The first commander of the unit was Infantry Commander Jos\u00e9 Torralba Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, a former retired Captain. The commissar was Antonio Romero Cebri\u00e1 who belonged to the Izquierda Republicana party. ===First phase=== Although it was placed under the 68th Division of the XX Army Corps the 221st Mixed Brigade could not be formed until November. Already in December 1937 the 221st Mixed Brigade was transferred to the 71st Division of the XXIII Army Corps of the Levantine Army (Ej\u00e9rcito de Levante) and moved to Albu\u00f1ol. In the new location the command of the 221st Mixed Brigade went to Militia Major Jes\u00fas Rubio Cer\u00f3n. By 11 June 1938, as the situation in the Eastern Front grew critical, the 221st Mixed Brigade was placed under the 49th Division of the XX Army Corps and went to the combat line by the Mijares (Millars) river. ===Unknown end of the brigade=== On 4 July 1938 the 221st Mixed Brigade was defending the area of La Vall d'Uix\u00f3 and Alfondeguilla, from where it slowly withdrew until reaching the protection afforded by the XYZ Line. Between the 7 and 10 November it took part in an unsuccessful attack against the rebel lines in Nudes and Castell\u00f3n. On 4 February 1939 it joined the 15th Division of the XX Army Corps, substituting the 75th Mixed Brigade in the road from Artana to the Aigualit Creek. The final fate of this mixed brigade is still a mystery. ==See also== *Desaparecidos del franquismo *Mixed Brigades *White Terror (Spain)\u00a7Death toll *XYZ Line ==References== ==External links== *Condecorados con la Medalla del Valor - Combatientes *Jumillanos desaparecidos y fallecidos en el a\u00f1o 1938 Category:Military units and formations established in 1937 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1939 Category:Mixed Brigades (Spain) ",
