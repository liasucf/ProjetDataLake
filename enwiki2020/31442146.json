    "text": "The Constitution of Samoa is the supreme law under which the Samoan Government operates. The 1960 Constitution, which formally came into force with independence from New Zealand in 1962, is based on the British pattern of parliamentary democracy, modified to take account of Samoan customs. In July 1997, the constitution was amended to change the country's name from Western Samoa to Samoa, or formally the Independent State of Samoa. ==References== ==External links== *Constitution of the Independent State of Western Samoa 1960, Pacific Islands Legal Information Institute.
