    "text": "In telecommunication, an isochronous signal is a signal in which the time interval separating any two significant instants is equal to the unit interval or a multiple of the unit interval. Variations in the time intervals are constrained within specified limits. \"Isochronous\" is a characteristic of one signal, while \"synchronous\" indicates a relationship between two or more signals. ==See also== * Synchronization in telecommunications * Synchronous network * Mesochronous network * Plesiochronous system * Asynchronous system ==References== Category:Telecommunications engineering Category:Synchronization ",
