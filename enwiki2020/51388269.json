Luginbill was one of the first settlers and founders of Berne, Indiana.\"Founders of Berne, Indiana\" http://hof.x10host.com/Founders.htmlhttp://hof.x10host.com/Lehmann.html ==Biography== Luginbill was born in a Swiss Settlement in Florimont (Blumenbergewald), Franche-Comt\u00e9 in 1818. In 1824, Luginbill and his family (who were Swiss Mennonites) fled from the Emmenthal to the Jura and to Alsace- Lorraine because of religious persecution. During the French occupation, Luginbill's family had retained his Swiss citizenship by concealing family records. Luginbill spoke both French and Swiss. Luginbill and his family emigrated to the United States and settled near Orrville, Ohio. Later, in September 1847, they moved to the area that would become Berne, where they were early settlers and where Peter was a founder. The community was named after the capital of Switzerland. As a city father, Luginbill often performed the functions of teacher, preacher and judge. He was also an early town trustee and treasurer.Liechty, Ed. The Roots of Bernie Indiana.
