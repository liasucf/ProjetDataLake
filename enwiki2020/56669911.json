(80 g) which occurs particularly in Anterior Asia, the borders of the ocelli are almost of the same colour as the ground and therefore scarcely visible, being much too distinct in our figure. The hindwing, moreover, has a slightly different shape in this form, which is perhaps on the way to develop into a local race.Seitz, A. ed.
