Fragments containing parts of this chapter were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls (3rd century BCE or later): * 1QIsaa: with all verses (1\u201314) * 1QIsa with all verses (1\u201314) * 4QIsad (4Q58): extant verses 1\u20133, 5\u20137 * 4QIsan (4Q67): extant verses 13\u201314 There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE.

Isaiah 58 is a part of the Consolations (Isaiah 40\u201366). {P}: open parashah. : {P} 58:1-14 {P} ==Verse 3== : Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not? :: wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? : Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, :: and exact all your labours. ==Verse 12== : And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: :: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; : and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, :: The restorer of paths to dwell in. In some versions, \"the old waste places\" is translated as \"ancient ruins\": John Skinner, in the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, suggests that \"the description of the ruins as 'ancient' suggests a period considerably later than the Exile (which only lasted half a century), although the argument is not one that can be rigorously pressed\".Skinner, J., Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Isaiah 58, accessed 10 September 2018 ==See also== * Jacob *Related Bible parts: Isaiah 61, Acts 15 ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== ===Jewish=== *Isaiah 58 Original Hebrew with Parallel English ===Christian=== *Isaiah 58 English Translation with Parallel Latin Vulgate 58 ",
