    "text": "Bloemhof is an agricultural town of about 2,000 inhabitants situated on the banks of the Vaal River in North West Province of South Africa. ==History== It was founded in August 1864 when diamonds were discovered in the area. The town was established on the farm owned by John Barclay, who survived the HMS Birkenhead shipwreck in 1852. The place became known as Bloemhof (flower court) because of the lovely gardens that were planted by Barclay's daughter. In June 1869, the South African Republic's Volksraad created a new district called Bloemhof named after the town itself. Currently Bloemhof has a variety of social milieus; it has a township called Boitumelong and former coloured residence called Coverdale. Salamat is also a small residence, formerly an Indian suburb, which is situated in this town. ==Education== * Bloemhof Combined School * Bloemhof primary School * Boitumelong primary Schoo * Gaopalelwe Senior Secondary School * Matlhajaneng Public Primary School * Thamagane Primary School * Thuto-Lore Secondary school * Tshenolo Primary School * Vaaloewer Combined School. == Tourist attractions == *Bloemhof Dam *Bloemhof Dam Nature Reserve *Sandveld Nature Reserve *SA Lombard Nature Reserve ==References== Category:1864 in South Africa Category:Populated places founded by Afrikaners Category:Populated places in the Lekwa-Teemane Local Municipality Category:Populated places established in 1864 ",
