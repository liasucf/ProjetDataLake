    "text": "Timecop is a 1994 American science fiction action film directed by Peter Hyams and co-written by Mike Richardson and Mark Verheiden. Richardson also served as executive producer. The film is based on Timecop, a story created by Richardson, written by Verheiden, and drawn by Ron Randall, which appeared in the anthology comic Dark Horse Comics, published by Dark Horse Comics. The film stars Jean-Claude Van Damme as Max Walker, a police officer in 1994 and later a U.S. federal agent in 2004, when time travel has been made possible. It also stars Ron Silver as a corrupt politician and Mia Sara as Melissa Walker, the agent's wife. The story follows Walker's life as he fights time- travel crime and investigates the politician's plans. Timecop remains Van Damme's highest-grossing film as a lead actor (his second to break the $100 million barrier worldwide), becoming a cult classic with fans. Although met with mixed reviews, it is generally regarded by critics as one of Van Damme's better films. ==Plot== By 1994, time travel has been developed and is used for illicit purposes. The Time Enforcement Commission (TEC) is established to police the use of time travel, with Senator Aaron McComb overseeing operations and financing. Police officer Max Walker is offered a position with the TEC but debates whether to accept it. Leaving home one night to work late, he and his wife Melissa are attacked by unknown assailants. Max witnesses the house explode, killing Melissa inside. Ten years later, Walker is a veteran of the TEC working under Commissioner Eugene Matuzak, who sends him back to October 1929 to prevent his former partner, Lyle Atwood, from using knowledge of the future to financially benefit from the U.S. stock market crash. When confronted, Atwood admits to working for Senator McComb, who needs funds for his upcoming presidential campaign. Fearing McComb will erase him from history, Atwood jumps to his death, but Walker catches him mid-leap and returns them both to 2004. Refusing to testify, Atwood is sentenced to execution and is returned to 1929 where he completes his fatal fall. Under investigation from Internal Affairs, Walker is assigned a new partner, TEC rookie Sarah Fielding, and together they are sent back to 1994 to investigate McComb. They witness a meeting between 1994 McComb and his business partner Jack Parker, where McComb wishes to withdraw over a disagreement about a new computer chip. They are interrupted by the 2004 McComb, who advises his younger self the chip will become highly profitable. The older McComb specifically warns his younger self they must not touch because the same matter cannot occupy the same space, then kills Parker. Fielding turns on Walker, revealing she works for McComb. After a shootout with McComb's henchmen, Fielding is wounded and Walker escapes back to 2004. Walker finds the future has been altered. McComb is now the sole owner of the computer company and is a presidential front runner while the TEC is being shut down due to budget cuts. Walker appeals to Matuzak, who has no knowledge the changes in history. Curious how McComb is able to travel through time, they realize the original prototype machine was never dismantled. Realizing Walker may be right, Matuzak sends him back to the past to restore history, sacrificing himself in the process as he is shot by the TEC's security who work for McComb. Back in 1994, Walker finds Fielding in the hospital. She agrees to testify against McComb, but is murdered in her room shortly thereafter. While at the hospital, Walker finds a record of a recent visit by his wife Melissa, discovering she was pregnant. Realizing she will be killed later that night, he finds her and reveals himself to be from the future. She agrees to make sure the 1994 Walker stays home that night. That night, the 1994 Walker is attacked just as before, the assailants being in McComb's employ, but is unknowingly aided by his older self who has been lying in wait. With the assailants defeated, the 2004 McComb steps in and takes Melissa hostage, confronting the older Walker with the bomb that will blow up the house. McComb knows he will now also die in the ensuing explosion, but is satisfied his younger self will survive and become president with Walker gone. However, Walker reveals he lured the 1994 McComb to the house, who enters the room. Walker pushes the two McCombs together and they merge into a writhing, screaming mass before disappearing from existence forever. 2004 Walker escapes with Melissa before the bomb explodes and leave her beside his unconscious younger self before returning to the future. Back in 2004, the timeline has changed for the better. McComb mysteriously vanished in 1994, allowing the TEC to remain active without his interference. Matuzak and Fielding are alive, although Fielding does not recognize Walker now. Walker returns home to find Melissa alive and waiting for him with their young son. ==Cast== * Jean-Claude Van Damme as Max Walker * Mia Sara as Melissa Walker * Ron Silver as Sen.

Richardson developed the story, while the comic was written by Mark Verheiden and drawn by Ron Randall. The comic told a story of Max Walker, a Time Enforcement Commission agent whose wife is implied to be dead (though the circumstances of this are unknown). Max pursues an illegal time traveler robbing a South African diamond mine in the 1930s. After capturing the robber and returning to present time, Walker realizes the timeline has been damaged because the criminal's robotic bodyguard remained in the past and was still active. Walker returns to the 1930s and defeats the robot with the help of a local whom he rewards with a diamond. Returning home, the timeline is largely restored but readers see the local became a political leader who helped end Apartheid. Richardson and Verheiden then teamed up to write the screenplay for the movie adaptation. ==Production== ==Music== The musical score of Timecop was composed by Mark Isham and conducted by Ken Kugler. ===Soundtrack=== Track listing # \"Time Cop\" \u2013 2:20 # \"Melissa\" \u2013 2:41 # \"Blow Up\" \u2013 2:12 # \"Lasers and Tasers\" \u2013 4:23 # \"Polaroid\" \u2013 6:10 # \"Rooftop\" \u2013 6:16 # \"Hambone\" \u2013 5:13 # \"C4\" \u2013 2:37 # \"Rescue and Return\" \u2013 3:22 ==Release== ===Home media=== Timecop was first released on LaserDisc on February 28, 1995,https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/06204/42242/Timecop and later released on DVD in 1998.
