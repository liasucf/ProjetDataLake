    "text": "Alessio Dionisi (born 1 April 1980) is a former Italian footballer who played as a defender, currently in charge as head coach of Serie B club Empoli. ==Club career== A centre back with free kick abilities, Dionisi spent most of his career at Serie C2 and Serie D level, with his personal highlight being at Tritium, a club he captained and with whom he won promotion to Lega Pro Prima Divisione and also played in the Italian third tier for a season. ==Coaching career== Dionisi retired from active footballing in 2014, immediately being named head coach of Serie D club Olginatese, his final club as a player. He then managed again at Serie D level with Borgosesia from 2015 to 2017, and Fiorenzuola in the 2017\u201318 season. He was then named head coach of Serie D club Imolese in 2018, guiding the club to second place in the league. After the club was admitted to Serie C to fill a vacancy, he was confirmed at Imolese, and successfully guided the small club from Emilia-Romagna to a historic third place in the league (the greatest result in the club's history) and a place in the promotion playoffs, where his club was defeated by Piacenza in the semi-finals. His impressive results with Imolese won him the attentions of Venezia, who appointed him as head coach on 3 July 2019. With Venezia readmitted to Serie B in place of Palermo, he guided the Venetians to keep their place in the Italian second division. On 19 August 2020, he was announced as the new head coach of Serie B club Empoli. ==References== Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Italian footballers Category:People from the Province of Siena Category:Association football central defenders Category:Italian football managers Category:Venezia F.C. managers Category:Varese Calcio players Category:Tritium Calcio 1908 players Category:A.S.D.
