Kaspar Hauser All that long time there was the place I was, All that long same, the dark and constant same. I came to being and it bit my eyes. I want to be a rider like my father. A soldier was my father was a horseman. I want to be a rider and I want Out of that same he carried me upstairs, Out of that dark and then I stood to lean; The soft ground stood and hit me where I fell. When it was hunger time they put soft life Into my mouth. It moved. The warm flesh tore Under my teeth. This could be me I'm eating. I spat and called: I loved that time, those horses, The brittle bread, the water, the soft dark, The stiff floor always there, the always steady Till I was carried to the bumpy world: The air threw needles at my eyes. I fell. Where were my walls, my horse to push, and where \u2013 I want my floor my bread my dark my always \u2013 I want the same the only same the only \u2013 I want to be a rider like my father ==Readings== Readings by Laurence Lerner of several of his poems appear on YouTube ==See also== *List of South Africans ==References== ==External links== * \"Laurence Lerner\" (Fellows Remembered), The Royal Society of Literature Category:1925 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Academics of Queen's University Belfast Category:British poets Category:British Jews Category:British Quakers Category:Jewish poets Category:South African poets Category:South African Jews Category:Lithuanian Jews Category:Alumni of Pembroke College, Cambridge Category:University of Cape Town alumni Category:Fellows of the Royal Society of Literature Category:South African literary critics Category:British male poets ",
