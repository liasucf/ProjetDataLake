    "text": "Lendonwood Gardens are non-profit botanical gardens in Grove, Oklahoma. The gardens were founded in 1995 by Dr. Leonard Miller, a retired dentist, and consist of a blend of American and Japanese gardening techniques. Major plantings took about 18 months to complete. In 1997 the Gardens became a non- profit organization and are now part of the Oklahoma Botanical Garden system. To be designated a botanical garden, a site must contain labeled plants, be open to the public, and contain at least 225 species. Grassy pathways meander through more than 1,400 different types of plants, including one of the largest collections of Chamaecyparis (false cypress) in the United States, the largest collection of rhododendrons in the Southwest, 500 varieties of daylilies, 25 varieties of dogwoods, more than 50 bonsai, 75 varieties of Japanese maples, and 70 varieties of hostas, as well as a stream consisting of nine pools of water, and a koi pond. Plants in the American Backyard Xeriscape Garden thrive without additional watering and include annuals such as zinnias and marigolds. ==External links== *Lendonwood Gardens == See also == * List of botanical gardens in the United States Category:Botanical gardens in Oklahoma Category:Protected areas of Delaware County, Oklahoma Category:1995 establishments in Oklahoma ",
