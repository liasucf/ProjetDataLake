    "text": "Arnolt Bronnen (19 August 1895 \u2013 12 October 1959) was an Austrian playwright and director. ==Life and career== Bronnen was born in Vienna, Austria. The son of the Austrian-Jewish writer Ferdinand Bronner and his Christian wife Martha Bronner.The Menorah Journal 19 (1930) 170. Bronnen's most famous play is the Expressionist drama Parricide (Vatermord, 1922); its premi\u00e8re production is notable, among other things, for being that from which Bronnen's friend, the young Bertolt Brecht in an early stage of his directing career, withdrew, after being taken to hospital with malnutrition and the actors of the cast, led by Heinrich George, walked out on him.Willett and Manheim (1970, viii) and Thomson (1994, 26). According to The Cambridge Guide to Theatre, the \"erotic, anti-bourgeois, black expressionism\" of the play \"caused a sensation\" when it was eventually performed. Bronnen also wrote Birth of Youth (Geburt der Jugend, 1922) and Die Excesse (1923).Banham (1998, 132). After having collaborated on film treatments and various theatrical projects together, in 1923 Bronnen and Brecht co-directed a condensed version of Pastor Ephraim Magnus (a nihilistic, Expressionist play, according to The Cambridge Guide, \"stuffed with perversities and sado-masochistic motifs\") by Hans Henny Jahnn.Banham (1998, 553), Sacks (1994, xviii), and Willett and Manheim (1970, viii). Later in his life he wrote reportage plays. Bronnen signed the Gel\u00f6bnis treuester Gefolgschaft, a \"vow of most faithful allegiance\" to Adolf Hitler in 1933,88 \"writers\", from Letters of Heinrich and Thomas Mann, 1900-1949, Weimar and Now: German Cultural Criticism 12, University of California Press 1998, , pp. 367-68. but after the Second World War, he became a communist.
