The city was ruled by the Pech family. After the fall of Yucat\u00e1n's central government in Mayapan in the 1440s, the Pech ruled a regional kingdom called Cehpech with its capital in Motul. With the Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n, Conquistador Francisco de Montejo made Motul a Spanish colonial town. Motul has a Spanish colonial era Franciscan monastery with interesting frescos. Motul was granted the status of a city on 22 February 1872. Motul was the birthplace of Felipe Carrillo Puerto, a former Governor of Yucat\u00e1n who was assassinated in 1924. In his honor, the formal name of the city of Motul was changed to Motul de Carrillo Puerto. Motul is known as the place of origin of the popular dish huevos motule\u00f1os (eggs Motul style). ==References== *Link to tables of population data from Census of 2005 INEGI: Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica, Geograf\u00eda e Inform\u00e1tica *Yucat\u00e1n Enciclopedia de los Municipios de M\u00e9xico ==External links== * Category:Populated places in Yucat\u00e1n Category:Populated places established in the 11th century Category:11th- century establishments in Mexico ",
