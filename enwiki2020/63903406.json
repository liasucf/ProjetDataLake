It is located within the first legislative district of Quezon City. == History == On July 17, 1948, president Elpidio Quirino signed Republic Act No. 333, designating Quezon City as the new capital of the Philippines. The following year, the 1949 Master Plan for Quezon City was published to serve as the foremost guideline in transforming the city as a \u201ca real Filipino metropolis\u201d and a \u201cshowplace of the nation.\u201d Although aspects of the 1949 Master Plan were not fully implemented, a portion of the West Triangle area of the Diliman Quadrangle was purchased as a residential zone. The entire Diliman Quadrangle was initially zoned as an area exclusively for park facilities and recreational activities. This triangular-shaped residential zone was purchased by the Philippine American Life Insurance Company (Philam Life). The purchase of this residential zone involved a cogon\u2010covered tract of land, bounded by West Avenues and Highway 54 (now known as EDSA). Then headed by an American philanthropist named Earl Carroll, the Philippine Life developed the area into a gated residential subdivision meant to cater for \"moderate\u2010income executives and their families\". The area was patterned after American suburbia in terms of architecture and urban design. The first phase of development and launching of this residential project was set on May 15, 1955. This residential enclave was to be called, \u201cPhilam Homes.\u201d Although the initial lots were offered to Philam Life employees, non- employees were later offered to purchase lots within community. The urban development and master plan of Philam Homes was designed by the Harvard educated architect Angel Nakpil. The various house models were designed by renown Filipino architect Carlos Arguelles. The residential master plan for Philam Homes offered an initial 605 residential lots with areas between . At the center of the residential area was a amenities center, which includes a football field, a basketball court, a tennis ball court, a swimming pool, and a clubhouse for residents. A large park, named Earl Carroll Park, is the main amenity of the community. A community chapel was also built in this center, which was later instated as a parish church on June 2, 1957. This parish is now known as the Santa Rita de Cascia Parish Church.A bust of Earl Carroll as a memorial in the civic park named after himThe center also had its own grocery in 1955, known as Jopson\u2019s Supermarket. This grocery was owned by the family of renown labor rights activist and former resident, Edgar Jopson. Later on, Jopson\u2019s Supermarket in Philam was to be sold off in 1958 and renamed as Nati\u2019s Nook. A branch of Puregold Minimart now stands on the location where Jopson\u2019s Supermarket used to stand. By 1976, Philam Homes was converted as a barangay, a small administrative division. Philam Homes as a barangay was designated as \"Barangay Philam\" and a barangay hall with a space allocated for a fire truck and emergency equipment was erected within the subdivision grounds. == Government == Earl Carroll Civic Park as seen from a wide road in Philam Homes As a barangay, Philam is governed by an elected barangay captain. Since 2019, the elected barangay captain of Philam Homes is Simplicio Hermogenes. Alongside the barangay government, the Philam Homeowners Association help in the security and maintenance of the community and all of its amenities. Being a gated community, entry into the barangay and other surveillance features is maintained by private security personnel managed by the Philam Homeowners Association. The barangay government and the homeowners association are based in the Clubhouse Complex along Baguio Road, Philam Homes, Quezon City. == Issues == A concern for many residents of the barangay is the growing gentrification and deteriorating traffic situation surrounding Philam. The worsening pollution and road congestion is affecting quality of life of the barangay. Mostly affected are elderly residents who have lived in Philam since its establishment in 1955. alt= Another concern for many residents in 2019 was the pruning done to the trees in Earl Carroll Civic Park. Many residents expressed concern on the number of trees pruned in the park. The barangay government stated that the pruning was necessary as a \u201cprecaution [against] potential damage to [property]\u201d in the area. Many of the trees remain standing and healthy. == References == Category:Barangays of Metro Manila Category:Quezon City ",
