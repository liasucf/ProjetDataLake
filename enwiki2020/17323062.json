    "text": "The 79th Fighter Squadron is part of the 20th Fighter Wing at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina. It operates the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft conducting air superiority missions. The squadron is one of the oldest in the United States Air Force, its origins dating to 22 February 1918, being organized at Rich Field, Waco Texas, as a pilot training Squadron during World War I. The squadron saw combat during World War II, and became part of the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) during the Cold War. ==History== ===World War I=== The 79th Fighter Squadron traces its history back to February 1918, when it was first organized as the 79th Aero Squadron. ===Inter-war years=== The unit inactivated from November 1918 until April 1933, when it became the 79th Pursuit Squadron, flying the Boeing P-12 at Barksdale Field, Louisiana From 1940 to 1942, the squadron trained combat pilots and flew the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk from bases on the east coast. ===World War II=== Lockheed P-38J Lightning of the 79th Fighter Squadron. In 1943, the 79th converted to the Lockheed P-38 Lightning, flying out of Northamptonshire, England, performing duty as bomber escorts and conducting fighter sweeps over Germany. The 79th remained at English bases throughout the war, supporting both the Normandy invasion and the allied drive into Germany. The squadron returned to the states and was inactivated on 19 October 1945. ===Post-war reactivation=== The 79th was again brought to active service on 29 July 1946, at Biggs Field, Texas. The unit moved to Shaw Field, South Carolina, in October 1946. The squadron moved again to Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, in November 1951. ===NATO support=== In June 1952, the squadron began to train to support NATO ground forces in conventional and nuclear roles arriving at RAF Woodbridge, England 1 October 1952 flying first the F-84G Thunderjet and then in 1955 the swept wing F-84F Thunderstreak. Redesignated as the 79th Tactical Fighter Squadron the unit transitioned onto the North American F-100 Super Sabre in 1957 and shared RAF Woodbridge with the 78th Tactical Fighter Squadron of the 81st Tactical Fighter Wing and operated locally under the command of the 81st Wing which was based at nearby RAF Bentwaters. The next change came in 1970, when the squadron transitioned to the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark and moved to RAF Upper Heyford, England. The 79th received the Commander in Chief's Trophy in 1981, as the best tactical fighter squadron in U.S. Air Forces in Europe. ===Desert Storm=== From 1990 to 1991, the 79th deployed to Southwest Asia to support Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. On 30 June 1993 the squadron inactivated. ===Return to the United States=== 79th Fighter Squadron F-16C over ColoradoAircraft is General Dynamics F-16C Block 50P serial 92-3923, taken on 11 August 2001. On 1 January 1994, it was reactivated at Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina, transitioning to the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and assuming the mission of suppression of enemy air defenses. Since that time, the 79th has continuously supported Operations Northern and Southern Watch in Southwest Asia. In December 1998, the 79th took an active part in Operation Desert Fox in conjunction with Operation Southern Watch demands. The squadron flew more than 1,000 successful combat sorties with these dual operational requirements. In January 1999, the 79th Fighter Squadron was awarded the South Carolina Air Force Association's Outstanding Air Force Unit of the Year award. Also in 1999, the squadron was honored with Air Combat Command's Maintenance Effectiveness Award. In June 1999, the 79th deployed F-16CJs in support of Operation Allied Force to a bare base in Southwest Asia. ====2013 Sequestration==== Air Combat Command officials announced a stand down and reallocation of flying hours for the rest of the fiscal year 2013 due to mandatory budget cuts. The across-the board spending cuts, called sequestration, took effect 1 March when Congress failed to agree on a deficit- reduction plan. Squadrons either stood down on a rotating basis or kept combat ready or at a reduced readiness level called \"basic mission capable\" for part or all of the remaining months in fiscal 2013. This affected the 79th Fighter Squadron with a reduction of its flying hours, placing it into a basic mission capable status from 5 April \u2013 30 July, then returning it to combat mission ready through September 2013. ==Lineage== ; Squadron B, Taliaferro Field, Texas * Organized as 79th Aero Squadron on 22 February 1918This squadron is not related to the 79th Aero Squadron organized on 15 August 1917 at Kelly Field, Texas and redesignated 491st Aero Squadron on 1 February 1918. : Redesignated Squadron B, Taliaferro Field, Texas on 23 July 1918 : Demobilized on 15 November 1918 ; 79th Fighter Squadron * Constituted as the 79th Observation Squadron on 18 October 1927 : Redesignated 79th Pursuit Squadron on 8 May 1929 : Organized as a Regular Army Inactive unit with reserve personnel on 7 September 1932Clay, p. 1428Regular Army Inactive units were units that were constituted in the regular army.
