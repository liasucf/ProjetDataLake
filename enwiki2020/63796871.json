    "text": "Jes\u00fas Mar\u00eda S\u00e1enz \"Josu\" Ortuondo (born 6 November 1951) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a right winger, and a manager. ==Playing career== Born in Ondarroa, Biscay, Basque Country, Ortuondo was an Athletic Bilbao youth graduate. On 14 September 1969, before even having appeared for the reserves, he made his first team \u2013 and La Liga \u2013 debut, coming on as a second- half substitute for Jos\u00e9 Argoitia in a 2\u20130 home win against RCD Mallorca. Ortuondo scored his first goal in the main category of Spanish football on 5 October 1969, netting his team's second in a 2\u20133 away loss against FC Barcelona. He would move back to the B-side in the second level for the remainder of the season, which ended in relegation. After starting the 1970\u201371 campaign with seven goals in only ten appearances for the B's, Ortuondo was promoted to the main squad in November 1970. Despite being a part of the main squad, he never established as a starter, and left the club in 1973 for CD Logro\u00f1\u00e9s in Tercera Divisi\u00f3n. In 1974, Ortuondo moved to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n side Real Oviedo, appearing rarely in the club's promotion campaign. He appeared regularly afterwards, as the club suffered two relegations and achieved one promotion in 1979; in that season, he scored a career-best 12 goals. In 1980, Ortuondo moved abroad and joined Atl\u00e9tico Espa\u00f1ol FC in Mexico. In 1982, after the club's dissolution, he returned to his home country and subsequently represented CF Lorca Deportiva and C\u00f3rdoba CF in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B, retiring with the latter in 1984 at the age of 33. ==Coaching career== Immediately after retiring Ortuondo took up coaching, taking over last club C\u00f3rdoba which was recently relegated to the fourth division. After achieving promotion with the side, he left in 1986 and was subsequently in charge of CP Almer\u00eda and Linares CF also in the third level. Ortuondo was named manager of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid's reserves ahead of the 1989\u201390 season, in the second division. He was dismissed when the club's relegation was confirmed, and spent a year without a club before taking over CF Extremadura in the third tier. Promoted to the second division in 1994, Ortuondo left Extremadura for CD Badajoz, but was dismissed in May of the following year. He subsequently returned to the Azulgranas, achieving promotion to the top tier but being immediately relegated afterwards. On 3 July 1998, Ortuondo was appointed in charge of Rayo Vallecano in the second division. He was relieved from his duties the following 9 March, being replaced by M\u00e1ximo Hern\u00e1ndez, but was reinstated as manager six days later. Ortuondo left Rayo as the club appointed Juande Ramos in charge, remaining unemployed until 11 January 1999, when he was named manager of UD Salamanca in the top tier. In July, he returned to Extremadura for a third spell, with the club in division two. Ortuondo was relieved from his duties on 7 April 2002, and returned to C\u00f3rdoba in June. Dismissed the following 20 January, he was appointed in charge of Algeciras CF on 28 November, but was sacked from the latter club in March 2004. In June 2005, Ortuondo started his fourth period at Extremadura, now in division three. He resigned in January 2007 due to the club's severe financial crisis. In March of the following year, he took the reins of CF Palencia, severely threatened with relegation, but could not avoid the drop. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Spanish footballers Category:Basque footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:Tercera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Athletic Bilbao footballers Category:Bilbao Athletic footballers Category:CD Logro\u00f1\u00e9s footballers Category:Real Oviedo players Category:C\u00f3rdoba CF players Category:Spanish football managers Category:La Liga managers Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n managers Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B managers Category:C\u00f3rdoba CF managers Category:CP Almer\u00eda managers Category:Atl\u00e9tico Madrid B managers Category:Rayo Vallecano managers Category:CF Extremadura managers Category:Algeciras CF managers ",
