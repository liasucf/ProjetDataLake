The mostly uninhabited southern half of the province is covered by the Grand Erg Oriental, a vast region of uninterrupted sand dunes. The northern half of the province is a mixture of sandy desert with scarce vegetation, scattered oases, and salt lakes. The most notable oases are the Oued Souf region, upon which the capital El Oued and neighbouring towns are built, as well as oases located near the towns of El M'Ghair and Djamaa, both of which support extensive palm plantations. Chott Melrhir, a large endorheic salt lake, lies in the north- central part of the province, while Chott Felrhir is a smaller salt lake to its southwest, near El M'Ghair. These salt lakes, and the surrounding areas, lie as much as below sea level; nearby towns and villages including Hamraia, M\u00e9guibra, Dendouga and A\u00efn Cheikh are also below sea level. ===Climate=== El Oued Province experiences a hot desert climate.
