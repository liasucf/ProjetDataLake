    "text": "Head-office of Gasunie in Groningen Anton (Ton) Alberts (6 July 1927 \u2013 16 August 1999) was a Dutch architect best known for the ING Bank (1982) in the Bijlmer district of Amsterdam and the Gas Corporation headquarters in Groningen. Alberts was involved with Situationist International before being expelled in 1960. He had been involved with fellow Situationists Constant and Har Oudejans in setting up a labyrinth in the Stedelijk Museum of Amsterdam, but the project fell apart amidst acrimony. Officially he was expelled for designing churches, although Asger Jorn relates the expulsion more to the \"Amsterdam affair\". In 1963 he founded the firm Alberts and Van Huut with Max van Huut, guided by the principles of organic architecture. His work also has its roots in the anthroposophical architecture of Rudolf Steiner.Pearson, David, New Organic Architecture, Univ. of California Press: 2001. Alberts offered to work for free on the Peace Parks in Bosnia and Herzegovina but was only able to create sketches before he died, aged 72, in Amsterdam. Still, by Albert's sketches the Peace Flame House, a community centre, was built in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a gift by Peace Flame Foundation Netherlands to this after-war community.
