    "text": "Winstanley is a 1975 British black-and-white film about social reformer and writer Gerrard Winstanley. It was made by Kevin Brownlow and Andrew Mollo (creators of It Happened Here) and based on the 1961 David Caute novel Comrade Jacob. ==Plot== The film details the story of the 17th-century social reformer and writer Gerrard Winstanley, who, along with a small band of followers known as the Diggers, tried to establish a self-sufficient farming community on common land at St George's Hill (\"Diggers' Hill\") near Cobham, Surrey. The community was one of the world's first small-scale experiments in socialism or communism, and its ideas were copied elsewhere in England during the time of the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell, but it was quickly suppressed, and in the end left only a legacy of ideas to inspire later generations of socialist theorists. ==Cast== * Miles Halliwell \u2013 Gerard Winstanley * Terry Higgins \u2013 Tom Haydon * Jerome Willis \u2013 Lord General Fairfax * Phil Oliver \u2013 Will Everard * David Bramley \u2013 Parson Platt * Alison Halliwell \u2013 Mrs. Platt * Dawson France \u2013 Captain Gladman * Bill Petch \u2013 Henry Bickerstaffe * Barry Shaw \u2013 Colonel Rich * Sid Rawle \u2013 Ranter * George Hawkins \u2013 John Coulton * Stanley Reed \u2013 Recorder * Philip Stearns \u2013 Francis Drake * Flora Skrine \u2013 Mrs. Drake ==Filming== Great efforts were made to produce a film of high historical accuracy. Armour used was real armour from the 1640s, borrowed from the Tower of London. Real-life activist Sid Rawle played a Ranter (i.e. a member of one or other of several English Revolution-period anarchist-type groups). The film was reissued on DVD and Blu-ray in 2009 by the British Film Institute (BFI), which had funded the original project. == References == ==External links== * *Dennis Schwartz review of 'Winstanley' *Book 'Winstanley: Warts and All' by Kevin Brownlow (about the making of the film) Category:1975 films Category:1975 drama films Category:British films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on British novels Category:English Civil War films Category:British drama films ",
