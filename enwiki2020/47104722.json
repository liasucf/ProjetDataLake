    "text": "Druze in Jordan refers to adherents of the Druze faith, an ethnoreligious esoteric group originating from the Near East who self identify as unitarians (Muwahhideen). Druze faith is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion, and Druze do not identify as Muslims. The Jordanian Druze people are believed to constitute about 0.5% of the total population of Jordan, which is around 32,000. The Druze, who refer to themselves as al-Muwahhideen, or \"believers in one God,\" are concentrated in the rural, mountainous areas west and north of Amman. ==History== The Druze faith is a monotheistic Abrahamic religion that does not follow the Five Pillars of Islam, \"fasting during the month of Ramadan and making a pilgrimage to Mecca. Thus, they are not regarded by Muslims as Islamic\". The Druze beliefs incorporate elements of Ismailism, Gnosticism, Neoplatonism and other philosophies. The Druze call themselves Ahl al-Tawhid \"People of Unitarianism or Monotheism\" or al-Muwa\u1e25\u1e25id\u016bn.\" The Druze follow a life style of isolation where no conversion is allowed, neither out of, or into, the religion. When Druze live among people of other religions, they try to blend in, in order to protect their religion and their own safety. They can pray as Muslims, or as Christians, depending on where they are. This system is apparently changing in modern times, where more security has allowed Druze to be more open about their religious belonging.\" Some of Arabians from the Tanukh inaugurated the Druze community in Jordan when most of them accepted and adopted the new message that was being preached in the 11th century, due to their leaderships close ties with then Fatimid ruler Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah. ==Demographics== The Druze, who refer to themselves as al- Muwahhideen, or \"believers in one God,\" are concentrated in the rural, mountainous areas north and west of Amman. The Jordanian Druze are estimated to constitute 0.5% of Jordan's population of approximately 6.5 million, which means they amount to 32,000. ==Notable people== * Rashid Tali\u2019a ==See also== * Jabal al-Druze * Druze * Islam in Jordan * Religion in Jordan * Azraq, Jordan * Jabal Druze State * ==References== Category:Jordanian people by religion Category:Druze communities in Jordan ",
