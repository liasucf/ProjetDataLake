    "text": "Albert \"Al\" Anderson (born October 11, 1950)Larkin, Colin (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, , p.11 is an American-born songwriter and guitarist. Anderson grew up in Montclair, New Jersey and attended Montclair High School where he learned to play the trombone, eventually picking up guitar & bass guitar. He later attended the Berklee College of Music contemporaneously with Pat Metheny and Al Di Meola after working with an early version of Aerosmith in the Boston music scene. He joined The Centurions, which brought him to the attention of Chris Wood of Traffic, who invited him to play on the band's next album. The Traffic album involvement never materialized, but led to Anderson becoming employed by Traffic's record label Island Records, leading to him being asked to play lead guitar on Bob Marley & The Wailers' Natty Dread sessions. Anderson played lead guitar on \"Crazy Baldhead\" and on the Live! album, remaining with the band until 1976, when he joined Word, Sound and Power, backing Peter Tosh on the albums Legalize It and Equal Rights. He returned to Marley's band and played on the Survival and Uprising albums. After Marley's death, Anderson continued to tour with The Wailers Band. Anderson went on to record with Ben Harper (Diamonds On the Inside (2003)) and Lauryn Hill on her multi-Grammy winning debut The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998). He also produced and performed on an album for actor Steven Seagal (Songs from the Crystal Cave (2005)). In 2008 he formed the band The Original Wailers with Junior Marvin. ==Tours with Bob Marley & The Wailers== * Jun\u2013Jul 1975: Natty Dread Tour (U.S., Canada, England) * May\u2013Aug 1978: Kaya Tour (U.S., Canada, England, France, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Netherlands, Belgium) * Apr\u2013May 1979: Babylon by Bus Tour (Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Hawaii) * Oct\u2013Dec 1979: Survival Tour (U.S., Canada, Trinidad & Tobago, Bahamas) * May\u2013Sep 1980: Uprising Tour (Switzerland, Germany, France, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Ireland, England, Scotland, Wales, U.S.) ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:American reggae guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American rock guitarists Category:Montclair High School (New Jersey) alumni Category:Musicians from New York (state) Category:People from Montclair, New Jersey Category:The Wailers members Category:Berklee College of Music alumni Category:Guitarists from New York (state) Category:20th-century American guitarists ",
