    "text": "The Olive Oil Commission of California (OOCC) was founded in 2014 by California olive oil farmers. It is an entity of the State of California which was established as a result of a bill introduced by Lois Wolk. The primary goal is to improve the sales of olive oil grown in California. == Grades and Standards == The OOCC has developed its own grading and standards for olive oils from California out of its belief that the standards set by the International Olive Council were not applicable to olive oils from California. The organization collects samples of olive oils from member producers and has them tested in a laboratory in Australia for sensory and chemical analysis. The standards have been criticized by the North American Olive Oil Association. The NAOOA claims that commission's standards fail to address product adulteration and \"do not ensure authenticity or quality of the olive oil\". == Board Members == * Adam Englehardt, Kbar Farming * Larry Maben, Maben Family LLC * John Williams, Cal Ag Properties LLC * Deborah Rogers, McEvoy of Marin LLC * Jeff Colombini, Lodi Farming * Richard Marchini, Marchini Ag * Liz Tagami, Lucero Olive Oil * Jim Lipman, California Olive Ranch * Jim Etters, Seka Hills Olive Mill * Brady Whitlow, Corto Olive LP * Bruce Golino, Santa Cruz Olive Tree Nursery == Advisory Committee == * Philip Asquith, Ojai Olive Oil Company \u2013 Ojai, CA * Lillian Dickson, Dickson Napa Ranch \u2013 Napa, CA * Eric Halverson, Halverson Ranch \u2013 Wallace, CA * Albert Katz, KATZ \u2013 Suisun Valley, CA * Jan de Luz, Leplus, Inc. \u2013 Carmel Valley, CA * Bob Roos, Homestead Olive Ranch \u2013 Templeton, CA * Ronald Sbragia, Collina di Mela \u2013 Placerville, CA == References == == External links == * Category:Government of California Category:Olive oil Category:Agriculture in California ",
