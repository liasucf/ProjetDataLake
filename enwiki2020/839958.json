She earned her Master of Arts degree from the School of Visual Communication within the Scripps College of Communication at Ohio University. ==Career beginnings== She began her career in 1986 as a staff photographer with the El Paso Herald-Post, a position which she occupied until 1988. She then moved to the San Francisco Examiner for two years, before spending another two years as a freelance photographer in Mexico City, working with newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times, Detroit Free Press, and Business Week. In 1992, Cole returned to being a staff photographer, working for The Sacramento Bee, before moving to the Times in 1994. ==Recognitions== In 1994, the same year she moved to the Times, she was recognized in their editorial awards for her pictures of the crisis in Haiti. The following year, she was recognized again, this time for her work in Russia. In 1997, she gained attention for her photographs of dying bank robber Emil Matasareanu, who had been shot after a nationally televised shootout with police. Her evidence was used in the wrongful death lawsuit filed by his family. Her pictures also helped the Times win a Pulitzer Prize for its coverage of the event. Later that year, she was named Journalist of the Year by the Times Mirror Corporation. In 2002, she received the National Press Photographers Association Newspaper Photographer of the Year award for the first time. In mid-2003, Cole went to Liberia, as rebels surrounded the capital, Monrovia, demanding the resignation of President Charles Taylor. This trip was to earn her the 2004 Pulitzer Prize, \"for her cohesive, behind-the-scenes look at the effects of civil war in Liberia, with special attention to innocent citizens caught in the conflict.\" She won the 2003 George Polk Award for photojournalism. In 2004, Cole was named both NPPA Newspaper Photographer of the Year for a second time, for her work in both Liberia and Iraq, and the Pictures of the Year International Newspaper Photographer by the University of Missouri's Missouri School of Journalism. This made her the first person ever to win all three of America's top photojournalism awards in the same year. During the year, she also spent time in Haiti, witnessing the fall of the regime of Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Cole has also received the Robert Capa Gold Medal from the Overseas Press Club in both 2003 and 2004, and won two World Press Photo awards in 2004. In 2007, she won the NPPA Newspaper Photographer of the Year. ==Arrest== In April 2000, Cole was arrested on felony charges for \"throwing deadly missiles\" at police during protests in Miami's \"Little Havana\" during the Eli\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez affair.

In 2002, Cole covered the beginnings of the prominent siege of Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity, which had been occupied by Palestinian militants. Then, on May 2, she made a last-minute decision to join a group of peace activists who entered the building in solidarity with the Palestinians. Over the nine days that followed, she doubled as a news reporter for the Times, filing several stories. She was the only photojournalist in the building itself. The pictures she took earned her a nomination for the 2003 Pulitzer Prize. ==References== ==External links== *Cole's Pulitzer Prize-winning photo series, at pulitzer.org *\"Haiti: Coping with the aftermath\", The Los Angeles Times, 2010 Category:American photojournalists Category:American women photographers Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Artists from Los Angeles Category:Photographers from California Category:George Polk Award recipients Category:Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography winners Category:Moody College of Communication alumni Category:Los Angeles Times people Category:20th- century American photographers Category:21st-century American photographers Category:20th-century American women artists Category:21st-century American women artists Category:20th-century women photographers Category:21st-century women photographers ",
