    "text": "Trove is a voxel-based sandbox game developed and published by Trion Worlds. The game was released for Microsoft Windows and macOS in July 2015, and for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in March 2017. ==Development== Trove was first revealed on November 13, 2013 with players able to sign up to play the Alpha version of the game. Access to a closed Beta test was launched on September 25, 2014, a free week of Trove was out a month later on October 24\u201326, 2014. The game went in Open Beta on November 4, 2014. The console versions of the game went in open beta on December 13, 2016. Trove launched its Closed Beta in China on March 27, 2017. == Gameplay == Gameplay Screenshot Players assume the role of one of multiple classes each with different play styles and abilities. After a brief tutorial players arrive in a central area called the 'Hub'. In this area players can access Portals which act as access points to different in-game worlds each one tailored for a specific stage of progression. Each portal requires a minimum Power Rank to enter which gets higher per portal, allowing for progression from easier worlds to harder worlds as the player gains in level. Each world gets progressively harder but rewards higher levels of experience and better loot/resources. Each portal is of a specific color which is designed to indicate the quality of the 'loot' which can be most commonly located there, although there is a small chance that loot of a higher quality will be found. The exception to this is the higher level Red portals which predominantly drop Legendary (orange) quality loot but have a higher chance to drop loot of relic (red), resplendent (rainbow) or shadow (dark purple) quality as well. Higher Level Red portals have a better chance for to drop the rarer loot types. Loot Quality progresses from (lowest to highest) Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Relic, Resplendent, Shadow level 1-5, Radiant, Stellar and crystal In Trove only three of the equipable slot items can be obtained from defeating hostile NPCs, unlike in other RPG games. The items which can be obtained in this way are the hat, weapon and mask slot items. These items form the 'loot drops' left behind either when some enemies are defeated or when a reward chest is opened following the defeat of a boss type NPC. Players can obtain the other equipable items from crafting, the ingame store, trade NPCs, reaching certain levels of Mastery, or via ingame badges. These items include rings, alternative character costumes (which unlock as your character increases in level), tomes, allies (permanent pets that boost the player character's stats), wings, mounts, boats, sails, flasks (which are consumed to restore the player character's health), fishing rods, mag riders ( a form of quick travel mount limited to use on train-like mono- rails), and Emblems, which add to or alter the benefits provided by Flasks. A notable feature of Trove is the Collection. With the exception of Rings, Hats, weapons and masks, each of the other none loot drop items, once activated is added to the players library of unlocked items. Any character on that account can then access their own copy of that item from the collection and can select it from the corresponding item slot in their character equipment screen. For example, once you obtain a fishing rod on one character, you can activate it (default left mouse click) which will add the rod to your library. You then only have to select the fishing rod slot on the character screen to be taken to the fishing rod area of the library. Select the rod from the list and the item will be equipped. This can be done on any character on that account without restriction. Rings, masks, hats and weapons are not added to the library and so the player will only get one instance of the item unless more are found/crafted. If a player wishes to transfer the item between characters then they must first un-equip the item and change characters in order to equip it to the newly selected character. Players can trade items in the market for flux (in game currency) ==Character customization== Any Weapon, Hat or Face that is placed in the Loot Collector will be destroyed but the style of that item will be added to the player's library allowing the player to choose to use that item's image as a vanity, instead of the item currently equipped. This applies to masks, hats and weapons only. The new image only affects the appearance of the character and provides an altered visual appearance only. Additionally, any item which is destroyed in the Loot Collector provides the player with resources, useful in upgrading other items or in crafting. Players can also alter their character's face, skin and hair styles using The Barbershop without limit, which can be crafted or found at the Hub zone. ==Environments== The Hub zone is the central Zone in Trove and acts as a meeting place for all players as well as a way of accessing the lower level worlds until players are able to craft their own world portals. The Hub also includes a selection of crafting stations and an NPC who sells items used for fishing, an in game semi-profession, and sailing. Each world zone contains various biomes that focus on a specific theme. These include Neon City, a world with structures designed to resemble a fictionalised image of the insides of a computer, Highlands, designed to resemble fields and forests, The Fae Forest, a dark fairy tale like zone and many, many others. (Dragonfire Peaks, Candoria, Treasure Isles, etc.) Each biome is connected seamlessly to each other and each world zone is open world in its construction allowing players to travel from biome to biome seamlessly within each world zone. The biomes themselves each have their own unique NPC enemies which will attack the player if they get too close, as well as their own unique flora. One of the main features of each biome is their themed dungeons. For example, the Candoria biome, a theme based on sweets, chocolate and other such items can have dungeons shaped like giant cakes, gumball machines or a myriad of other themed objects related to the biome. ==Classes== There are numerous classes within Trove. Currently, these are the Vanguardian, the Dino Tamer, the Chloromancer, the Revenant, Lunar Lancer, Tomb Raiser, Boomeranger, Pirate Captain, Shadow Hunter, Ice Sage, Candy Barbarian, Neon Ninja, Dracolyte, Fae Trickster, Gunslinger, and the Knight. Each Character has their own strengths and weaknesses making the play style for each varied. Most classes are designed to resemble a particular Biome whilst others are said to be 'roamer' classes which do not originate from any particular biome, according to in game lore. Each Character has a selection of unique abilities which unlock within the first few levels of play. Each Character has a main attack, secondary attack, unique passive ability, and 2 extra skills which can be triggered when desired and have built in cooldowns, limiting their use. The Unique passive ability allows the class to utilize their class mechanics, for example the Tomb Raiser class obtains charges called 'souls' either when a set period of time has passed or when an enemy is defeated. The Tomb Raiser can store up to 3 of these charges at any one time and can expend them using their secondary attack ability to summon NPC character minions to help him in combat. ==Professions== There are three Crafting professions, each with their own particular crafting stations. With each craft the level of the profession increases which in turn allows the player access to higher quality recipes for each increase of 50 levels, until the profession level reaches the maximum of 250. Players can also participate in Fishing, which can provide them with resources, items and trophies that are not obtainable via other means. However Fishing does not improve with levels and does not require a crafting station, unless the player is attempting to create more advanced fishing rods than the basic type purchasable from the Hub NPC, Saltwater Sam. ==References== Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:2015 video games Category:MacOS games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games ",
