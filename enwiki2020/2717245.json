    "text": "The Oratory Tennis Club plays on the real tennis court of The Oratory School in Woodcote, South Oxfordshire. It was the first school in the United Kingdom to construct a court for 80 years, finishing the building in 1990. The club is primarily made up of paying members of the public, but also of Oratorians (boys from the school). Over recent years the UK Professional Singles Tournament has been held at the court and in April 2006, the World Championships are scheduled to take place there. Jonathan Howell, the President of the International Real Tennis Professionals Association is the Sports Executive of the school and the club and Mark Eadle is the Senior Professional. Bryn Sayers has recently been appointed as Assistant Professional. The court itself is modern, fast and possesses a \"bouncy\" feel to it. The school has one of the most successful school real tennis teams ever, with regular appearances in the finals of national competitions, and in recent years has produced such players as Richard Greenland and Paul Knox. ==External links== * The Oratory School Category:Real tennis venues ",
