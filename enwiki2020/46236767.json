Her best friend, Gianna, is his mistress. Marco murders his wife and becomes the administrator of his wife's estate, with the proviso that Nancy, Dorothy's daughter from a previous marriage, takes over control when she turns twenty. Marco has retired to live with Gianna in a luxurious lakeshore villa. Marco's daughter Nancy contacts him to notify him that she will be taking control of her mother's estate very soon. Nancy has been living in a boarding school for years and hadn't seen her mother for a long time. Gianna tries to encourage Marco to kill Nancy, since Marco's standard of living will drop severely once she takes over the estate. But Marco ends up falling in love with Nancy, which complicates the proceedings. == Cast == *Jenny Tamburi as Nancy Thompson *Silvano Tranquilli as Marco *Rosalba Neri as Gianna *Dana Ghia as Magda *Zora Gheorgieva as Dorothy Emerson *Hiram Keller as Paolo ==See also == * List of Italian films of 1972 ==References== ==External links== * Category:Italian films Category:Italian-language films Category:Giallo films Category:1970s crime thriller films Category:Films directed by Silvio Amadio Category:Films scored by Roberto Pregadio ",
