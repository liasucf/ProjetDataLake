    "text": "Potassium ethyl xanthate (KEX) is an organosulfur compound with the chemical formula CH3CH2OCS2K. It is a pale yellow powder that is used in the mining industry for the separation of ores. Unlike the related sodium ethyl xanthate, the potassium salt exists as an anhydrous salt. ==Production and properties== Xanthate salts are prepared by the action of alkoxides on carbon disulfide. The alkoxide is often generated in situ from potassium hydroxide:This report gives a detailed procedure :CH3CH2OH + CS2 \\+ KOH \u2192 CH3CH2OCS2K + H2O Potassium ethyl xanthate is a pale yellow powder that is stable at high pH but rapidly hydrolyses at pH <9 at 25 \u00b0C. Unlike the sodium derivative, potassium xanthate crystallizes as the anhydrous salt and is non-hygroscopic. ==Applications== Potassium ethyl xanthate is used in the mining industry as flotation agent for extraction of the ores of copper, nickel, and silver. The method exploits the affinity of these \"soft\" metals for the organosulfur ligand. Potassium xanthate is a useful reagent for preparing xanthate esters from alkyl and aryl halides. The resulting xanthate esters are useful intermediates in organic synthesis.One of several procedures using xanthate esters: ==Safety== The \\text{LD}_{50} is 683 mg/kg (oral, rats) for potassium ethyl xanthate. ==References== Category:Potassium compounds Category:Thiocarbonyl compounds Category:Metallurgical processes ",
