The sentencing, Hamburg, Rotherbaum The Hamburg Ravensbr\u00fcck trials were a series of seven trials for war crimes against camp officials from the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp that the British authorities held in their occupation zone in Germany in Hamburg after the end of World War II. These trials were heard before a military tribunal; the three to five judges at these trials were British officers, assisted by a lawyer. The defendants included concentration camp personnel of all levels: SS officers, camp doctors, male guards, female guards (Aufseherinnen), and a few former prisoner-functionaries who had tortured or mistreated other inmates. In total, 38 defendants were tried in these seven trials; 21 of the defendants were women. Executions relating to these trials were carried out on the gallows at by British hangman Albert Pierrepoint. All seven trials took place at the Curiohaus in the Hamburg quarter of Rotherbaum. == First trial == The first Ravensbr\u00fcck trial was held from December 5, 1946 until February 3, 1947 against sixteen Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp staff and officials. All of them were found guilty. One died during trial. The death sentences (except for Salvequart) were carried out on May 2\u20143, 1947, in Hamelin prison. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" style=\"font-size: 90%; border-spacing:10px 0px;\" !# !align=\"left\"|Defendant !align=\"left\"|Function, Title !align=\"left\"|Sentence |- ||1||||Deputy camp leader||Death, executed on May 3, 1947 |- ||2||||Warden||Death, executed on May 3, 1947 |- ||3||||Warden||15 years' imprisonment; released May 18, 1955 |- ||4||||Gestapo inspector||Death, executed on May 3, 1947 |- ||5||Martin Hellinger||Medical doctor||15 years' imprisonment; released May 14, 1955 |- ||6||||Medical doctor||Death, executed on May 3, 1947 |- ||7||Gerhard Schiedlausky||Medical doctor||Death, executed on May 3, 1947 |- ||8||||Medical doctor||Death; committed suicide on April 8, 1947 before the sentence could be carried out |- ||9||Adolf Winkelmann||Medical doctor||Died during the trial on February 1, 1947 |- ||10||Dorothea Binz||Assistant Chief warden (Oberaufseherin)||Death; executed May 2, 1947 |- ||11||Greta B\u00f6sel||||Death; executed May 3, 1947 |- ||12||Margarete Mewes||Jail Warden||10 years' imprisonment; released February 26, 1952 |- ||13||Elisabeth Marschall||Nurse||Death; executed May 3, 1947 |- ||14||Carmen Mory||Inmate; Kapo||Death; committed suicide on April 9, 1947 before the sentence could be carried out |- ||15||Vera Salvequart||Inmate; Kapo||Death; executed on June 2, 1947 |- ||16||Eugenia von Skene||Inmate; Kapo||10 years' imprisonment, released December 21, 1951 |} Percival Treite, a half-British medical doctor at Ravensbr\u00fcck, was defended by a dozen former female prisoners, including Special Operations Executive agent, Yvonne Baseden, who wrote letters to the court favorable to him. Ex-prisoner Mary Lindell testified in favor of Treite at the trial saying that Treite \"was the only man who was human, the only man who looked after the sick people as a doctor should look after them.\" The outspoken Lindell also criticized the judge advocate, \"who was partial and objectionable, had taken on the cross examination of witnesses himself and prevented other questions from being put which might have been [answered] in favour of the accused.\" Nevertheless, Triete was sentenced to death.Hore, pp. 233-236 Three more defendants, the camp leader, Lagerkommandant Fritz Suhren, along with \"work leader\" Hans Pflaum and Schneidermeister Friedrich Opitz (below, see the Second Ravensbr\u00fcck trial), escaped from prison prior to the first trial. The first two of them were apprehended under assumed names in 1949. They were handed over to French authorities, who were conducting another Ravensbr\u00fcck trial in Rastatt at that time; both men were sentenced to death in that trial and executed by a firing squad on June 12, 1950. Opitz faced trial in November 1947. Female prisoners at Ravensbruck in 1939 Female prisoners gathered when the Red Cross arrive to Ravensbr\u00fcck in April 1945. The white paint marks shows they are prisoners.Margarete Buber-Neumann, Under Two Dictators. Prisoner of Stalin and Hitler, : \"SS had no fabric for the production of new prison clothing. Instead they drove truckloads of coats, dresses, underwear and shoes that had once belonged to those gassed in the east, to Ravensbr\u00fcck. [...] The clothes of the murdered people were sorted, and at first crosses were cut out, and fabric of another color sewn underneath. The prisoners walked around like sheep marked for slaughter. The crosses would impede escape. Later they spared themselves this cumbersome procedure and painted with oil paint broad, white crosses on the coats.\" (translated from the Swedish edition: Margarete Buber-Neumann F\u00e5nge hos Hitler och Stalin, Stockholm, Natur & Kultur, 1948. Page 176) == Second Ravensbr\u00fcck trial == In the second Ravensbr\u00fcck trial, which lasted from November 5 to 27, 1947, the only defendant was Friedrich Opitz age 49, a clothing factory leader in the camp employed there from June 1940 till April 1945. He was recaptured after his earlier escape from prison along with Fritz Suhren and Hans Pflaum (see above). During trial, he was convicted of beating women with truncheons, belts and fists, starving them for missing the quota, keeping them outside in very long roll-calls, and sending them to the gas chamber for (what he called) \"being useless\", as well as of kicking at least one Czech female inmate, causing death. He also encouraged his guards to do the same. Opitz received a death sentence, which was carried out on January 26, 1948. == Third Ravensbr\u00fcck trial == In the third Ravensbr\u00fcck trial, the so-called \"Uckermark trial\" which took place from April 14 to 26, 1948, five female camp officials of the satellite Uckermark concentration camp, were indicted for the mistreatment of women and the participation in the selection of women for the gas chamber. The Uckermark subcamp was located about one mile from the Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp. It was opened in May 1942 as a prison or parallel concentration camp for teenage girls aged 16 to 21 dubbed criminal or \"difficult\" by the SS. Girls who reached the upper age limit were transferred back to the Ravensbr\u00fcck women's camp. Camp administration was provided by the Ravensbr\u00fcck main camp. In January 1945, the prison for juveniles was closed although the gassing infrastructure was subsequently used for the extermination of \"sick, no longer efficient, and over 52 years old women\" from Ravensbr\u00fcck .Ebbinghaus 1987, p. 287. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" style=\"font-size: 90%; border-spacing:10px 0px;\" !align=\"left\"|Defendant !align=\"left\"|Function, Title !align=\"left\"|Sentence |- |Johanna Braach||Criminal inspector; warden in the juvenile's camp||Acquitted |- |Lotte Toberentz||Camp leader of the juvenile's camp||Acquitted |- |Elfriede Mohneke||Assistant Chief warden of the extermination camp||10 years of imprisonment; released June 14, 1952 |- |Margarete Rabe||Warden of the extermination camp||Lifetime imprisonment; reduced in 1950 to 21 years; released June 16, 1959 |- |Ruth Neudeck||Chief warden of the extermination camp||Death; executed on July 29, 1948 |} Braach and Toberentz were acquitted because they had worked at Uckermark only while it was still a juveniles camp, and there were no Allied women there at that time; the camp was exclusively for German girls, whose fate or treatment was outside the remit of the tribunal. == Fourth Ravensbr\u00fcck trial == The fourth trial was held from May to June 8, 1948. The accused were all members of the medical staff of the camp at Ravensbr\u00fcck, including one inmate who had worked as a nurse. The charges again centered on mistreatment, torture, and sending to gas chambers of women of Allied nationality. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" style=\"font-size: 90%; border-spacing:10px 0px;\" !align=\"left\"|Defendant !align=\"left\"|Function, Title !align=\"left\"|Sentence |- |Benno Orendi||Medical doctor||Death; executed September 17, 1948 |- |Walter Sonntag||Medical doctor||Death; executed September 17, 1948 |- |Martha Haake||Nurse||10 years' imprisonment; released on January 1, 1951 due to medical reasons |- |Liesbeth Krzok||Nurse||4 years' imprisonment; released February 3, 1951 |- |Gerda Ganzer||Inmate; Nurse||Death |} Ganzer had already stood trial for her activities in Ravensbr\u00fcck in 1946 before a Russian military tribunal and had been acquitted. In Hamburg, she was found guilty, but her death sentence was commuted into lifetime imprisonment on July 3, 1948, which in turn was reduced to 21 years' imprisonment in 1950 and then to 12 years in 1954. She was finally released on June 6, 1961. == Fifth Ravensbr\u00fcck trial == In the fifth trial, three SS members were accused of having killed Allied inmates. The trial lasted from June 16 to 29, 1948. The judgments were handed down on July 15, 1948. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" style=\"font-size: 90%; border-spacing:10px 0px;\" !align=\"left\"|Defendant !align=\"left\"|Function, Title !align=\"left\"|Sentence |- |Arthur Conrad||SS warden||Death; executed September 17, 1948 |- |Heinrich Sch\u00e4fer||SS warden||2 years' imprisonment; released October 28, 1949 |- |Walter Schenk||SS warden||20 years' imprisonment; released August 3, 1954 |} == Sixth Ravensbr\u00fcck trial == This trial lasted from July 1 to 26, 1948.
