When associated with the United States Navy (who operate the majority), they are known as naval outlying landing fields (NOLFs) or naval auxiliary landing fields (NALFs); when associated with United States Marine Corps, they are known as Marine Corps outlying fields (MCOFs) or Marine Corps auxilary landing fields (MCALFs). Having no based units or aircraft, and minimal facilities, an outlying landing field is used as a low-traffic location for flight training, without the risks and distractions of other traffic at a naval air station or other airport. ==List of active OLFs== ===NOLFs=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
