Originally released in 1976, it features performances by Jarrett's 'American Quartet', which included Dewey Redman, Charlie Haden and Paul Motian with Guilherme Franco added on percussion. Aside from appearing in the Mysteries: The Impulse Years 1975-1976 boxset, Shades was only issued on compact disc in Japan, packaged in a miniature replica of the original vinyl LP sleeve. In October 2011, it was reissued internationally as part of the Impulse! 2-on-1 series, packaged with Mysteries in a single disc format titled Mysteries / Shades. ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4\u00bd stars, stating, \"Throughout, bassist Charlie Haden, drummer Paul Motian and percussionist Guilherme Franco keep the band's juices flowing.\".Yanow, S.
