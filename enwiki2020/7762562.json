The economy of La Costa Partido is dominated by the summer tourist season (December\u2013February), which sees tens of thousands of vacationers make their way to the Atlantic coast from Buenos Aires and the Greater Buenos Aires urban area. ==History== Noticed by Ferdinand Magellan in 1520, who gave nearby Cape San Antonio its name, Spanish authorities first surveyed the area in 1580. The waterfront area was purchased in the 18th century by the Ortiz de Rozas family, one of Argentina's most well-established landowners. Sold to another prominent family, the Leloirs, in 1816, the area became a sheep ranch. A descendant of the Ortiz de Rozas', Buenos Aires Province Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas, designated the area as the Partido del Rinc\u00f3n de Aj\u00f3 in 1839, following a local insurrection against his repressive rule and poor conditions. A fishing wharf became Aj\u00f3's economic hub in subsequent decades, and had been prominent as a supply route during the 1838 French blockade against Rosas. The area was renamed Partido de General Lavalle, after one of Rosas' erstwhile foes, in 1891. The installation of abattoirs (since closed) was followed by new fishermen's docks, a canal, a Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway terminal, and two lighthouses built between 1878 and 1902. The La Lucila del Mar pier, one of five in the county. The area became a tourist attraction during the 1920s, when County Mayor Jorge Gibson promoted its shores for their seclusion and scenic value. He had the local coastline graded into public beaches, and in 1932, a provincial gravel road reached the area. The oldest official municipalities, San Clemente del Tuy\u00fa and Mar de Aj\u00f3, were established in 1935, followed by San Bernardo del Tuy\u00fa (1942), Mar del Tuy\u00fa (1945), and Santa Teresita (1946). During the last dictatorship, the military-appointed Governor, General Ib\u00e9rico Saint Jean, signed Decree 9024, the Urban Jurisdictions Law of June 11, 1978, by which the Lavalle District was divided into three (the others being Pinamar and Villa Gesell). Mar del Tuy\u00fa was chosen as the county seat to avoid disputes between residents of the county's northernmost town, San Clemente del Tuy\u00fa, and the southernmost, Mar de Aj\u00f3, which are the two largest in the district. Elections in 1983 brought Justicialist candidate Juan de Jes\u00fas to office. His administration two hospitals built and numerous public infrastructure works, thereby helping integrate the neighboring communities in the district. The economic malaise Argentina suffered in the 1980s and the boom in overseas travel following recovery in the early 1990s took its toll on municipal finances, however. The administration of Mayor Guillermo Magad\u00e1n (who had been the military-appointed mayor in the late 1970s) had a nature theme park, Parque Bah\u00eda Aventura, opened in 1997. Drawing few crowds, the area was slated for closure when, in 2003, mineral hot springs were discovered at the spot. Returned to office that year, Mayor de Jes\u00fas set aside part of Bah\u00eda Aventura and opened Termas Marinas, today one of Argentina's most popular hot springs; his son, Juan Pablo, was elected mayor in 2007. The county's population has grown by over 4% a year since 1980, climbing from under 26,000 that year, to over 60,000 at the . *La Costa: Cronolog\u00eda ==Settlements== 150px * San Clemente del Tuy\u00fa * Las Toninas * Costa Chica * Santa Teresita * Mar del Tuy\u00fa * Costa del Este * Aguas Verdes * La Lucila del Mar * Costa Azul * San Bernardo del Tuy\u00fa * Mar de Aj\u00f3 * Nueva Atlantis * Pinar del Sol * Costa Esmeralda Beachgoers in Santa Teresita ==External links== * San Clemente del Tuy\u00fa * Santa Teresita * San Bernardo del Tuy\u00fa * Partido De La Costa Website Category:1978 establishments in Argentina Category:Partidos of Buenos Aires Province ",
