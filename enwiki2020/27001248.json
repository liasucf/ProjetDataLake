    "text": "The INQ Chat 3G (occasionally dropping the '3G' to be called the INQ Chat) is a fully featured, 3G enabled \"Candy Bar\" smartphone created by the British manufacturer INQ, designed to easily interface with popular social media applications. Dubbed the 'Twitter phone', the INQ Chat 3G features integrated Twitter, Facebook, Skype and Windows Live Messenger applications. The phone sports a full QWERTY keypad, a 3.2-megapixel camera and a 2.4-inch screen. The phone was launched alongside the INQ Mini 3G - both of which succeed the hugely successful INQ1. ==History== The BREW device was announced on 4 August 2009, and developed in response to consumer demand for a full QWERTY keypad layout device from INQ. The phone debuted on 30 November 2009 in Italy,Ciao Italia!

The packaging the phone comes in is laden with artwork from various artists, and there is no manual as such, instead a set of 'Help Cards'. Each help card focusses on a particular part of the phone - for example Contacts, E-mail or Twitter - on one side, and then on the other side one of the many artworks selected by INQ. In their words: \"We have collaborated with illustrators we love to turn our packaging and help cards into objects to cherish, not chuck.\" Along with this, all of the artworks are included as images on the phone and can set as the wallpaper or screensaver if desired. The artwork use on the Chat 3G's box is by Matt Huynh. The artwork for all of INQ's phones can be seen here, along with an introduction to \"INQ+Art\", brief descriptions of each artist, their artwork and which phone it was used for. (Note: some artists have had more than one of their pieces used, and on multiple phones). ===Battery Covers=== Like the Mini 3G, the INQ Chat 3G's battery covers are interchangeable with other colours. The default is the red battery cover, but black, pink and yellow battery covers can be purchased at participating stores of the default network in the respective countries. In Canada, phones bought on Telus receive, two battery covers, a solid color and an artwork cover - feature either the artwork by Paul Vizzari or one of the pieces of artwork by Matt Huynh (different from the one use on the phone's box); both artworks feature on the back of the help cards. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Battery Covers ! scope=\"col\" | Red ! scope=\"col\" | Yellow ! scope=\"col\" | Pink ! scope=\"col\" | Black ! scope=\"col\" | Artwork ! scope=\"col\" | Artwork |- ! scope=\"row\" | Image | alt=INQ Chat 3G - red cover | alt=INQ Chat 3G - yellow cover | alt=INQ Chat 3G - pink cover | alt=INQ Chat 3G - black cover | alt=INQ Chat 3G - Paul Vizzari cove | alt=INQ Chat 3G - Matt Huynh cover |- ! scope=\"row\" | Notes | Default colour.
