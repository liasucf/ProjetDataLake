Stillhouse Hollow Dam and the reservoir are both managed by the Fort Worth District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

At the close of 2011, the level of the lake stood at just over 605 ft. ==Fish populations== Stillhouse Hollow Lake has been stocked with species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing.
