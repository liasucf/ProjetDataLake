    "text": "Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles (BW&BK;) is a Canadian heavy metal magazine. Although based in Toronto, Canada, BW&BK; features writers from the US, Germany and the UK, allowing the magazine to represent metal music from an international prospective. Covering many facets of extreme music, BW&BK; features a reviews section which reports on current records circulating through the underground metal world, a Metal Forecast section which tracks the release date of upcoming recordings, and a website which reports current metal news. Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles was founded by former M.E.A.T. magazine staffer Tim Henderson and author Martin Popoff in 1994. ==Background== ===Early 1990s=== Henderson, who had published several photocopied issues of a newsletter called Metal Tim Bits (the title a play on the Tim Bit donut served at the popular Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons), encountered Popoff in the Toronto HMV's metal section and Popoff began discussing his first metal book, Riff Kills Man. The two subsequently plotted a magazine creation based on Metal Tim Bits; the Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles title was based on Agony Column's 1990 album of the same name. ====March '94 \u2013 first issue==== 200 copies of BW&BK; #1 were originally printed, and its cover price was $1.95. HMV stocked the magazine and other record stores followed suit. Issue #1 was 16 pages, and featured interviews with Pantera, Entombed, Gwar, Cannibal Corpse and Geezer Butler of Black Sabbath. No ads appeared in the inaugural issue. ===1994\u20131997=== BW&BK; continued to grow, reaching 48 pages by October 1997.

By this time, current writers Carl Begai, Chris Bruni, Mark Gromen, Allan Grusie and Aaron Small had joined the team. ====Late 1997==== BW&BK; #21 was the first issue of the magazine to feature a colour cover.
