    "text": "Ynys Gored Goch (\"Red Weir Island\"), sometimes Ynys Gorad Goch, is a small island in the Menai Strait between Gwynedd and Anglesey in north Wales.Ordnance Survey map of the island It is situated in the stretch of the strait called the Swellies between Thomas Telford's Menai Suspension Bridge and Robert Stephenson's Britannia Bridge. The island is occupied by the main house and the converted smoke house where locally caught fish were processed. The island is private property and access is only by boat. ==History== The earliest known document relating to the island dates from 1590 when it is listed as belonging to the Diocese of Bangor which leased it for \u00a33 and a barrel of herrings a year Hughes, Margaret: Anglesey from the Sea, page 14. Carreg Gwalch, 2001 as the island was used as a fishing trap and presently has the remains of two fishing weirs. The weirs are thought to have been constructed at the same time as the smoking chamber was built, around 1842, in the path of eddy currents that would take the fish into the weirs and leave them trapped as the tide retreated. After 1888 when the house was sold into private hands the whitebait (herring), business was developed, and growing tourism in the 20th century meant people would often travel to the island to taste the fish.Hughes, Margaret: Anglesey from the Sea, page 15. Carreg Gwalch, 2001 A bell by the Anglesey shore summoned a boat to carry visitors across to enjoy a 'Gored Whitebait Tea' which comprised a pot of tea, brown bread and butter and whitebait \u2018fried in a basket\u2019, priced one shilling.Anglesey Today: The secrets of Ynys Gorad Goch, from the book \"Anglesey Sketches\" by Margaret Hughes. Accessed 11 June 2016 ==Location== A high spring tide around Ynys Gored Goch, 30 March 2006. The strong tidal flow in the Menai Strait creates small whirlpools, hence the name the \"Swellies\". In olden times, access by rowing boat was restricted by the tides but nowadays modern boats can access anytime. Mains water and electricity were installed in 1997. Pumping systems mean the two houses no longer flood. Due to the large tidal range of the Menai Strait the size of the island varies between and . The tidal range of the Menai Strait is known to exceed during high with spring tides which makes it appear that the buildings are on two separate islands. Occasional storm surges have even increased water levels up to . Ynys Gored Goch once had a large common tern colony. This has now reduced to approximately 10 pairs which in 2011 produced 13 chicks. The island's location makes it a popular theme in photographs of the Menai Strait and its bridges. It has also featured in television programmes such as A Great Welsh Adventure with Griff Rhys Jones (2014) Countryfile (2016) and Robson Green's Coastal Lives (2017). ==References == * Senogles,David (1969), The story of Ynys Gorad Goch in the Menai Straits, published by the author, 97 pages. *Senogles, David \"A History of the parish of Llandysilio\" (2001), The Vicar and Wardens of the parish of Llantysilio == External links == *Site containing an aerial view * Category:Islands of Anglesey Category:Menai Strait Category:Llanfairpwllgwyngyll ",
