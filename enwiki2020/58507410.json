    "text": "Structural changes to local government in England have taken place or will take place in 2019, 2020, and 2021. Some of these changes continue the trend of new unitary authorities being created from other types of local government districts. Ceremonial counties will not see any changes to their external boundaries, but in some cases their subdivisions will be altered. ==Changes in 2019== In all new authorities created in 2019, new councils were elected on 2 May 2019, along with local elections in other parts of the country. See 2019 United Kingdom local elections for details. ===Dorset=== *Status: Completed On 1 April 2019, the ceremonial county of Dorset was changed from consisting of a non-metropolitan county (itself divided into six non-metropolitan districts) and two unitary authorities, into consisting of two unitary authorities.The Local Government (Structural and Boundary Changes) (Supplementary Provision and Miscellaneous Amendments) Order 2019New unitary authorities formally takeover from Dorset\u2019s nine councils from Public Sector Executive The new unitary authorities in Dorset are: * Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole, consisting of the old unitary authorities of Bournemouth and Poole as well as the non-metropolitan district of Christchurch * Dorset Council, which merged the five remaining non-metropolitan districts of East Dorset, North Dorset, Purbeck, West Dorset, and Weymouth and Portland, as well as the former county council Charter trustees were established for Bournemouth and for Poole as a consequence. For details of the inaugural elections to the new councils, see 2019 Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council election and 2019 Dorset Council election. ===Suffolk=== *Status: Completed On 1 April 2019, the number of districts in Suffolk was reduced from seven to five. West Suffolk was created by merging Forest Heath and St Edmundsbury. East Suffolk was created by merging Suffolk Coastal and Waveney. These new districts are not unitary authorities, and the two-tier structure of county and district councils remains in place. For details of the inaugural elections to the new councils, see 2019 East Suffolk District Council election and 2019 West Suffolk District Council election. ===Somerset=== *Status: Completed On 1 April 2019, the number of districts in the non-metropolitan county of Somerset was reduced from five to four, when Taunton Deane and West Somerset were merged as Somerset West and Taunton. This new district is not a unitary authority, and the two-tier structure of county and district councils remains in place. Charter trustees were established for Taunton as a consequence. For details of the inaugural elections to the new council, see 2019 Somerset West and Taunton District Council election. ==Changes in 2020== In all new authorities created in 2020, new councils were scheduled to be elected on 7 May 2020, along with local elections in other parts of the country. However, all local elections in the United Kingdom were postponed a year due to the coronavirus pandemic, so elections scheduled for 2020 will instead be held on 6 May 2021. See 2021 United Kingdom local elections for details. ===Buckinghamshire=== *Status: Completed The existing Buckinghamshire County Council and the non-metropolitan districts of Aylesbury Vale, Chiltern, South Bucks, and Wycombe in Buckinghamshire was replaced by a single unitary authority known as Buckinghamshire Council on 1 April 2020. This plan was proposed by Martin Tett, leader of the county council, and backed by then-Communities Secretary James Brokenshire. It received approval from Parliament in May 2019.Buckinghamshire unitary council plan gets go-ahead from BBC NewsThe Buckinghamshire (Structural Changes) Order 2019 The existing unitary authority of Milton Keynes was not affected; since 1 April 2020, the ceremonial county of Buckinghamshire has therefore been composed of two unitary authorities. Before this was approved by Parliament, the district councils had proposed a different plan in which Aylesbury Vale would become a unitary authority and the three southern districts would become another unitary authority. The district councils opposed the single unitary Buckinghamshire plan, and considered legal action against it.District council joins plans to take legal action over 'undemocratic' unitary authority from Bucks Free Press For details of the inaugural elections to the new council, see 2021 Buckinghamshire Council election. ==Changes in 2021== In all new authorities to be created in 2021, new councils will be elected on 6 May 2021, along with local elections in other parts of the country.

The joint committee for West Northamptonshire claims that the changes will save 85 million pounds per year.Northamptonshire: Crisis council replacement plan decision postponed from BBC NewsNorthamptonshire County Council replacement 'will save \u00a385m a year' from BBC News The Northamptonshire (Structural Change) Order 2019 (SCO) was brought before Parliament in October 2019, but due to the dissolution of Parliament on 6 November leading up to the general election on 12 December 2019, the changes were not then given final approval.Unitary councils - Update on unitary legislation from northamptonshire.gov.uk Parliament went on Christmas break after the election, with the order finally being made on 14 February 2020. For details of the inaugural elections to the new councils, see 2021 North Northamptonshire Council election and 2021 West Northamptonshire Council election. ===Somerset=== *Status: Proposed Changes in Somerset have been under consideration since at least 2018. In 2020, Somerset County Council submitted a proposal known as \"One Somerset\" to the Government. Under this plan, the county council and the four non-metropolitan districts of Mendip, Sedgemoor, Somerset West and Taunton and South Somerset would be replaced by a single unitary authority. The proposal awaits approval by Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick and by Parliament. The four district councils have created a rival proposal, known as \"Stronger Somerset\", where the county and district councils would be replaced by two unitary authorities. Mendip and South Somerset would be merged to create Eastern Somerset, while Sedgemoor and Somerset West and Taunton would be merged to create Western Somerset. The district councils argue that a single authority would be too far removed from the citizens, and say that forming two instead of one would help save \u00a3204 million. District councillors agreed to this plan in August 2020, but it too awaits approval by the Communities Secretary and by Parliament. The existing unitary authorities of Bath and North East Somerset and North Somerset would not be affected under either plan; depending on whether the One Somerset or Stronger Somerset plan is implemented, the ceremonial county of Somerset would be composed of either three or four unitary authorities. ==See also== *History of local government in England *Local government in England *Earlier local government reforms: **Local Government Act 1972 **1990s United Kingdom local government reform **2009 structural changes to local government in England ==References== Category:2019 in England Category:2019 in British politics Category:2020 in England Category:2020 in British politics Category:2021 in England Category:2021 in British politics Category:History of local government in England Category:Public policy in England Category:Reform in England ",
