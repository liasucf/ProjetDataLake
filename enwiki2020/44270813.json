The tournament was contested twice between 1920 and 1926.Copa Est\u00edmulo [Stimulus Cup] on RSSSF Although some versions state the cup had a third edition in 1929, it was indeed played under the 1929 Primera Divisi\u00f3n season format (being Gimnasia y Esgrima (LP) the winner). The Association only officialized the 1920 and 1926 Copa Est\u00edmulo editions,\"Campeones de Copas Nacionales\" at AFA website considering the 1929 championship as a Primera Divisi\u00f3n title.\"Campeones de la Primera Divisi\u00f3n 1891-1934\" on AFA website ==History== In 1920, the Argentina national team travelled to Chile to play the South American Championship held in that country therefore the Association interrupted the Primera Divisi\u00f3n championship while the international competition was being played. With the purpose of keeping local teams active, the association created a new tournament to be played during the recess, named \"Copa Est\u00edmulo\". Ten teams took part of the competition, divided into two groups where teams played each other in a round-robin tournament. Before finishing the first stage, the cup was abandoned and never went back. Hurac\u00e1n (leading the group \"Norte\") was declared winner due to Banfield (first in the other zone) disaffiliated from the Football Association. For the third edition, the trophy would be awarded by the 1929 Primera Divisi\u00f3n champion. Unlike the previous season, the 35 teams participating were split into two groups in a round-robin tournament format. Teams finishing first of each zone at the end of the season played a final match, therefore Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata won the tournament after defeating Boca Juniors by 2-1.Argentina 1929 on RSSSF\"Argentina: 1ra.
