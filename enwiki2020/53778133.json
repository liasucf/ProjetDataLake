    "text": "The is a medium-sized breed of dog that originates from Okinawa, Japan. It is a rare dog and is slowly declining in numbers. There were as few as 400 Ryukyu Inu as of 2015. Unlike dogs such as the Kai Ken, the Ryukyu Inu is not protected by the Nihon Ken Hozonkai, but instead is protected by the Ryukyu Inu Hozonkai. == History == The Ryukyu Inu originated in Okinawa. The breed was originally used to track and bay Ryukyu Wild Boar in Packs, and also rarely hunt birds. Much of the Ryukyu Inu's history has been destroyed and misplaced, hence it's very sparse. The purebred Ryukyu Inu was thought to be extinct after World War II due to food shortages and crossbreeding with western dogs. In the early 1980s, Yoshio Aragaki the founder of the Ryukyu Inu Hozonkai, felt a strong urge to save the breed when he managed to find purebred Ryukyu Inu up in Yanbaru. It is believed that the years of living in the rainforest is why the Ryukyu Inu has a dewclaw on the back of the foot. Because of this claw, they can climb trees. It has been speculated that this would have been evolutionarily favourable to them because of the high incidence of tsunami in Okinawa; they could climb trees quickly to evade the floods. However, this is unlikely to be true due to only a small percentage of Ryukyu Inu actually having working rear dewclaws. The preservation society sees the dewclaws as a throwback from hundreds of years ago when the dogs were genetically closer to wolves and that the claws are used more often to help with stopping when running. ==Appearance== The Ryukyu Inu is a medium-sized Okinawan dog breed. They are very similar to Kai Ken in appearance but are genetically closer to the Hokkaido. ===Breed standard=== The Ryukyu Inu is not currently recognised by any Kennel Club, including the Japanese Kennel Club, however the Ryukyu Ken Hozonkai has issued this breed standard for the Ryukyu Inu. http://okinawa-dog.seesaa.net/article/12349006.html Temperament Neither fearful nor aggressive, intelligent, alert, and quiet. Head and skull Broad head; the muzzle is straight and drawn somewhat longer. The stop is Shallow. Nose colour should always be black, with the exception of Liver colouration, which always has a brown nose. Eyes Clear, dark brown, the corner of the eye is not lifted. In Liver the eye is golden/yellow. Ears Pricked ears in a blunt triangle shape; dogs with ears that are dropped are undesirable. Mouth Scissor bite. Undershot, overshot, or missing teeth are major faults. Black/Blue Pigment on tongue desirable. Neck Moderately wide. Neither lean nor chunky. Forequarters Forelegs straight. Body Longer than high. The chest is well developed, wide and deep. Straight back. Hindlimbs Hindquarters straight and strong. Dewclaws at the back preferred. Tail The tail should ideally be in the shape of a blade, it can also be curled. Fault for a dropped tail. Coat Short coat. Both Single Coated and Double Coated varieties allowed; long coat is a fault. Colour There are four recognised colours for conformation, black brindle, red brindle, white brindle (both silver and cream brindle), red and liver. The brindle pattern has to be beautiful and clear. A small amount of white is permitted, but an excessive amount of white is a fault. Height Dogs: 46.3 - 49.6cm Bitches: 43.4 - 46.9cm === Colour and coat === The Ryukyu Inu comes in nine colours: five original colours and four newer recognised colours. The original colours are: * red (With and without a mask) * liver * white brindle * black brindle * red brindle The newer official colours are: * black * white * ivory * sesame Ryukyu Inu are short coated dogs that have both single coated and double coated variates. However, like Akita Inu, they do carry the long coat gene recessively. == Temperament == The Ryukyu Inu is described as a quiet dog that is capable of hunting in a group or on its own. They are agile, brave and not sensitive. They are natural hunters and have a high prey drive. Despite being a hunting dog, they are obedient, playful and good with children. They cannot be trusted around small animals, but are usually okay with cats if introduced to them early on. They can be escape artists and have amazing climbing abilities, especially those with working rear dewclaws, who can climb vertical trees. They are very smart so require a lot of mental stimulation as well as physical stimulation. Despite being bred, raised and used as a hunting dog for many years they have been described by the Ryukyu Inu Hozonkai as ideal for Therapy Dog work because of their calm, placid temperament when trained correctly, however due to their high Prey Drive they are not suitable for Disability Assistance work. ==Lines== There are two distinct lines of Ryukyu Inu, the Yanbaru and the Yaeyama. Whilst they are the same breed of dog, there are subtle difference between the two lines. Ryukyu from the Yaeyama lines are often a lot bigger. For example, males from Yaeyama lines are often on average 49.6cm at the withers, whereas males from Yanbaru lines are on average 46.3cm. The Yaeyama line dogs also tend to have longer bodies and deeper chests than Yanbaru. The Ryukyu Inu Hozonkai has issued a statement that advises people to not breed Yabaru Line dogs with Yaeyama Line dogs at the current time as a preservation strategy. ==Ryukyu Inu Preservation Society== The Ryukyu Inu Hozonkai (Lit. Ryukyu Inu Preservation Society) is a breed club for the Ryukyu Inu. It was founded on April 1, 1990 by Yoshio Aragaki, and is the only Ryukyu Inu breed club and the only establishment that recognises the Ryukyu Inu thus far. The society has become inactive online in recent years, however the club itself still active in and around Okinawa. As of 1993, 3 years after the club's formation, there were 134 Ryukyu Inu registered. http://okinawa-dog.seesaa.net/article/12903440.html As a preservation and genetic diversity strategy the Club currently has Open Studbooks and registers dogs on merit is they meet the breed standard. == Health == The Ryukyu Inu, like all Japanese dog breeds, are considered to be relatively healthy dogs overall with not many health issues. The health conditions for Ryukyu Inu aren't well documented due to the culture of breeding dogs in Japan and Okinawa. Western Breeders of Ryukyu Inu are urged to test for hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia, Patella luxation, glaucoma, Collie eye anomaly (CEA) and hypothyroidism. ===Inbreeding=== One of the biggest health issues in Ryukyu Inu is inbreeding. These dogs have already survived one near-extinction, and all current Ryukyu Ken are descendants of the small pack from the 1980s. At their peak, Ryukyu Inu had around 1,500+ individuals in 2005, but this dropped to only 400 in 2015. Because of this second drop in population, finding two nearly completely unrelated individuals is very difficult, and as such their inbreeding is likely very high. To combat this, the Ryukyu Inu Hozonkai have begun Registering Dogs \"On Merit\" if they meet the breed standard and still continue to do this. ==Notable Ryukyu== Kai (\u6d77) is a very well known Ryukyu Ken in Okinawa who lives in Okinawa World. On 2 February 2019 Kai retired from being in the public eye because of turning 16 and going to be living in a quiet part of the workshop. He is being replaced by a female Ryukyu called Sora. Ume (\u30a6\u30e1) was a very light red brindle, almost fawn coloured Ryukyu, that lived at the Okinawa Children's Zoo and Museum. Ume passed away on 29 August 2018 at the age of 13. Okinawa Zoo announced her death on 1 September on Facebook. Hana (\u30cf\u30ca) is a Black Brindle Ryukyu Inu that lives in Okinawa Children's Zoo and Museum. == References == Category:Dog breeds originating in Japan ",
