    "text": "Talofa Airways is a Samoan airline that offers flights within the Polynesian region. It started operations in August 2016 using two Rockwell 690B Turbo Commander aircraft. As of September 2016, the airline serves three destinations in the region. Talofa Airways is the third airline based in Samoa, after Samoa Air and Polynesian Airlines. ==History== Toleafoa Jeffrey Hunter, the founder of Talofa Airways, first had plans to set up an airline business in the region in 1996, when he decided to remain in Samoa rather than return to the United States. After opening a pharmacy in Apia in 2002, Hunter began to invest towards establishing Talofa Airways, which would provide more convenient air travel between Samoa, American Samoa and other islands in Polynesia. He selected the Rockwell 690B Turbo Commander in a nine-seat configuration for the airline's fleet. In order to avoid the high costs of transporting the aircraft to Samoa, Hunter flew the aircraft from Florida himself. On 22 August 2016, the airline held an inauguration ceremony at Apia's Fagali'i Airport with Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi in attendance. Talofa Airways began operations on 29 August 2016, becoming the third airline based in Samoa after Polynesian Airlines and Samoa Air. ==Corporate affairs== The airline takes its name from the traditional Samoan greeting Talofa, signifying Talofa Airways' Samoan roots. It is headquartered in Taufusi, Apia. Toleafoa Jeffrey Hunter serves as the chairman and chief executive officer, and former Polynesian Airlines CEO Taua Fatu Tielu is the chief financial officer. Hunter, Tielu and their respective wives are all shareholders in the airline. ==Destinations== As of September 2016, Talofa Airways flies to the following destinations: {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
