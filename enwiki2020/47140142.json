As part of the QNMP's Urban Centre plan, which aims to implement development strategies in 28 central hubs that will serve their surrounding communities, Najma has been designated a District Centre, which is the lowest designation. Najma District Centre includes sections of four different zones located at the crossing of B Ring Road and Airport Street: Zone 15 (Ad Dawhah al Jadidah), Zone 16 (Old Al Ghanim), Zone 26 (Najma) and Zone 27 (Umm Ghuwailina). Somewhere from 10,000 to 15,000 residents will be situated in the District Centre, thus the plan emphasizes the construction of more high density apartment buildings.
