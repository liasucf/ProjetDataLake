    "text": "Philippines's 2nd senatorial district, officially the Second Senatorial District of the Philippine Islands (), was one of the twelve senatorial districts of the Philippines in existence between 1916 and 1935. It elected two members to the Senate of the Philippines, the upper chamber of the bicameral Philippine Legislature under the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands for each of the 4th to 10th legislatures. The district was created under the 1916 Jones Law from the west-central Luzon provinces of La Union, Pangasinan and Zambales. The district was represented by a total of eight senators throughout its existence. It was abolished in 1935 when a unicameral National Assembly was installed under a new constitution following the passage of the Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act which established the Commonwealth of the Philippines. Since the 1941 elections when the Senate was restored after a constitutional plebiscite, all twenty-four members of the upper house have been elected countrywide at-large. It was last represented by Te\u00f3filo Sison of the Nacionalista Democr\u00e1tico and Alejo Mabanag of the Nacionalista Dem\u00f3crata Pro-Independencia. ==List of senators== {| class=wikitable |- ! colspan=7 | Seat A | rowspan=99 | ! rowspan=3 | Legislature | rowspan=99 | ! colspan=7 | Seat B |- style=\"height:3em\" ! rowspan=\"2\" | # ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=2 | Senator ! colspan=2 | Term of office ! rowspan=\"2\" | Party ! rowspan=\"2\" | Electoral history ! rowspan=\"2\" | # ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=2 | Senator ! colspan=2 | Term of office ! rowspan=\"2\" | Party ! rowspan=\"2\" | Electoral history |- !Start!!End !Start!!End |- | rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1 | rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background:;\" | | rowspan=\"3\" | Pedro Mar\u00eda Sison | rowspan=\"3\" | October 16, 1916 | rowspan=\"3\" | June 6, 1922 | rowspan=\"3\" | Nacionalista | rowspan=\"3\" | Elected in 1916. | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | 4th | style=\"text- align:center;\" | 1 | style=\"background:;\" | | Aquilino Calvo | October 16, 1916 | February 20, 1917 | Nacionalista | Elected in 1916.
