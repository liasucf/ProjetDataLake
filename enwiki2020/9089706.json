Pelham-Clinton was the son of Henry Pelham-Clinton, 5th Duke of Newcastle and his wife Lady Susan Hamilton. He was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford. His political career was limited to sitting as Member of Parliament for Newark between 1857 and 1859. He did not hold any significant political offices in Nottinghamshire, although he was Provincial Grand Master of the Nottinghamshire Freemasons from 1865 to 1877. Lincoln's taste for gambling resulted in his fleeing the country in 1860 to escape his debts, which had then reached \u00a3230,000 (in excess of \u00a326 million in 2017 terms). In 1861, he married Henrietta Hope, heiress of the wealthy Henry Thomas Hope, in Paris. As part of the marriage settlement, his debts were paid and an income of \u00a350,000 a year settled on the couple. Extensive lands in England and Ireland were also added to his family's holdings by inheritance from his father-in-law, although Pelham-Clinton himself never controlled them due to the terms of that testament. He succeeded his father as Duke of Newcastle in 1864 and had five children with Henrietta: * Lady Beatrice Adeline Pelham-Clinton (1862\u20131935) who married Sir Cecil Lister-Kaye, 4th Baronet in 1880 * Lady Emily Augusta Mary Pelham-Clinton (1863\u20131919) who married Prince Alphonso Doria Pamphilj, Duc d'Avigliano in 1882 * Henry Pelham-Clinton, 7th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne (1864\u20131928) * Francis Pelham- Clinton-Hope, 8th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne (1866\u20131941) * Lady Florence Josephine Pelham-Clinton (1868\u20131935) ==References== == External links == *Biography of the 6th Duke, from Manuscripts and Special Collections at The University of Nottingham * * Category:1834 births Category:1879 deaths Category:19th-century English nobility Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford 006 Henry Lincoln, Henry Pelham-Clinton, Earl of Lincoln, Henry Pelham-Clinton, Earl of Category:UK MPs who inherited peerages Henry ",
