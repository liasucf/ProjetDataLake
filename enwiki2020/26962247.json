    "text": "The Extreme 19th is the highest () and longest () par three golf hole in the world, located at the Legend Golf & Safari Resort in the Entabeni Safari Conservatory, Limpopo Province, South Africa. The hole was conceived by the property owners, Peet and Mart Cilliers, along with Graham Cooke of the UK, and David Riddle. The tee, located at the top of Hangklip Mountain, is accessed only via helicopter. Because of its height, a tee shot takes almost 20 seconds to land. A spotter is given a rough direction via radio to look for the ball. The fairway is seeded with Cynodon grass, and has been landscaped to direct the ball towards the green, which has been shaped to resemble the continent of Africa. The green is surrounded by a large waste bunker. The 19th is an addition to an 18-hole Signature Golf Course designed by professional golfers, including P\u00e1draig Harrington, Trevor Immelman, Sergio Garc\u00eda, Bernhard Langer, Colin Montgomerie, Justin Rose, Vijay Singh, K. J. Choi and Retief Goosen. As of March 28, 2015, no one had scored a hole-in-one, but fourteen golfers had managed a birdie, including Lawrence Ahmed, professional cricketer Franklyn Stephenson, who was the first to do so. Of professional golfers to try the hole, P\u00e1draig Harrington was the first ever to score par, while Rapha\u00ebl Jacquelin, Justin Rose, Sergio Garc\u00eda and K. J. Choi have all carded bogeys. Other notable par scorers include American actor Morgan Freeman and Formula One Champion Lewis Hamilton. ==Facts and figures== * Vertical height \u2013 430 m. * Horizontal distance from foot of mountain to back of green \u2013 400 m. * Horizontal distance from foot of mountain to start of fairway \u2013 280 m. * The vertical drop from the start of fairway to the front of the green is 21 m. ==References== ==External links== Category:Golf in South Africa ",
