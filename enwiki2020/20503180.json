His father was J\u0101nis \u0122ermanis, and his family returned to the newly independent Latvia in 1919. He taught history at the University of Latvia in Riga from 1943 and obtained his master's degree. During World War II, he was mobilised to the Latvian Legion and served in the 19th. waffen grenadier division of the SS as a military reporter. A few days before the German capitulation, he emigrated to Sweden, where he settled in Solna. In 1974, he received his doctorate in history from the University of Stockholm. \u0122\u0113rmanis was, since 1935, a lifelong member of the Latvian student fraternity Fraternitas Livonica. His speciality was modern Latvian history, especially of the Soviet Union and the Latvian Riflemen. His ground-breaking work on Jukums V\u0101cietis and the Latvian Riflemen's role in the Bolshevik Revolution paved the way for further research on this subject by other Latvian \u00e9migr\u00e9 historians, notably the early works of Andrew Ezergailis. His book Zili stikli, za\u013ci ledi (Blue glass, green ice; 1968) describes his experience researching the story of V\u0101cietis. \u0122\u0113rmanis was one of the rare \u00e9migr\u00e9 Latvians allowed access to primary sources in the Latvian SSR at the time. In the book, he describes the suspicion he was met with by both the Soviet Latvian authorities, and by his fellow \u00e9migr\u00e9s, who questioned his motives for researching the history of pro-Bolshevik Latvians. In 1958, \u0122\u0113rmanis living in exile completed \"The Latvian Saga\", which presents Latvian history, but reads like a novel. As the Latvian Embassy in the USA writes on their homepage: \"It describes the people, powers and events that made Latvia what it is today, and puts it all in a broader European context...\", \"...it inspired several generations of Latvians to dedicate their lives to the restoration of Latvia's independence in 1991\". In 2007 the eleventh edition was issued in an English version and the works of \u0122\u0113rmanis are becoming increasingly popular in his native country as well. His lecture in Toronto, in 1988, about \"current events\" in the Soviet Union, is considered by many to be the best analysis of the situation at the time. Video recording of the lecture (in Latvian) can be accessed via internet on daugavasvanagi.ca Uldis \u0122\u0113rmanis was elected a member of the Latvian Academy of Sciences in 1992 and awarded the Order of the Three Stars in 1995. == Bibliography == * Pa aizputin\u0101t\u0101m p\u0113d\u0101m (1956), Daugava, Stockholm. * Latvie\u0161u tautas piedz\u012bvojumi (1959), Daugava, Stockholm. * Zili stikli, za\u013ci ledi (1968), Gr\u0101matu Draugs, New York. * Zemgalie\u0161u komandieris (1969\u20131972) Jaun\u0101 Gaita 76\u201390 * T\u0101 lieta pati nekrit\u012bs (1971), Gr\u0101matu Draugs, New York. * Oberst V\u0101cietis und die lettischen Sch\u00fctzen im Weltkrieg und in der Oktoberrevolution (1974) , Almqvist & Wiksell, Stockholm. * T\u0101lu t\u0101lum\u0101, liel\u0101 pla\u0161um\u0101 (1977), Gr\u0101matu Draugs, New York. * Zin\u0101\u0161anai (1985), Ziemelzvaigzne, Stockholm. * Divi portreti (1985), Atvase, Stockholm. * Izv\u0113rt\u0113\u0161anai (1987), Memento, Stockholm. * Laikmeta liec\u012bbas (1988), Memento, Stockholm. * Pak\u0101pies torn\u012b (1987), Gr\u0101matu Draugs, New York. * Pak\u0101pies torn\u012b 2. da\u013ca (1991), Memento, Stockholm. * Ce\u013c\u0101 uz Latviju.
