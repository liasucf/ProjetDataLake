    "text": "White Witch Doctor is a 1953 Technicolor adventure film directed by Henry Hathaway and starring Susan Hayward, Robert Mitchum, and Walter Slezak. Made by 20th Century Fox, it was produced by Otto Lang from a screenplay by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, based on the 1950 novel by Louise A. Stinetorf. The music score (notable for its use of the serpent, an obsolete instrument) was by Bernard Herrmann, and the cinematography by Leon Shamroy. The film was set in the Belgian Congo in 1907. ==Plot== The arrival of nurse Ellen Burton to the Belgian Congo is unwelcome to hunter John \"Lonni\" Douglas (Robert Mitchum), who captures animals for zoos. He warns her against traveling upriver to join a female doctor who is working with native tribesmen. Short of money, Lonni is intrigued when partner Huysman (Walter Slezak) tells him there is gold to be found in the region where Ellen will be traveling. Lonni volunteers to accompany her, along with gun bearer Jacques (Ajala). Ellen (Susan Hayward) is a widow who once discouraged her physician husband from his dream of coming to Africa to give medical aid. She talks a witch doctor out of killing a woman with an abscessed tooth. Upset with her, the witch doctor places a deadly tarantula in Ellen's tent. The doctor she is there to assist has died of fever. The king is pleased when his son is saved from a lion by Lonni, his wounds treated by Ellen, but then the king takes her hostage when Huysman, heavily armed, arrives to search for gold. Huysman's men knock Lonni unconscious and tie him up, but Jacques sacrifices his own life to save that of Lonni, who returns to Ellen's side for good. ==Cast== * Robert Mitchum as Lonni Douglas * Susan Hayward as Ellen Burton * Walter Slezak as Huysman * Timothy Carey as Jarrett * Mashood Olabisi Ajala as Jacques ==Production== The original director was Roy Ward Baker but he fell ill on location in Africa and was replaced by Henry Hathaway.Baby Sitters' Spree Set as Subject of Picture; Stage Gets Roz Russell Scheuer, Philip K.
