Organised by county, they were supposed to drill on a regular basis, although this was rarely the case in practice. They later became common in the American colonies, where they are normally referred to as Trainbands. Similar organisations include the Dutch Schutterij, and the Swiss militia, elements of which remain in existence today. ==Trained Bands; England and Wales== Founded in 1572, and organised by county, it was not until the 'Exact Militia Programme' of 1625 that they began to have regular training and weapons drill. Even then, standards varied considerably, and depended on the level of financial support by the local gentry. Although Charles I tried to assemble armies of around 30,000 militia for the 1639 and 1640 Bishops Wars, there was considerable reluctance to serve outside their counties, and a proportion were armed only with Longbows.Fissell, Chapter 5. A standard drill book was issued in February 1638, which was used throughout the 1638 to 1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms, together with a muster roll by county. This shows large variations in size, equipment and training; the largest was Yorkshire, which had 12,000 men, then London, with 8,000, increased in 1642 to 20,000. Counties like Shropshire or Glamorgan had fewer than 500 men. In the early stages of the 1642 to 1646 First English Civil War, the Trained Bands provided the bulk of the forces used by both Royalists and Parliamentarians, but were often unwilling to serve outside their home areas. They were rapidly replaced by more professional bodies, the most important being the New Model Army. ==American Train bands== In the early American colonies the trained band was the most basic tactical unit.Allan R. Millett and Peter Maslowski: For the common defense: A military history of the United States of America, New York: Free Press; London: Collier Macmillan, 1984, Library of Congress bibliographic record, http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/simon052/94005199.html, last accessed 27 Oct 2018: \"Although the basic tactical unit in all the colonies was the company, or trainband, regional variations and changes over time were as important as the superficial uniformity. No standardized company size existed, some companies containing as few as sixty-five men and others as many as two hundred. Some trainbands elected their officers, but in others the governors appointed them. Southern colonies, with widely dispersed populations, often organized companies on a countywide basis, while in New England, with its towns and villages, individual communities contained their own trainbands. As populations increased and the number of trainbands grew, colonies organized companies into regiments to preserve efficient management.\" However, no standard company size existed and variations were wide. As population grew these companies were organised into regiments to allow better management.Allan R.

Generally, upon reaching a certain age a man was required to join the local trainband in which he received periodic training for the next couple of decades. In wartime, military forces were formed by selecting men from trainbands on an individual basis and then forming them into a fighting unit. The exact derivation and usage is not clear. A nineteenth-century dictionary says, under \"Train\": The issue is whether the men \"received training\" in the modern sense, or whether they were \"in the train\" or retinue or were otherwise organised around a military \"train\" as in horse-drawn artillery. In 17th Century New England colonial militia units were usually referred to as \"train bands\" or, sometimes, \"trained bands\".Charles J. Hoadly, State Librarian: The Public Records of the State of Connecticut From October, 1776, to February, 1778, Inclusive, With the Journal of the Council of Safety from October 11, 1776, to May 6, 1778, Inclusive, and An Appendix, Connecticut: Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company, 1894, pp. 32, et seq., https://books.google.com/books?id=uWhKAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA267&lpg;=PA267&dq;=%22trainband%22#v=onepage&q;=%22trainband%22&f;=false, last accessed 27 Oct 2018: \"that part of the militia called the train-bands.\" Typically, each town would elect three officers to lead its train band with the ranks of captain, lieutenant and ensign. As the populations of towns varied widely, larger towns usually had more than one train band. In the middle 1600s train bands began to be referred to as companies. On December 13, 1636 the Massachusetts Militia was organised into three regiments - North, South and East. As there are National Guard units descendants of these regiments, this date is used as the \"birthday\" of the National Guard, despite the fact that citizen militias in the American Colonies date back to the Jamestown settlement in 1607. ==References== ==Sources== * * Mark Charles Fissell, The Bishops' Wars: Charles I's campaigns against Scotland 1638\u20131640, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994, . * * ==External links== * Category:Infantry units and formations Category:Militia in the United States Category:Militia of the United Kingdom ",
