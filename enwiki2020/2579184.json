    "text": "William Neilson (March 16, 1844 - February 10, 1915) was a Canadian businessman and founder of William Neilson Limited. ==Early life== Neilson was born in the Ramsay township, Lanark County, Ontario. His working life began as a farmer in Rochester, New York, then moved on to being a machinist's apprentice in Almonte, Ontario, Canada. In 1873 journeyman Neilson worked in Brockville, Ontario, moving on in 1889 to a retail store. Afterward he sold his store in 1890 and moved to Toronto, Ontario and began a grocery store that eventually failed. Leaving his family behind, he moved to North Dakota to work as a farmer with his brother Jessie. ==Founding of William Neilson Limited== Returning to Toronto, still in debt, he purchased some cows and began the sale of milk. Neilson then obtained ice-cream manufacturing equipment. In 1893 the firm, William Neilson Limited, was started. Ice-cream and mincemeat were the first products, and these fueled the growth of the company. Expansion and modernization started in 1904 with a new location and the addition of new equipment. By 1905 production was at two thousand gallons of ice-cream per day, and mincemeat production was discontinued. Chocolate was added to the product mix in 1908. This required further expansion and a new building was added, and by 1915 a new site was required and the production moved to Beachville, Ontario. By 1928, the company employed a thousand people in all departments and production was at one thousand gallons of ice-cream per hour, and the company opened branches in South America, South Africa, Japan, China, Australia and New Zealand. William Neilson Limited, now headquartered in Georgetown, Ontario, was held by George Weston Limited from 1947 to 2008 and is now held by Saputo Incorporated. ==Marriage and family== Neilson married Mary Eva Kaiser on October 6, 1875 in Brockville, Ontario. They were the parents of five children, of which the sons continued the business after the death of their father in 1915. Fred Harry Morden Neilson, the family's official churner, ran the business as president until his death in 1947. Charles Edward Neilson was secretary-treasurer and James William Allen Neilson was a vice-president. The Neilson family are buried at Forest Lawn Mausoleum in north Toronto. ==References== Middletown, Jesse Edgar, The Municipality of Toronto - A History, Dominion Publishing, 1923 == External links == *Biography at the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online * Neilson Dairy at www.neilsondairy.com Category:1844 births Category:1915 deaths Category:Canadian businesspeople Category:People from Lanark County Category:Canadian people of Scottish descent ",
