Spanish Americans are the longest-established European- American group with a continuous presence in Florida since 1565 and are the eighth-largest (choosing the term \"Spaniard\") group in the United States of America. Most Americans of Latin American descent have Spanish ancestral roots due to five centuries of Spanish colonial settlement and large-scale immigration after independence. By this criterion, white Hispanic and Latino Americans largely overlap with \"Spanish Americans\", with the caveat that the former group can include European ancestries other than Spanish, and self- reported white Latinos often have some Amerindian ancestry. However, the term \"Spanish-American\" is used only to refer to Americans whose ancestry originates directly from Spain, and excludes Americans who immigrated from Latin America and have Spanish origins. Basque Americans and Catalan Americans may or may not be considered Spanish Americans, as they form a separate linguistic group from other Spaniards. Like other Europeans, people directly from Spain are considered White/Caucasian. ==Immigration waves== Throughout the colonial times, there were a number of European settlements of Spanish populations in the present-day United States of America with governments answerable to Madrid. The first settlement on modern day U.S. soil was San Juan, Puerto Rico, in 1521, followed by St. Augustine, Florida (the oldest in the continental United States), in 1565, followed by others in New Mexico, California, Arizona, Texas, and Louisiana. In 1598, San Juan de los Caballeros was established, near present-day Santa Fe, New Mexico, by Juan de O\u00f1ate and about 1,000 other Spaniards. Spanish immigrants also established settlements in San Diego, California (1602), San Antonio, Texas (1691) and Tucson, Arizona (1699). By the mid-1600s the Spanish in America numbered more than 400,000. After the establishment of the American colonies, an additional 250,000 immigrants arrived either directly from Spain, the Canary Islands or, after a relatively short sojourn, from present-day central Mexico. These Spanish settlers expanded European influence in the New World. The Canary Islanders settled in bayou areas surrounding New Orleans in Louisiana from 1778 to 1783 and in San Antonio de Bejar, San Antonio, Texas, in 1731.Hern\u00e1ndez Gonz\u00e1lez, Manuel. La emigraci\u00f3n canaria a Am\u00e9rica (Canarian Emigration to the Americas). Pages 15 and 43\u201344 (about the expeditions and Canarian emigration in Texas), page 51 (about of the Canarian emigration to Louisiana). First Edition January, 2007 The earliest known Spanish settlements in the then northern Mexico were the result of the same forces that later led the English to come to North America. Exploration had been fueled in part by imperial hopes for the discovery of wealthy civilizations. In addition, like those aboard the Mayflower, most Spaniards came to the New World seeking land to farm, or occasionally, as historians have recently established, freedom from religious persecution. A smaller percentage of new Spanish settlers were descendants of Spanish Jewish converts and Spanish Muslim converts. Basques stood out in the exploration of the Americas, both as soldiers and members of the crews that sailed for the Spanish. Prominent in the civil service and colonial administration, they were accustomed to overseas travel and residence. Another reason for their emigration besides the restrictive inheritance laws in the Basque Country, was the devastation from the Napoleonic Wars in the first half of the nineteenth century, which was followed by defeats in the two Carlist civil wars. (For more information about the Basque, and immigrants to the United States from this region, please see the article Basque Americans.) === 19th and 20th centuries === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:right;\" |+ |- !colspan=6|Spanish immigration to the U.S. 1820\u20132000 |- !

Much larger numbers of Spanish immigrants entered the country in the first quarter of the twentieth century\u201427,000 in the first decade and 68,000 in the second\u2014due to the same circumstances of rural poverty and urban congestion that led other Europeans to emigrate in that period, as well as unpopular wars. The Spanish presence in the United States declined sharply between 1930 and 1940 from a total of 110,000 to 85,000, because most Spanish immigrants have historically arrived in Latin America rather than English-speaking countries, and many immigrants moved either back to Spain or to another country. Beginning with the Fascist coup d'\u00e9tat against the Second Spanish Republic in 1936 and the devastating civil war that ensued, General Francisco Franco established a fascist dictatorship for 40 years. At the time of the Fascist takeover, a small but prominent group of liberal intellectuals fled to the United States. After the civil war the country endured 20 years of autarky, as Franco believed that post-World War II Spain could survive or continue its activities without any European assistance. As a result, in the mid-1960s, 44,000 Spaniards immigrated to the United States. In the 1970s, when Franco abandoned Spain's autarkic economic system, prosperity began to emerge in Spain, and Spanish immigration to the United States declined to about 3,000 per year. In the 1980s, as Europe enjoyed an economic boom, Spanish immigrants to the United States dropped to only 15,000. The 1990 U.S. census recorded 76,000 foreign-born Spaniards in the country, representing only four-tenths of a percent of the total populace. Much as with French Americans, who are of French descent but mostly by way of Canada, the majority of the 41 million massively strong Spanish-speaking population have come by way of Latin America, especially Mexico, but also Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and other areas that the Spanish themselves colonized. Many of the Hispanic and Latino Americans bring their Spanish-speaking culture into the country. ==Principal areas of settlement== Spanish-Americans in the United States are found in large concentrations in five major states from 1940 through the early twenty-first century. In 1940, the highest concentration of Spaniards were in New York (primarily New York City), followed by California, Florida, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The 1950 US Census indicated little change\u2014New York with 14,705 residents from Spain and California with 10,890 topped the list. Spaniards spilled into New Jersey with 3,382, followed by Florida (3,382) and Pennsylvania (1,790).Immigrants in American History: Arrival, Adaptation, and Integration: Spanish and Spanish-Americans. By 1990 and 2000, there was relatively little change except in the order of the states and the addition of Texas. In 1990 Florida ranked first with 78,656 Spanish immigrants followed by: California 74,784, New York (42,309), Texas (32,226), New Jersey (28,666). The 2000 Census was a significant decline in Spanish-origin immigrants. California now ranked highest (22,459), followed by, Florida (14,110 arriving from Spain), New York (13,017), New Jersey (9,183), Texas (7,202). Communities in the United States, in keeping with their strong regional identification in Spain, have established ethnic organizations for Basques, Galicians, Asturians, Andalusians, and other such communities. These figures show that there was never the mass emigration from Iberia that there was from Latin America. It is evident in the figures that Spanish immigration peaked in the 1910s and 1920s. The majority settled in Florida and New York, although there was also a sizable Spanish influx to West Virginia at the turn of the 20th century, mostly from Asturias. It is likely that more Spaniards settled in Latin America than in the United States, due to common language, shared religion, and cultural ties. Some of the first ancestors of Spanish Americans were Spanish Jews who spoke Ladino, a language derived from Castilian Spanish and Hebrew. In the 1930s and 1940s, Spanish immigration mostly consisted of refugees fleeing from the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) and from the Franco military regime in Spain, which lasted until his death in 1975. The majority of these refugees were businessmen and intellectuals, as well as union activists, and held strong liberal anti-authoritarian feelings. ===California=== A Californio (Spanish for \"Californian\") is a Spanish term for a descendant of a person of Castillian ancestry who was born in Alta California. \"Alta California\" refers to the time of the first Spanish presence established by the Portol\u00e1 expedition in 1769 until the region's cession to the United States of America in 1848. Since 1945, others sometimes referred to as Californios (many appear in the \"Notable Californios\" section below) include: Early Alta California immigrants who settled down and made new lives in the province, regardless of where they were born. This group is distinct from indigenous peoples of California. Descendants of Californios, especially those who married other Californios. The military, religious and civil components of pre-1848 Californio society were embodied in the thinly- populated presidios, missions, pueblos and ranchos.Harrow, Neal; \"California Conquered: The Annexation of a Mexican Province, 1846\u20131850\"; pp. 14\u201330; University of California Press; 1989; Until they were secularized in the 1830s, the twenty-one Spanish missions of California, with their thousands of more-or-less captive native converts, controlled the most (about per mission) and best land, had large numbers of workers, grew the most crops and had the most sheep, cattle and horses. After secularization, the Mexican authorities divided most of the mission lands into new ranchos and granted them to Mexican citizens (including many Californios) resident in California. The Spanish colonial and later Mexican national governments encouraged settlers from the northern and western provinces of Mexico, whom Californios called \"Sonorans.\" People from other parts of Latin America (most notably Peru and Chile) did settle in California. However, only a few official colonization efforts were ever undertaken\u2014notably the second expeditions of Gaspar de Portol\u00e1 (1770) and of Juan Bautista de Anza (1775\u20131776). Children of those few early settlers and retired soldiers became the first true Californios. One genealogist estimated that, in 2004, between 300,000 and 500,000 Californians were descendants of Californios. ===Florida=== El Centro Espa\u00f1ol de Tampa is a cultural house built in 1912 in the Ybor City neighborhood of Tampa, Florida. Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n, a Spanish conquistador, named Florida in honor of his discovery of the land on April 2, 1513, during Pascua Florida, a Spanish term for the Easter season. Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s founded the city of St Augustine in 1565; the first European-founded city in what is now the continental United States. In the early 1880s, Tampa was an isolated village with a population of less than 1000 and a struggling economy.Mormino&Pizzo;, Ch. 9 However, its combination of a good port, Henry Plant's new railroad line, and humid climate attracted the attention of Vicente Martinez Ybor, a prominent Spanish-born cigar manufacturer; the neighborhood of Ybor City was named after him. The El Centro Espa\u00f1ol de Tampa remains one of the few surviving structures specific to Spanish immigration to the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries,\"El Centro Espa\u00f1ol de Tampa\".

Spanish immigration to Hawaii began when the Hawaiian government and the Hawaiian Sugar Planters' Association (HSPA) decided to supplement their ongoing importation of Portuguese workers to Hawaii with workers recruited from Spain. Importation of Spanish laborers, along with their families, continued until 1913, at which time more than 9,000 Spanish immigrants had been brought in, most recruited to work primarily on the Hawaiian sugar plantations. The importation of Spanish laborers to Hawaii began in 1907, when the British steamship SS Heliopolis arrived in Honolulu Harbor with 2,246 immigrants from the M\u00e1laga province of Spain. However, rumored poor accommodations and food on the voyage created political complications that delayed the next Spanish importation until 1911, when the SS Orteric arrived with a mixed contingent of 960 Spanish and 565 Portuguese immigrants, the Spanish having boarded at Gibraltar, and the Portuguese at Oporto and Lisbon. Although Portuguese immigration to Hawaii effectively ended after the arrival of the Orteric, the importation of Spanish laborers and their families continued until 1913, ultimately bringing to Hawaii a total of 9,262 Spanish immigrants. Six ships between 1907 and 1913 brought over 9,000 Spanish immigrants from the Spanish mainland to Hawaii. Although many of the Portuguese immigrants who preceded them to Hawaii arrived on small wooden sailing ships of less than a thousand gross tonnage capacity, all of the ships involved in the Spanish immigration were large, steel-hulled, passenger steamships. ===Louisiana=== The majority of them descended from Canarian settlers who arrived in Louisiana between 1778 and 1783. Its members are descendants of colonists from the Canary Islands, which is part of Spain off the coast of Africa. They settled in Spanish Louisiana between and intermarried with other communities such as French, Acadians, Creoles, Mainland Spaniards, and other groups, mainly through the 19th and early 20th centuries. The Isle\u00f1os originally settled in four communities including Galveztown, Valenzuela, Barataria, and San Bernardo. Following significant flooding of the Mississippi River in 1782, the Barataria settlement was abandoned and the survivors were relocated to San Bernardo and Valenzuela with some settling in West Florida.Balbuena Castellano, Jos\u00e9 Manuel. \"La odisea de los canarios en Texas y Luisiana\" (The Odyssey of the Canarians in Texas and Louisiana). Pages 137, 138, 150 and 152. (ed) 2007, editorial: Anroart Ediciones. ===New Mexico=== Hispanos of New Mexico (less commonly referred to as Neomexicanos or Nuevomexicanos) are people of Spanish descendants of the Spanish and Mexican colonists who settled the area of New Mexico and Southern Colorado. From 1598 to 1848, most settlers in New Mexico were of Spanish ancestry (either directly or through Mexico), Like Californios and Tejanos. The descendants of the settlers still retain a community of thousands of people in this state and that of southern Colorado. New Mexico belonged to Spain for most of its modern history (16th century \u2013 1821) and later to Mexico (1821\u20131848). The original name of the region was Santa F\u00e9 de Nuevo Mexico. The descendants of the settlers still retain a community of thousands of people in this state. Also, there is a community of Nuevomexicanos in Southern Colorado, due to shared colonial history. Currently, the majority of the Nuevomexicano population is distributed between New Mexico and Southern Colorado. Most of the Nuevomexicanos that live in New Mexico live in the northern half of the state. There are hundreds of thousands of Nuevomexicanos living in New Mexico. Those who claim to be descendants of Spanish settlers in this state currently account as the first predominant ancestry in the state. There is also a community of people in Southern Colorado descended from Nuevomexicanos that migrated there in the 19th century. The stories and language of the Nuevomexicanos from Northern New Mexico and Southern Colorado were studied by Nuevomexicano ethnographer, linguist, and folklorist Juan Bautista Rael and Aurelio Espinosa. ===New York=== Actress Rita Hayworth of paternal Spanish descent. Spanish American actress Anita Page in Our Modern Maidens (1929). \"Little Spain\" was a Spanish-American neighborhood in the New York City borough of Manhattan during the 20th century. Little Spain was on 14th Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. A very different section of Chelsea existed on a stretch of 14th Street often referred to by residents as \"Calle Catorce,\" or \"Little Spain\". The Church of Our Lady of Guadelupe (No. 299) was founded in 1902, when Spaniards started to settle in the area. Although the Spanish business have given way to such nightclubs as Nell's and Oh Johnny on the block between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, the Spanish food and gift emporium known as Casa Moneo has been at 210 West 14th since 1929. In 2010 the documentary Little Spain, directed and written by Artur Balder, was filmed in New York City. The documentary pulled together for first time an archive that reveals the untold history of the Spanish-American presence in Manhattan. They present the history of the streets of Little Spain in New York City throughout the 20th Century. The archive contains more than 450 photographs and 150 documents that have never been publicly displayed. Other important commerces and Spanish business of Little Spain were restaurants like La Bilba\u00edna, Trocadero Valencia, Bar Coru\u00f1a, Little Spain Bar, Caf\u00e9 Madrid, Mes\u00f3n Flamenco, or El Faro Restaurant, established 1927, and still today open at 823 Greenwich St. The Iberia was a famous Spanish dress shop. The heart of the Spanish American community in that area were the two landmarks: the Spanish Benevolent Society and the Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Guadalupe, founded at the turn of the 19th century, being the first parish in Manhattan with mass in Latin and Spanish. Another area of influence is the Unanue family of Goya Foods. Its founder, Prudencio Unanue Ortiz, migrated from Spain in the 20th century and established Goya Foods, the largest Hispanic-owned food company in the United States. The family's members include Joseph A. Unanue and Andy Unanue. Goya Foods is the 377th largest private American company. ==Culture== Santa Barbara, California\u2019s annual Old Spanish Days fiesta celebration. Many Spanish Americans still retain aspects of their culture. This includes Spanish food, drink, art, annual fiestas. Spaniards have contributed to a vast number of areas in the United States of America. The influence of Spanish cuisine is seen in the cuisine of the United States throughout the country. ===Cuisine=== In the early 20th century Prudencio Unanue Ortiz and his wife Carolina established Goya Foods, the largest Hispanic-owned food company in the United States. ===Spanish language in the U.S.=== Spanish was the second European language spoken in North America after Old Norse, the language of the Viking settlers. It was brought to the territory of what is the contemporary United States of America in 1513 by Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n. In 1565, the Spaniards founded St. Augustine, Florida, the oldest, continuously occupied European settlement in the modern U.S. territory. Like other descendants of European immigrants, Spaniards have adopted English as their primary language. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- ! colspan=\"2\"| Language spoken at home and ability to speak English (2013 ACS) |- ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Spaniard \u2013 Language spoken and ability ! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Percent |- |Population 5 years and over |703,504 |- |English only |68.5% |- |Language other than English |31.5% |- |Speak English less than \"very well\" |7.1% |} ===Religion=== Mission Santa Barbara was founded in 1786. Main articles: Spanish missions in Arizona, California, Carolinas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas, Ajac\u00e1n Mission Many Spanish Americans are more active in Catholic church activities than was common in past generations in Spain; they rarely change their religious affiliation and participate frequently in family\u2013centered ecclesiastical rituals. In both Spain and the United States events such as first communions and baptisms are felt to be important social obligations that strengthen clan identity. == Socioeconomics == Since Spanish American entrance into the middle class has been widespread, the employment patterns described above have largely disappeared. This social mobility has followed logically from the fact that throughout the history of Spanish immigration to the United States, the percentage of skilled workers remained uniformly high. In the first quarter of the twentieth century, for example, 85 percent of Spanish immigrants were literate, and 36 percent were either professionals or skilled craftsmen. A combination of aptitude, motivation, and high expectations led to successful entry into a variety of fields. ==Number of Spanish Americans== ===Censuses=== ===1980=== In 1980, 62,747 Americans claimed only Spaniard ancestry and another 31,781 claimed Spaniard along with another ethnic ancestry. 2.6 million or 1.43% of the total U.S. population chose to identify as \"Spanish/Hispanic\", however this represents a general type of response which will encompass a variety of ancestry groups.Ancestry of the Population by State: 1980 (Supplementary Report PC80-S1-10) Issued: April 1983 Spanish Americans are found in relative numbers throughout United States, particularly in the Southwestern and Gulf Coast. According to the 1980 U.S. census 66.4% reported Spaniard as their main ancestry, while 62.7% reported Spanish/Hispanic as their main ancestry.1980, U.S Census by State The table showing those who self-identified as Spaniard are as follows: {|class=\"sort wikitable unsortable\" style=\"font-size: 100%\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text- align:left;\"|Response||Number||Percent||Northeast||North Central||South||West |- | colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|Single ancestry||62,747||66.4%||24,048||3,011||23,123||12,565 |- | colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|Multiple ancestry||31,781||33.6%||9,941||2,209||11,296||8,335 |- | colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|Total reported||colspan=2 style=\"text- align:center;\"|94,528||33,989||5,220||34,419||20,900 |- |} {| class=\"unsortable wikitable\" |- !

This number also includes people who self-identify as Hispanic of Spanish origin, such as those who immigrated or have family or ancestors who immigrated from Spain. == Political participation == With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 a number of intellectual political refugees found asylum in the United States. Supporters of the overthrown Spanish Republic, which had received aid from the Soviet Union while under attack from National rebel forces, were sometimes incorrectly identified with communism, but their arrival in the United States well before the \"red scare\" of the early 1950s spared them the worst excesses of McCarthyism. Until the end of the dictatorship in Spain in 1975 political exiles in the United States actively campaigned against the abuses of the Franco regime. ==Place names of Spanish origin== Some Spanish placenames in the USA include: * Arizona \u2013 Either from \u00e1rida zona, meaning \"Arid Zone\", or from a Spanish word of Basque origin meaning \"The Good Oak\". * California \u2013 The state was named for a mythical land described in a popular Spanish novel from around 1500, Las sergas de Esplandi\u00e1n (The exploits of Esplandi\u00e1n) by Garci Rodr\u00edguez de Montalvo. ** Alcatraz Island \"Gannet Island\" ** Los Angeles \"City of Angels\" ** Sacramento \"City of the Sacrament\" ** Santa Cruz \"City of the Holy Cross\". ** San Diego \"Saint Didacus\". ** San Francisco \"Saint Francis\". ** San Jose \"Saint Joseph\". * Florida \u2013 \"Flowery\". ** Boca Raton \u2013 \"Shallow inlet of sharp\u2013pointed rocks that scrape a ship's cables\", ** Key West \u2013 Anglicisation of \"Cayo Hueso\" (\"Bone Island\") ** St. Augustine, Florida \u2013 Founded by Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s. * Colorado \u2013 \"Reddish\". ** Pueblo \u2013 \"Town\", Alamosa \u2013 \"Cottonwood\" * Montana \u2013 \"Monta\u00f1a\", \"Mountain\". * New Mexico ** Albuquerque, New Mexico \u2013 First called La Villa de San Francisco Xavier de Alburquerque, was founded as a Royal city by order of Don Francisco Cuervo y Valdez, 34th Governor of New Mexico, on February 7, 1706. ** Santa Fe \u2013 \"Holy Faith\", **Las Cruces \u2013 \"The Crosses\", **Madrid \u2013 although pronounced \"MAD\u2013rid\" the city was named for the capital of Spain * Texas \"Tejas\" in Spanish and \"slates\" in English. ** El Paso \"The Pass\", **Amarillo \"Yellow\", **San Antonio \"St. Anthony\", * Nevada \u2013 The name comes from the Spanish nevada , meaning \"snow-covered\", after the Sierra Nevada (\"snow-covered mountain range\"). ** Las Vegas \" The Meadows\". * Oregon \u2013 \"Orej\u00f3n\", \"big ear\" or could come from \"Arag\u00f3n\". ==Notable people== ==See also== === About Spanish Americans === * Spanish-American relations * Spanish immigration to Hawaii * Spanish cuisine * Asturian Americans * Canarian Americans * Isle\u00f1o * Louisiana Creole people * Cajuns * Galician Americans * Basque Americans * Catalan Americans * Hispanos ** Californio ** Tejano ** Nuevomexicano (New Mexican Spanish) * Origins of New Mexico Families: A Genealogy of the Spanish Colonial Period * El Centro Espa\u00f1ol de Tampa * Centro Asturiano de Tampa * History of Ybor City === About Hispanic Americans and Spanish Canadians === * Hispanic Society of America * Notable Hispanics * Spanish Canadians * White Americans * White Hispanic * White Latin Americans * Hispanic * Hispanic and Latino Americans ==References== ==Further reading== * Colahan, Clark. \"Spanish Americans.\" Gale Encyclopedia of Multicultural America, edited by Thomas Riggs, (3rd ed., vol. 4, Gale, 2014), pp. 271\u2013281.
