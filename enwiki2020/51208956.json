Featuring the DC Comics team of the same name created by Peter Milligan and Mikel Jan\u00edn, the film is the twenty-seventh in the DC Universe Animated Original Movies series and a part of DC Animated Movie Universe. Unlike most installments in the DC Animated Universe Movies series, Justice League Dark features an original premise. The film stars Matt Ryan as John Constantine and Jason O'Mara reprising his role as Batman. It was released on Digital HD on January 24, 2017, and on DVD and Blu-ray on February 7, 2017.Justice League Dark - \"Are You Talking About Magic?\" In May 2020 a sequel was released, Justice League Dark: Apokolips War. ==Plot== In a flashback, exorcist and con man John Constantine and Jason Blood engage the Demons Three in a poker game for high-end stakes; Constantine offers his home, the House of Mystery, as his part of the pool in exchange for a box of artifacts, including a chipped Dreamstone. When both parties are caught cheating, Constantine has Blood summon Etrigan \u2014 a demon forced to share a body with Blood \u2014 to dispatch the demons. Afterward, Blood reprimands Constantine for making him summon Etrigan, and the two part ways. In the present, a magical threat arises causing violent murders to be committed by people around the world, who think their victims are demonic creatures. The Justice League gather to conclude that magic is the source of the crimes, but Bruce Wayne / Batman is skeptical. Later that night at Wayne Manor, Bruce finds a written message on his walls telling him to find Constantine prompting him to seek out a reluctant Zatanna \"Z\" Zatara. Zatanna is eventually convinced by Boston Brand / Deadman. Zatanna and Boston lead Bruce to the House of Mystery, where they meet Constantine, who is reluctantly working with a team. The group is also joined by Black Orchid, the spiritual embodiment of the House of Mystery, and they decide to investigate the cause behind these supernatural occurrences. The team then visits Ritchie Simpson, an old friend of Constantine and Zatanna, where they find shroud spirits of Death waiting to collect Ritchie's soul upon his upcoming demise. Simpson has cancer and is resentful towards Constantine for abandoning him to his fate, but loans them the Keshanti Key. Constantine and Zatanna use the key to view one of the victim's memories and discover he was possessed by an unknown entity. A magical creature is conjured to consume the man, but Batman, Deadman, Constantine and Zatanna narrowly escape and destroy it. Back at Ritchie's house, the team finds him close to death; Blood is also there to find the Dreamstone. Constantine chases after Blood while Batman gives an adrenaline shot to revitalize Ritchie. Upon being caught by Constantine, Blood explains that centuries ago the sorcerer Destiny possessed the Dreamstone in an attempt to overthrow Camelot-era Britain, using it to make people see their worst nightmares and feed off their torment. Blood was mortally injured cleaving the Dreamstone in half. Merlin summoned Etrigan to defeat Destiny and then bound him to Blood because Merlin knew they would be needed in the future. Ritchie briefly wakes to claim Felix Faust as his assailant. With the help of the plant elemental Alec Holland / Swamp Thing, the group locates Faust's Observatory of the Cosmos. After a battle with Faust, which he loses, the team conclude Faust had no involvement in hurting Ritchie. Ritchie awakens and is revealed to have the other piece of the Dreamstone, which has been keeping his cancer in remission; he apparently destroys Black Orchid. Constantine tries to reason with Ritchie, that the Dreamstone (with Destiny's soul trapped inside) is using him. However, the Dreamstone takes over Ritchie's body and transforms him into Destiny. Destiny destroys the House and departs to start a frenzy; Zatanna saves the group, but passes out from the exertion. The Justice League tries to fight Destiny, but he causes them to perceive each other as demonic threats, so they attack each other. Etrigan attacks Destiny, but is separated back into Jason Blood and Etrigan. Constantine summons Swamp Thing, who attacks Destiny, while Batman and Zatanna disable the League. Destiny rips Alec Holland's corpse from Swamp Thing, weakening him and breaking his will; Swamp Thing withdraws. Constantine tricks Destiny into bringing him and Deadman within his protective shield, allowing Deadman to wound Destiny. Blood, Constantine and Batman destroy the Dreamstone (and Destiny's body), and Ritchie is dragged to Hell as insurance that Destiny cannot come back. Blood succumbs to his mortal wounds, and his body is buried near the place of his old village by Zatanna, Constantine and Etrigan. Zatanna agrees to join the League and offers Constantine a position as well. He declines, claiming that Batman would not approve, but Zatanna states it was Batman's idea. The two return to the now-rebuilt House of Mystery, and Deadman joins the restored Black Orchid as his soulmate. ==Voice cast== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- style=\"background:rgb(255,85,0);\" !Voice actor !Character |- !colspan=\"2\"|Justice League |- | Jason O'Mara | Bruce Wayne / Batman |- | Jerry O'Connell | Kal-El / Clark Kent / Superman |- | Rosario Dawson | Diana Prince / Wonder Woman |- | Roger Cross | John Stewart / Green Lantern |- !colspan=\"2\"|Justice League Dark |- | Matt Ryan | John Constantine |- | Camilla Luddington | Zatanna Zatara |- | Nicholas Turturro | Boston Brand / Deadman |- | Ray Chase | Jason Blood / Etrigan the Demon |- | Roger Cross | Dr. Alec Holland / Swamp Thing |- | Colleen Villard | Black Orchid |- !colspan=\"3\"|Demons Three |- | JB Blanc | Abnegazar |- | Jeffrey Vincent Parise | Rath |- | Fred Tatasciore | Ghast |- !colspan=\"2\"|Other |- | Enrico Colantoni | Felix Faust |- | Jeremy Davies | Ritchie Simpson |- | Alfred Molina | Destiny |- | JB Blanc | Merlin |- | Brian T.
