    "text": "Kenneth Chuang Yin-ching () is a Taiwanese epidemiologist. As of January 2020, he leads the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (TCDC) Communicable Disease Control Medical Network. ==Career== Chuang earned a degree in medicine at Kaohsiung Medical University, and completed his residency at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. He specialized in epidemiology and infectious diseases while teaching at National Cheng Kung University. Chuang was the superintendent of , Liouying branch. ===COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan=== Chuang rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan. Chuang and two colleagues issued on 16 January a level-2 travel alert for Wuhan, China because of his and his colleague's three-day long on-the-ground experience in that city from 13 January to 15 January 2020. They told a news conference in Taipei one day later that 30 percent of the Wuhan patients had no direct exposure to the Huanan Seafood City market (HSCM), which the Chinese authorities indicate as the epicenter of the outbreak. The Chinese had closed down the HSCM on 1 January. Chuang's revelation on 16 January predates by three days the Chinese confirmation of human-to-human transmission. On 20\u201321 January the World Health Organization then sent to Wuhan a delegation, which reported on 22 January that human-to-human transmission was indeed occurring. The Chinese government allowed the visit to foreign medical officials not only from Taiwan but also from Hong Kong and Macau. At the 16 January conference, Chuang remarked on the case of \"a married couple infected in Wuhan. The husband worked at the market, but the wife, who had not recently been to the market due to limited mobility, might have contracted the illness from her husband.\" Chuang also was among the first to report that the SARS-CoV-2 infections were occurring in clusters. Chuang stated later, in an interview for the Daily Telegraph that: Chuang \"received no response to his questions about why 13 infections could not be traced to the (HSCM) seafood market.\" The WHO declared a PHEIC on 30 January. ==References== Category:Taiwanese epidemiologists Category:Kaohsiung Medical University alumni Category:National Cheng Kung University faculty Category:Taiwanese hospital administrators Category:COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan Category:Taiwanese civil servants Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ",
