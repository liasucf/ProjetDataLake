When asked about the title, Chloe said, > \"The title means so much to us; we\u2019re speaking about ourselves as we\u2019re > growing into young women, telling ourselves we\u2019re going to be OK. We\u2019ll make > mistakes and we\u2019ll have obstacles, but we\u2019ll overcome them. But then also in > a general sense, with this generation and how the world has gone mad and all > these crazy things that are left for this generation to handle, it\u2019s just > proclaiming that we will be alright no matter what, and they shouldn\u2019t worry > about us. I love being part of this generation because we\u2019re not afraid to > let our voices be heard, and we\u2019re not afraid to speak our mind.\" == Critical reception == The album received mostly positive reviews. Writing for Refinery29, Courtney Smith stated, \" Chloe X Halle write lyrics that address love, both universal and romantic, but do the latter from a place of power... It's a reminder to not underestimate or infantilize them simply because they are young.\" Sydney Gore for MTV wrote, \"Overall, this record is loaded with catchy bops, hardcore bangers and beautiful ballads with uplifting messages that will surely turn into anthems for various experiences in your personal life.\" Briana Younger, writing for Pitchfork said about the album, \"The Beyonc\u00e9-approved sister act are fearless on their debut album, reshaping pop and R&B; in their own images until even the highest-profile co-signs seem beside the point... Listening to their debut, it\u2019s easy to believe that if God spoke, she would sound like Chloe x Halle.\" Pitchfork rated the album 7.6 out of 10. Gabe Bergado wrote in a review of the album for Teen Vogue, \"Within the first few minutes of listening to Chloe x Halle's debut album The Kids Are Alright, you'll be completely entranced by the sisters' dreamy vocals and electrifying beats.\" Alex Zidel wrote for HotNewHipHop, saying, \"[The album wows] many with impressive chemistry and an undeniable charm.\" Also listing \"Happy without Me\" as an album highlight, he wrote, \"In a pairing that not many expected would sound this beautiful, Joey Bada$$ and Chloe x Halle makes for a fantastic collaboration... Joey complements the pair's voices as he raps seamlessly throughout his bars.\" == The Kids Are Alright film == Immediately following the release of the album, the duo released a short film on YouTube named after the album.
