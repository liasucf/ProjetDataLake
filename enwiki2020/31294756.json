Writing in Time Out in the 31 August 2005 issue of the magazine, Steffens concluded that though the novel contains \"sly plot twists and persuasive [characters] \u2026 some of it comes off as [no more than] cathartic release\", though \"whispers of promising novels \u2013 or movies \u2013 to come.\"Steffens, Daneet.

Before he'd even hit puberty he had shot enemy troops, looted villages and brutally murdered civilians \u2013 and all against his will.\"Innocence lost: The child soldiers forced to murder Taussig, Nick.

Through Klebnikov, the plight of the Russian people under Stalinist rule is grippingly demonstrated. Taussig's style \u2013 short on dialogue and long on descriptions and Klebnikov's thoughts \u2013 takes a bit of getting used to, but turns out to be effective for the passionate political and emotional content of his novel.\" == Published works == === Fiction === * Love and Mayhem (2005) *Don Don (2007) * Gorilla Guerrilla (2008) *The Distinguished Assassin (2013) == Producing == Taussig has produced feature films such as the double BAFTA nominee McQueen (2018), Churchill (2017), Lek and the Dogs (2017) and My Name Is Lenny (2017).
