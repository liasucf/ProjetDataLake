    "text": "The 2015 Brighton and Hove City Council election took place on 7 May 2015 to elect members of Brighton and Hove City Council in England. This is on the same day as the general election and other local elections. The election saw the Green party lose their minority control of the council. The party had gained control of the council from the Conservative party following the previous election, with the party elected on a promise to resist cuts from central government. During the administration however the council was faced with cuts of up to \u00a380 million. Other issues faced by the party included internal disputes, which had seen several attempts to remove Green party leader (and leader of Brighton & Hove Council), Jason Kitcat. In one prominent incident the Green administration faced a strike by the city's binmen, following changes to their allowances. The strike, undertaken during the summer, saw refuse go uncollected. The Green administration split over the strike, with several Green councillors (alongside Brighton Pavilion MP Caroline Lucas), including Kitcat's deputy, siding with the binmen. Following the election, the Labour Party formed a minority administration to run the council. ==Results of election== |} ==Ward breakdown== ===Brunswick and Adelaide=== Brunswick and Adelaide highlighted ===Central Hove=== Central Hove highlighted ===East Brighton=== East Brighton highlighted ===Goldsmid=== Goldsmid highlighted ===Hangleton and Knoll=== Hangleton and Knoll highlighted ===Hanover and Elm Grove=== Hanover and Elm Grove highlighted ===Hollingdean and Stanmer=== Hollingdean and Stanmer highlighted ===Hove Park=== Hove Park highlighted ===Moulsecoomb and Bevendean=== Moulsecoomb and Bevendean highlighted ===North Portslade=== North Portslade highlighted ===Patcham=== Patcham highlighted ===Preston Park=== Preston Park highlighted ===Queen's Park=== Queen's Park highlighted ===Regency=== Regency highlighted ===Rottingdean Coastal=== Rottingdean Coastal highlighted ===South Portslade=== South Portslade highlighted ===St Peter's and North Laine=== St Peter's and North Laine highlighted ===Westbourne=== Westbourne highlighted ===Wish=== Wish highlighted ===Withdean=== Withdean highlighted ===Woodingdean=== Woodingdean highlighted ==External links== *Results on council website *Results from The Argus Live Blog ==References== Category:2015 English local elections Category:May 2015 events in the United Kingdom 2015 Category:2010s in East Sussex ",
