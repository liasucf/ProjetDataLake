UMRC is also a registered charity in the United States and Canada. The founder of UMRC, Asaf Durakovic, claimed on CNN CNN, broadcast 05/02/2007, American Morning special investigation by Greg Hunter: depleted uranium hidden health risks that: \"Inhalation of uranium dust is harmful.... Even in the amount of one atom\". == Vision == UMRC states at its website that its vision for the world, \"is a full awareness of the risks of using nuclear products and by- products AND to contain the still reversible alterations of the earth's biosphere since the advent of nuclear events and the resulting contamination\". They go on to state further that: \"There needs to be an appreciation of the enormous effects and damage of uranium on the environment and human health. Governments, scientific communities, and the general public need to understand the many forms of contamination and specific effects. Continued abuses of uranium and radioisotopes will only lead to the steady degradation and eventual end of meaningful life on earth.\" www.UMRC.net == References == ==External links== * Official site * Asaf Durakovic - Interview About Depleted Uranium in Iraq, on DemocracyNow!
