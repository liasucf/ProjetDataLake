It was her first song to chart on Billboard, peaking at #37 on the Japan Hot 100. ==Critical reception== The song has received mainly positive reviews from critics, with many complimenting the song's disco- influenced feel. Olivia Forman of Spin stated that the song has a \"flawlessly fluctating [...] beat\" and additionally complimented Kimbra's vocals. Josh Brooks of Vulture Magazine proclaimed the song as \"a killer modern pop disco track\" and added that in comparison to the rest of The Golden Echo, the track is where Kimbra is at her \"grooviest\". Jake Cleland of Pitchfork praised the song but also felt that it was \"a-minute-and-a-half too long\". ==Music video== The official music video for the song was directed by Thom Kerr. Throughout the video, Kimbra is shown dancing down the sidewalk in various costumes, all designed by Australian designer Jaime Lee Major. ==Chart positions== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (2014) !Peak position |- |Japan Hot 100 Singles |align=center|37 |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2014 songs Category:2014 singles Category:Kimbra songs Category:Song recordings produced by Rich Costey Category:Song recordings produced by Kimbra Category:Songs written by Daniel Johns Category:Songs written by Kimbra Category:Songs written by Thundercat (musician) Category:Warner Records singles Category:Disco songs Category:Funk songs ",
