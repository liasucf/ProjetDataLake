Beginning in 1999, his restaurant was awarded three stars by the Michelin Guide for eighteen consecutive years. ==Biography== Waldhotel Sonnora garden Thieltges was the only child of the innkeepers Vinzenz and Maria Thieltges, who led the Pension Elisabeth in Dreis. After his apprenticeship in the Roman Emperor in Trier, he moved to the Schlosshotel Pontresina near St. Moritz in 1973, then to the Breidenbacher Hof in D\u00fcsseldorf, and in 1977, to the Bastei restaurant in Cologne. Since 1978, he cooked in the family-owned Waldhotel Sonnora, which is located in a forest on the edge of Dreis. Thieltges gave few interviews, never published a cookbook, and only wanted to concentrate on his work. At the same time, he was able to delight guests from Belgium, Luxembourg, and France. He started out with the normal program of a dining restaurant; today his cuisine is praised for the \"standards of precision\". Of his cooking he once said, \"Classical is the true art. That is the basis of everything. Modern can call anyone who wants to do something else with violence.\" Thieltges died after a brief illness, at the age of 61. ==Awards== The classic of Thieltges: Tart of beef fillet tartare with Imperial caviar * 3 Stars in Michelin Guide (Guide Rouge) * 19.5/20 points in Gault Millau (2015) * 5 points in '''' * 5 spoons in ARAL SchlemmerAtlas * 1998 \"Chef of the Year\", Gault Millau ==References== ==External links== * Waldhotel Sonnora * Who\u00b4s Who der K\u00f6che Category:German chefs Category:1955 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Place of birth missing Category:Head chefs of Michelin starred restaurants ",
