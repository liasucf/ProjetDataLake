The station airs a news-talk format and broadcasts in the Arabic, Kurdish, English, French, and Russian languages. Sample from an English-language news bulletin broadcast in April 2015 on al-Bayan Originating from Mosul, al-Bayan programs have been credited with being \"highly professional and slickly produced\" and have been compared to NPR and the BBC for tone and quality. Al-Bayan's reporting on ISIS military operations has been referenced by the Associated Press and The Washington Post'. In February 2015, ISIL captured a radio station called \"Makmadas\" in Sirte, Libya. It is unclear whether that station is still under ISIL management.

Radio Al-Tawheed (former Libyan Jamahiriya Broadcasting Corporation transmitter) have 10 kilowatts output power and is received in Europe via sporadic E propagation. The first broadcast of Al-Bayan Radio was launched in late 2014, which initially provided newscasts, then some other programs were added in April 2015. The station offers a wide range of programming including nasheed, Quran recitations, speeches, Fiqh, language instruction, and interview shows, interspersed with regular news bulletins and field reports from al-Bayan correspondents in Iraq and Syria. English-language news bulletins are delivered by an American-accented, male newsreader and datelines are read in the Islamic calendar. Known frequencies (October 2016) are: Iraq: Mosul 92.5/99.3 FM; Syria: Raqqah 99.9 FM; Libya: Darnah 95.5 FM (irregular), Benghazi 94.3 FM (irregular). The station in Mosul was reported to have gone off-air after an air strike on it in late February 2017 as part of the Battle of Mosul. Iraqi forces discovered the station in March 2017 in an upscale western Mosul neighborhood they captured. ISIS had burnt it down before fleeing. ==See also== *Dabiq Magazine *Media of Iraq ==References== == External links == * Al-Bayan Radio Archive In the arabic language.
