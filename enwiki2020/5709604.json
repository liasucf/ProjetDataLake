    "text": "The Ralja () is a river in the \u0160umadija region of Serbia. It is a 51 km long left tributary to the Jezava, which is a tributary of the Great Morava river. It also gives its name to the surrounding \u0160umadija's subregion of Ralja. The Ralja originates from the northern part of the Kosmaj mountain, north of the village of Velika Ivan\u010da, in the Sopot municipality of the City of Belgrade. Almost from the source, the river valley is a route for the Belgrade-Ni\u0161 railway. At the villages of Popovi\u0107 and Mali Po\u017earevac, the Ralja turns straight to the east for the rest of its flow and also from this point, the Belgrade-Ni\u0161 highway joins the railroad. As it flows next to the Belgrade suburbs of Dra\u017eanj, Um\u010dari and \u017divkovac, the Ralja divides the Podunavlje region from the Ralja region of the low \u0160umadija, and leaves the City of Belgrade area at the village of Malo Ora\u0161je. After the villages of Binovac, Kolari, Vrbovac and Ralja, the river separates from the highway turning north at the village of Vranovo and empties into the one of several arms of the Jezava at Smederevo's suburb of Radinac. The Ralja drains an area of 310 km\u00b2, belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin, and is not navigable. == See also == * Rivers in Serbia == References == * Mala Prosvetina Enciklopedija, Third edition (1985); Prosveta; * Jovan \u0110.
