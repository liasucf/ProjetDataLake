It is the third movie produced by the studio Lanterna Magica after How the Toys Saved Christmas and Lucky and Zorba, and it is loosely inspired by Giuseppe Verdi's opera Aida. ==Plot== Arborea and Petra are two neighbouring countries perpetually at war with one another. Only the romantic relationship between Aida, the daughter of the Arborean king, and Radames, the brave son of the high general of Petra, will change the situation. The couple's worst enemy is Ramfis, the high priest of the evil god Satam, who would like his clumsy son Kak to marry the princess of Petra (who's engaged to Radames).
