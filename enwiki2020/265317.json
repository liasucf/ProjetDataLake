He is introduced in chapter #25 , first published in Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump magazine on May 21, 1985, as Goku's fellow martial arts student under Kame- Sen'nin. As the series progresses, Krillin becomes Goku's closest ally and best friend as he fights every villain along with Goku or before him and is often depicted as the comic relief due to his baldness. == Design and appearance == Toriyama originally created Krillin along with the Tenka'ichi Bud\u014dkai as a method to help add depth to the story, as his editor Kazuhiko Torishima had stated that the series' protagonist, Goku, was too plain. Torishima explained that in order to develop Goku's characterization, they needed someone petty and mischievous to provide contrast, thus leading to the introduction of Krillin. Y\u016bsuke Watanabe, who wrote the screenplay for the film Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods, had originally written the film to take place at Krillin and Android #18's wedding, but Toriyama wrote it to take place at Bulma's birthday party. Watanabe thought Toriyama made the change because he wanted fans to imagine the wedding for themselves.DVD & Blu-ray Vision, issue #4, March 19, 2013 Toriyama cited Krillin and Bulma's older ages at the end of the manga as a reason he chose for Battle of Gods to take place after the Boo arc since they were in their \"strongest condition at that time.\"\"Akira Toriyama Interview (Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods)\". saiyanisland.com.

Toriyama once stated, seemingly humorously, that Krillin's lack of a nose is because he has a \"physical idiosyncrasy\" that allows him to breathe through the pores of his skin.
