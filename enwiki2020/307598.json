    "text": "Papabile (, also ,\"papabile\" (US) and ; ; or \"able to be pope\") is an unofficial Italian term first coined by Vaticanologists and now used internationally in many languages to describe a Roman Catholic man, in practice always a cardinal, who is thought a likely or possible candidate to be elected pope. In Italy the term has become very common and people use it for other analogous situations, too. In some cases the cardinals will choose a papabile candidate. Among the papabili cardinals who have been elected pope are Eugenio Pacelli (Pius XII), Giovanni Battista Montini (Paul VI), and Joseph Ratzinger (Benedict XVI). However, at times the College of Cardinals elects a man who was not considered papabile by most Vatican watchers. In recent years those who were elected pope though not considered papabile include John XXIII, John Paul I, and John Paul II. There is a saying among Vaticanologists: \"He who enters the conclave as pope, leaves it as a cardinal.\" This is a popular proverb in Italy as well, indicating one should never be too sure of oneself. The list of papabili changes as cardinals age. For instance, Carlo Maria Martini was thought to be papabile until he retired from his see upon reaching 75 years of age. In Italian, the word papabile is also used in non-Church contexts referring to short list candidates, i.e. those who, among the available candidates, are most likely to get elected or appointed to a specific position. ==Papabili elected pope== * Francesco Saverio Castiglioni (elected as Pius VIII in 1829) * Gioachino Pecci (elected as Leo XIII in 1878) * Giacomo della Chiesa (elected as Benedict XV in 1914) * Eugenio Pacelli (elected as Pius XII in 1939) * Giovanni Battista Montini (elected as Paul VI in 1963)Conclave A.D. 1963 - Election of Pope Paul VI.

(Although the following candidates were widely discussed as candidates publicly, the actual vote results described below are frequently based on rumours and sourced, if at all, from off-the-record reports of individual cardinals.) * Giuseppe Siri was widely expected to be elected pope in the 1958 and 1963 conclaves and continued to be a prime contender in both 1978 conclaves. On the first of these occasions, Angelo Roncalli, an utterly unexpected choice, was elected and became Pope John XXIII. *Giovanni Benelli was widely expected to be elected pope in both the August and October 1978 conclaves. In fact he was defeated in both (narrowly the second time). In August, a candidate few saw as papabile, Albino Luciani, was elected and became Pope John Paul I\u2013with the support of Benelli himself. In October, another such candidate, Karol Wojty\u0142a, was elected as John Paul II. * Rafael Merry del Val was a widely considered candidate during the conclaves of 1914 and 1922 which eventually elected Benedict XV and Pius XI respectively, although he never garnered enough votes to be in serious contention. * Bartolomeo Pacca \u2013 experienced diplomat under Pius VII, he was a candidate in 1823 and favored to win in 1829 but was vetoed by France. Cardinal Castiglioni was elected as Pius VIII. * Emmanuele de Gregorio - expected to succeed Leo XII and Pius VIII, but never did. * Mariano Rampolla \u2013 Leo XIII's Secretary of State. He was headed for victory in the 1903 conclave only to be vetoed by Krak\u00f3w Cardinal Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko on behalf of Austro-Hungarian Emperor Franz Joseph I. With Rampolla blocked, Giuseppe Sarto was elected and became Pius X. One of Pius X's first acts was to abolish the rights of states to veto. * Carlo Maria Martini \u2013 Jesuit, biblical exegete, Archbishop of Milan from 1980 to 2002. Considered to be the most likely successor to John Paul II for much of the 1980s and 1990s but was already suffering from Parkinson's disease by the time the 2005 papal conclave was convened. * Francis Arinze \u2013 speculated by some media reports as a highly favoured successor to John Paul II but did not gain a substantial number of votes in the 2005 papal conclave. ==Papabili at the 2013 conclave== The following cardinals, as noted in the cited references, were also considered papabili at the 2013 conclave, which elected Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, who took the name Francis. * Angelo Bagnasco, Archbishop of Genoa\"Choose your own pope \u2013 with our interactive Pontifficator\".
