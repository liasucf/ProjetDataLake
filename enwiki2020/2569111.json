On 1 January 2015 the former municipalities of B\u00e9vilard, Malleray and Pontenet merged to form the new municipality of Valbirse.Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 2 January 2013 ==History== Aerial view (1958) B\u00e9vilard is first mentioned in 1182 as Bevilar. In German it was known as Bewiler though this is not used currently. Very little is known about the early history of the village. During the 13th and 14th centuries the noble B\u00e9vilard family appear in a few records. Throughout much of its existence, it was owned by the Provost of Moutier-Grandval Abbey. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, B\u00e9vilard became part of the French D\u00e9partement of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, B\u00e9vilard was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. The village parish church of Saint-Georges was first mentioned in 1263. The current church building is from 1716. In 1531 the Protestant Reformation entered the village and the new faith was adopted. The church was the center of a parish that originally included B\u00e9vilard, Malleray and Pontenet. In the 18th century the municipality of Champoz joined the parish. In 1746 a filial church of the parish was established in Sornetan. The village was generally agrarian until the Basel- Del\u00e9mont-Biel railroad built a station between B\u00e9vilard and Malleray in 1877. The convenient link to the transportation network encouraged several precision machining and watch making factories to set up in the municipality. In 1882 the H\u00e9lios gear factory opened and was followed in 1915 Sch\u00e4ublin machining factory. The watch industry was a major source of income and led to a growing population in the municipality until the 1970s. Beginning in the 1970s, competition from cheaper electronic watches forced many Swiss watchmakers out of business and the population in B\u00e9vilard dropped. ==Geography== Before the merger, B\u00e9vilard had a total area of .
