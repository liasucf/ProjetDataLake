It has space for 29 patients.\"MMHI - Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center.\" Wisconsin Department of Health Services. Retrieved on September 9, 2018. The inmates at Mendota usually have anti-social personality disorders who do not feel empathy, guilt, nor remorse. It uses the Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center Program. The impetus for the facility's creation was an increase in violent crime perpetrated by minors. It was established in 1995 by two psychologists, Michael Caldwell and Greg Van Rybroek. It was deliberately staffed with psychologists instead of regular prison guards; while most facilities for delinquent and criminal youth are operated by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections, MJTC is under the health services department instead. ==References== ==External links== * Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center - Wisconsin Department of Health Services Category:Buildings and structures in Madison, Wisconsin Category:Psychiatric hospitals in Wisconsin Category:1995 establishments in Wisconsin ",
