It was issued as a non-album single. ==Recording and release== The track was engineered by Ernie Winfrey at Soundshop Studios in Nashville, Tennessee in 1974. While recording in Nashville, the band stayed at the Lebanon, Tennessee farm of Curly Putman Jr., which accounts for the song's title. Jimmy McCulloch played the guitar solo as his Wings debut. The lyrics are a source of confusion; Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd, McCartney's publisher,https://www.kobaltmusic.com/roster/all#group-P omits the third and fourth verses,https://www.songfacts.com/lyrics/paul-mccartney-wings/juniors- farm as per official lyric finder service Lyric Find.https://www.lyricfind.com/ An explanation for this could be that there was a 'DJ edit' of the song, without those verses which were controversial. The third verse allude to US President Richard Nixon's resignation over the Watergate scandal and the desire to get rid of him Mafia style, by putting his feet in concrete and dropping him in the river Thames, which is next to the British Houses of Parliament: At the Houses of Parliament, / Everybody's talking 'bout the President. / We all chip in for a bag of cement.https://genius.com/Paul-mccartney-juniors-farm-lyrics The fourth verse was more explicit, but far less extreme, it simply mocks movie legend Oliver Hardy's investment in the Del Mar Fairgrounds race track, (which was partly owned by fellow actor Bing Crosby).Del Mar Fairgrounds It is uncertain as to why McCartney chose to single out Hardy, especially as there appears to be no record of him having lost on the investment. Ollie Hardy should have had more sense. / He bought a gee-gee and he jumped the fence \u2014 / All for the sake of a couple of pence. The song continued McCartney and Wings' worldwide success after the Band on the Run album. It made number 3 in the US, number 16 on the United Kingdom charts, and was a notable hit elsewhere. The photo for the single's picture sleeve featured the members of Wings dressed in corresponding costumes from the song's lyrics (for example, Geoff Britton as a poker dealer and Denny Laine as the \"Eskimo\"). A sea lion is also mentioned in the lyrics and subsequently, an actual sea lion appears in photo, between 'farmer' McCartney and Britton. However, the photo only appeared on the picture sleeve of the single in Spain and in advertisements elsewhere. In the UK and the US, the single was released in an Apple Records company sleeve. In some other countries in Europe, a black-and-white band photo was used instead (see alternative cover). This was McCartney's last release on Apple Records before signing a solo recording contract with Capitol Records in May 1975, following the dissolution of the Beatles' partnership. ==Personnel== *Paul McCartney \u2013 vocals, bass, background vocals *Linda McCartney \u2013 keyboards, background vocals *Denny Laine \u2013 guitars, background vocals *Jimmy McCulloch \u2013 lead guitars, backing vocals *Geoff Britton \u2013 drums ==Music video== The music video of \"Junior's Farm\" shows Paul McCartney playing a Kay electric bass guitar. ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1974\u201375) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Australia KMR | style=\"text-align:center;\"|12 |- |align=\"left\"|Canada RPM | style=\"text-align:center;\"|10 |- |align=\"left\"|New Zealand (Listener) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 |- |align=\"left\"|Norway | style=\"text-align:center;\"|9 |- |South Africa (Springbok) |align=\"center\"|6 |- |align=\"left\"|UK | style=\"text-align:center;\"|16 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot 100Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20132002 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|3 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Cash Box Top 100 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|4 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1974) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank |- |Canada | style=\"text-align:center;\"|115 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1975) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank |- |Australia | style=\"text- align:center;\"|77 |- |U.S. Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|88 |- |U.S. Cash Box | style=\"text-align:center;\"|92 |} ==B-side and later release== The B-side, \"Sally G\", was also a top-20 hit on the US charts, peaking at number 17. \"Junior's Farm\" was later released on the McCartney/Wings compilation Wings Greatest in 1978 and the US version of All the Best! in 1987, although it was not on the UK edition of the latter album.
