    "text": "Enrique C\u00e1rdenas Gonz\u00e1lez (February 4, 1927 \u2013 March 1, 2018) was a Mexican politician and a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He served as Governor of Tamaulipas from 1975 to 1981 and Municipal President of Ciudad Victoria from 1968 until 1971. Nationally, C\u00e1rdenas served in the Senate of the Republic for two terms, as well as Undersecretary of Finance during the administration of President Luis Echeverr\u00eda during the 1970s. ==Life== C\u00e1rdenas was born in Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, on February 4, 1927. In the 1950s, he began his business career selling cars in Tampico and later moved to Matamoros, where he sold and repaired farm implements. His brother Jorge started a radio station, XEGW, in Ciudad Victoria in 1957. Ultimately, after working as one of its sales agents, Enrique acquired XEGW from his brother. In 1969, C\u00e1rdenas started Organizaci\u00f3n Radiof\u00f3nica Tamaulipeca, which continues to operate radio stations in Ciudad Victoria and Ciudad Mante. Separately from ORT, he also was the original owner of XEIR radio in Ciudad Valles, San Luis Potos\u00ed. In 1963, C\u00e1rdenas entered politics. His cousin, Morelos Jaime Canseco Gonz\u00e1lez, was critical in promoting him to the head of the state electoral commission. When Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz left the Federal Electoral Commission to run for president, Luis Echeverr\u00eda took his place, starting a friendship that would catalyze C\u00e1rdenas's political career. In 1968, with Echeverr\u00eda as Secretary of the Interior, he intervened to have C\u00e1rdenas be named the mayor of Ciudad Victoria. However, he would only serve in that post for a year before being named to the first of two Senate stints. C\u00e1rdenas promoted Tamaulipas's agricultural sector during his tenure as governor from 1975 to 1981 through his program called Revoluci\u00f3n Verde, or Green Revolution. The initiative led to the modernization of Tamaulipas's agriculture industry, including an increase in land clearing and tillage for farming. Tamaulipas became known as one of the \"granaries of Mexico\" as a result of the state programs. Enrique C\u00e1rdenas died at his home in Ciudad Victoria at 3:00 a.m. on March 1, 2018, at the age of 91. He was survived by his wife, Bertha del Avellano, the former First Lady of Tamaulipas, and their five children - Laura, Jos\u00e9, Enrique C\u00e1rdenas del Avellano (PRI politician), Eduardo, and Alejandro. ==References== Category:1927 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Governors of Tamaulipas Category:Senators of Mexico Category:Mayors of places in Mexico Category:Institutional Revolutionary Party politicians Category:People from Ciudad Victoria ",
