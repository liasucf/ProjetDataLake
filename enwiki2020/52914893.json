He is now mainly known for his reproductive prints after master paintings and various publications containing portraits of prominent persons.Franciscus van der Steen at the Netherlands Institute for Art History No known paintings are currently attributed to him.Miroslav Kindl, Die niederl\u00e4ndischen K\u00fcnstler der zweiten H\u00e4lfte des 17. Jahrhunderts in Diensten der F\u00fcrsten von Liechtenstein in Feldsberg (Valtice), in: Liechtensteinisch-Tschechische Historikerkommission (Hrsg.), 'Die Liechtenstein und die Kunst' Band 3, Vaduz, HWFL, 2014, pp. 172-173 ==Life== Franciscus van der Steen is believed to have been born in Antwerp somewhere between 1615 and 1635. In the guild year 1638-39 he registered as a pupil of the engraver Alexander Voet the Elder in the registers of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke.The Netherlands Institute for Art History entry on the artist incorrectly states that the landscape painter Jacques Backereel was his master. Jacques Backereel was the master of a Franciscus van der Steen II, not the Franciscus van der Steen who is the subject of this article. The master of Franciscus van der Steen was in fact Alexander Voet the Elder, see: Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde Volume 2, Antwerp, 1864, p. 174, pp. 105, 144, 202 and 296 He became a master in the Antwerp Guild in the guild year 1643-1644. He is one of the Flemish and Dutch artists, such as Nikolaus van Hoy, Jan Anton van der Baren and Jan van Ossenbeeck, who followed Archduke Leopold Wilhelm, the art loving governor of the Southern Netherlands, upon his return to Vienna in 1656. Shortly after his arrival in Vienna in 1656, van der Steen asked the court chancellery for court quarters (i.e. accommodation) and in the same year he was appointed court etcher to Emperor Ferdinand III with an annual income of 1200 gulden. This sum was reduced to 800 gulden the following year.Guido Messling, Point of View #14 at the Kunsthistorisches Museum Portrait of Emperor Ferdinand III, after Jacob Toorenvliet Franciscus van der Steen operated a workshop in Vienna. On 8 January 1662, van der Steen signed his name in the ecclesiastical registers of the Schottenkirche (Scottish church) in Vienna as he, together with the Flemish painter Jan de Herdt, acted as a witnesses at the wedding of the Dutch landscape painter Hans de Jode. Van der Steen and Jan de Herdt later collaborated on a series of aristocratic portraits for the publication Historia di Lepoldo Cesare.Miroslav Kindl, Jan de Herdt, Nizozem\u00ed, It\u00e1lie, st\u0159edn\u00ed Evropa, diploma work for Palack\u00fd University in Olomouc, Department of History of Art, promoter: Dr. Ladislav Daniel His compatriot, the landscape painter Renier Meganck, joined his workshop around 1670. In 1671 Meganck acted as a witness and sealed the last will of Franciscus van der Steen. Van der Steen died not much later in early 1672. ==Work== Franciscus van der Steen is principally known as a reproductive engraver who made engravings after old masters and contemporary artists. The archival sources also show him in the role of a painter. The Liechtenstein books of accounts record that van der Steen was paid 465 gulden for paintings in August 1665, 120 gulden in September of the same year and a further 34 gulden and 30 kreutzer for five more paintings in July 1667. No paintings are currently attributed to van der Steen.
