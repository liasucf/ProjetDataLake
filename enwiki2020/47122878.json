Aboard a ship in an unknown location a single crewman is hunted and seemingly killed by the Librarian. Back at school, Pete and Luther are cornered by Paul and his friends in the bathroom; Luther at first takes the beating from Paul until Paul mentions Petra. Luther responds with a single punch that shatters Paul's jaw and disgusts everyone else. A few weeks later, Luther returns to the school after being suspended for the punch. Paul again tries to pick a fight. Uncharacteristically, as he stops Paul from going after Pete, Luther starts having visions of him starting a school massacre with just his bare hands. After relaxing and letting Paul go on his way, he begins to notice he is starting to see people as their musculature, but it appears to stop.
