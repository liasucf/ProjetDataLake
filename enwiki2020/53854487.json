    "text": "Since the 1968 Summer Olympics did not feature tennis as an official sport, two unofficial tournaments were held during the Games: a Demonstration tournament and an Exhibition tournament. The Demonstration tournament was played from 14 to 20 October 1968 at three venues in Guadalajara, Mexico: Guadalajara Country Club, Atlas Sports Club and Guadalajara Sports Club; all of them featured clay courts. All matches were played at best-of-three sets; since the tiebreak rule wasn't implemented until the 1970s, a player had to win a set by a two-game margin in case of a 6\u20136 draw. West German Helga Niessen won the tournament by defeating American Peaches Bartkowicz 6\u20134, 6\u20133 in the final. Another American, Julie Heldman, won the third place. ==Seeds== Both seeds received a bye into the quarterfinals. ==Draw== Bronze Medal Match ==References== ==External links== * Official Results Archive (ITF) Demonstration Category:Women's events at the 1968 Summer Olympics Olym ",
