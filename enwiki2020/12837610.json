    "text": "The Roman Catholic Diocese of Laval (Latin: Dioecesis Valleguidonensis; French: Dioc\u00e8se de Laval) is a Roman Catholic Latin Rite diocese in France. The episcopal see is Laval Cathedral in the city of Laval. Created in June 1855, the diocese was originally erected from the Diocese of Le Mans, and corresponds to the department of Mayenne. Under the Ancien R\u00e9gime the diocese of Mans had an Archdeacon of Laval, whose responsibilities extended over the deaneries of Ern\u00e9e, \u00c9vrun, Laval and Mayenne.L\u00e9on Ma\u00eetre, Dictionnaire topographique du D\u00e9partement de la Mayenne (Paris: Imprimerie nationaloe 1878), p. vii. The diocese is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Rennes, Dol, and Saint-Malo. The current bishop is Thierry Scherrer, appointed in 2008.Dioc\u00e8se de Laval, Biographie de Mgr Scherrer, retrieved: 2017-05-14. On 10 April 2017 he announced the first diocesan synod ever to be held in Mayenne, to commence on 23 May.Dioc\u00e8se de Laval, Un synode pour le Dioc\u00e8se de Laval, retrieved: 2017-05-14. In 2013 there was one priest for every 1,780 Catholics. ==History== At the beginning of the Revolution, the Constituent Assembly decided that the number of dioceses in France was excessive, and that approximately fifty of them could be eliminated. Those that survived would have their boundaries changed to coincide with new departmental subdivisions of France. This was contrary to Canon Law, which reserved the creation and suppression of dioceses, as well as the appointment and transfer (translation) of bishops to the Pope. In creating the new department of Mayenne, the French government produced a territory in which there was no established bishopric. The very large former diocese of Mans (now called Sarthe) was divided, and the western half given to the diocese of Mayenne, situated at Laval. A new Metropolitanate was created (the M\u00e9tropole du Nord-Ouest), with its center at Rennes, embracing the department-dioceses of Ille-et-Vilaine, C\u00f4tes du Nord, Finist\u00e8re, Loire-Inf\u00e9rieure, Maine-et-Loire, Mayenne, Morbihan, and Sarthe.Pisani, p. 125. In March 1791 the electors of the Department of Mayenne met to elect a constitutional bishop. These electors did not need to be active members of the Roman Catholic Church, nor even Christians. The election, therefore, was blasphemous and schismatic. The office of bishop was first offered to Abb\u00e9 de Vauponts, the Vicar General of the (former) diocese of Dol. After some hesitation, he refused, and won a commendation from Pope Pius VI. On 20 March, the electors then turned to Father Noel-Gabriel-Luce Villar, a native of Toulouse and teacher of rhetoric at the Coll\u00e8ge de Toulouse, and then principal of the Coll\u00e8ge de la Fl\u00e8che.Bouiller, pp. 34-38. He was consecrated in Paris by the Constitutional Bishop Jean-Baptiste Gobel on 22 May 1791.Tableau, p. 22. Pisani, pp. 142 and 457. Gobel had been consecrated titular Bishop of Lydda in 1772, and therefore the consecration of Villar was valid, though uncanonical and schismatic.Pisani, p. 53. The new bishop returned to Laval, and was installed in the church of la Trinit\u00e9, which served as a cathedral for the Constitutionals. Only twnety-two ecclesiastics signed the record.Bouiller, p. 38. Villar participated in the Legislative Assembly, and voted King Louis XVI guilty, though not requiring the death penalty. In 1794, when Reason replaced Religion in France, he abandoned his ecclesiastical activities and no longer said Mass. He did not resign his bishopric, however, until 3 October 1798, under pressure from his Metropolitan, Bishop Le Coz.Pisani, p. 143. He died on 26 August 1826.Tableau, p. 22. In October 1798 Bishop Le Coz was able to authorize an election, by the priests of Mayenne, to provide a successor to Bishop Villar. They chose Charles Fran\u00e7ois Dorlodot (or D'Orlodot), the cur\u00e9 of the church of S. V\u00e9n\u00e9rand in Laval, and Bishop Le Coz confirmed the election on 6 February 1799. Dorlodot was consecrated at Laval by Le Coz and the constitutional bishops of Saint-Brieuc and Vannes on 7 April 1799. He took part in the provincial council held by Le Coz in Rennes, and then in the national council held in Paris in 1800.Pisani, p. 145. On November 29 1801, by the bull Qui Christi Domini, Pope Pius VII suppressed all of the Roman Catholic dioceses in France, and reinstituted them under papal authority. The Constitutional Diocese of Mayenne (Laval) was ignored by the Vatican, which had played no part in its existence. In 1802 the French government suppressed the diocese of Mayenne (Laval),Bouiller, pp. 363-368. and Dordolot was named a Canon of Mans. He continued to reside in Laval, however, and found employment as librarian of the \u00c9cole Central until 1810, when he followed his patron Le Coz to Besan\u00e7on.Boullier, p. 372. He died in Besan\u00e7on on 3 January 1816.Pisani, p. 146-147. In 1846 the creation of the new diocese was decided upon, but was not carried out until after the death of Bishop Jean-Baptiste Bouvier of Le Mans on 29 December 1854. A Bull of Pope Pius IX, June 30, 1855, established the See of Laval. The apologist Emile Bougaud was consecrated Bishop of Laval in February 1888, and died a few months later. The request of the Holy See in 1904 for the resignation of Bishop Pierre-Joseph Geay (1896-1904) was one of the reasons assigned by the French Republic for breaking with the pope and preparing the separation of Church and State. In August 1859 Bishop Casimir-Alexis-Joseph Wicart held a diocesan synod in the \u00e9glise S. Michel in Laval. Bishop Grellier held a synod in November 1913. == Bishops of Laval == * Casimir-Alexis-Joseph Wicart - (1855\u20131876) L'\u00e9piscopat fran\u00e7ais..., pp. 286\u2013287. * Jules-Denis-Marie- Dieudonn\u00e9 Le Hardy du Marais - (25 June 1876 \u2013 1886)Le Hardy was born in Valenciennes in 1833.
