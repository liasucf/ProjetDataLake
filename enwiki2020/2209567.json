Often caused by nativization, it is a type of epenthesis, most commonly vocalic epenthesis. Paragoge is particularly common in Brazilian Portuguese, not only in loanwords but also in word derivation. It is also present in the accents of many Brazilians while speaking foreign languages such as English.Paragoge and degree of foreign accent in Brazilian English Some languages have undergone paragoge as a sound change, and modern forms are longer than the historical forms they are derived from. Italian sono 'I am', from Latin sum, is an example. Sometimes, as above, the paragogic vowel is an echo vowel. ==In loanwords== Some languages add a sound to the end of a loanword when it would otherwise end in a forbidden sound. Some languages add a grammatical ending to the end of a loanword to make it declinable. ===Examples=== *English rack \u2192 Finnish r\u00e4kki; *English gal \u2192 Japanese \u30ae\u30e3\u30eb (gyaru); ====Grammatical endings==== *English computer \u2192 Latvian kompj\u016bters; *Ottoman Turkish (rak\u0131) > South Slavic rakia. ==References== ==Sources== *Crowley, Terry.
