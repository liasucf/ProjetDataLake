    "text": "Sankey railway station, also known as Sankey for Penketh, is a railway station in the west of Warrington, Cheshire, England, serving the Great Sankey, Penketh and Whittle Hall areas of the town. The station, and all trains serving it, are operated by Northern Trains. It is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building. ==Facilities== The main station building is the original (dating from the opening of the line in 1874) and of a standard style used by the Cheshire Lines Committee. It is used as a booking office and waiting room, though part of the building is a house and another part disused. Passengers have little shelter available when the main building is closed and seats are only available on the Manchester bound platform, which has recently had a shelter installed. The station is staffed on Monday to Saturday mornings (from start of service until 14:30). At other times you must buy a ticket from the machine on the Liverpool bound platform. There is a car park outside and the former goods yard has been used for building houses. The station was upgraded in May 2013 with automated announcements and in 2016, digital information screens were added. Step-free access is available to both platforms.Sankey station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 12 December 2016 ==Services== Prior to the opening of the nearby Warrington West, Services departed Sankey for Penketh approximately hourly in each direction; however since the opening of the new station Sankey for Penketh now only has two services a day in each direction, one in each direction in the morning 07:45 (Towards Liverpool Lime Street) and 08:20 (Towards Manchester Oxford Road) and one in each direction in the evening 17:52 (Towards Manchester Oxford Road) and 17:57 (Towards Liverpool Lime Street).
