    "text": "Yusuf Khan (also spelled Yusof Khan), was a Safavid gholam and official of Armenian origin, who served as the governor of Astarabad (1604), Shamakhi (1610-?), and Shirvan (1610\u20131624) during the reign of king Abbas I (r. 1588\u20131629). Originally a Christian, Yusuf was first employed in the royal mews, and because of his apparent skill in handling and hunting birds and animals, he was soon given the rank of \"master of the hunt\" (m\u012br shek\u0101r- b\u0101shi). Thereafter, he became governor of Shirvan and Shamakhi. When Abbas I decided to marry his granddaughter to Semayun Khan (Simon II) in 1624, Yusuf Khan was ordered by Qarachaqay Khan, likewise of Christian Armenian origin and a childhood friend, to host the banquet in the first term of the wedding party. Yusuf Khan was murdered on the orders of Murav Beg (Giorgi Saakadze), after the latter decided to conspire with the Georgian rebel leaders. ==Sources== * * * * * Category:17th-century deaths Category:Persian Armenians Category:Ghilman Category:Safavid governors of Astarabad Category:Safavid governors of Shamakhi Category:Safavid governors of Shirvan Category:Ethnic Armenian Shia Muslims Category:Armenian former Christians Category:Masters of the hunt of the Safavid Empire Category:17th-century people of the Safavid Empire Category:Converts to Shia Islam from Christianity ",
