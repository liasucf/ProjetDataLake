    "text": "The protected areas of the Sierra Nevada, a major mountain range located in the U.S. states of California and Nevada, are numerous and highly diverse. Like the mountain range itself, these areas span hundreds of miles along the length of the range, and over 14,000 feet of elevation from the lowest foothills to the summit of Mount Whitney. The Sierra Nevada, as a natural region, does not have exactly defined borders. In particular, to the north, there is a wide transition zone where the Cascade Range and the Sierra Nevada meet. As a result, it is difficult to delineate a border between these two mountain ranges. This list uses the common definition of the Sierra Nevada as the mountain range extending from Fredonyer Pass in the north to Tehachapi Pass in the south. It is also difficult to delineate between the Sierra Nevada mountains, the range's foothills, and the Central Valley; this article also considers any elevated and hilly terrain east of the flat Central Valley to be part of the range. Areas outside those bounds may also be included if they are widely associated with the Sierra Nevada. ==National parks and monuments== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" !scope=\"col\" | Name !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| Image !scope=\"col\" | Location !scope=\"col\" | Establishedhttps://web.archive.org/web/20120311003821/http://home.nps.gov/applications/budget2/documents/chronop.pdf !scope=\"col\" | Areahttps://www.nps.gov/subjects/lwcf/upload/NPS- Acreage-12-31-2019.pdf !scope=\"col\" | Elevation !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description |- ! style=\"background:palegreen\" | Kings Canyon National Park | 200px | 33 miles east of Sanger.

A number of streams and springs counterbalance the otherwise dry and rocky nature of the landscape. |- !Desolation Wilderness |200px |El Dorado County | January 1, 1969 |https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/ltbmu/recarea/?recid=11786 | https://www.sierrawild.gov/wilderness/desolation/ | Located west of Lake Tahoe, the Desolation Wilderness is said to be the most visited wilderness area in the United States on a per-square-mile basis. Mount Tallac soars 3,500 feet over Lake Tahoe, providing commanding views of the lake and its basin. Aloha Lake is a unique environment, with the jumbled terrain of the area producing a highly irregular lake with countless small islands. With more than 130 lakes in only 100 square miles, water is everywhere in this wilderness - additionally, on the highest peaks, snowpack can persist well into the summer. Between the numerous lake basins are dozens of barren granite peaks that characterize the desolation for which the wilderness is named. |- !Dinkey Lakes Wilderness |200px |Fresno County | September 28, 1984 | |https://wilderness.net/visit-wilderness/?ID=159 | Northwest of Courtright Reservoir, this densely forested area is home to over a dozen significant lakes. Steep yet rounded granite monoliths, including the Three Sisters peak at over 10,000 feet, rise from rugged plateaus dotted with lakes, meadows, and rocky outcroppings. |- !Domeland Wilderness |200px | Tulare and Kern counties | 1964 | https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/sequoia/recarea/?recid=79565 | | The southern end of the Kern Plateau is home to numerous granite domes, including the notable Church Dome, that host scenic views of the surrounding semi-arid, lightly wooded landscape. Vegetation is characterized by pinyon-juniper pine on the highlands of the plateau, grading to sagebrush scrub in the desert below. |- !Emigrant Wilderness |200px |Tuolumne County | 1975https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/stanislaus/recarea/?recid=15107 | | | Emigrant Wilderness is northwest of Yosemite.

Its northeast region is volcanic with peaks forming part of the Sierra crest. Meadows with stands of trees and granite outcrops have been compared to Yosemite \"in miniature\".https://rootsrated.com/stories/yosemite-s-little-sister-exploring- the-rarely-visited-domeland-wilderness |- !Golden Trout Wilderness |200px |Tulare and Inyo counties | 1978https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/inyo/recarea/?recid=21878 | | https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd531555.pdf | Golden Trout Wilderness marks the southernmost extent of ice in the Sierra Nevada during the Last Glacial Period. It spans the Kern River, and its larger eastern portion includes the Kern Plateau, which is drained by the South Fork Kern River. |- !Granite Chief Wilderness |200px |Placer County | 1984https://www.sierrawild.gov/wilderness/granite-chief/ | https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/ltbmu/recarea/?recid=11819 | | The headwaters of the American River rise in the highlands to the west of Granite Chief, a highly prominent peak that also overlooks the Squaw Valley ski area to the east. The Five Lakes Basin, accessible by day hike from a trailhead near Alpine Meadows, is a popular area that is also traversed by the Pacific Crest trail. The forest is dominated by lodgepole and red fir at upper elevations, and a more varied mixture of conifers and deciduous trees at the lower elevations around 5,000 feet. French Meadows, in the northwest of the wilderness area, is further protected as a game refuge.https://wilderness.net/visit-wilderness/?ID=214 |- !Hoover Wilderness |200px | Mono County | 1931https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/inyo/recarea/?recid=21879 | | https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/htnf/home/?cid=stelprdb5238673 | Northeast of Yosemite National Park, the Sierra Nevada descends steeply to its eastern base along the western edge of the Great Basin. The sparsely forested terrain, featuring scattered stands of hemlock, pine, aspen, and cottonwood, affords wide open views across the mountains and meadows. |- !Ishi Wilderness |200px |Tehama County |1984 | |https://www.calwild.org/deer-creek- trail/https://www.summitpost.org/ishi-wilderness/290043 |Named for the last California Native American to make contact with white society, this wilderness area protects the historic homeland of the Yahi Yana people. In contrast to other Sierra wilderness areas, most of which protect either the alpine and subalpine country along the crest or the high desert to the east, this wilderness area is unique in that it protects the lower-elevation foothills of the western slope. The landscape, which receives plentiful winter and spring rainfall, consists mainly of parallel creeks in densely wooded valleys divided by east-west ridges. Numerous volcanic features dot the area including caves and lava plugs. The Ishi Wilderness is the winter home of California's most numerous migratory deer herd. |- !Jennie Lakes Wilderness |200px |Tulare County |1984 | |https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/sequoia/recarea/?recid=79914 |This small wilderness area is home to two main lakes, Jennie Lake (for which it is named) and Weaver Lake.

In addition to the two main lakes, there are half a dozen smaller lakes at elevations ranging up to over 9,000 feet. The area is home to upper montane forest typical of the upper middle elevations of the Sierra Nevada. |- !John Krebs Wilderness |200px |Tulare County |March 30, 2009https://www.nps.gov/seki/learn/news/john-krebs- wilderness-dedication.htm | |https://wilderness.net/visit-wilderness/?ID=728 |Mineral King, a subalpine glacial valley, forms the headwaters of the East Fork Kaweah River. The mountain summits flanking the valley reach over 11,000 feet, more than two-thirds of a mile above the valley floor. High cliffs line the faces of the high peaks, giving way to rocky slopes immediately below and eventually to forested, gently sloping hillsides. At the bottom of the valley is a lush meadow and wetland habitat fringing the river. The valley has narrowly escaped large-scale development a number of times, most notably a Disney proposal for a ski area and year-round family resort. The creation of the wilderness area protected Mineral King from such developments indefinitely into the future. |- !John Muir Wilderness |200px |Fresno, Inyo, Mono, and Madera counties |January 1, 1964 |https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/inyo/recarea/?recid=21875 |https://wilderness.net/visit-wilderness/?ID=278 |The John Muir Wilderness stretches along the Sierra crest for 90 miles. Mount Whitney, at 14,505 feet, is the tallest summit in not only the Sierra Nevada but also the entire contiguous United States. Mount Williamson, the second highest peak in the Sierra Nevada, rises straight from the Owens Valley floor more than two miles below. The Palisade Glacier is the southernmost glacier in the U.S., and its namesake peak, North Palisade, is a famous rock climbing destination. The John Muir Trail and Pacific Crest Trail run for a great distance through this wilderness area. In addition to the long and narrow section along the crest, this wilderness area also covers some lower-elevation terrain in the western Sierra north of Kings Canyon National Park. |- !Kaiser Wilderness |200px |Fresno County |1976https://wilderness.net/visit-wilderness/?ID=286 | |https://www.air- resource.net/COHA/web/state_analysis/California/KaiserWA_metdesc.html |North of Huntington Lake, Kaiser Peak crowns a high massif separated from the main body of the High Sierra by the canyon of the South Fork San Joaquin River. From the lake's north shore, the ridge rises gently amidst dense stands of coniferous forest, culminating at the subalpine zone near the summit. On the north side of Kaiser Peak, the terrain plunges steeply into the deep canyon far below. |- !Kiavah Wilderness |200px |Kern County |1994 |https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fsbdev3_058992.pdf | | The Scodie Mountains, a low mountain range located at the far southeasternmost extent of the Sierra Nevada, are protected by this wilderness area. These mountains are quite arid, generally receiving only 10 to 15 inches of rainfall-equivalent precipitation per year. As a result, this area contains features of both the Sierra Nevada and Mojave Desert ecosystems, forming a sort of transition zone at the edge of the desert. The driest locations are home to desert vegetation such as sagebrush, creosote, and Joshua trees, and the bajadas at the foot of the mountains are home to desert animals including numerous lizards and the yellow-eared pocket mouse. In areas that receive somewhat greater rainfall, vegetation common to the drier parts of the Sierra, such as pinyon, juniper, canyon oak, and grey pine predominate.https://www.sierrawild.gov/wilderness/kiavah/ |- !Mokelumne Wilderness |200px |Alpine, Amador, and Calaveras counties |1964 | | |Round Top, a geologic remnant of a former volcano, is the highest point in the wilderness, rising to the south of Carson Pass and overlooking several major V-shaped canyons to the south that cut through the heart of the wilderness. Most notable among those canyons is that of the Mokelumne River. Along the banks of that river deep in its canyon, the outlaw Monte Wolfe lived off the land in isolation for years after numerous run-ins with the law. Mokelumne Peak, an isolated peak deep in the wilderness, rises nearly a mile from the canyons below and features commanding views that reach from Round Top all the way to Mount Diablo. |- !Monarch Wilderness |200px |Fresno County |1984 |https://wilderness.net/visit-wilderness/?ID=365 |https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/sequoia/recarea/?recid=79913 | Encompassing over 9,000 feet of vertical relief, the Monarch Wilderness extends from steep chaparral canyonlands at its lowest to rugged subalpine peaks at its highest. Split in half by a road in Kings Canyon national park, the wilderness spans both walls of the deep Kings River canyon. The high country is home to a number of groves of giant sequoias.https://www.sierrawild.gov/wilderness/monarch/ |- !Mount Rose Wilderness |200px |Washoe County, Nevada |1989 |https://wilderness.net/visit- wilderness/?ID=396 |https://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/cs/recarea?ss=110308&navtype;=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid;=FSE_003738&navid;=110240000000000&pnavid;=110000000000000&position;=generalinfo&recid;=11768&ttype;=recarea&pname;=Mt.%20Rose%20Wilderness | Mount Rose, the highest peak in the Carson Range, sits at the center of the high country of this range, a spur of the Sierra Nevada which projects into Nevada and wraps around Lake Tahoe across the lake from the main body of the Sierra. The peak offers views of the Reno-Sparks-Carson City metropolitan area in the Truckee Meadows to the east. This wilderness area receives heavy use due to its proximity to a number of cities, but in addition to the popular trails it protects areas deeper in the backcountry which see far fewer visitors.https://wilderness.net/visit-wilderness/?ID=396 |- !Owens Peak Wilderness |200px |Kern and Tulare counties |1994https://www.sierrawild.gov/wilderness/owens-peak/ | | | At nearly 8,500 feet, Owens Peak is the highest point in a cluster of subsidiary ranges at the interface between the Mojave Desert and the bulk of the Sierra Nevada. Receiving only light use, this area remains relatively pristine. It is a haven of ecological diversity, and is home to a number of notable large fauna such as the black bear, mule deer, golden eagle, mountain lion, and prairie falcon. In addition to the widespread sagebrush and pinyon-juniper woodland, two plant species are also noted as local to the area: the Nine Mile Canyon phacelia and the monkey flower.https://www.sierrawild.gov/wilderness/owens-peak/ |- !Owens River Headwaters Wilderness |200px |Mono County |March 31, 2009https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/inyo/recreation/recarea/?recid=21881 | | |The uppermost headwaters of the Owens River, which goes on to flow through the desert valley that shares its name, are protected by this relatively new wilderness area.San Joaquin Mountain, rising over 11,500 feet above sea level to be the highest peak in the area, overlooks the surrounding wilderness below. This mountain, though, is part of a relatively low section of the Sierra Crest, allowing enough moisture to spill over for dense conifer forests to grow. https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/inyo/recreation/recarea/?recid=21881 |- !Sacatar Trail Wilderness |200px |Inyo and Tulare counties |1994https://www.sierrawild.gov/wilderness/sacatar-trail/ | | | The Sacatar Trail, a long-since disused wagon train trail, cuts through this wilderness area at the interface between the Sierra Nevada and the Mojave Desert. Wide valleys and rugged peaks characterize the topography of the area. Canyons and gullies present habitats for riparian plant life such as cottonwoods and willows, subsisting on the spring-fed creeks that flow down from the mountains. The area is home to diverse wildlife including such notable species as the golden eagle and the mule deer.https://wilderness.net/visit- wilderness/?ID=508 |- !Sequoia-Kings Canyon Wilderness |200px |Fresno and Tulare counties |1964https://www.nps.gov/seki/planyourvisit/wilderness.htm | | |This wilderness area incorporates all undeveloped areas of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. It contains many ecosystems in its 13,000 feet of elevation span, ranging from chaparral foothills to the towering summit of Mount Whitney, the roof of the Sierra. Parts of three Wild and Scenic Rivers flow through the wilderness: the Kern River, the South Fork Kings River, and the Middle Fork Kings River. |- !South Sierra Wilderness |200px |Tulare and Inyo counties |1984 | |https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/inyo/recarea/?recid=21882 |This wilderness area covers the southernmost part of the Sierra Nevada that contains peaks reaching above the tree line, most notably Olancha Peak, the highest point in the wilderness area at 12,123 feet. This area contains two areas with very different characteristics. The western part, making up most of its area, feeds the headwaters of the South Fork Kern River, has considerable tree cover, and has a gentle landscape by Sierra standards, taking the form of a gently rolling high plateau with wide meadows filling the valleys in between isolated mountain peaks. The eastern part is diametrically opposite, with sheer cliffs, deep canyons, and barren treeless desert slopes characterizing the terrain in which the Sierra Crest drops over a vertical mile to the Owens Valley in the space of only a few horizontal miles. Kennedy Meadows is a popular jumping-off point for visitors to this wilderness area.https://wilderness.net/visit- wilderness/?ID=569 |- !Yosemite Wilderness |200px |Madera, Mariposa, Mono, and Tuolumne counties |1984https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/yosemitewilderness.htm |https://wilderness.net/visit-wilderness/?ID=662 |https://wilderness.net/visit-wilderness/?ID=662 |All undeveloped areas of Yosemite National Park, comprising 94 percent of the park's total area,https://wilderness.net/visit-wilderness/?ID=662, are designated as wilderness. This area contains most of Yosemite's high country, including all of the scarcely-visited northern half of the park, on the far side of the Grand Canyon of the Tuolumne. These areas, while mostly lacking the striking relief of Yosemite Valley (which is located outside the wilderness area), still contain numerous geologically interesting landscapes, and with diverse environments ranging from mid-elevation meadows in the northwest to Mount Dana, whose summit is the highest point in the park at over 13,000 feet. |- |} ==Other federal protected areas== * Blue Ridge National Wildlife Refuge * Jawbone\u2013Butterbredt Area of Critical Environmental Concern * The Red Hills of Tuolumne County Area of Critical Environmental Concern ==State parks== * Burton Creek State Park * Calaveras Big Trees State Park * D.
