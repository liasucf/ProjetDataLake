Market penetration in Portugal is around 50% although Portugal has the distinction of being one of the few European countries to have coverage in virtually the entire territory. There are several service providers offering ADSL, fiber and wireless services in Portugal to the residential and the professional markets. The majority of the residential market is split between the two larger operators: Portugal Telecom and Sonae. The current maximum speed for home Internet plans in Portugal is 1 Gbit/s, available on special request, and 360 Mbit/s is widely available together with television and telephone services. ===Portugal Telecom=== A former monopoly, Portugal Telecom is still the largest telecommunications company in the country. Due to its previous monopoly status its copper landline infrastructure covers all territory, making it the only operator that can offer direct service anywhere in the country. Portugal Telecom uses different brands to segment their ADSL service, among others SAPO for the residential market and Telepac for the small business market. In November 2006 Portugal Telecom announced their ADSL2+ service, adding a 24 Mbit/s speed grade service to their market offer and effectively catching up to competitor Sonaecom that had been offering ADSL2+ speed grades for several months. Portugal Telecom was also the first to deploy fiber in the country, being that ZON, Vodafone and Sonae followed with their deployment after being denied access to Portugal Telecom's infrastructure. ===Sonae=== Sonaecom started operations in 1999, soon after the government opened the telecommunications market to competition. The company started by renting Portugal Telecom's lines in order to offer their voice service to customers, but soon started laying their own infrastructure and can now offer direct service in the main metropolitan areas. Sonaecom also uses different brands to segment their ADSL offer, these include Optimus Clix for the residential market and Novis enabling the company to offer Triple Play services to customers in select areas. Taking advantage of the increased bandwidth provided by their ADSL2+ network, Sonaecom announced in June 2006 the launch of their IPTV service, SmartTV. ===Other ADSL and fiber providers=== * Vodafone * ZON Multim\u00e9dia ==Cable== ===Cable service providers=== * Cabovis\u00e3o * ZON Multim\u00e9dia ==Internet censorship and surveillance== Internet access in Portugal is not restricted.\"Portugal\", Freedom in the World 2013, Freedom House.

There are neither government restrictions on access to the Internet nor reports that the government monitors e-mail or Internet chat rooms without appropriate legal authority.
