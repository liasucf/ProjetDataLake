Gahota is controlled by the devil's henchman, Ajay, who has been granted the ability to control the minds of people in Gahota by the devil himself. Preparing for the devil's birth, Ajay removes anyone who comes in the way by murdering the person. Eventually, the devil is born in the form of Rahul/Ajinkya.

Everyday three trains stop at Gahota and many people disembark but since the last couple of months no one is seen boarding the trains. Gahota's bird sanctuary is host to migratory birds during winters but not a single bird has arrived this year. A frantic Pratap (Shishir Sharma), who lives in Gahota is trying to contact his daughter but telephone lines are not working. Pratap's daughter Sheela (Iravati Harshe), who is an air hostess, meets her school friend Ratan (Zafar Karachiwala), at the Mumbai airport. Pratap rushes to receive his friend Avinash (Ravindra Mankani), a police officer, at the railway station and briefs him about strange things happening in Gahota. Some days back a bank manager slit his wrists, a woman murdered her husband and an ex-army officer killed his family and himself for no apparent reason. Avinash thinks that Pratap is overreacting. He confronts local Police Inspector Vanshi who denies that any such incidents happened at all. Avinash enquires the kin of victims and they all say that the victims are fine and alive. Avinash is convinced that Pratap has gone crazy but Pratap insists that everyone is lying. === Episode 2 === Ratan asks Sheela out to dinner. Sheela accepts and books a trunk call to Gahota. Still trying to convince Avinash, Pratap tells him that he has taken pictures of the incidents. Pratap takes Avinash to Regent Photo Studio whose owner Balram is his friend. Balram hands over the developed photos to Pratap but they are not the ones Pratap had handed over to him four days back. Furious, Pratap dashes into the dark room where he is restrained and roughed up by Avinash who is frustrated with him. Later at Pratap's home, Avinash goes through the photos and discovers that they were taken on that day and not four days back. Avinash visits the photo studio in a taxi and asks the driver to wait for him. Balram's assistant confesses that he switched them as directed by Balram. A black car (Hindustan Contessa) is seen moving through Gahota mysteriously at night with the devil's symbol. It bumps the taxi and engraves the symbol on it. The taxi driver becomes possessed and cuts the fuel line. Avinash returns and a scuffle ensues between him and the taxi driver. A match is thrown from inside the black car which ignites the fuel trail. The taxi driver is seen laughing hysterically as Avinash kills him. The taxi then blows up killing Avinash. Inspector Vanshi orders the locals to remove the evidence and book a return ticket for Avinash from Gahota. Pratap watches all this and flees from Gahota in his car with Inspector Vanshi pursuing him. Pratap's car runs out of fuel and he stops at a petrol pump. He calls his daughter Sheela, informing her that he is coming to meet her in Mumbai and cautions her not to come to Gahohta ever, even for his funeral were he to die. === Episode 3 === Malini is returning from office at night. She stops at a red light. She starts day dreaming about a man (Pratap), surrounded by policemen, facing a black car with headlights on, pleading to let him go. ==Awards == Indian Telly award for Best horror programme of the year in 2003. ==References == Category:Psychological thrillers ",
