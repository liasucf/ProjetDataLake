This term came into being in the context of the escalating conflicts on issues of sovereignty between Vietnam and China over the South China Sea in the 21st century. The term uses the name of a historic victory with the ironic implication that in an actual naval battle, the Vietnamese navy will defeat Chinese navy. ==Background== During the First Indochina War, a Vietnamese struggle for independence f the Battle of Dien Bien Phu took place in 1954. This victory was of great importance and deep meaning, marking the greatest victory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam during the First Indochina War. The Vietnamese victorious, the French were defeated and signed the Geneva Agreement, leaving Vietnam. In December of 1972, the United States Air Force bombed North Vietnam. This was the largest bombardment of U.S. air forces in North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The bombing ended on December 30, when the United States agreed to sign the Paris Agreement to leave the war. This event was broadcast in Vietnam using the iconic \"battle of Dien Bien Phu on sky\" to emphasize its ultimate and grandiose significance. Over two years later, Vietnam reunited. ==Usage== Currently, a formal war between Vietnam and China has not yet taken place in the South China Sea, the battle can be considered a strategic decision so it has not happened yet. The historian D\u01b0\u01a1ng Trung Qu\u1ed1c first mentioned this in an interview with the media on 14 May 2014: \"Will Dien Bien Phu not only in the war but also in peace time. I give the biggest lesson of Dien Bien Phu is the will to self-determination but still know take the resources of present time, in other words, the support of our friends in the world, when our goals are righteous and righteous. And in the end all the wars we have covered our goal is to reach the goal we desire, to fight in the blood, to be peaceful in our independence and territorial integrity in order to harmonize with all nations. Talk about Dien Bien Phu (1954) do not forgot effort of the Independent State of Vietnam has done its utmost to mobilize peace, avoid bloodshed (1945-1946). For more than four months in France to mobilize peace and when forced to hold guns, we remember the opening sentence of the Call for National Resistance (20-12-1946): \"We want peace, we was has been conciliatory, but ... We certainly do not expect any more Dien Bien Phu in battle on sea or on land. Like our ancestors, we are always looking forward to harmonizing with the whole world, especially with China, \"bordering mountains, bordering rivers, bordering seas\" but if we are forced to do so, we will do what our's father did.\" The term is also used by author Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0169 M\u1ed9c Thi\u00eang, director of a travel business company in Ho Chi Minh City, the article was published in the May 27, 2014 edition of Thanh Ni\u00ean News. \"On the surface, the Vietnamese lack of cooperation, or self-interest, seem to endure, but when the country be invade, they are differents. Those who wish to go to war, but if they are put on the same line, the Vietnamese will continue writing the history of our's country. Dien Bien Phu (land) in 1954 and \"Dien Bien Phu in the air\" in 1972. The Vietnamese people are preparing their spirits and will, if necessary, to spend \"Dien Bien Phu on the sea\", breaking the extravagant ambition of the Great Han Dream, wanting the hegemony of the East Sea.\" ==References== Category:Disputed territories in Southeast Asia Category:First Indochina War Category:Political history of Vietnam Category:Political history of China ",
