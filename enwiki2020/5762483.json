    "text": "\"Waterfalls\" is a Paul McCartney ballad from his first solo album after Wings, McCartney II. The song has a minimalist sound, with McCartney only playing a Fender Rhodes electric piano and a synthesizer and singing, and a short solo performed on acoustic guitar. \"Waterfalls\" was released as a single with \"Check My Machine\" as its B-Side and reached chart position in the UK. In the US, however, it was his first single ever to miss the Billboard Hot 100 chart, only reaching despite being the follow-up to the hit \"Coming Up\".Chip Madinger & Mark Easter, Eight Arms To Hold You: The Solo Beatles Compendium (Chesterfield, MO: 44.1 Productions, 2000), 250. In 2013, Rolling Stone rated it the all-time Paul McCartney post-Beatles song, describing how it contrasted with Wings' prior single. Billboard Magazine described \"Waterfalls\" as having \"a subtle oriental flavor\" and \"appropriately sparse\" instrumentation, and described McCartney's vocal performance as \" inimitable\" and \"creamy.\" When questioned on singles he wished were more successful, McCartney stated, \"There's quite a few, actually. ... 'Waterfalls', I think is nice.\" He also commented that TLC's single \"Waterfalls\" carries elements of his song. == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- ! style=\"width:18em;\"| Chart (1980) !
