    "text": "Alex Z\u00fclle (born 5 July 1968) is a Swiss former professional road bicycle racer. During the 1990s he was one of the most successful cyclists in the world, winning back-to-back in the 1996 and 1997 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a, taking second place in the 1995 and the 1999 Tour de France. He was world time-trial champion in Lugano in 1996. ==Biography== ===Early career=== Z\u00fclle (centre) during the amateur race at the 1990 UCI Road World Championships Z\u00fclle was born and brought up in Wil in the canton of St. Gallen, son of a Swiss father, Walter Z\u00fclle and Wilhelmine, from Brabant, Netherlands. As a child he wanted to be a skier but at 18 he was injured in an accident. He began cycling in the Netherlands for rehabilitation before giving up because it was too windy. His father, having bought cycling equipment, persuaded him to give cycling another go when they returned to Switzerland. After several years as a successful amateur, Z\u00fclle turned professional in 1991. He approached the former sporting director of the Swiss team, Helvetia, Paul K\u00f6chli, but K\u00f6chli signed Laurent Dufaux instead. Z\u00fclle then approached Manolo Saiz, but was rebuffed because, among reasons, he did not contract riders who wore earrings. Eventually, Saiz softened and Z\u00fclle rode for ONCE as a stagaire or apprentice in the Volta a Catalunya. He attacked frequently and finished third. Saiz relented and Z\u00fclle signed his first professional contract in September 1991. He remained with ONCE until 1997. Most of its riders were Spanish. Z\u00fclle spoke only Swiss- German when he joined but at the end of the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a he answered journalists in Spanish. ===Festina affair=== In 1998, Z\u00fclle joined Festina. The team was banned from the 1998 Tour de France amid doping allegations which later became known as the Festina affair. Five Festina riders including Z\u00fclle admitted taking EPO. Z\u00fclle said he took it to satisfy his sponsors. He also said he was deprived of his spectacles during the police interview. On 28 November 1998, Z\u00fclle's haematocrit was found to be 52.3%, 2.3% over the limit. ===1999-2004=== His career coincided with that of Miguel Indurain, five-times Tour de France winner. Z\u00fclle was second in the Tour in 1999. He also won the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a and Tour de Suisse, and stages in the Giro d'Italia. Following financial problems for his employer, Team Coast, Z\u00fclle transferred to on 27 March 2003 in a rare mid-season switch. Z\u00fclle retired in 2004, and held a party for his fans in Wil in October that year. ==Career achievements== ===Major results=== ;1992 : 1st 20px Overall Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme : 1st 20px Overall Vuelta a Asturias : 1st 20px Overall Vuelta a Burgos : 1st Escalada a Montju\u00efc ;1993 : 1st 20px Overall Paris\u2013Nice ::1st Stage 1 & 8 : 1st Chur-Arosa : 1st Josef Voegeli Memorial : 2nd Overall Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a ::1st Stage 1, 6 & 21 : 3rd Overall Tour of the Basque Country ;1994 : 4th Overall Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a ;1995 : 1st 20px Overall Tour of the Basque Country ::1st Stage 3 & Stage 5b : 1st 20px Overall Vuelta a Valencia ::1st Stage 2b : 1st Challenge Mallorca : 1st Stage 16 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a : 2nd Overall Tour de Suisse ::1st 20px Points classification ::1st Stage 1 & 6 : 2nd Overall Tour de France ::1st Stage 9 : 2nd Overall Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme ::1st Stage 5b : 2nd Overall Euskal Bizikleta ::1st Stage 4b : 3rd Overall Paris\u2013Nice ;1996 : 1st 20px Time trial, UCI Road World Championships : 1st 20px Overall Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a ::1st Stage 15 : 1st 20px Overall Volta a Catalunya ::1st Prologue, Stages 3 & 6 : 1st 20px Overall Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme ::1st Stage 3 & 5b : 1st GP Miguel Indurain : 1st Prologue Tour de France : 2nd Overall Euskal Bizikleta ::1st Stage 4b ;1997 : 1st 20px Overall Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a ::1st Stage 21 : 1st 20px Overall Tour of the Basque Country ::1st Stage 5b : 2nd Overall Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme : 2nd Milano\u2013Torino : 3rd La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne ;1998 : Giro d'Italia ::1st Prologue, Stages 6 & 15 : 1st Stage 21 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a : 2nd Overall Tour de Romandie ::1st Stage 4b : 3rd Overall Tour of the Basque Country : 3rd Overall Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme : 4th Overall Paris\u2013Nice ;1999 : 1st Stage 13 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a : 2nd Overall Tour de France ;2000 : 1st 20px Overall Volta ao Algarve : 1st Stage 1 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a ;2001 : 1st Stage 4 Paris\u2013Nice ;2002 : 1st 20px Overall Tour de Suisse ::1st Stage 1 : 2nd Overall Tour de Romandie ::1st 20px Points classification ::1st Stage 4 & 5 ====General classification results timeline==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |colspan=15 align=\"center\"|Grand Tour general classification results |- ! scope=\"col\" | Grand Tour ! scope=\"col\" | 1991 ! scope=\"col\" | 1992 ! scope=\"col\" | 1993 ! scope=\"col\" | 1994 ! scope=\"col\" | 1995 ! scope=\"col\" | 1996 ! scope=\"col\" | 1997 ! scope=\"col\" | 1998 ! scope=\"col\" | 1999 ! scope=\"col\" | 2000 ! scope=\"col\" | 2001 ! scope=\"col\" | 2002 ! scope=\"col\" | 2003 ! scope=\"col\" | 2004 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | alt=A pink jersey Giro d'Italia | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 14 | DNF | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | alt=A yellow jersey Tour de France | \u2014 | DNF | 41 | style=\"background:#ddf;\" |8 | style=\"background:#ddf;\" |2 | 26 | DNF | DNF | style=\"background:#ddf;\" |2 | DNF | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | alt=A yellow jersey/alt=A gold jersey Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a | \u2014 | DNF | style=\"background:#ddf;\" |2 | style=\"background:#ddf;\" |4 | 20 | style=\"background:yellow;\" |1 | style=\"background:yellow;\" |1 | style=\"background:#ddf;\" |8 | 37 | 49 | 109 | \u2014 | DNF | \u2014 |- |colspan=15 align=\"center\"|Major stage race general classification results |- !
