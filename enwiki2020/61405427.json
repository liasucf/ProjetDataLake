All matches are also shown live on the Kayo Sports and Rugby.com.au streaming platforms. ==Experimental Law Variations== Two new trial variations were included for the 2019 NRC. * A 50:22 kick, whereby a team kicking the ball indirectly into touch (i.e. not on the full) is awarded the resulting lineout throw if the ball is kicked: (a) from within the team's own half and finds touch in the opposition's 22; or (b) from within the team's own 22 and finds touch in the opposition's half. * A goal line drop-out, awarded to the defending team if an attacking player brings the ball into the in-goal and is held up. {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Existing Law of the Game !style=\"width:35%;\"|Variation |- |Television Match Official / Global law trial: Law 5 |Television match official to only be consulted about tries and in-goal plays. |- |Conversion: Law 8 : Sanction: Kick is disallowed. |Time limit reduced to 60 seconds for conversion kicks. |- |Penalty goal: Law 8 : Sanction: Kick is disallowed and a scrum is awarded. |Time limit reduced to 45 seconds for penalty kicks. |- |During a maul: Law 16 : Sanction: Penalty. |Greater policing of this law, in order to discourage \"hold up tackles\", by ensuring that the tackler, who holds up a ball carrier in an effort to form a maul, does not collapse the maul as soon as it has formed. |- |Quick throw: Law 18 |Players will be allowed to take quick throw-ins regardless of whether someone else has touched the ball |- |style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|Lineout: Law 18 |For a 50:22 kick, where the team in possession kicks the ball indirectly into touch from either: (a) within their own half to find touch in the opposition's 22; or (b) from within their own 22 to find touch in the opposition's half; then the throw in to the resulting lineout is awarded to the kicking team at the location where the ball reached the touchline. |- |Location of a penalty or free kick: Law 20 |Increased latitude will be given to where penalty and free kicks are to be taken |- |Ball held up in-goal: Law 21 |Play restarts with a goal-line drop out awarded to the defending team. Rationale: To reward good defence and promote a faster rate of play. |- |Competition rule - Bonus point awarded for scoring 4 tries |Bonus point awarded if a winning team scores at least 3 more tries than its opponent. This particular system was first used in the French professional leagues during the 2007\u201308 northern hemisphere season. |} == Regular season == The eight teams competed in a round-robin tournament for the regular season. During this section of the competition, teams also played for the Horan-Little Shield, a challenge trophy put on the line when a challenge is accepted by the holders or mandated by the terms of the competition. The regular season standings were determined via a slightly modified version of the standard competition points system\u2014 the same system as was used for The Rugby Championship and Super Rugby\u2014with a bonus point awarded to a winning team scoring at least 3 more tries than their opponent; and a bonus point awarded to a losing team defeated by a margin of 7 points or under. Four points were awarded for a win and none for a loss; two points were awarded to each team for a draw. Each team's placement was based on its cumulative points total, including any bonus points earned. For teams level on table points, tiebreakers apply in the following order: # Difference between points for and against during the season. # Head-to-head match result(s) between the tied teams. # Total number tries scored during the season. The top four teams at the end of the regular season qualified for the title play-offs in the form of semi-finals followed by a final to determine the champion team. ===Standings=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
