MS-04 was the 133rd flight of a Soyuz spacecraft. The crew consisted of a Russian commander and an American flight engineer. It was the first of the Soyuz MS series to rendezvous with the Station in approximately 6 hours, instead of the 2 day orbital rendezvous used for the previous launches. It was also the first Soyuz to launch with only 2 crew members since Soyuz TMA-2. ==Crew== ===Backup crew=== Due to a decision to cut down the number of participating Russian astronauts in 2017, only two astronauts were launched on Soyuz MS-04. Originally set to include 3 people, the crew assignments were changed in November 2016 by NASA and Roscosmos. ==Original Crew== Alexander Misurkin and Mark Vande Hei were reassigned to Soyuz MS-06 and served as part of Expedition 53/54,http://www.russianspaceweb.com/soyuz-ms-06.html Nikolai Tikhonov was reassigned to Soyuz MS-10 to serve as part of Expedition 57/58 although was also pulled of that mission due to the same budget cuts.https://www.americaspace.com/2018/05/30/no-u-s-crew-will-command-the- international-space-station-in-2019/ ==External links== ==References== Category:Crewed Soyuz missions Category:Spacecraft launched in 2017 Category:2017 in Russia Category:Spacecraft launched by Soyuz-FG rockets Category:Spacecraft which reentered in 2017 ",
