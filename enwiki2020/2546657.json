    "text": "Mental Notes is the 1975 debut album by New Zealand art rock band Split Enz. The album cover was painted by band member Phil Judd. Original vinyl copies featured Judd saying \"Make a mental note\" in the runout groove of the record's second side, causing the phrase to be looped ad infinitum on manual turntables until the stylus is removed. ==Recording== Chunn later complained about the \"totally unsympathetic treatment we'd had when we were recording in Australia. The engineer in Sydney thought we couldn't tune our guitars and that we were unprofessional and he just showed total disinterest right through.\" == Track listing == * These songs were re-recorded for the Second Thoughts album. \u2020 This version has Phil Judd singing lead vocals. An earlier version (found on The Beginning of the Enz) recorded in 1974 has Tim Finn singing lead. == Personnel == === Split Enz === * Timothy Finn \u2013 vocals, piano * Philip Judd \u2013 vocals, acoustic and electric guitars, mandolin * Jonathan Michael Chunn \u2013 bass, piano on 'Titus' * Noel Crombie \u2013 percussion * Emlyn Crowther \u2013 drums * Eddie Rayner \u2013 organs, synthesizers, piano, clavinet, mellotron, electric piano * Wally Wilkinson \u2013 lead guitar * David Russell \u2013 bass on 'Maybe' https://web.archive.org/web/20061230010245/http://www.radionz.co.nz/nr/programmes/enzology/ep02 * Robert Gillies \u2013 trumpet on \"Maybe\", saxophone on \"129 (Live)\" and \"Lovey Dovey (Live)\" === Production === * Engineered by Richard Batchens * Produced by: David Russell and Split Enz * Recorded at Festival Studios, Studio 24, May/June 1975 * Tapes and Equipment: Murray Ward * Artwork: Graeme Webber * Cover painting by Phil Judd === Special Thanks to === * Robert Gillies * Geoffrey Chunn * Peter Madill * James Farrell * David Russell * Miles Golding == History and features == The album was a moderate success on its release in July 1975.
