    "text": "Lau Chin-shek (born 12 September 1944 in Guangzhou, Guangdong with family root in Shunde, Guangdong) is the President of the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions and a vice Chairman of the Hong Kong Christian Industrial Committee. He was born in Guangzhou and had a secondary school education. He was a member of the Legislative Council from 1991 to 2008. ==Background== Lau smuggled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong in 1960. Since the 1980s, he has been a labour activist, working to help factory workers in Sham Shui Po and Cheung Sha Wan, where working conditions were poor. During the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Lau and other pro-democracy activists expressed sympathy and support to the student demonstrators who had gathered at Tiananmen Square. He and others also founded the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organises the anniversary commemoration of the 1989 protests. In 1990, Lau and other labour activists, including Lee Cheuk-yan, established the 160,000-strong Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions. Lau ran in the Hong Kong legislative elections in 1991, and was elected. Lau was re-elected four times. Lau was a lawmaker continuously from 1991 to 2008, except he resigned in 1994 but elected again in 1995, a brief period during 1997 and 1998 when the sovereignty of Hong Kong was transferred to the People's Republic of China, and the Legislative Council temporarily became a Provisional Legislative Council which was filled with people indirectly hand picked by Beijing. In recent years, however, Lau has moderated his stance against Beijing. He was expelled from the Democratic Party (Hong Kong) in 2000 because of having an identity of two parties. Once branded subversive by the central authorities, Mr Lau had been barred from entering mainland China for more than a decade. In May 2000, after quiet lobbying by Hong Kong top leaders, he was allowed to make a low-key visit to Guangzhou to see his ailing mother. Since then, he has been urging his pro-democracy colleagues to have \"better communication with the Central Government\" and visit mainland China and see for themselves the changes that are taking place in the country. Lau lost his seat in the Legislative Council in the Legislative Election of 2008 with only 5.1% or 10,553 votes. On a radio program in September 2008, he announces that he has been diagnosed with colorectal cancer. He says the cancer is under control. ==External links== *Lau Chin-shek's website *Hong Kong Legislative Council's website on Lau Chin-shek *Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions' election campaign website Category:Hong Kong justices of the peace Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong Category:Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions Category:Politicians from Guangzhou Category:Hong Kong trade unionists Category:Democratic Party (Hong Kong) politicians Category:The Frontier (Hong Kong) politicians Category:United Democrats of Hong Kong politicians Category:HK LegCo Members 1991\u20131995 Category:HK LegCo Members 1995\u20131997 Category:HK LegCo Members 1998\u20132000 Category:HK LegCo Members 2000\u20132004 Category:HK LegCo Members 2004\u20132008 ",
