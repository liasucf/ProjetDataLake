    "text": "Lammert van Raan (born 3 February 1962) is a Dutch politician currently serving as a member of the House of Representatives. Previously, he served as member of the water board of Amstel, Gooi and Vecht and the municipal council of Amsterdam. In 2015, Van Raan joined the States-Provincial of North Holland, where he served as member until his election to the House of Representatives in 2017. Van Raan, born in a family of entrepreneurs, originally supported the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, but after his wife, Lieke Keller, co-founded the Party for the Animals (PvdD), he got more involved with left- wing politics and eventually joined the PvdD. A key reason for this switch was global warming, saying: \"We're messing up the Earth, but I stay optimistic.\" == References == == External links == Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century Dutch politicians Category:Members of the Provincial-Council of North Holland Category:Members of the House of Representatives (Netherlands) Category:Municipal councillors of Amsterdam Category:Party for the Animals politicians Category:People from Harlingen, Netherlands ",
