Members can either do reciprocal exchanges or non-reciprocal exchanges with guestpoints. They earn points by hosting other members, and they can use those to stay at other homes. In order to finalize a reciprocal exchange, members need to activate their annual membership of \u20ac130 per year for unlimited exchanges. ==History== In 2011, the company was founded as GuestToGuest by Emmanuel Arnaud and 22 families experienced in home exchange.
