The bayonet of the Mauser Model 1895 could be fitted on it. It used the standard tangent leaf rear sight. The Model 1910 features a rarely-used Mauser invention, patented in 1898: the bolt head enveloped the cartridge case, leaving only the cartridge rim visible. It made the rifle more complex. == Service == Costa Rica ordered the Model 1910, chambered in 7\u00d757mm Mauser. 5,000 were produced by the Mauser Oberndorf plant (Waffenfabrik Mauser-Oberndorf a/n) between 1911 and 1913.

In Yugoslavian service, the rifle was called Pu\u0161ka 7 mm M 10 and saw further service during World War II. Some were shortened and rechambered in 7.92\u00d757mm Mauser as Pu\u0161ka 7,9 mm M 10C. The German captured by Nazi Germany were respectively designated Gewehr 221 (j) and Gewehr 291/.
