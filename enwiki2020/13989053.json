Middle Kanawauke was built in 1916 by damming Stillwater Creek. It was used by the Brooklyn Boy Scouts, who erected six camps and built the White Bar trail system centered on the lake.*Myles, William J., Harriman Trails, A Guide and History, The New York-New Jersey Trail Conference, New York, N.Y., 1999.
