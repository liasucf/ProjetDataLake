    "text": "The barred bichir, armoured bichir, bandback bichir, or banded bichir (Polypterus delhezi) is an elongated fish found in the Congo River, specifically in the upper and middle portions. This species is one of the more commonly available in commercial pet stores. == Introduction == Barred bichir (Polypterus delhezi) Polypterus delhezi, otherwise known as the barred bichir, armoured bichir, or banded bichir, is a species of fish belonging to the class Actinopterygii, or the ray-finned fish, which constitute an order of the class of the bony fish. \u201cActinopterygians, or ray-finned fish, are the largest and most successful group of fish and make up half of all living vertebrates\u201d. == Description == P. delhezi is greyish in color, and specks of yellow or green coloration have also been observed. Compared to the dorsal side, the ventral surface seems to be lighter in color. It is a rather unique species from a notably old group of fishes, possessing several traits than set them apart from their close relatives. \u201cThe dorsal fin is very distinct in its shape, made up of a series of individual spines. They have a mostly cartilaginous body, like a shark\u2019s, and the primitive shape of its jawbones, more like a salamander\u2019s than a fish\u2019s.Barred Bichir Polypterus Delhezi | Aquatropic, www.aquatropic.com/news/barred-bichir-polypterus-delhezi. Another notable characteristic of P. dellhezi is its modified swim bladder. In bony fish, the swim bladder is an internal, gas-filled chamber, an organ that likely evolved to help fish control their buoyancy and stay at their preferred water depth. In P. delhezi, the swim bladder also functions as a type of lung. The swim bladder is divided into 2 parts, of which the right hand section is considerably larger. \u201cThis functions as an accessory breathing organ and means the fish can survive out of water for some time, provided it is kept moist\u201d.Barred Bichir Polypterus Delhezi | Aquatropic, www.aquatropic.com/news/barred-bichir-polypterus-delhezi. For this reason, Polypterus is the only known vertebrate to have a lung, but no trachea. Another aspect of the barred bichir, which illuminates its primitive lineage and surviving characteristics, are its scales. Scales vary significantly in shape, size, and consistency, and the morphology of fish scales can generally be used to identify the species of fish that it came from. Its scales are primitive as well, each being covered with \u2018ganoin\u2019, a substance with similarities to tooth enamel\u201d.Anderson PS, Friedman M, Brazeau MD, Rayfield EJ. Initial radiation of jaws demonstrated stability despite faunal and environmental change. Nature. 2011; [PubMed] Similar to the type of scales found in sturgeons, paddlefishes, gars, and bowfin, bichirs also share the trait of ganoid scales. Deriving from cosmoid scales, they are thicker compared to other types of scales and consist of a layer of dentine and ganoine, an inorganic bone salt. They also connect with peg-and-socket like joints, thus ganoid scales do not overlap with each other. \u201cEach scale is shaped like a rhombus and is non\u00acoverlapping with those surrounding it\u201d Helfman, G. 1997. The Diversity of Fishes. Malden, Mass.: Blackwell Science.. P. delhezi also belongs to the \u201cupper-jawed\u201d subclass of Polypterus, meaning that its upper jaw protrudes out farther than the lower jaw. \u201cThe cleaver- shaped cheek and maxilla (upper external jaw bone) bears an uncanny resemblance to early ray-finned fishes, suggestive of a shared primitive condition for bony fishes\u201d.Anderson PS, Friedman M, Brazeau MD, Rayfield EJ. Initial radiation of jaws demonstrated stability despite faunal and environmental change. Nature. 2011; [PubMed] Again, this jaw shape reiterates the bichir\u2019s eating capabilities and diet, which includes smaller animals capable of being sucked into their mouth.

Nature. 2011; [PubMed] Barred Bichir Polypterus Delhezi | Aquatropic, www.aquatropic.com/news/barred-bichir-polypterus- delhezi. == Diet == A nocturnal species, P. delhezi relies significantly on their sense of smell, rather than their poor sense of sight when it comes to hunting and locating food. In the wild, the barred bichir will hide during the day, only emerging at night to hunt prey. \u201cTheir diet is entirely carnivorous and includes more or less anything which can be sucked into their mouths, including small fishes, insects, and worms\u201d.Barred Bichir Polypterus Delhezi | Aquatropic, www.aquatropic.com/news/barred-bichir-polypterus-delhezi. This preference for a meaty diet can be observed in both wild species as well as in those kept as aquatic pets, in which shrimp, prawn and mussels have been noted as the favored prey. == Habitat == The barred bichir was first discovered in the Congo River, and is commonly found especially in the upper and middle portions of the Congo River. Although only found in nature in this small region of Central Africa, this species has been bred in captivity and has become a common fish for aquariums or aquarists. ==References== Category:Polypteridae Category:Fish described in 1899 ",
