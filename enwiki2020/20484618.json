    "text": "It's What I Do is the title of the fifth studio album released by American country music artist Billy Dean. It was his first album since Men'll Be Boys two years previous. This was also his first release for Capitol Records Nashville, as the Nashville division of Liberty Records had been merged into Capitol. The album produced three singles: the title track at #5, followed by \"That Girl's Been Spyin' on Me\" at #4 and \"I Wouldn't Be a Man\" at #45. (The latter was originally a Top Ten country hit for Don Williams, in 1987.) The album also reunited him with Tom Shapiro, who had co-produced his first two albums. ==Track listing== #\"It's What I Do\" (Tom Shapiro, Chuck Jones) \u2013 3:22 #\"That Girl's Been Spyin' on Me\" (Shapiro, Max T.
