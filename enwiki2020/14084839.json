The Thun-based Br\u00fcgger & Thomet (B&T;) company provided its client with both a weapon and a special round, with the added benefit of compatibility with a wide array of lethal and less-lethal ammunition produced in the low-velocity class. ==Design== The GL06 is a stand-alone shoulder-firing weapon intended for military and police applications. A special \"less-lethal\" version of GL06 was produced as the LL06. Although the LL06 was marketed as a variation of the GL06, the only difference is the bright yellow color of the frame, compared to the standard black of the GL06. Both weapons are fully capable of firing a complete range of lethal and less-lethal 40\u00d7 ammunition. The GL06 is lighter and more compact than other stand-alone weapons of the same class (such as the US M79 or German HK69A1), yet it is capable of greater accuracy, tactical flexibility and has good ergonomics. ==Production== The GL06 is also produced by four different manufacturers around the world. ==Users== * :Lanceur de balles de d\u00e9fense LBD 40.
