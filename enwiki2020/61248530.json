The principal Native-American tribe which inhabited southeastern Arizona were the Chiricahua Apaches. They called themselves the Chiricahua Apache (Apache: great mountain) after their former mountain home in southeast Arizona. Their own name true name is actually the Aiaha.Chiricahua Apache TribeNATIVE AMERICAN/APACHES HISTORYHISTORY OF WILLCOX, ARIZONA, AND ENVIRONS ==Apache Wars== Compared to the other tribes in Arizona, the Chiricahua tribe were the most warlike. Among their leaders were Cochise, Victorio, Loco, Chato, Naiche, and Geronimo. The Chiricahua were involved in the so-called \u201cIndian Wars\u201d now referred to as the Apache Wars of the 1860s and 1870s. Some historians believe a misunderstanding during the \u201cBascom Affair\u201d launched clashes with the Chiricahua. Cochise was the Apache chief during the Apache Wars, he led an uprising against the U.S. government which began in 1861, and persisted until a peace treaty in 1872.Orlando Bolivar Willcox In 1872, President Ulysses S. Grant sent General Oliver Howard, as a special commissioner, to Arizona. Howard together with Tom Jeffords, a trusted friend of Cochise, met with the Chiricahua Chief. Their meeting concluded in an agreement to cease hostilities with the understanding that Cochise would use his influence with the other Chiricahua Apaches to this end. By the autumn of this year more than 1,000 of the tribe were settled on the newly established Chiricahua Reservation, southeast Arizona. Cochise died in 1874. Cochise County was named after the Chiricahua Apache Chief and the land where he is buried is now the Chiricahua National Monument. In 1878, General Orlando Bolivar Willcox assumed command of the Department of Arizona during the last years of the Apache Wars. ==Willcox is established== General Orlando Bolivar WillcoxWarren Baxter EarpWilliam \"Bill\" Downing In 1880, the small town of \"Maley\" was founded as a whistlestop for the Southern Pacific Railroad. A whislestop is a train station where a train will stop only on request; that is, only if there are passengers or freight to be picked up or dropped off.Whistle-stop The station was an important supply point for the Army during the Apache Wars from 1880 to 1886. It was also important to the cattle ranching and mining industries of southeastern Arizona as a major shipping point. General Willcox remained in his post until 1882. The citizens of the town of Maley renamed the town in his honor, however, his surname was misspelled and instead of being spelled with two \"L\"s it was spelled with one, hence \"Wilcox\". In 1889, the correction of the town's name was made and therefore \"Wilcox\" finally became \"Willcox\". In the early years, Willcox was a town with many saloons and hotels. There were shootings practically every week in Willcox and its surrounding area. Two of the more notable shootings involved Warren Earp in 1900 and Bill Downing in 1908.young.html Warren Earp -- A Young Bully Died YoungDowning tops Willcox bad man list Warren Baxter Earp, the youngest of the Earp brothers, was ill-tempered. He wasn't in town during the OK Corral gunfight, but he did participate in Wyatt Earp's revenge where many cowboys were murdered. Earp lived in Willcox. He disliked a fellow ranch cowboy named Johnny Boyett. He habitually bullied Boyett for months past. Earp and Boyett ran into each other in the \"Headquarters Saloon\" and Earp challenged Boyett to fight to the death. Boyett got a gun from the Willcox Hotel, and charged after Earp. After missing a few times, Earp was mortally wounded. Bill Downing was a member of the Burt Alvord gang. The gang was caught and arrested in Pearce after robbing the Cochise Train Depot. They were held in the prison of Tombstone. Members of the gang that were not arrested went to Tombstone and rescued the gang members in jail, but left Downing in jail because they disliked him. After spending seven years in the Yuma prison, Downing went to Willcox and opened the Free and Easy Saloon. He hired prostitutes who picked pocketed the customers. The town Sheriff and his Deputy went to the bar to serve Downing a warrant for his arrest. Downing dashed out a back door, but found himself face to face with the Deputy who had a shotgun. Downing reached for his gun and the Deputy shot him dead. What Downing didn't know is that he didn't have his gun because one the prostitutes stole it before he went out. The town celebrated when they learned of his death. Both Earp and Downing were buried in the historic \"Old City Cemetery\" of Willcox.Eagle Scout Project of Willcox Historical Cemetery The Pioneers' Cemetery Association (PCA) defines an \"historic cemetery\" as one which has been in existence for more than fifty years.Known Burial Sites in Arizona ==Sulphur Springs Valley Historical Society== The mission of the Sulphur Springs Valley Historical Society is to preserved and displayed historical items related to the cultural history of Willcox and its surrounding area.Sulphur Springs Valley Historical Society The historic building known as \"The Toggery\", is an extension of the Chiricahua Regional Museum and contains the research library and museum archives.

The cabin, built in 1880, is also among the oldest surviving log cabins in the region. Ja Hu Stafford was a pioneer settler who was born in Davidson County, North Carolina, to John Wesley and Clementine Reid Stafford. Stafford found the Chiricahua Mountain area to his liking and built a log cabin which was a small 14 square foot structure made with unpeeled logs, suggesting that it was built in a hurry. A second log room about the same size as the first was added sometime before 1885, followed by a small wooden-frame addition on the backside of the house around 1898. He dug an irrigation system which provided water for his fruit orchard.Library of Congress Ja Hu received his homestead certificate on April 6, 1886.
