    "text": "Theobald II ( or Thi\u00e9baut; 1263 \u2013 13 May 1312) was the Duke of Lorraine from 1303 until his death in 1312. He was the son and successor of Frederick III and Margaret, daughter of King Theobald I of Navarre. ==Life== In 1298, he took part in the Battle of G\u00f6llheim, near Speyer, in which the king of Germany, Adolph, was killed fighting his rival, Albert of Habsburg. Theobald was on Albert' side, despite the history of support for the legitimate emperors (which Adolph aspired to be) in the history of his family. In 1302, Theobald and his son, Frederick, were supporting Philip IV of France, at the Battle of the Golden Spurs at Kortrijk, where the Flemings defeated the French chivalry under Robert II of Artois. He was present also at the Battle of Mons- en-P\u00e9v\u00e8le in 1304, where the French king personally led the army in a less decisive battle. He, along with John II, Duke of Brabant, and Amadeus V, Count of Savoy, were sent to negotiate peace with Flanders. In 1305, he was at Lyon, at the crowning of Pope Clement V. When Clement imposed a tax, a tenth-part, on the clergy and charged the duke to collect it, Theobald successfully met the opposition of Renaud de Bar, bishop of Metz. ==Family== A contract for the marriage of Theobald II, Duke of Lorraine and Isabel de Rumigny was signed in April 1270. On 23 May 1278, he married Isabelle, lady of Rumigny (b. 1263 \u2013 d. 1326), daughter of Hugh, lord of Rumigny, and Philippine d'Oulche. They had: *Frederick (b. 15 April 1282 - d. 21 April 1329), his successor in Lorraine. *Matthias (died c. 1330), lord of Darney, Boves, Blainville, and Florennes, married Mathilde of Flanders. *Hugh (d. after 20 March 1337), his successor in Rumigny, Martigny, and Aubenton. *Mary (d. after 1344), married (1324) Guy de Ch\u00e2tillon (died 1362), lord of La F\u00e8re-en-Tardenois and had one child. *Margaret (d. 1348), married (c. 1311) Guy de Dampierre, count of Zeeland and later married (1313) Louis V, de Looz & Chiny. *Isabella (died 1353), married \u00c9rard de Bar (died 1337), lord of Pierrepont and had six children. *Philippine, nun ==See also== *Dukes of Lorraine family tree ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:Dukes of Lorraine Category:1263 births Category:1312 deaths ",
