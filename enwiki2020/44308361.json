Emmanuel currently lives and works in Johannesburg.\"Featured Artist: Paul Emmanuel\" . FNB Joburg Art Fair. == Artwork== === Artistic practice === Paul Emmanuel is an artist and printmaker who employs various media including photography and film, to address issues of identity, particularly as a white male living in post-apartheid South Africa.\"Paul Emmanuel Transitions || Biography\". The content of his oeuvre deals with a construct of gender, memory and loss. Emmanuel was professionally trained as a printmaker, specialising in lithography. Emmanuel employs his perceptual and technical skills to create photo-realistic drawings. In his drawings he employs a technique using a blade to scratch into the surface of exposed photographic paper and removes layers of the surface revealing tones in the paper in his drawing. His approach is from dark to light. Emmanuel has produced a non-narrative award-winning experimental film artwork.\"Featured Artist: Paul Emmanuel\" . FNB Joburg Art Fair, 16 August 2011. === Major projects === ==== Transitions ==== Transitions is the artist's project comprising an internationally touring museum exhibition of drawings and a short film (3SAI: A Rite of Passage). As well as suite of maniere noir lithographs titled \"Transitions Multiples\" exhibited in 2011 at Goya Contemporary Gallery, Baltimore and as the featured exhibition on the 2011 FNB Joburg Art Fair. Transitions explores liminal moments in shifting white male identity, memory and loss.\"Artslink.co.za \u2013 SA artist launches Transitions in Germany\". Artslink. The Transitions Project comprises the following three elements: #Transitions \u2013 an internationally touring museum solo exhibition comprising a series of five original drawings obsessively hand incised into exposed & processed photographic paper \u2013 each capturing sequences of transitory life stages. Included in the show is a looped projection of the short film 3SAI: A Rite of Passage. #3SAI: A RRite of Passage \u2013 a cross- platform, cinematic non-narrative experimental short film #Transitions Multiples \u2013 a suite of editioned maniere noir lithographs. ==== The Lost Men ==== The Lost Men is an ongoing project comprises a series of temporary, site- specific installations, which engage with concepts of memorial and public grief. Emmanuel researches the history and relevance of the selected public site. The artwork he creates re-evaluates events related to South African history; it is his personal response from a contemporary viewpoint to a particular place and its historical significance. Each artwork is unique in imagery, structure and format while the project remains conceptually consistent. The installations are installed for a defined period only. Emmanuel uses his own body as his \u2018canvas\u2019 and imprints into his skin, using lead type that results in temporary bruising, the names of deceased servicemen killed in action. The artist\u2019s marked body is photographed and the images re- printed onto large, semi-transparent silk banners which are placed in the landscape, acting as a \u2018counter memorial\u2019. It is a non-partisan, \u2018counter- memorial\u2019 that reflects on impermanence and forgetting. The Lost Men has been selected by the government of France as an official exhibit of the World War One Centennial.Jonathan Jones. \"Why nudes are a fitting tribute to the Somme's fallen soldiers\". the Guardian.
