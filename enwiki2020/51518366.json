The plot follows two boys who reconnect over their memories and fears as they walk through the woods on Halloween night 1997. ==Critical reception== Reviews were mixed but generally favourable, with a score of 78% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 15 reviews. The AV Club included it in its \"The best films of 2017 that we didn't review\" feature, noting that while its themes were not original, the film \"grapples with the universal teenage themes of fitting in and growing apart more imaginatively\u2014and sensitively\u2014than most.\" The Guardian's reviewer gave it 2/5, finding some moments were \"memorably surreal,\" but writing that it suffered from its low budget and lack of script editing. ==Cast== * Toby Wallace as Corey * Gulliver McGrath as Jonah * Mitzi Ruhlmann as Romany * Justin Holborow as Jango ==References== ==External links== * Category:2016 films Category:2016 directorial debut films Category:2016 drama films Category:2010s fantasy drama films Category:2016 horror films Category:Australian films Category:Australian drama films Category:Australian fantasy films Category:Australian horror films Category:English-language films Category:Films shot in Adelaide Category:Films set in 1997 Category:Halloween horror films ",
