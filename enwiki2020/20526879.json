He completed his Senior Cambridge (GCE) from PAF Public School Sargodha (formerly PAF College Sargodha) in April 1961 (5th Entry, Sabre House) and joined the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) in August 1961. ==PAF career== He was commissioned in the PAF on 22 June 1963 in the 36th GD(P) Course with the service serial number of Pak-4362 and being the Wing Under Officer, was a candidate for the Sword of Honour at this time, but did not end up receiving it. In a vehement debate at the PAF Academy in Risalpur, Waleed passionately pushed the agenda of the Language Movement of 1952 which compelled the Government of Pakistan to establish Bengali as an official language on par with Urdu and English (the official and mainstream languages in West Pakistan). He was later nominated and became known as the captain of the basketball team at the academy. Flight Lt. Matiur Rahman (later recipient of the Bir Sreshtho in the Bangladesh Liberation War) and Air Vice Marshal Momtaz Uddin Ahmed were his classmates in both Sargodha and Risalpur.

After successfully completing Jet Conversion Training on T-33 jet trainers, he was designated for a Fighter Conversion Training Course with the North American F-86 Sabre (a relatively new aircraft being delivered by the United States to Pakistan since the late 1950s), following which he was posted with the No. 19 Squadron in Peshawar due to his strong performance. Waleed was famous among personnel in the PAF for the daring stunts he performed with his F-86 Sabre and took part in the Republic Day flybys in Rawalpindi on 23 March 1965 as a wingman alongside Air Marshal Asghar Khan (then Chief of Air Staff of the Pakistan Air Force) and Air Commodore Zafar Chaudhry in Lockheed F-104 Starfighters. ==Indo-Pakistani War of 1965== Waleed died when his aircraft (which was hit by anti-aircraft guns in the Rann of Kutch during a sortie by Indian forces early in the morning) had serious engine trouble and rapidly plunged into the Arabian Sea about 10\u201315 miles off the southern coast of Karachi on the night of 19 April 1965 as he was returning to Karachi from a reconnaissance mission over Gujarat, India. He had engaged the Indian Army in skirmishes throughout the Rann of Kutch by dropping smoke bombs during the daytime to screen infantry attacks. Neither his body nor his aircraft were recovered, but a part of the rudder from the Sabre was found about two months after and retrieved near the location where his aircraft crashed. He was a fighter pilot with the 17th Squadron (The Tigers) of the Pakistan Air Force when he died, and Air Marshal Azim Daudpota was his squadron leader at the time. ==References== ==External links== * Cox's Bazar * Old Sargodhians Category:1944 births Category:1965 deaths Category:Pakistan Air Force officers Category:Pakistani aviators Category:Pakistani military personnel killed in action Category:Pilots of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 Category:Pakistani people of Bengali descent Category:PAF College Sargodha alumni ",
