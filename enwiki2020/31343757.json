It is adjacent to Llanishen Reservoir and forms part of the Nant Fawr Corridor from the top of Roath Park to the countryside beyond Cyncoed. In 1892 the Llanishen Reservoir was reported to be able to hold of water and the smaller Lisvane Reservoir able to hold . On 30 August 2013, CELSA Group bought both Llanishen and Lisvane reservoirs from their owner Western Power Distribution, to assure its Cardiff rod mill plant a consistent supply of water. In January 2016, Welsh Water acquired both Llanishen and Lisvane reservoirs from CELSA Group on a 999-year lease, which allows Welsh Water to use both reservoirs for water supply and recreational purposes while also allowing CELSA UK to continue to take its water supply from the Lisvane reservoir. The reservoir is protected as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. ==See also== *List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Mid & South Glamorgan ==References== Category:Infrastructure completed in 1886 Category:Llanishen, Cardiff Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Cardiff Category:Reservoirs in Wales Category:Cardiff Corporation Waterworks ",
