    "text": "El Trompillo Airport is located in the south part of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, about 2 km (1.25 miles) away from the central plaza. ==Creation== It was created in 1920 with a lane that measured no more than 800 meters (2,624 feet). The airport was given the name of \u201cCaptain Horacio Vasquez\u201d honoring a pilot who died in an accident flying from Argentina to La Paz. Nevertheless, because of the location, the airport with time was known as \u201cEl Trompillo\u201d. For the first 65 years, it was the only airport in the city, until in 1984 the international airport of Viru Viru was constructed. Since then it has only operated local flights and the landing and departure of students of the Bolivian Air Force. The first airlines to use this airport were Lloyd A\u00e9reo Boliviano, known as LAB, and Panagra. About 70 departures and arrivals of the Air Force, and small and large airlines are registered. For a while, from 1980 to 1985, the amount of airplanes registered increased due to a combat against drug traffic. As of 2019, there is currently no commercial passenger flights since the national carrier Transporte A\u00e9reo Militar ceased operations.https://simpleflying.com/tam-bolivia-suspends-operations/ ==Facilities== Aerocon had its head office in Hangar 93.\"aerocon_of_nacional.png.\" (Archive) Aerocon.

The Lockheed Constellation tried to get away but was forced to return to El Trompillo after a chase, which resulted in the death of BAF pilot Alberto Peredo Cespedes, whose Mustang PF-51 plane crashed at Cicumvalacion avenue during the pursuit. The four people in the Constellation were arrested, accused of contraband and homicide, later released on bond and escaped. The Constellation remained in Bolivia, and was later used by Aerosur and Pepsi for advertising purposes. The incident became known as the \"Pirate Airplane Incident\".Dia 7 - 19-08-12 by EDADSA - issuu (in Spanish) ==See also== *Transport in Bolivia *List of airports in Bolivia ==References== * \"El Trompillo alza vuelo.\" El Nuevo Dia. 29 January 2006. * \"Har\u00e1n estudio para traslado del aeropuerto El Trompillo.\" El Mundo. 17 April 2006. ===Footnotes=== ==External links== * * Category:Airports in Bolivia Category:Airports in Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia) Category:Airports established in 1920 Category:1920 establishments in Bolivia ",
