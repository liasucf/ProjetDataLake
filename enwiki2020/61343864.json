WDT was one of the first broadcasting stations in the New York metropolitan area, although it was soon joined by numerous others. Initially, all stations making entertainment broadcasts transmitted on the common wavelength of 360 meters, which necessitated a time- sharing agreement to allocate operating hours for individual stations. This soon became complicated, and by June there were in excess of ten regional stations broadcasting on this wavelength.\"Make First Co-operative Effort to Equalize Air Usage\", The Radio Dealer, June 1922, page 12. The station moved to the Stapleton section of Staten Island in New York City in early 1923.\"Alterations and Corrections\", Radio Service Bulletin, February 1, 1923, page 7. In May 1923 the Department of Commerce, which regulated radio at this time, greatly expanded the number of available transmitting frequencies, including three \"Class B\" allocations for the Newark/New York City area that were reserved for stations with superior equipment and programmimg.\"What the New Broadcasting Schedule Means to You\" by John V. L. Hogan, Popular Radio, July 1923, page 70. Beginning with these assignments, radio stations ended the practice of broadcasting their market reports and weather forecasts on the separate 485 meter wavelength. WDT was assigned to the Class B frequency of 740 kHz, \"Alterations and Corrections\", Radio Service Bulletin, July 2, 1923, page 10. where it shared time with WOR in Newark, New Jersey, and a new Radio Corporation of America station, WJY in New York City.\"Class B Calls and Waves\", Radio Age, June 1923, page 12. The upgrade to Class B status coincided with the beginning of joint operations with the Premier Grand Piano Corporation, with a new studio and transmitter installed at that company's factory at 510 West 23rd Street in New York City.\"Alterations and Corrections\", Radio Service Bulletin, October 1, 1923, page 6. In addition, the famous singer Vaughn De Leath, who also was the leader of a sixty-piece orchestra, took over as the station's studio manager.\"Vaughn De Leath as Program Manager\", Radio Broadcast, November 1923, page 50. The debut broadcast from the new facility took place on the evening of June 8th, and featured an opening address by De Leath.
