    "text": "The Booth-Weir House is a historic house on West First Street in McRae, Arkansas. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with an irregular cross- gable configuration and a projecting gable-roof porch. It is finished in composition shingles and rests on brick piers. Built in 1911 for a railroad fireman, it is one of a few houses in McRae to survive the pre-World War I period, and is typical of vernacular construction of that period. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in White County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Houses in White County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in White County, Arkansas ",
