At the time, the voting system in Queensland was based on contingency voting, which was similar to the modern optional preferential voting system. In electorates with 3 or more candidates, preferences were not distributed if a candidate received more than 50% of the primary vote. If none received more than 50%, all except the top two candidates were eliminated from the count and their preferences distributed between the two leaders, with the one receiving the most votes declared the winner. == Results by electoral district == === Albert === === Aubigny === === Balonne === === Barcoo === === Bowen === === Bremer === === Brisbane === === Bulimba === === Bundaberg === === Buranda === ==== By-election ==== * This by-election was caused by the appointment of John Huxham as Agent-General of Queensland in London.
