    "text": "Johnson Bayou is a small unincorporated community located on the Creole Nature Trail along the Gulf Coast in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, United States, and is named after Daniel Johnson, who came to the area circa 1790. The village is spread across coastal chenieres which were formed by deltaic sedimentation by the shifting of the Mississippi River. This geologic formation, the coastal cheniere , is found only in a few locations across the globe. The population of the community is approximately 400. Johnson Bayou is part of the Lake Charles Metropolitan Statistical Area.
