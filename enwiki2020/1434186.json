The Minor Planet Center credits her with the discovery of two numbered minor planets, but erroneously gives the credit to \"A. Dalsanti\" for the trans-Neptunian object , which she co-discovered in 1999. In 2004 she was awarded a NASA Postdoctoral Fellowship in astrobiology at the Institute for Astronomy of the University of Hawaii in Honolulu. == References == == External links == * Audrey Delsanti \u2013 Homepage Category:French astronomers Category:Astrobiologists Category:Planetary scientists Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Discoverers of trans-Neptunian objects Category:French women biologists Category:Women astronomers Category:20th- century French scientists Category:21st-century French scientists Category:20th-century French women scientists Category:21st-century French women scientists Category:20th-century astronomers Category:21st-century astronomers Category:Women planetary scientists ",
