Talking about introducing a fresh concept on primetime, Zee TV's business head, Mr. Pradeep Hejmadi said,\u201cEven when it comes to genres such as history and mythology, a most fascinating period that remains unexplored by Indian television is the pre-Independence era. This vibrant period of India\u2019s history that saw a great upheaval also saw intense drama unfold in the lives of the royalty of the princely states. Behind empty walls of grandeur and fake displays of splendor was hidden the truth of erosion of wealth, insecurities, succumbing to British dominion, depression and bankruptcy. Ek Tha Raja Ek Thi Rani is a story of love set against this most interesting canvas. It aims to give viewers an up close and personal view of the lifestyles and some of the most closely guarded secrets of the rich and royal of the 1940s. It is a work of fiction that draws inspiration from the lives of the royalty of that period.\"http://businessofcinema.com/tele/zee-tvs- ek-tha-raja-ek-thi-rani-is-all-set-to-take-viewers-to-the-1940s/219039 Producers Sunjoy and Comall Wadhwa of Sphere Origins further add, \u201cThe idea has been to look back at a glorious period of history for inspiration and churn out a timeless masterpiece that will entertain and enthrall TV audiences. The most daunting task at hand has been the re-creation of the pre- Independence era and the majestic lifestyles of the kings and queens of the princely states. Enormous research has gone to ensure authentic representation of the era and to create magic on screen. We have on board an ensemble of extremely impressive actors who beautifully fit the parts they are playing. The show will definitely turn out to be a clutter-breaker and hopefully, the biggest fiction show of the year.\u201d ===Casting=== Popular TV Actress, Drashti Dhami was roped in the play the lead as Gayatri. Speaking about her comeback to television post her last show Madhubala \u2013 Ek Ishq Ek Junoon, she said \u201cI do feel a little under pressure since \u2018Madhubala\u2019 was such a success. But I am also looking forward to seeing my fans\u2019 reaction to my new show. Even my family and friends are very excited,\u201d \u201cIt found it difficult to speak in the dialect which people spoke at that time. That was challenging. Other than that, I did not have any issues with the role,\u201d Siddhant Karnick was roped to play the male lead opposite Drashti. The show also had other notable cast including Anita Raj, Moon Banerjee, Priya Tandon and Surekha Sikri who was seen in Balika Vadhu, Ajay Arya. In December 2015, Abhinam Nain entered the show. Later Anjum Fakih entered as the Main Antagonist as Rageshwari. In May 2016, Drashti and Sidhant left the show as the show was gearing up for a leap. After Eisha Singh and Sartaj Gill enterecas the new Rani-Raja. ==Reception== The show began with good ratings and became one of the most watched shows across all GEC's and was one of the top ten serials of 2015. Later due to poor repetitive tracks the TRPs dropped and it was scheduled to go off air. These were the rumours by people that the show will be go to off air.
