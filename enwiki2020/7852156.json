    "text": "The Anglican Diocese of Armidale is a diocese of the Anglican Church of Australia located in the state of New South Wales. As the Diocese of Grafton and Armidale, it was created (from the Diocese of Newcastle) by letters patent in 1863.1877 legislation When the Anglican Diocese of Grafton was split off in 1914, the remaining portion was renamed Armidale, retaining its legal continuity and its incumbent bishop. Once relatively Anglo-Catholic in its liturgical and theological leanings, since the mid-20th century the diocese has leant more towards the Diocese of Sydney and its particular form of Evangelical teaching and liturgy. The diocese is theologically conservative and holds to the traditional Anglican beliefs on human sexuality, disapproving same-sex unions. The diocese includes the regional cities of Tamworth and Armidale and the towns of Glen Innes, Tenterfield, Inverell, Moree, Gunnedah and Narrabri. Rick Lewers has been the Bishop of Armidale since May 2012. ==Cathedral== The cathedral church of the diocese is St Peter's Cathedral in Armidale. It was consecrated for worship in 1875. The cathedral was designed by the Canadian architect John Horbury Hunt who also designed the University of New England. The foundation stone was laid by James F. Turner, Bishop of Grafton and Armidale. ==Schools== The Diocese of Armidale has three affiliated independent Anglican schools: *The Armidale School (TAS), founded 1894 *New England Girls' School (NEGS), Armidale, founded 1895 *Calrossy Anglican School, Tamworth, incorporating Calrossy Anglican School for Girls (founded 1919), William Cowper Anglican Boys High School and William Cowper Primary School ==Linked diocese== Following a 2004 synod visit by Edward Muhima, Bishop of North Kigezi in Uganda, there has been a forging of a support link between the two dioceses. The Diocese of North Kigezi is in the South West of Uganda, with its office in Rukunjiri. ==List of bishops== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 95%;\" |- ! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #7F1734; color: white;\" | Bishops of Grafton and Armidale |- ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 10%;\" | From ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 10%;\" | Until ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 33%;\" | Incumbent ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 42%;\" | Notes |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1867 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1868 | Collinson Sawyer | Appointed First Bishop drowned in the River Clarence before his enthonement |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1869 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1893 | James Turner | |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1894 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1901 | Arthur Green | \u201cWho was Who\u201d 1897-1990 London, A & C Black, 1991 translated to Ballarat |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1901 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1914 | Henry Cooper | Lays foundation stone for the Armidale School remained in post as Bishop of Armidale |- ! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #7F1734; color: white;\" | Bishops of Armidale |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1914 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1916 | Henry Cooper | previously Bishop of Grafton and Armidale |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1916 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1929 | Wentworth Wentworth-Sheilds | |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1929 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1964 | John Moyes | |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1965 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1976 | Clive Kerle | Previously bishop coadjutor in Sydney since 1956 |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1976 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1999 | Peter Chiswell | |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2000 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2012 | Peter Brain | |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2012 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | present | Rick Lewers | Consecrated and installed May 2012 |} ==See also== *Anglican Diocese of Sydney *Anglican Pacifist Fellowship *Church Missionary Society *Anglicare *Evangelical Anglicanism *Low church *Calvinism *Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans *GAFCON ==References== ==External links== *Diocese of Armidale Armidale Category:Anglican bishops of Armidale Category:New England (New South Wales) Category:Armidale, New South Wales Category:Evangelical Anglicanism Category:Evangelicalism in Australia Category:Anglican Church of Australia Ecclesiastical Province of New South Wales Category:Anglican Bishops of Grafton and Armidale Category:Lists of Anglican bishops and archbishops Category:Grafton, New South Wales Category:Lists of Australian people by occupation Category:New South Wales-related lists Category:1863 establishments in Australia ",
