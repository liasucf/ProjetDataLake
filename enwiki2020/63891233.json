The novel takes place in New York City. ==Reception== New York Times critic Michiko Kakutani compared the novel unfavorably to Barthelme's earlier novels and short stories, writing that it \"[...] has little of the vitality or inventiveness of Mr. Barthelme's earlier work and none of its provocative intelligence.\" Elizabeth Jolley, also writing in The New York Times, praised the novel's humor and referred to it as a \"shock and a revelation\". ==References== Category:1986 novels Category:Novels set in New York City ",
