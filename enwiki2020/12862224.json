    "text": "Bolivian Americans (, or ) are Americans of at least partial Bolivian descent. Bolivian Americans are usually those of Indigenous, Mestizo, or European (mostly Spanish or German) background. Additionally, a much smaller number of Bolivian Americans may have Japanese or Afro-Bolivian heritage. Bolivians compose the third smallest Hispanic group in the United States, with a 2010 Census population of 99,210. The highest concentration resides in the Washington Metropolitan Area, which accounts for 38% of the total Bolivian population in the US. Additional areas of concentration include the New York City borough of Queens, Miami-Dade County, and the cities of Los Angeles and Providence, Rhode Island. == History == Westlake Theatre building, side wall mural of Jaime Escalante and Edward James Olmos. Bolivian immigration into the United States occurred in two significant phases. The first phase occurred during and subsequent to the 1952 National Revolution (between 1952 and the latter 1960s). Most of these immigrants consisted of middle- to upper-middle income occupational professionals or political dissidents, and identify with Bolivia's White or Criollo (descendants from Europeans born in Bolivia) society. The second notable phase of Bolivian immigration (between 1980 and 1988) was a result of Bolivia's fiscal policies in the 1970s which gave way to the hyperinflation throughout most of the 1980s. Most of these immigrants consisted of lower-income Mestizo (European/Amerindian mix) and Indigenous Bolivians obtaining work posts as service and manual laborers. Many Bolivians who emigrated to the United States came as tourists. However, many remained indefinitely in the country, setting with family and friends. This made it difficult to know the number of Bolivians living in the United States. Between 1984 and 1993, only 4,574 Bolivians got U.S. citizenship. In this period about 457 were naturalized each year.Bolivian Americans by Tim Eigo == Demographics == Raquel Welch American actress and singer.

The number of Bolivians in the U.S. in 2006 was estimated at 82,322. Most Bolivian immigrants are high school or college graduates; many work in companies or in government. === Areas === A Bolivian restaurant in Falls Church, Virginia The largest populations of Bolivians are situated in the following areas (Source: Census 2010): # Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV MSA \u2013 37,607 # New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-PA MSA \u2013 9,749 # Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana, CA MSA \u2013 7,068 # Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach, FL MSA \u2013 6,697 # Houston-Sugar Land-Baytown, TX MSA \u2013 2,359 # Chicago-Joliet-Naperville, IL-IN- WI MSA \u2013 2,099 # San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont, CA MSA \u2013 2,078 # Providence- New Bedford-Fall River, RI-MA MSA \u2013 1,970 # Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX MSA \u2013 1,223 # Boston-Cambridge-Quincy, MA-NH MSA \u2013 1,170 # Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, CA MSA \u2013 1,114 # San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, CA MSA \u2013 898 # San Diego-Carlsbad-San Marcos, CA MSA and Tampa-St. Petersburg- Clearwater, FL MSA \u2013 808 # Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford, FL MSA \u2013 744 # Baltimore-Towson, MD MSA \u2013 710 # Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Marietta, GA MSA \u2013 647 # Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, WA MSA \u2013 558 # Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington, PA- NJ-DE-MD MSA \u2013 524 # Salt Lake City, UT MSA \u2013 519 # Phoenix-Mesa-Glendale, AZ MSA \u2013 502 ==Notable people== * Juan Fernando Bastos \u2013 Bolivian born, American portrait artist * Marcelo Claure \u2013 CEO of Sprint Wireless, and Brightstar Corporation * Jaime Escalante \u2013 educator * Marco Etcheverry \u2013 footballer * Jaime Laredo \u2013 musician, violinist * Jaime Moreno \u2013 footballer * Jaime Mendoza-Nava \u2013 composer and conductor * Ben Mikaelsen \u2013 writer of children's literature * Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz \u2013 public servant * Milenka Pe\u00f1a \u2013 journalist, TV personality * Carlos Scott \u2013 retired Bolivian-American soccer midfielder * James T.
