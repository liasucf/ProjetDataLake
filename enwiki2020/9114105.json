Evdokimov, A.P. Izoitko and E.I. Travnikov. It opened on July 1, 1963. The station's name was derived from Maxim Gorky Avenue (later renamed Kronverskiy Avenue). The station was designed as a tribute to the writer. The ground-level vestibule is located at the intersection between Kamennoostrovsky and Kronverksky Prospects. The vestibule is designed to withstand a direct impact during carpet bombing. The station closed in October 2008 for a 14-month reconstruction and reopened in December 2009 as initially planned. ==Gallery== File:Metro SPB Line 2 Gorkovskaya pavilion.jpg|Entrance to the station File:\u0413\u043e\u0440\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f.jpg|Original station entrance in 2007 ==Notable landmarks== The station is located in proximity to Peter and Paul Fortress, as well as the Saint Petersburg Mosque and Leningrad Zoo. ==References== * Category:Saint Petersburg Metro stations Category:Railway stations in Russia opened in 1963 Category:1963 establishments in the Soviet Union Category:Railway stations located underground in Russia ",
