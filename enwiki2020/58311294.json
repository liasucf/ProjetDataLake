This infantry unit was established after the first English Invasion to the R\u00edo de la Plata. == History == The Third of Vizca\u00ednos was created on September 8, 1806, and was formed with a Company of militiamen from Cantabria, under the command of Prudencio Murguiondo, five companies of Vascos and Navarros, and two militia companies formed by volunteers from Asturias. The Vizca\u00ednos also had a Cuerpo de Cazadores Correntinos, composed of sixty- seven soldiers under the Captain Juan Jos\u00e9 Blanco. Prudencio Murguiondo and Miguel Cuyar, Captain of the 8th Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Asturianos, were distinguished by the Supreme Junta of Seville on behalf of Fernando VII of Spain, for his heroic actions in the Reconquest of Buenos Aires against the English invaders. The Tercio de Vizca\u00ednos was dissolved in 1809, after its members took part in the Mutiny of \u00c1lzaga against the Viceroy Santiago de Liniers. == References == Category:Regiments of Argentina Category:Military history of Argentina Category:R\u00edo de la Plata ",
