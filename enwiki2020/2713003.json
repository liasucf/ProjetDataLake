    "text": "Rho Ursae Majoris (\u03c1 UMa) is the Bayer designation for a solitary star in the northern circumpolar constellation of Ursa Major. It is faintly visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.74. The distance to this star, based upon an annual parallax shift of 10.37 mas, is around 315 light years. With a stellar classification of M3 III, this is a red giant star on the asymptotic giant branch. It is a suspected small amplitude variable. The measured angular diameter of the star after correcting for limb darkening is , which, at the estimated distance of this star, yields a physical size of about 58 times the radius of the Sun. It is radiating 464 times the solar luminosity from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of about 3,725 K. Based upon its motion through space, there is a 60.6% chance that this star is a member of the Sirius stream. ==Naming== *With \u03c01, \u03c02, \u03c31, \u03c32, A and d, it composed the Arabic asterism Al \u1e6chib\u0101\u1fbd, the Gazelle. According to the catalogue of stars in the Technical Memorandum 33-507 - A Reduced Star Catalog Containing 537 Named Stars, Al \u1e6chib\u0101 were the title for seven stars : A as Althiba I, \u03c01 as Althiba II, \u03c02 as Althiba III, this star (\u03c1) as Althiba IV, \u03c31 as Althiba V, \u03c32 as Althiba VI, and d as Althiba VII *In Chinese, (), meaning Three Top Instructors, refers to an asterism consisting of \u03c1 Ursae Majoris and \u03c32 Ursae Majoris. Consequently, the Chinese name for \u03c1 Ursae Majoris itself is (, .).
