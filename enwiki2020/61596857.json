She was criticized by the church for speaking up against Bishop Franco Mulakkal, who was then accused of repeatedly raping another nun at Kuravilangad convent in Kerala's Kottayam district between 2014 and 2016. The bishop was arrested in 2018 after being convicted for charges of rape. The congregation accused that Sr. Lucy was living a life that is against 'the principles of religious life' and the rules of the congregation. She had acquired a driver's license, bought a car, published a poetry book and received remuneration for the book without seeking permission from her superiors. She was also accused of arriving at the convent late in the night, participated in a news channel's discussion, letting a female journalist live with her in the convent and appearing in public without wearing the nun's uniform. The church was not pleased that Sr. Lucy sought the rape convict Bishop Franco's arrest, and went vocal about this issue in the news media In 2019, she received a third warning letter from the congregation, which would cause her expulsion from the convent, if she did not produce adequate reasoning for her deeds. ==References== Category:Indian nuns Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Religious activists Category:Living people ",
