Previously, the team could choose any player to take the shot. * A player on the ice must be within 1,5 metres of the bench before his replacement can step on the ice. * A player losing his helmet during play must leave the ice immediately. * When a team with a player already in the penalty box has a delayed penalty and the opposing team scores, the player already in the box will exit and the player with the delayed penalty will serve his penalty. Previously, the goal would negate the delayed penalty. * A goal scored with the shaft of the stick will stand, even if the stick blade is above the crossbar. * The number of non-players allowed in the bench area has been increased from six to eight. * For the first time since the 2004\u201305 Elitserien season, the 2010\u201311 Elitserien season re-introduces shootout in regulation games. If a game is tied after the first 60 minutes, the game goes to a 5-minute overtime period. If the game is still not concluded after that, it goes to a shootout. If the game is still not concluded after each team has made three penalty shots each, the shootout goes into a sudden-death shootout, where the first team that scores and if the other team misses, the first team wins. The player who gives the winning team the winning lead in the shootout gets a goal point in the protocol. The Timr\u00e5 IK \u2013 Lule\u00e5 HF game in round 3 was the first one to go into a shootout, which Timr\u00e5 won. ==References== ==External links== Swe Category:Swedish Hockey League seasons 1 ",
