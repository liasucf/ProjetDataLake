Its current head is Fernando Lima since late 2016. ==About the Island/Regional League== Before 2002, the top two champions competed into the single island competition until 2003. Until the early 2000s was the only island league in Cape Verde to have all of its football clubs in one town and also where there are no teams in the western half (though included) of the island due to a slightly low population, now the population compared to the eastern part is around half. The clubs are throughout the area. Acad\u00e9mica has the most number of island titles with twelve, second is Sporting with three, third is Maritimo with two and Fiorentina with a title won in 2008. Acad\u00e9mica Porto Novo was the first champ won in 1998, Mar\u00edtimo became the second champ a year later, Acad\u00e9mica won their second a year later, the club won two more in 2005 minus the cancelled 2004 season. Sporting won two consecutive in 2007, Fiorentina won their only title in 2008, Sporting again with their recent title in 2009 and Mar\u00edtimo's second and recent title in 2010. Acad\u00e9mica has recently won seven consecutive champ titles in 2017, of any regional championships, it became the next club after Botafogo of Fogo and Mindelense of S\u00e3o Vicente to do so. Acad\u00e9mica Porto Novo holds the record having not a single loss in 60 matches, the record includes that of the South Zone Cup and the Super Cup which totals about 70. The record lasted from 2011 to April 23, 2016. Acad\u00e9mica's next loss in a few seasons was at the final week losing to their second rival Mar\u00edtimo 2-1. Overall in any of the island leagues, Acad\u00e9mica had about four years without a loss, though in a championship with a club less than S\u00e3o Vicente's and no second division, the record is tied with CS Mindelense's. Acad\u00e9mica's overall 13 total is more than any club who has the second most championship titles of any region except Fogo. One of the teams that scored the most goals in a season was Acad\u00e9mica do Porto Novo numbering 60. One of the highest scoring matches in the championship was Acad\u00e9mica who defeated Sporting with a high scoring match of 11-0 on week 13, the final match of the 2016 season. ==Santo Ant\u00e3o Island League (South) - Clubs 2017/18== * Acad\u00e9mica Porto Novo * Fiorentina Porto Novo * Inter Porto Novo * Mar\u00edtimo - Porto Novo * Sanjoanense - Ribeira da Pratas * Sporting Porto Novo ===Withdrawn clubs=== * Lajedos * Santo Andr\u00e9 - based in Ribeira da Cruz * Tarrafal FC de Monte Trigo ==Winners== *1997/98 : Acad\u00e9mica do Porto Novo *1998/99 : Mar\u00edtimo (Porto Novo) *1999/00 : Acad\u00e9mica do Porto Novo *2000-02 : not held as the Santo Ant\u00e3o Island League continued without the two zones *2002/03 : Acad\u00e9mica do Porto Novo *2003/04 : not held *2004/05 : Acad\u00e9mica do Porto Novo *2005/06 : Sporting Clube do Porto Novo *2006/07 : Sporting Clube do Porto Novo *2007/08 : Grupo Desportivo, Recreativo e Cultural Fiorentina *2008/09 : Sporting Clube do Porto Novo *2009/10 : Mar\u00edtimo (Porto Novo) *2010/11 : Acad\u00e9mica Porto Novo *2011/12 : Acad\u00e9mica Porto Novo *2012/13 : Acad\u00e9mica Porto Novo *2013/14 : Acad\u00e9mica Porto Novo *2014/15 : Acad\u00e9mica Porto Novo *2015-16: Acad\u00e9mica Porto Novo *2016-17: Acad\u00e9mica Porto Novo *2017\u201318: Acad\u00e9mica Porto Novo ===Performance by club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
