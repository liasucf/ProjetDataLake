He was elected abbot of the community in 1509. On 17 September 1520, the abbey was suppressed by Pope Leo X and its territory was made a part of the new Diocese of Sansepolcro. At that time, the pope appointed Graziani to be the first Bishop of Sansepolcro, for which he was consecrated a bishop on 3 January of the following year. He served in this office until his death on 15 April 1522. == References == Category:15th-century births Category:1522 deaths Category:Benedictine abbots Category:Italian Roman Catholic bishops Category:16th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Bishops appointed by Pope Leo X Category:Camaldolese bishops ",
