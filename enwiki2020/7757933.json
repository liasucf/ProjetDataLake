    "text": "Sunrise at St. Helena Sound, June 2007 Saint Helena Sound is a coastal inlet in the Lowcountry region South Carolina, located along the Atlantic Ocean between Beaufort and Colleton counties. Located within the relatively undeveloped ACE Basin, the sound consists of the mouths of the Ashepoo, Combahee, and the south branch of the Edisto rivers, of which the ACE moniker derives from. The inlet is located east of Beaufort, between Edisto Island and Hunting Island. At its widest point, Saint Helena Sound is across. The Intracoastal Waterway crosses the sound. Much of the land surrounding St. Helena Sound has been preserved through the St. Helena Sound Heritage Preserve and the larger ACE Basin project. ==See also== * ACE Basin * St. Helena Sound Heritage Preserve * Waterways forming and crossings of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway == References == Category:Bodies of water of Beaufort County, South Carolina Category:Bodies of water of Colleton County, South Carolina Category:Bodies of water of South Carolina Category:Intracoastal Waterway Category:Sounds of the United States ",
