    "text": "Milit\u00e3o Augusto de Azevedo (Rio de Janeiro, 1837 \u2014 S\u00e3o Paulo, 1905) was a Brazilian photographer and actor active in the second half of the 19th century. Milit\u00e3o founded the Photographia Americana studio in 1875, where his clients included Castro Alves, Joaquim Nabuco, Dom Pedro II, and Empress Teresa Cristina. His rates were among the lowest in the city. The location of the studio in front of the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary, frequented mainly by the Afro-Brazilian residents, led to his photography of prominent Black citizens of Brazil. He depicted Afro-Brazilians not as slaves, but as ordinary citizens. His other works were of singers and theater artists. A collection of more than 12,000 photos produced by Milit\u00e3o de Azevedo was acquired by the Roberto Marinho Foundation in 1996 and donated to the Museu do Ipiranga of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo. ==Life and career== S\u00e9 District, approximately 1860 Anonymous family, ca. 1870 Milit\u00e3o Augusto de Azevedo was born in Rio de Janeiro on June 18, 1837. He began his career as a stage actor, participating in groups such as the Companhia Joaquim Heliodoro in 1858 and the Companhia Dram\u00e1tica Nacional in 1860. With this last group, he traveled to the city of S\u00e3o Paulo in 1862, where he moved in the same year and started a career as a photographer. Milit\u00e3o pursued the careers of actor and photographer in parallel. He worked at the Companhia Joaquim Heleodoro (1858-1860) and at Companhia Dram\u00e1tica Nacional (1860-1862), with whom he moved to S\u00e3o Paulo at the age of 25. He became acquainted with the owners of the Carneiro & Gaspar studio in the 1850, and worked as a portrait artist for the partners. Milit\u00e3o's experience in the theater had an important influence on his style of photography. While other photographers of the time were dedicated to the largest market of the time, the portrait market, Milit\u00e3o exercised artistic and creative freedom in the choice of urban landscapes as the subject of work. When he arrived in S\u00e3o Paulo in 1862, Milit\u00e3o found a \"small and introspective closed nucleus immersed in numbing sameness\". The capital had a provincial atmosphere, but it was bustling, full of energy, and activities focused on material achievements. It was in this context that Milit\u00e3o started his photographic work, documenting the population and their daily lives. Milit\u00e3o acquired Carneiro & Gaspar in 1875 and changed it name to Photographia Americana. The studio has received numerous famous figures in its twenty years of operation. Despite this, the price charged for the photos was one of the cheapest in the city: five thousand r\u00e9is. The studio was located in front of the Ros\u00e1rio church, frequented the Afro-Brazilian population of S\u00e3o Paulo; he photographed the Black population of the city as ordinary citizens rather than as slaves. Milit\u00e3o worked mainly in S\u00e3o Paulo between 1862 and 1887, producing images of houses, farms, public buildings, streets and panoramic shots; and organized albums with some of these urban scenes. The photographer also made portraits during excursions to other cities, especially during annual festivals. Some of his famous clients were the emperor, Dom Pedro II, the Empress Teresa Cristina, the jurist and politician Ruy Barbosa, the poet Castro Alves, the abolitionists Lu\u00eds Gama and Joaquim Nabuco, Ant\u00f4nio de Lacerda Franco, Jos\u00e9 Maria Lisbon, Eduardo da Silva Prado, Friar Germano de Annecy and Rodolfo Amoedo. Despite the increasing popularity of the photographic market in 1884, Milit\u00e3o facing serious commercial problems. He decided to put Photographia Americana up for sale in 1885, and auctioned off his furniture and equipment to travel to Europe. Despite disposing of the entire Photographia Americana laboratory and auctioning off photographic machines, materials and equipment, Milit\u00e3o kept the textual and iconographic documentation of the business. The collection was maintained by the family of his eldest son, Luiz Gonzaga de Azevedo, with whom the photographer maintained close ties until his death. Probably influenced by the popularity of photographic albums featuring images of European cities, he produced similar albums focused on changes in the urban landscape of the city of S\u00e3o Paulo. He released \u00c1lbum Comparativo de Vistas da Cidade de S\u00e3o Paulo (1862-1887) in 1887, defined a model for urban landscape photography that focused on the comparison of urban landscapes between times.
