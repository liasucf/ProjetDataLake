For these reasons, the school was heavily oversubscribed by parents on first choices. Visiting Great Barr School in November 1999, Sir Chris Woodhead, the then Chief Inspector of Schools, said \"You have here an outstanding city comprehensive school \u2013 it is one of the most impressive schools I have visited. Great Barr School shows it is possible for a comprehensive school to give a very high quality of education\".

This trenchant policy study arguably represents Brian Sherratt at his most influential in shaping the views of policy makers. He argued that, whereas the grant-maintained schools policy offered schools the chance of freedom from LEA control, the government's own hesitations over the policy were being exploited by members of the interest groups \u2013 heads, bureaucrats, and officials \u2013 whose present careers and future ambitions depended on the LEA system. The procedure for becoming grant- maintained had been allowed to develop into an obstacle course, while imposed central restrictions (such as the National Curriculum) meant that grant- maintained status in fact offered limited independence. Sherratt argued that government should aim to make all schools grant-maintained (i.e. independent of LEA control) as a matter of general policy, and that it should loosen the constraints placed on grant-maintained schools so as to make diversity and choice in education a reality. Grant-Maintained Status: considering the options, Longman, 1994. In this book Sherratt examines the nature of the grant-maintained policy and its implementation; the implications of self- government and the benefits of grant-maintained status; the role of the Funding Agency for Schools and the Common Funding Formula. The book also looks at the obstacles that there had been to implementing the policy and suggests some necessary changes to overcome them. A Structured Approach to School and Staff Development: from theory to practice (1996) \u2013 with John Wyatt. This book considers the relationships between school aims and values, whole school review, appraisal, school development planning, value for money in school planning and school evaluation. Headteacher Appraisal (contrib, Arena, in association with the NAHT, 1997). In this book, Brian Sherratt writes about his experience of being appraised as the head of a large secondary school. He comments on the effect it had on his view of his job, and the impact it made on the school as a whole. Radical Educational Policies and Secretaries of State (with Peter Ribbins, Cassell 1997). In this book Sherratt and Ribbins argue that the post-war consensus on the purpose of education, and the role played by the Secretary of State in defining it, had all but collapsed. In a series of conversations with Secretaries of State, the nature of the unfolding agenda for educational reform which the Conservative Party had developed since 1979 is explored. The authors present a series of portraits of seven very different people: Mark Carlisle, Keith Joseph, Kenneth Baker, Kenneth Clarke, John MacGregor, John Patten and Gillian Shephard, revealing the ways in which they sought to define and deliver educational change against a backdrop of conflicting messages from within their own party, and in the face of determined opposition from much of the educational establishment. These illuminating, entertaining and provocative conversations suggest that what was once regarded as radical in the Conservative agenda for education is now increasingly taken for granted by allies and opponents alike. Including a thorough analysis of the seven interviews, this book provides a mine of information for all those interested in contemporary politics, the future of education and the workings of government. Policy, Leadership and Professional Knowledge in Education (contrib, Chapman, BEMAS, 1999). Journal of Education Policy, The role of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the making of educational policy: Kenneth Baker and the Lawson factor? Volume 19, No 6, November 2004 (with Peter Ribbins). Until this paper, the role of Chancellors of the Exchequer in the making of policy in education has attracted the attention of few researchers, and little has been published that seeks systematically and comprehensively to examine this issue. This is remarkable given that, for most of the last 25 years, this office has been filled by four unusually powerful and long-serving figures. In this paper, Sherratt and Ribbins, drawing on their interview-based studies of the Secretaries of State and of the Permanent Secretaries who have held office at the Department of Education since 1979, consider the influence of Prime Ministers and Chancellors on educational policy over these years. In this context, the bulk of this paper focuses on the role of Nigel Lawson in the making of the 1988 Education Reform Act. In doing so, it draws on face-to-face interviews with Lawson along with other key participants such as Kenneth Baker and David Hancock. It concludes that, although Lawson may not have been, as he had hoped to be, the architect of the Act, he did exercise an important influence in shaping many of its central characteristics. As such, his claim that he was the catalyst of reform may well be justified. 'Managing the Secondary School in the 1990s: A New View of Headship' with Peter Ribbins, Educational Management and Administration.. This paper, which has been influential among researchers, talks about 'a new approach to the study of headship in which they have been involved together; an approach which they describe as a dialectic of biography and autobiography'.
