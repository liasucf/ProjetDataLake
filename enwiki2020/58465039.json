    "text": "Hypothetical technologies are technologies that do not exist yet, but that could exist in the future. They are distinct from emerging technologies, which have achieved some developmental success. Emerging technologies as of 2018 include 3-D metal printing and artificial embryos. Many hypothetical technologies have been the subject of science fiction. == List == * Acne vaccine * Alcubierre drive * Alderson disk * Anti-evolutionary drug * Anti- gravity * Antimatter rocket * Antimatter weapon * Antiprion drug * Artificial gametes * Artificial general intelligence * Artificial gill * Artificial gravity * Artificial \"super\" mitochondria * Artificial universe * Artificial uterus * Beam powered propulsion * Bering Strait crossing * Bernal sphere * Bias drive * Biogel refrigerator * Bishop ring * Black hole starship * Bracewell probe * Brain in a vat * Brainwashing * Brownian ratchet * Bush robot * Bussard ramjet * Caries vaccine * Chitin-cellulose composite * Chronovisor * Cloaking device * Cloud Nine (tensegrity sphere) * Cold fusion * Coleopter * Computronium * Cortical modem * Dean drive * De-extinction * Dentifrobot * Diametric drive * Diamond trees * Digital immortality * Dipole drive * Disjunction drive * Dyson sphere * Dyson tree * Dyson\u2013Harrop satellite * Electrogravitics * Endoneurobot * Enzmann starship * ET3 Global Alliance * Exoskeletal engine * Faster than light communication * Female sperm * Femtotechnology * Field propulsion * Fission sail * Fluorescent multilayer card * Flying submarine * Flying syringe * Ford-Svaiter mirror * Fusion rocket * Fusion torch * Gamma-ray bomb * Gliabot * Global brain * Globus Cassus * God helmet * Gravitational shielding * Gravity tractor * Gravity train * Gravity- vacuum transit * Grey goo * Hafnium bomb * Hair cloning * Halo drive * HIV vaccine * Horizon drive * Humanzee * Hydrogenase * Hypercomputer * Inertia negation * Inferential programming * Infomorph * Information panspermia * Intelligence amplification * Isotropic beacon * Krasnikov tube * Language- learning pill * Laser broom * Laser propulsion * Launch loop * Life extension * Lightcraft * Liquid breathing * Lunar space elevator * MagBeam * Magnetic sail * Malaria vaccine * Matrioshka brain * McKendree cylinder * Mechanosynthesis * Memory editing * Mezoelectronics * Microfactory * Mind uploading * Molecular assembler * Momentum exchange tether * Monopolium * Moral enhancement * Muon collider * Nanochondrion * Nanocomputer * Nano electrokinetic thruster * Nanomatrix skyscraper * Nanoship * Neutronium * Nike ONE * Non-rocket spacelaunch * Nootropic * Nuclear bullet * Nuclear lightbulb * Nuclear pulse propulsion * Nuclear salt-water rocket * Nuclear shaped charge * O'Neill cylinder * Orbital ring * Organic nuclear reactor * Ouroboros habitat * Perpetual motion * Phased-array optics * Photon rocket * Photonic railway * Picotechnology * Piezer * Pitch drive * Plasma bubble * Plasmonster * Prime editing * Project Excalibur * Pure fusion weapon * Quantum memory * Quantum money * Quantum telescope * Quantum vacuum thruster * Quasite * Ringworld * Reactionless drive * Respirocyte * RF resonant cavity thruster * Robotoid * Rocket sled launch * Room-temperature superconductor * Rotating wheel space station * Santa Claus machine * Seascraper * Self-replicating spacecraft * Shellworld * Simulated reality * Skyhook * S-money * Solar thermal rocket * Soletta * Space coach * Space dock * Space elevator * Space fountain * Space gun * Space mirror * Space tether * Space-time cloak * Space tug * Sphalerizer * Spomified asteroid * Stanford torus * Starlifting * Starseed launcher * StarTram * Statite * Stellar engine * Sun scoop * Synthetic epigenetics * Superintelligence * Synaptobot * Tachyonic antitelephone * Tectonic weapon * Teleforce * Teleporter * Terrascope * Thermonuclear micro-bomb engine * Thought recording and reproduction device * Time machine * Tipler cylinder * Topopolis * Torsion field (pseudoscience) * Tractor beam * Transatlantic tunnel * Universal flu vaccine * Universal memory * Universal snakebite antidote * Utility fog * Vacuum airship * Vertical city * Vertical zoo * Warp-field experiments * Water-fueled car * Wearable generator * Wet nanotechnology * Wet workshop * Wetware computer * Zettascale computing == See also == * List of emerging technologies * List of fictional aircraft * List of fictional artificial intelligences * List of fictional automobiles * List of fictional cyborgs * List of fictional doomsday devices * List of fictional firearms * List of fictional galactic communities * List of fictional robots and androids ** List of fictional gynoids * List of fictional space stations * List of fictional spacecraft * List of fictional vehicles ==References== * ",
