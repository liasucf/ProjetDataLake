    "text": "Rotterdam Noord is a railway station in the city of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, located on the Utrecht\u2013Rotterdam railway. It sits at the border between the two Rotterdam municipalities Noord and Hillegersberg-Schiebroek. ==History== In 1899, the railway station Hillegersberg was opened on the new connecting line (Ceintuurbaan) between the railway from Rotterdam Delftsche Poort to Leiden, and the railway from Rotterdam Maasstation to Utrecht. In 1953 the railway from Rotterdam to Utrecht was rerouted to the new Rotterdam Centraal railway station through Hillegersberg. A new station building was constructed, and the station was renamed Rotterdam Noord. Rotterdam Noord is designed by architect Sybold van Ravesteyn who has also designed the stations Rotterdam Centraal, Eindhoven, and many other railway stations and buildings in the Netherlands. The station was opened on 4 October 1953. ==The building== The platform that leads to Utrecht is connected to a building, where there used to be an NS office that sold tickets. When this office disappeared and the tickets could only be bought at a ticket machine, the building was closed down. Since a few years back the building is used for an art-exposition. ==Train services== Rotterdam Noord is a station for local trains (Stoptrein and Sprinter in Dutch).
