The show now airs on ABC3 in an afternoon time slot. == Overview == Eug\u00e9nie Sandler is your average everyday teenager, worried about the usual things, like her place in the world, who she is, and what it's like to be fifteen. She also worries about her father Ray, who is a private investigator whose job causes frequent changes of address. When her father goes missing one day and she discovers a bomb in her sink, her whole world is turned upside down. With the help of her new friend Warwick, she discovers that her world is not as simple as it seems and that the freedom of a (fictional) country known as Versovia depends on her actions. Along the way, she makes many new friends, saves a lot of lives and discovers that love is not as scary as people think. == Cast == *Xaris Miller as Eug\u00e9nie Sandler *Matthew Vennell as Warwick Bedford *Brett Climo as Ray Sandler *Martin Jacobs as Detective Matt Gurny *Odette Joannides as Detective Teresa Brady *Saskia Post as Angela Duvier *Alex Meglett as Davorin *Jasper Bagg as Slavomir == Production == In late 1999 the Australian Broadcasting Company came up with the idea of a new children's detective show.
