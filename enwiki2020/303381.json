    "text": "Trondheim Airport, V\u00e6rnes (; ) is an international airport serving Trondheim, a city and municipality in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. The airport is located in V\u00e6rnes, a village in the municipality of Stj\u00f8rdal in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, east of Trondheim. Operated by the state-owned Avinor, it shares facilities with V\u00e6rnes Air Station of the Royal Norwegian Air Force. In 2018, the airport had 4,441,870 passengers and 58,273 air movements, making it the fourth-busiest in the country. The airport has two terminals; A dates from 1994 and is used for domestic traffic, while B is the renovated former main terminal from 1982, and is used for international traffic. The airport features a main east\u2013west runway, a disused northwest\u2013southeast runway, an integrated railway station and an airport hotel. The main airlines at the airport are Scandinavian Airlines (SAS), Norwegian Air Shuttle and Wider\u00f8e, for all of which V\u00e6rnes is a focus city. The main route is the service to Oslo, operated by both SAS and Norwegian, which is the fifth-busiest route in Europe. Both airlines operate services also using Boeing 737 aircraft to Bergen, Bod\u00f8 and Troms\u00f8; SAS has some additional domestic services while Norwegian has a number of low- frequency international services. Wider\u00f8e operates regional Dash 8 aircraft to six airports in Helgeland, in addition to Sandefjord. Krohn Air provides services to Molde. Daily international services to Copenhagen is provided by SAS and to Amsterdam is provided by KLM. The airport also serves charter services, mainly to the Mediterranean. In total, it connects to 17 domestic and 21 international destinations, as well as 18 charter destinations. V\u00e6rnes was taken into use by the Royal Norwegian Army in 1887. The first flight was made in 1914, and aerodrome facilities were gradually installed. The first main installations, including three concrete runways, were built during World War II by Luftwaffe. After the war, the Air Force Pilot School moved to V\u00e6rnes, although in 1954 most of the other air force activities for Central Norway were moved to \u00d8rland Main Air Station. Civilian aviation started in 1951, when half a barracks was taken into use as a terminal, with the whole building being utilized from 1958. Jet aircraft started serving V\u00e6rnes from 1963, and the second terminal opened in 1965. The third (the current international Terminal B) was opened in 1982, and the fourth, Terminal A, was opened in 1994, along with the train station. From 1956 to 2004, Braathens was one of the largest airlines at the airport. ==Facilities== The five westernmost gates at Terminal A Trondheim Airport is a joint military and civilian airport located in the municipality of Stj\u00f8rdal in Tr\u00f8ndelag, with the northern part of the airport bordering the town of Stj\u00f8rdalshalsen.Avinor (2006): 8 To the west, the airport borders the Trondheimsfjord, and to the south the Stj\u00f8rdal River.Avinor (2006): 19 Combining the functions as an international, domestic and regional airport, it is located east of Trondheim. Most of the airport area is owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Defence, although the civilian facilities and the air traffic control are owned and operated by Avinor, a subsidiary of the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications.Avinor (2006): 7 ===Terminals=== The civilian sector consists of two terminals\u2014A and B\u2014which combined are , of which is passenger facilities. Terminal A is used for domestic traffic, while Terminal B is used for international services. The check-in facilities for domestic, international and charter are all fitted together at second floor at terminal A. The terminal contains an array of stores and dining places; these include a book store, convenience stores; clothing, crafts and cosmetics; diners, restaurants and pubs; and a duty-free store. The airport also has three automatic teller machines and a Radisson Blu hotel with 180 rooms and 11 conference rooms. Scandic Hell operates another hotel, the 400-room Rica Hell Hotel, within walking distance of the airport. The airport administration is located in Terminal B, while the administration for airlines and handling agents is located in annexes of Terminal A.Avinor (2006): 41 The terminal has stands for 24 aircraft, of which eight of sixteen at Terminal A have jetbridges. Four stands (two at each terminal is size code D, large enough for an Airbus A330 or a Boeing 757), while 20 are for size category C (large enough for an Airbus A320 or Boeing 737). Domestic jets normally use the seven jetbridge stands (gates 30\u201337), while the five non-bridged gates at Terminal A (gates 25\u201329) are used for domestic regional aircraft. International flights all use the eight non-bridged gates at Terminal B (gates 42\u201349). The Air Force has six stands for military freight planes up to the size of a Lockheed C-5 Galaxy (code F), although one is permanently used for deicing.Avinor (2006): 24\u201325 An Antonov An-124 Ruslan cargo aircraft parked at the military sector ===Cargo, general aviation and VIP=== Southeast of Terminal B is a collection of hangars and facilities belonging to various airlines. The largest is a hangar belonging to Scandinavian Airlines, dating from 1979, and a hangar from 1992 which is used by SAS Cargo. The airline also has two smaller buildings, at . This area contains the main gate, which is also used for VIP passengers. There are six additional hangars, used by Helitrans (), built in 1984 and 1991, a hangar belonging to Auticon, a hangar belonging to Hilmar Tollefsen and two smaller hangars, one of which belongs to V\u00e6rnes flyklubb.Avinor (2006): 27\u201328 V\u00e6rnes handles the largest amount of general aviation in Central Norway, including executive jets. ===Runway and air control=== A Wider\u00f8e Dash 8 Q400 taxies while a Lufttransport Beechcraft King Air approaches Runway 09 The main runway is long, and runs east\u2013west at 09/27. It is wide, plus shoulders of on each side. The runway is equipped with instrument landing system category 1. The main radar, a combined primary and secondary, is placed at Vennafjell, south of the airport. Other radars are located at Kopparen, Tronfjell and Gr\u00e5kallen.Avinor (2006): 19\u201321 The taxiway runs the parallel the full length of the main runway. It is wide, with wide shoulders on each side. The center-distance between the runway and taxiway is , allowing simultaneous use by code E aircraft (such as Boeing 747).Avinor (2006): 22 V\u00e6rnes has a theoretical capacity of 40 air movements per hour, but this is reduced during bad weather, so the airport has a registered capacity of 25.Avinor (2006): 24 The airport also has a diagonal runway, which runs 14/32, roughly northwest\u2013southeast. It is long, plus end section of on Runway 14 and on Runway 32. The runway is closed for traffic, in part because of bad asphalt quality.Avinor (2006): 20 The current control tower is tall and dates from 2005. A United States Air Force C-5 Galaxy unloading cargo at V\u00e6rnes Air Station ===Military=== V\u00e6rnes Air Station is one of two air stations in Central Norway, the other being \u00d8rland Main Air Station. There are no aircraft permanently stationed at V\u00e6rnes, but the station serves the Home Guard, including its training center and the headquarters of the Tr\u00f8ndelag District (HV-12). Most of the military installations are located on the north side of the runway, although some are also located on the south side, to the east of the civilian terminal. V\u00e6rnes also serves as a storage base for the United States Armed Forces as part of the Marine Corps Prepositioning Program-Norway. The military owns the runways and taxiways, but these are operated by Avinor. Three to four hundred military aircraft are handled at the air station each year. The military installations contain places for up to six aircraft of the size of a C-5 Galaxy and barracks to house 1,200 soldiers. The Ring Road connects the northern to the southern installations and passes the main runway on the east side.Avinor (2006): 8\u201310 ==History== V\u00e6rnes in 1936 ===Military establishment=== V\u00e6rnes is first recorded in the 10th century as the seat for one of eight chieftains in Tr\u00f8ndelag. The first military activity in the area was as a base for leidang. After the Viking Age, the farm at V\u00e6rnes was taken over by the king and became the seat of the vogt. From 1671, the farm was owned by a series of military officers and public servants. In 1887, the farm was bought by the Royal Norwegian Army and converted to a camp.Hovd (2000): 17\u201322 The first aircraft to use V\u00e6rnes was a military Farman MF.7 Longhorn, which took off on 26 March 1914. It was part of the plan to establish the Norwegian Army Air Service, for which V\u00e6rnes was chosen as the initial station for Central Norway. Radio equipment was installed in 1919 and the first hangar was built in 1920. By 1922, the grass field serving as runway has become insufficient for newer planes, both in terms of length and level, but an extension was not performed until 1925. In 1927, parliament passed legislation to move the division to Rinnleiret from 1930, but this was later annulled. With the delivery of Fokker aircraft in 1930, the runway was again upgraded and extended.Hovd (2000): 80\u201390 V\u00e6rnes in 1936 V\u00e6rnes was surrendered to Luftwaffe on 9 April 1940, during the German occupation of Norway. On 24 April 350 civilians started construction at V\u00e6rnes, and within a few days 2,000 people were hired. On 28 April, a new wooden runway was completed. The expansion was part of the plans for Festung Norwegen and was used as a bomber base for attacks on Northern Norway. By May, there were 200 aircraft stationed at V\u00e6rnes. During the war, particularly in April 1940, the airport was subject to several bombings from the Royal Air Force (RAF). In June, work was started to clear the forests near the airport, and graves from the Viking Age were found. Construction was halted for several weeks while German and Norwegian archaeologists conducted research. In July, work started on building concrete runways, and by 1942 all three runways were finished. The east\u2013west was made long, the north\u2013south was made while the northwest\u2013southeast was made long. A number of taxiways were also constructed and a branch line of the railway was built to the hangars. By 1945, Luftwaffe had built about 100 buildings at V\u00e6rnes. The land expropriated was estimated at between .Hovd (2000): 116\u2013126 Luftwaffe had also finished the control tower that had been under construction since 1939.Hovd (2000): 301 Erhard Milch visits Luftwaffe troops on 23 April 1940 After the war ended, the airport was initial taken over by the Royal Air Force, but they soon withdrew leaving the Norwegian military in charge. Numerous squadrons, including 332, 331 and 337 were stationed at V\u00e6rnes in the post-war years. In 1952, the pilot school was moved to V\u00e6rnes, but in 1954 \u00d8rland Main Air Station became the main air force base in Central Norway, and the majority of the armed air forces (with the exception of the school) moved to \u00d8rland.Hovd (2000): 133\u2013172 ===Previous airports=== Civilian aviation in Tr\u00f8ndelag started in 1937, when Norwegian Air Lines (DNL) started seaplane services from Ilsvika and Jonsvannet in Trondheim. These were terminated during World War II, but taken up again by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Norwegian Air Force during the summer of 1945. They were terminated in November due to the weather and RAF's withdrawal. The following year, DNL started services again, this time from Hommelvik. During winter, the route was not operated. The service was operated with a Short Sandringham flying boat to Oslo and Northern Norway, and a Junkers Ju 52 to Western Norway. The southbound and northbound Sandringhams and the Junkers all met at Hummelvik to exchange passengers. There was only room for two planes at the quay, so the third aircraft had to be anchored in the fjord. In 1947, the airport had 3,500 passengers. On 2 October 1948, the Bukkene Bruse Accident occurred, where a Sandringham aircraft crashed during landing, killing 19 people. In 1949, a reserve airport was built at Skogn, and people were transported from Hommelvik to Skogn along the Nordland Line in case the reserve airport was used. DNL became part of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) in 1951\u2014the last year it used Hommelvik. Vestlandske Luftfartsselskap continued to use Hommelvik for some more year.Hovd (2000): 306\u2013308 Braathens SAFE started their route from Oslo Airport, Fornebu via Hamar Airport, Stafsberg and R\u00f8ros Airport on 18 August 1953. However, they chose to operate their de Havilland Herons from Trondheim Airport, Lade, just a few kilometers outside of the city center, in days with clear weather. Braathens SAFE moved all services to V\u00e6rnes in 1956.Tjomsland and Wilsberg (1995): 116\u2013117 ===Civilian establishment=== The second terminal, from 1965, as it stands in 2009 After World War II, there was only general aviation at V\u00e6rnes, organized by two clubs, V\u00e6rnes flyklubb and NTH flyklubb. From 1 August 1946 to 31 July 1947, there were 1,221 take-offs from V\u00e6rnes, mostly during the summer. During parts of 1946 and 1947, the airport was used as a pasture for sheep. The first scheduled service was introduced with a Douglas DC-3 operated to Oslo by DNL during the winter of 1947\u201348. While there were initially many customers, the lack of sufficient deicing caused low regularity and fewer customers through the season. The route was not reopened the following year.Hovd (2000): 308\u2013309 The air traffic control at V\u00e6rnes was established in 1946, after the air force had sent personnel to the United Kingdom for training. The Telecommunications Administration took over the responsibility for the radio installations, and the responsibility for the meteorological services became the responsibility of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center was also established to monitor all air space over Central Norway. In 1955, a glass dome was built on top of the control tower, giving a much better view of the air field.Hovd (2000): 299\u2013303 Prior to World War II, Heimdal had been proposed as a location for the primary airport for Trondheim. Construction had started with drainage and ground works, but this work was interrupted by the war. Because of the large investments made to V\u00e6rnes by Luftwaffe, a commission was established in 1947 to look into if V\u00e6rnes or Lade instead should be selected. The commission was unanimous in recommending V\u00e6rnes, highlighting that the airport was of a sufficient size to handle all civilian and military needs in the foreseeable future, and emphasized the proximity to the railway and highway. However, the commission recommended that Heimdal and Lade be kept as possibilities for future expansion. When the issue was discussed in Parliament, several members of the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications focused on the long distance to Trondheim, but the low investment needs (stipulated to NOK 1.3 million for necessary navigation and air control investments) convinced parliament, who passed legislation in favor of V\u00e6rnes on 10 June 1952.Hovd (2000): 172\u2013173 Runway 09; the civilian terminals are located to the right (south). The runway was extended to its current length in 1961, after artificial land had been built into the fjord. In 1956, NATO approved the plans for V\u00e6rnes to be financed through its infrastructure investment plan, after rejecting proposals for Heimdal. The costs were estimated at NOK 27.4 million and would allow the runway to be extended to support jet aircraft. Such an extension had already been done at \u00d8rland Main Air Station, but NATO wanted to have two military air station of such dimensions in Central Norway. The east\u2013west runway was to be extended to ; initial proposals had called for the extension to occur on the east side, but the Ministry of Defence instead wanted the expansion of the fjord-side to reduce expropriation costs. This called for a complex civil engineering program, as the railway and highway would have to pass under the runway in tunnels and an artificial island would have to be built in the fjord and the mouth of the Stj\u00f8rdal River be diverted.Hovd (2000): 173 SAS moved its seaplane services to V\u00e6rnes in 1952, and two-year later started flying the route from Oslo Airport, Fornebu via Trondheim to Bod\u00f8 Airport using Saab 90 Scandia aircraft. The first terminal was half a barracks located beside a military hangar. In 1956, Braathens SAFE moved its services from Lade to V\u00e6rnes, making the terminal too small for the needs. The whole barracks was taken into use in 1958, doubling the area.Hovd (2000): 309\u2013310 Braathens SAFE initially served flights to Trondheim from Oslo Airport, Fornebu with stop- overs at Hamar Airport, Stafsberg, and from 1957 at R\u00f8ros Airport, using de Havilland Heron aircraft.Tjomsland and Wilsberg (1995): 104\u2013108 Concession for the route from Bergen via the new \u00c5lesund Airport, Vigra to Trondheim was granted to Braathens SAFE from 1958.Tjomsland and Wilsberg (1995): 112 Braathens SAFE then also started using Fokker F-27 turboprops, at first on the Oslo-route, but later also on the West Coast route. When they were taken fully into use, the service to Hamar was terminated.Tjomsland and Wilsberg (1995): 118\u2013120 The old control tower in 1999, since demolished. In 1957, parliament started a new process to consider Heimdal as the primary airport, in part because the airlines and the Civil Aviation Administration stated that they felt V\u00e6rnes was insufficient. However, higher costs\u2014due to bad ground conditions and existing infrastructure at V\u00e6rnes, valuated at NOK 150 million\u2014caused parliament to support V\u00e6rnes. Construction of the new runway therefore commenced in January 1959, with the work subcontracted to Selmer. First the artificial peninsula was built, then the delta of the Stj\u00f8rdal River was moved, before a tunnel was built around the highway and railway. Finally, the runway could be built on top, and construction completed on 21 October 1961.Hovd (2000): 176\u2013177 In 1963, the airport had 115,000 passengers, increasing to 195,000 the following year. That year, SAS started using the Sud Aviation Caravelle jet aircraft on their route.Hovd (2000): 310 Parliament passed legislation for the construction of a new terminal in 1964, which opened on 5 December 1965. the following year, Wider\u00f8e started a seaplane route from V\u00e6rnes to Namsos, R\u00f8rvik, Br\u00f8nn\u00f8ysund, Sandnessj\u00f8en, Mo i Rana and Bod\u00f8. To serve the seaplanes, a quay was established at Hell. On 1 July 1968, four airports in Helgeland opened: Namsos Airport, H\u00f8knes\u00f8ra, Br\u00f8nn\u00f8ysund Airport, Br\u00f8nn\u00f8y, Sandnessj\u00f8en Airport, Stokka and Mo i Rana Airport, R\u00f8ssvoll. These were served by Wider\u00f8e with the land planes de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter.Hovd (2000): 312\u2013313 From 1 April 1967, Braathens SAFE was permitted to extend their West Coast service north to Bod\u00f8 and Troms\u00f8.Tjomsland and Wilsberg (1995): 165\u2013172 Starting in 1969, Braathens introduced Boeing 737-200 jet aircraft on the Oslo services and Fokker F-28 jet aircraft on the West Coast services.Tjomsland and Wilsberg (1995): 180\u2013182 In 1975, a third control tower was built, located right in front of (the yet to be built) Terminal A.Tjomsland and Wilsberg (1995): 302 Old check-in at Terminal B. Last used for charter flights until 2013, it was the main check-in from 1982 to 1994. In 1976, charter planes started operating to Trondheim, after a barracks was rebuilt to facilitate a border control. Several plans for a lager terminal were made, but these were delayed. In the late 1970s, the tarmac was expanded and a new taxiway built.Hovd (2000): 313\u2013315 Braathens SAFE opened a new hangar in 1979. The third terminal opened as an extension of the old one in May 1982. It was and the old terminal was converted to a cafeteria. Due to a heavy increase in traffic, the new terminal quickly became too small. During 1985 and 1986, a major overhaul of the main runway was made; it was dismantled and a new foundation and surface was laid. A number of new military buildings were constructed, along with six stands for large cargo aircraft and a new fuel system.Hovd (2000): 210\u2013211 In 1988, smaller adjustments, including new washrooms and longer baggage belts, were installed at the terminal. From 1986, Braathens SAFE retired its Fokker F-28, and the West Coast route to Molde was subcontracted to Busy Bee, who started to serve V\u00e6rnes with their Fokker F-27, and later Fokker 50, aircraft.Tjomsland and Wilsberg (1995): 280\u2013283 In 1992, SAS Cargo built a facility. After Busy Bee's bankruptcy, the regional services were taken over by Norwegian Air Shuttle from 22 January 1993. ===Fourth terminal and deregulation=== The fourth and current domestic terminal was opened on 15 November 1994. With of floor space it had seven gates, of which five had jetbridges. The two remaining gates were fitted with jetbridges in July 2012. V\u00e6rnes became the first airport in the Nordic Countries with a train station in the terminal, when Trondheim Airport Station opened. In March 1996, the old terminal was named Terminal B and all international flights were moved there. A new taxiway, which extended the full length of the runway, was opened in 1999, after more artificial land has been created and a second tunnel built for the highway and railway.Hovd (2000): 315\u2013316 The new terminal Oslo Airport, Gardermoen opened on 8 October 1998, replacing the congested Fornebu. For the first time, an airline could receive sufficient landing slots to challenge SAS and Braathens on domestic routes. The low-cost carrier Color Air was established, and started flights from Oslo to Trondheim using Boeing 737-300 aircraft. SAS and Braathens also saw the opportunity to increase the frequency on the route, and the three airlines between them introduced 39 daily flights. This made the route the fourth- busiest in Europe in terms of the number of aircraft. During this period, there were 84 daily departures to all destinations from V\u00e6rnes. Color Air filed for bankruptcy on 27 September 1999, ending a price war which had cost the airlines NOK 3 billion. By April 2000, the number of services by the main airlines was reduced to less than the level before the opening of Gardermoen, with 75 daily departures. Braathens had 33 daily departures, SAS had 22 and Wider\u00f8e had 20. Of Braathens' services, 14 were to Oslo, 15 to cities on the West Coast (of which four were operated by Norwegian Air Shuttle) and four were to Bod\u00f8, Harstad/Narvik and Troms\u00f8. SAS operated 15 daily flights to Oslo, while eight were operated to Bod\u00f8, Harstad/Narvik and Troms\u00f8. One flight was to their main hub in Copenhagen. This was the last year that SAS used DC-9s to Trondheim, phasing in Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft, supplemented by occasional MD-80s. Wider\u00f8e had 15 daily flights to STOLports in Helgeland, and five flights to Sandefjord. Two Wider\u00f8e Dash 8 aircraft at Terminal A; a Q400 used to Sandefjord and a \u2212100 used to Mo i Rana In 2002, SAS acquired Braathens, and the two companies coordinated their routes. All flights from Trondheim to Oslo-Gardermoen were taken over by SAS, who increased to 23 departures per day in each direction. This included a 30-minute headway from 06:30 to 09:30 and from 15:30 to 19:00. This made the route Trondheim\u2013Oslo the busiest in the country. The routes northwards were taken over by Braathens, who increased to six daily trips to Bod\u00f8 with connections northwards. The daily trip with Braathens to Harstad/Narvik was replaced by a two-round trips with SAS Commuter. Braathens retained the routes to the West Coast, with two flights to \u00c5lesund and seven to Bergen. In addition, Norwegian Air Shuttle continued with two flights to Molde. In 2004, SAS and Braathens merged to form SAS Braathens. The airline changed its name back to Scandinavian Airlines in 2007. From 1 September 2002, Norwegian Air Shuttle converted from a regional airline to a low-cost carrier and started competing on the route to Oslo. From 5 May 2003, Norwegian started a daily domestic service to Troms\u00f8, from 17 April 2004, they introduced two weekly services to Prague, Czech Republic, and from 26 June to Dubrovnik, Croatia. From 30 October, Norwegian introduced one weekly flight to Murcia, Spain, from 4 November, they introduced five weekly services to London Stansted Airport, United Kingdom. In 2005, Terminal B received a major upgrade, increasing the passenger area with . The airport was also rebuilt to 100% security control. The terminal received a new border control for flights to countries outside the Schengen Area and a duty-free store for both departing and arriving passengers.Avinor (2006): 27 A new tall control tower was also built. Gates 33 and 34 at Terminal A From 7 January 2006, Norwegian started a seasonal winter service to Salzburg, Austria; from 7 May 2006, they introduced one weekly service to Nice, France; On 1 April 2008, they started two weekly round trips to Warsaw, Poland; and from 1 June 2008, Norwegian introduced one daily evening flight to Bod\u00f8 and Troms\u00f8. In 2009, a new indoor parking lot opened, with a capacity of 1,200 cars. It replaced a site with 225 parking places and cost NOK 125 million. The same year saw the opening of the Radisson Blu hotel, costing NOK 220 million, and a new fire station for NOK 80 million. From 31 October 2009, Norwegian started a weekly service to Las Palmas, Spain. On 31 January 2010, SAS operated its last service to Molde. To compensate, the Molde-based Krohn Air was established to start flights between V\u00e6rnes and Molde Airport, \u00c5r\u00f8 on 3 February, using Dornier 328 aircraft operated by Sun Air of Scandinavia. On 22 February 2010, Nextjet commenced two daily round trips to \u00c5re \u00d6stersund Airport and Stockholm-Bromma Airport in Sweden. This connection ended during that year. Scandinavian already had flights to Stockholm. From 28 March 2010, Norwegian moved its three weekly services to London from Stansted to London Gatwick Airport. From 10 June to 30 August 2010, Icelandair operated two weekly services to their hub Keflav\u00edk International Airport using Boeing 757 aircraft. Among international destinations operating in 2018 but not 2010 are Tallinn, Krak\u00f3w and Gda\u0144sk. ==Future== Departure area at Terminal A In a master plan from 2006, Avinor has identified several key development issues to increase the capacity of the airport. For Terminal A, the plans call to keep the existing structure, and gradually expand it westwards, eventually passing over the railway on a culvert. Along the area between the railway and the highway, a south pier is planned to be constructed, with the inside facing immediately towards the railway and the outside having aircraft stands. In the short term, this is planned with six stands for regional aircraft, with a single-story building. The remaining stands currently used for regional aircraft will then be converted to international gates. While Avinor states that there is need for an expansion of Terminal B, no concrete solution has been found, in part because of the lack of space in the area, although this can partially be fixed by removing the general aviation from the area.Avinor (2006): 40 At both ends of the runway, the taxiway ends from the start of the runway, forcing aircraft which need the full length to backtrack. An extension of the taxiways would help with this problem.Avinor (2006): 39 Both at Terminal A and B, there will be a need for double taxiways. This will result in insufficient space for general aviation at its current location, and this has been proposed moved eastwards past the military installations. Several airlines, in particular Helitrans, has indicated need for more space. Proposals have been made to establish a heliport to allow flight to oil platforms on the Norwegian continental shelf.Avinor (2006): 42 The military has suggested to fill in a large section of the river delta at the west end of the runway, and move some of the cargo and helicopter operations there, but environmental concerns have been raised by among others Avinor. The cost of establishing access to the artificial land is also high.Avinor (2006): 44 By 2050, there may be need for a second, parallel runway to meet demand, and initial plans call for a runway which would be used by general aviation, regional airlines and helicopters. A Boeing 737-600 from Scandinavian Airlines Between 2009 and 2011, Avinor is extending the runway with into the fjord. The masses used for this are coming from the construction of the nearby Geving\u00e5sen Tunnel on the Nordland Line, which will help shorten the travel time of the airport rail link to Trondheim and increase frequency. Once finished, the line may be electrified. Work has commenced on building the E6 northwards to a four-lane highway from V\u00e6rnes past Stj\u00f8rdal. This is scheduled for completion in 2013. In 2016 some politicians suggested a name change to Hell International Airport, given that \u00c6 could be less suitable in the name of an international airport with the same problem if using the name of municipality and nearby village of Stj\u00f8rdal, so using the name of the nearest village Hell, which is easily writable on foreign keyboards, could be a good idea.B\u00f8r hete Hell International Airport A web vote on a newspaper site gave support for that.Du lander jo i Stj\u00f8rdal, ikke i Trondheim The name has not been changed (as of 2019). An official Facebook page called Hell International Airport, TRD is maintained by the airport itself.https://www.facebook.com/hellintl/ == Airlines and destinations == ===Overview=== Wider\u00f8e is a regional airline and uses Dash 8 aircraft to operate routes from south to north in Norway.
