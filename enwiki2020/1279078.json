    "text": "Ronald Frederick Bradley Tugnutt (born October 22, 1967) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender. Tugnutt played several seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Quebec Nordiques, Edmonton Oilers, Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Pittsburgh Penguins, Columbus Blue Jackets, and Dallas Stars. While a member of the Nordiques on March 21, 1991, Tugnutt set a modern-day NHL record for most saves in a regular-season game when he stopped 70 of 73 shots in a 3-3 tie with the Boston Bruins. After retiring as a player, Tugnutt served as the president, governor, and coach of the Central Canada Hockey League's Kemptville 73's. ==Playing career== ===Early years=== Tugnutt was born in Scarborough, Ontario. As a youth, he played in the 1980 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Toronto. Tugnutt played three seasons with the Peterborough Petes in the Ontario Hockey League, and won the F. W. \"Dinty\" Moore Trophy for the rookie with the best goals against average, followed by the Dave Pinkney Trophy for Top Team Goaltending, and was named to the OHL All Star team in 1987. ===NHL beginnings=== He was drafted by the Quebec Nordiques in the fourth round (87th overall) of the 1986 NHL Entry Draft. He was primarily used as a backup during his first three pro seasons, bouncing up and down between the Halifax Citadels of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the parent club in Quebec City. During 1990\u201391 NHL season, Tugnutt played what would be a career-high 56 games for Quebec and established himself as a quality NHL starter despite playing for what was then the worst team in the league. On March 21, 1991, Tugnutt stopped 70 of 73 shots to earn his team a 3-3 tie against the Boston Bruins, the second-highest number of saves made in a regular season game in NHL history. His performance evoked such respect that after it was over, several Bruins players skated over to congratulate Tugnutt.New York Times, March 21, 1991 The hometown Bruins fans gave him a standing ovation after the game ended as well. In the midst of an inconsistent 1991\u201392 NHL season, and with the emergence of St\u00e9phane Fiset as the Nordiques' number one goaltender, Tugnutt was demoted to the Nordiques' AHL affiliate. In exchange for Martin Ru\u010d\u00ednsk\u00fd, he was soon traded to the Edmonton Oilers to serve as Bill Ranford's backup. Tugnutt remained in this role until he was selected by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the 1993 expansion draft. In Anaheim, he split goaltending duties with Guy Hebert. Anaheim quickly settled on Hebert as their future starter, and the Montreal Canadiens decided that Andr\u00e9 Racicot and Les Kuntar were not adequately serving as Patrick Roy's backup, so Tugnutt was acquired by the Canadiens in exchange for Stephan Lebeau. Tugnutt's performance suffered; for Anaheim he had posted a .908 save percentage in 28 games, but for Montreal, he posted an .860 save percentage in eight games during the 1993-94 season. During the 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Bruins, Tugnutt started a game as Patrick Roy was recuperating from an appendectomy, but he did not return to the Canadiens for the 1995\u201396 season, and was replaced by Patrick Labrecque. These experiences caused Tugnutt to ponder retirement. ===Career breakthrough=== In 1995, Tugnutt signed a one-year deal with the Washington Capitals, and subsequently spent the entire 1995-96 season with their AHL affiliate, the Portland Pirates. He was productive in Portland, helping lead the Pirates to the Calder Cup Finals.The AHL.com, Portland rejuvanates Tugnutt's career This strong performance caught the attention of the Ottawa Senators. Goaltending coach Phil Myre helped Tugnutt work on fundamentals, and gained confidence and improved his game each season. While in Ottawa, he went from fighting for the backup position with Mike Bales to splitting duties with starter Damian Rhodes the next two seasons, and became the team's undisputed starting goaltender by 1999. On April 12, 1997, Tugnutt shutout the Buffalo Sabres in the final game of the regular season. Tugnutt's father had just died and immediately following the win Tugnutt pointed to the rafters to signify the win was for his father, in what became an iconic image of Tugnutt. This win propelled the Senators to their first playoff berth. In 1998\u201399, Tugnutt had the best season of his career, and one of the best by an NHL goaltender in the modern era. He posted a league-best goals against average of 1.79, placed second in the league in save percentage at .925, had a career high in wins, and tied a career high in shutouts. This outstanding play, and an injury to Curtis Joseph, gave Tugnutt the opportunity to play in the 1999 NHL All-Star Game. The next season, Rhodes was shipped to the expansion Atlanta Thrashers, giving Tugnutt sole possession of the starting job. However, he was unable to match his previous season and Ottawa traded him to the Pittsburgh Penguins for an experienced playoff goaltender, Tom Barrasso. After arriving in Pittsburgh, Tugnutt took over the starting job from Jean-S\u00e9bastien Aubin and helped lead Pittsburgh deep into the playoffs. Tugnutt was in goal for the May 4, 2000, playoff game against the Philadelphia Flyers in which he made 70 saves on 72 shots. The 72nd shot was a goal scored by Keith Primeau of the Flyers at 12:01 of the fifth overtime, winning the game for Philadelphia 2-1, the longest NHL game since the 1930s. Following his performance with Pittsburgh, Tugnutt became one of the most sought-after free agent goaltenders on the market. Both Ottawa and Pittsburgh attempted to re-sign Tugnutt but were unable to match the lucrative contract offered by the expansion Columbus Blue Jackets.Post- Gazette, Sens want Tugnutt Back, Tugnutt hot on free agent marketCanoe Sports Slam Hockey, Tugnutt Signs with Columbus During Columbus' inaugural season, Tugnutt was considered their backbone. Tugnutt's 22 wins broke another NHL record for most wins on an expansion team, and his .917 save percentage was among the best in the league.The Sports Network, Tugnutt was the backbone to Columbus The team's second season was not as impressive as the first. Tugnutt battled injuries and ended up sharing time with young netminder Marc Denis. General Manager Doug MacLean gave Denis the opportunity to be the sole starter on the club, and traded Tugnutt to the Dallas Stars.HockeyInformer.com, Denis had potential to be starter In 2002\u201303 Tugnutt was the backup to Marty Turco. In January 2003, Turco suffered an ankle injury that allowed Tugnutt to start almost 20 straight games, and he posted back to back shutouts during that stretch. For the season, he played 31 games and posted a 15-10-5 record including four shutouts. The 2003\u201304 season was possibly Tugnutt's toughest in the NHL, as by January he only received three starts. He was sent down to the minors for the first time in almost ten years to get some playing time with the Utah Grizzlies. Just five games in, Tugnutt pulled his groin and was out until after the All Star break.AllSports.com,Tugnutt pulls groin in minors Soon after, he was recalled to the Dallas Stars. After two solid starts, one of which was a shutout, Tugnutt received a break when Turco received a four- game suspension.ESPN, Turco Suspended 4 Games He retired following the 2003-04 season. ===Post-retirement=== After the lockout, Tugnutt joined CBC as a color commentator for Hockey Night in Canada.SLAM!

Tugnutt was a consultant with Hockey Canada until 2013 when that relationship ended. Tugnutt then moved behind the bench of his sons' team the Kemptville 73's. ==Off the ice== Tugnutt is married to wife Lisa, and the couple have two sons, Jacob and Matthew. The family resides on Stoney Lake near Peterborough, Ontario. Tugnutt enjoys boating and traveling. In the summer of 1998, Tugnutt was involved in a severe boating accident, and it was suspected that he might miss out on training camp. Tugnutt healed and had the best season of his career, breaking the modern-day NHL record for lowest G.A.A. and coming second in the league in save percentage.Hockey Goalies, Tugnutt Profile, and boating accident Tugnutt previously owned the Kemptville 73's, a Junior \"A\" ice hockey team, where he served as head coach, president and governor. Tugnutt sold the team to an ownership group led by former teammate Jason York. ==Honours and records== * Modern-day record holder for most saves in a regular season game non-loss (stopped 70 of 73 shots in a 3-3 tie with the Boston Bruins; March 21, 1991). * Holds Mighty Ducks of Anaheim record for most saves in a regular season game with 46, set against the Edmonton Oilers on November 21, 1993). * Tied with Dominik Ha\u0161ek for Ottawa Senators highest regular season save percentage. * Leader in save percentage for the 1999\u20132000 Playoffs. * Holds Pittsburgh Penguins record for highest save percentage in the playoffs. * Has Division named in his honour in the FCHL. ==International play== After a disappointing 4-game sweep in the NHL playoffs, Tugnutt was more than excited to play for Team Canada in the 1999 World Hockey Championship. The semi-final game was against the Czech Republic in which Canada lost after the game went undecided in overtime, ending in a shootout. This was Tugnutt's second appearance on Team Canada. He played for them in 1993 as well.Ottawa Sun, Shootout loss to Czechs ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:90%; text-align:center;\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"9\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"8\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
