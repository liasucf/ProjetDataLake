Formerly, she was a distinguished professor of physics at Michigan State University, the Dean of Lyman Briggs College, and the Associate Provost for Faculty and Academic Staff Development.Curriculum Vitae She has also held positions at Harvard University and Boston University.Compact Curriculum Vitae Simmons is married to fellow physicist, R. Sekhar Chivukula.Briggantine Together they have two children.MI ACE Network == Education == A graduate of Harvard University, Simmons earned her master's degree in physics from the University of Cambridge.Briggs Profile It was at the University of Cambridge where she wrote her thesis on the origins and symmetry of some incommensurate phases, under the direction of Volker Heine, PhD. Simmons would return to Harvard University for her PhD in Physics, in which Simmons wrote her thesis on electroweak and flavor symmetry breaking, under the direction of Howard Georgi, PhD. == Occupations == The first position Simmons held in academia was at Harvard University (1990\u201393), where she was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Physics specializing in Theoretical Particle Physics. In 1993, Simmons was hired by Boston University as an Assistant Professor of Physics. However, in 1998 Simmons was promoted to the title of Associate Professor of Physics\u2014where she would remain until 2003. During her time at Boston University, Simmons was appointed the Associate Chair for Undergraduate Studies (2001\u201303) in the Department of Physics. In 2002, Simmons was named the Director of Boston University\u2019s Learning Resource Network for Pre-College Outreach. After her time at Boston University, Simmons moved to Michigan State University where she was hired as a Professor in Physics in 2003. In addition to her position as Professor of Physics, Simmons was named the Director of Lyman Briggs School of Science. In 2007, the school returned to the college level and Simmons was named Dean of Lyman Briggs College.,WKAR Then in 2013, Simmons was promoted to the title of University Distinguished Professor of Physics. During the next year, Simmons was named the Acting Dean of the College of Arts and Letters (2014\u201315).MSU Today More recently, 2016, Simmons was appointed the position of Associate Provost for Faculty and Academic Staff Development. Simmons held three positions at Michigan State University: Dean of Lyman Briggs College, University Distinguished Professor of Physics, and Associate Provost for Faculty and Academic Staff Development. == Work on outreach and inclusion in science == === Women in STEM === \u201cElizabeth Simmons is a strong advocate for the advancement of women scholars in mathematics and science\u2026\u201d a quote from Dr. Lou Anna K. Simon, President of Michigan State University. One way that Simmons advocates for this advancement is through public speaking. Simmons argues that there are several contributing factors adding to the issue of gender inequity in STEM field\u2014such as implicit bias, gender schema, and stereotype threat. Observer Simmons proposes several solutions to some of these factors, which include increasing aware of implicit bias, promoting diversity for the betterment of STEM, and promoting gender-neutral parental leave. === QUEST === In addition to public speaking, Simmons and her husband founded Quantum Education for Students and Teachers better known as QUEST. QUEST is an outreach program, through Michigan State University, with the purpose of \u201csharing the fun and excitement of quantum physics with educators, students, and the general public.\u201dQUEST * List of Local Outreach Activities ** East Lansing Girls\u2019 Math Science Conference ** MSU Grandparents University ** MSU Lyman Briggs College\u2019s Spartan Science Day ** MSU Physics and Astronomy Research Opportunities for Undergraduates ** MSU Physics and Astronomy Society of Physics Students ** MSU Visiting International Professionals Programs * List of National Organizations Sponsoring Outreach Activities ** APS Division of Particles and Fields ** Aspen Center for Physics ** LHC Theory Initiative ** QuarkNet ** Summer Science Program, Inc. === LGBT physicists === Also, Elizabeth Simmons is a current member of the Ad-Hoc Committee on LGBT Issues for the American Physical Society.LGBT Climate The purpose of this committee is to look into issues relevant to LGBT, and other sexual- and gender-minority physicists.Feder The committee is responsible for investigating their (LGBT persons) \u201crepresentation in physics, assess the educational and professional climate in physics, recommend changes in policies and practices that impact LGBT physicists, and address other issues that affect inclusion.\u201d In March 2016, the Ad-Hoc Committee on LGBT Issues released their full report.American Physical Society The report covered several issues faced by the LGBT community, and touched on several possible recommendations. == Research == Simmons is a Theoretical Particle Physicist, and her research focuses on the origins of the masses of the elementary subatomic particles. Even further, Simmons is interested in the question of \u201cwhy we have mass at all?\u201dFaculty Conversation with Elizabeth Simmons Over the years, Simmons has contributed to over a hundred papers\u2014including published papers, conference papers, review papers, and more.Inspire Profile To see list of research articles, please visit Dr. Simmons\u2019 LBC Profile and her Full Curriculum Vitae. == Honors/awards == During Simmons\u2019 time at Boston University, she was honored with the American Association of University Women (Curie) Fellowship. The fellowships granted by the AAUW support female scholars who are completing dissertations, planning research, and preparing research for publication.AAUW In 2002, Simmons was awarded the United Methodist Church Scholar/Teacher of the Year. This award acknowledges outstanding scholars for their dedication to learning and to the institution. Later, in 2005, Simmons presented with the ACE Michigan Distinguished Women in Higher Education Leadership Award\u2014which is the highest honor given by the Michigan-ACE Network., MI ACE Award More recently, in February 2012, the American Physical Society named Simmons the Women Physicist of the Month.APS Woman of Month The following year (2013) Simmons was awarded the Robert F. Banks Award for Institutional Leadership\u2014an award reserved for any faculty member in recognition of extraordinary and sustained leadership that advances Michigan State University\u2019s commitment to connectivity, quality, and inclusion., Robert F.
