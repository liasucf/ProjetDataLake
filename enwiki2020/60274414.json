    "text": "Warrior Nun is an American fantasy drama streaming television series created by Simon Barry based on the comic book character Warrior Nun Areala by Ben Dunn. Originally developed as a feature film adaptation, the idea was re- imagined as a television series for Netflix when the service had given the production a series order for a first season. Filming takes place in multiple locations in Andalusia Spain, such as Antequera, where the headquarters of the fictional Order of the Cruciform Sword was filmed. The series is narrated and led by Portuguese actress Alba Baptista in the role of Ava Silva, a quadriplegic orphan who discovers she now has supernatural powers which force her to join an ancient order of warrior nuns. The series marks Baptista's English-language debut. The cast also features Toya Turner, Thekla Reuten, Lorena Andrea, Kristina Tonteri-Young and Tristan Ulloa. The series debuted on July 2, 2020 on Netflix, to generally positive reviews. In August 2020, the series has been renewed for a second season. ==Premise== Warrior Nun revolves around the story of a 19-year-old woman who wakes up in a morgue with a new lease on life and a divine artifact embedded in her back.

The El Tajo Gorge was featured in one of the scenes. ==Episodes== ==Release== On June 17, 2020, Netflix released the official trailer for the series, and the first season was released on July 2, 2020. ==Reception== On Rotten Tomatoes, the series has an approval rating of 70% based on 33 critic reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Though Warrior Nun heavy handed set-up weighs it down, committed performances and excellent fight choreography may be enough for those looking for more pulp with their pulpit.\" On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Roxana Hadadi of The A. V. Club wrote: \"The script can sometimes lean too much on mythological and religious exposition... but the actors have such good chemistry that their various pairings work, and the smartly choreographed fight scenes are well-placed.\" Hadadi said that \"Warrior Nun is undoubtedly familiar\" influenced by the likes of Veronica Mars, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Alex Garland's Devs, but that when the show really clicks it becomes \"its own distinct experience rather than simply a derivative facsimile of those inspirations.\" She praised the performances, particularly Toya Turner as Shotgun Mary, and gives the show a grade B-. Nicole Drum of ComicBook.com gave the review 3 out of 5, and wrote: \"Warrior Nun is a truly wild journey that manages to ask some tough questions while equally embracing its silliness, its action, and the absolute absurdity of it all. The show may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is one hell of a fun ride.\" While the majority of critics praised the choreography of the series, many took issue with the pacing of the plot and the extensive exposition of the plot. Robyn Bahr, of The Hollywood Reporter notes, \"Thematically, Warrior Nun is nothing you haven't seen before, and aesthetically, nothing you ever want to see again...leak, dour and trudging, the series contains none of the kitschy, blasphemous fun of its title.\" Critic Steve Murray notes that Warrior Nun has \"both potential and problems in equal measure\"; supposing that the series is trying to recreate the feel of Buffy the Vampire Slayer but with less witty dialogue and creativity. Reviewer Danielle Broadway of BlackGirlNerds states that, although the program has good intentions, Warrior Nun \"fails to live up to expectations\". Broadway says the elements of a good series are there, but \"if the plot, pacing, and character development (don't improve), there will be no resurrection for Season 2\". ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2020s American drama television series Category:2020s American supernatural television series Category:2020 American television series debuts Category:American fantasy drama television series Category:American action television series Category:Dark fantasy television series Category:Martial arts television series Category:Angels in television Category:Demons in television Category:Nuns in fiction Category:English-language television shows Category:English-language Netflix original programming Category:Television shows based on comics Category:Television series about orphans Category:Television about magic Category:Television shows filmed in Spain Category:Television shows set in Spain Category:Television shows set in Andalusia Category:Television shows set in Vatican City ",
