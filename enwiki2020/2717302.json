    "text": "Hellenic is the branch of the Indo-European language family whose principal member is Greek.In other contexts, \"Hellenic\" and \"Greek\" are generally synonyms. In most classifications, Hellenic consists of Greek alone,Browning (1983), Medieval and Modern Greek, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.Joseph, Brian D. and Irene Philippaki-Warburton (1987): Modern Greek. London: Routledge, p. 1. but some linguists use the term Hellenic to refer to a group consisting of Greek proper and other varieties thought to be related but different enough to be separate languages, either among ancient neighbouring languagesB.

(Online Paper) or among modern spoken dialects.David Dalby. The Linguasphere Register of the World's Languages and Speech Communities (1999/2000, Linguasphere Press). Pp. 449-450. ==Greek and ancient Macedonian== A family under the name \"Hellenic\" has been suggested to group together Greek proper and the ancient Macedonian language, which is barely attested and whose degree of relatedness to Greek is not well known. The suggestion of a \"Hellenic\" group with two branches, in this context, represents the idea that Macedonian was not simply a dialect within Greek but a \"sibling language\" outside the group of Greek varieties proper.LinguistList, Ancient Macedonian Other approaches include Macedonian as a dialect of Greek properRoisman, Worthington, 2010, \"A Companion to Ancient Macedonia\", Chapter 5: Johannes Engels, \"Macedonians and Greeks\", p. 95:\"This (i.e. Pella curse tablet) has been judged to be the most important ancient testimony to substantiate that Macedonian was a north-western Greek and mainly a Doric dialect\". or as an unclassified Paleo-Balkan language.For a survey of different views, see Brixhe C., Panayotou A. (1994), \"Le Mac\u00e9donien\", in Bader, F. (ed.), Langues indo-europ\u00e9ennes, Paris:CNRS \u00e9ditions, 1994, pp 205\u2013220. ==Modern Hellenic languages== In addition, some linguists use the term \"Hellenic\" to refer to modern Greek in a narrow sense together with certain other, divergent modern varieties deemed separate languages on the basis of a lack of mutual intelligibility. Separate language status is most often posited for Tsakonian, which is thought to be uniquely a descendant of Doric rather than Attic Greek, followed by Pontic and Cappadocian Greek of Anatolia.Ethnologue: Family tree for Greek. The Griko or Italiot varieties of southern Italy are also not readily intelligible to speakers of standard Greek.N. Nicholas (1999), The Story of Pu: The Grammaticalisation in Space and Time of a Modern Greek Complementiser. PhD Dissertation, University of Melbourne. p. 482f. (PDF) Separate status is sometimes also argued for Cypriot, though this is not as easily justified. In contrast, Yevanic (Jewish Greek) is mutually intelligible with standard Greek but is sometimes considered a separate language for ethnic and cultural reasons. Greek linguistics traditionally treats all of these as dialects of a single language.G. Horrocks (1997), Greek: A History of the Language and its Speakers. London: Longman.P.
