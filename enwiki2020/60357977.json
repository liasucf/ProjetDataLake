    "text": "Tradition Lives is a 2016 studio album by American country music singer Mark Chesnutt. It was released in 2016 on Nada Dinero Records. ==Content== The album includes the track \"There Won't Be Another Now\", a cover of a Merle Haggard song from his 1985 album Kern River. Chesnutt had recorded the song several years prior and had not intended for it to be an album, but chose to include it because the album had been released shortly after Haggard's death. ==Critical reception== Giving it 3.5 out of 5 stars, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote to \"Throughout the album, Chesnutt keeps things simple, spare, and easy, keeping the focus on the song and the instrumental interplay -- the very things that make for great country, of which this is proudly part of that long tradition.\" ==Track listing== #\"I've Got a Quarter in My Pocket\" (Billy Yates, John Ludowitz) - 2:46 #\"Is It Still Cheating\" (Randy Houser, Jamey Johnson, Jerrod Niemann) - 3:50 #\"Lonely Ain't the Only Game in Town\" (Don Poythress, Jimmy Ritchey, Donnie Skaggs) - 2:57 #\"Oughta Miss Me by Now\" (Trey Mathews, Tony Ramey) - 3:35 #\"Neither Did I\" (Monty Criswell, Tim Menzies, Ritchey) - 4:09 #\"So You Can't Hurt Me Anymore\" (Roger Springer, William Michael Morgan, Ritchey) - 3:49 #\"You Moved Up in Your World\" (Dale Dodson, Brett Eldredge, Curly Putman) - 3:24 #\"Look at Me Now\" (Blaine Larsen, Poythress, Ritchey) - 4:14 #\"Losing You All Over Again\" (Larsen, Poythress, Ritchet) - 3:52 #\"Never Been to Texas\" (Chesnutt, Springer, Slugger Morrissette) - 3:16 #\"What I Heard\" (Byron Hill, Cary Stone) - 3:16 #\"Hot\" (Poythress, Wynn Varble) - 3:44 #\"There Won't Be Another Now\" (Red Lane) - 4:16 ==Personnel== *Eddie Bayers - drums *Jim \"Moose\" Brown - piano, B-3 organ *Mark Chesnutt - lead vocals *Larry Franklin - fiddle *Wes Hightower - background vocals *Mike Johnson - steel guitar, dobro *B.
