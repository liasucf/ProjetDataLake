    "text": "Igor Vuki\u0107 (born 26 January 1966) is a Croatian journalist and historical negationist. He is an author of books on the Jasenovac concentration camp, including Radni logor Jasenovac (Jasenovac Labour Camp), which advances his thesis that Jasenovac was simply a labour camp, rather than an extermination camp as accepted by all serious scholars. He does not have a degree in history. == Career == Vuki\u0107 worked as a journalist in newspapers: Vjesnik (1990\u20131991), Novi list (1994\u20132001), Jutarnji list (2001\u20132005), Poslovni dnevnik (2005\u20132009) and Privredni vjesnik (2009\u20132016). He worked at Kutina Television (1992\u20131993). Currently, he writes a column for Hrvatski tjednik, a weekly magazine from Zadar. On 30 May 2018, Vuki\u0107 was invited as a guest on the \"Good afternoon, Croatia\" programme on the state owned broadcaster HRT where he stated among other things, that Jasenovac had served as a labour camp or a prison for active opponents of the state and for Jews excluded from deportation to Germany, and described Ustasha leader Ante Pavelic as the most responsible person for rescuing camp inmates. The public institution running the Jasenovac memorial complex (JUSP) condemned Vuki\u0107's views and criticized the station for giving him a platform. Vuki\u0107's appearance was also condemned by members of the Jewish community in Croatia who were \"insulted, shocked, and disturbed\" by the ideas and views expressed in the program. Vuki\u0107 reportedly received a grant of 50000 HRK in 2018 for his project that denies the Ustashe crimes in the Jasenovac extermination camp. The project is entitled \"Dru\u0161tvo za istra\u017eivanje trostrukog logora Jasenovac\" (Society for research of the triple camp of Jasenovac), and Vuki\u0107 is its secretary, with Stjepan Razum being its president. == See also == * Josip Pe\u010dari\u0107 * Stjepan Razum == References == == External links == * Croatia's media and the problem with historical revisionism * Branimir Jankovi\u0107 \u2013 Javna povijest \u2013 Javni status znanja o Jasenovcu ili kako je javna povijest porazila akademsku historiografiju Category:Living people Category:1966 births Category:People from Zagreb Category:Serbs of Croatia Category:Croatian journalists Category:University of Zagreb alumni Category:Croatian Holocaust deniers Category:Genocide of Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia deniers ",
