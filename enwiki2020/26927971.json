While in intent/frame I und II (2000 und 2001) she was still working with interpersonal relations and behaviour patterns, in other feature (2002) she took up the human body as a mobile, organic mass. This continued with the solo exposition corps (2003) and superposition corps (2004). Secret sight (2009) observed and explored the interstices and lines between the bodies. Finally, pictographic events (2010) works with a large pool of signs and body images. == Awards == * 2000: Prix d\u2019Auteur du Conseil G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de la Seine-Saint-Denis/ Bagnolet for \u201cDo your desires still burn\u201d * 2002: Austrian Dance Production Prize for \u201cother feature\u201d == Works/Projects == exposition corps cat freeze 2 superposition corps ;Choreographies for DANS.KIAS * Duras-Trilogie (1995\u20131997) * Do Your Desires Still Burn (1998) * Distance.Two.Near (1999) * Chat Gap (1999) * in.tent//frame 1 (2000) * in.tent//frame 2 (2001) * other feature (2002) * exposition corps (2003) * superposition corps (2004) * Your body is the shoreline (2005) * Jours Blancs (2006) * F on a pale ground (2007) * cat in a deep freeze, bzw. cat freeze 2 (2007) * secret sight (2008) ;Guest choreographies: * out.of.between (1999) for the ballet of the Vienna State Opera * emerge behind your eyes (2000) f\u00fcr das TanzTheaterWien ;Collaboration with other artists: * rrr\u2026 (2001) \u2013 a solo developed in collaboration with Beno\u00eet Lachambre/CAN (artistic direction) and Laurent Goldring/F (video exhibition) for the opening of the Tanzquartier Wien * philosophy on stage (2005) \u2013 a project initiated by the Austrian philosopher Arno B\u00f6hler and the actor Susanne Granzer. * fiction in between (2008) \u2013 a duet with Fabrice Ramalingom ;Productions: * 2002: production/direction of the Wien Modern festival (conductor: Peter Rundl/D) * 2004: Music-theatre project Labyrinth, a collaboration between Wolfgang Mitterer (music), Alexej Paryla (video) and Saskia H\u00f6lbling (dance) * 2009: production of three works by Luciano Berio: Naturale, Visage and Sequenza V in the Neue Saal of the Vienna Konzerthaus under the title Berio in Bewegung * 2009: Production of the theatre work Hamletmaschine by Heiner M\u00fcller, a theatre-direction work commissioned by the Max Reinhardt Seminar for third-year students. ==References== == External links == * Official Website * Saskia H\u00f6lbling on website of University Vienna Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Dancers from Vienna Category:Austrian choreographers Category:Austrian female dancers Category:Contemporary dancers ",
