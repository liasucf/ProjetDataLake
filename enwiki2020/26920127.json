    "text": "' (prov. designation: ) is a dark Jupiter trojan from the Trojan camp, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 9 October 1989, by Japanese astronomer Yoshiaki Oshima at the Gekko Observatory east of Shizuoka, Japan. The assumed C-type asteroid belongs to the 70 largest Jupiter trojans. It is possibly elongated in shape and has a rotation period of 8.8 hours. It has not yet been named since its numbering in January 1991. == Orbit and classification == ' is orbiting in the trailering Trojan camp, at Jupiter's Lagrangian point, 60\u00b0 behind the Gas Giant's orbit in a 1:1 resonance . It is also a non-family asteroid of the Jovian background population. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.9\u20135.4 AU once every 11 years and 7 months (4,218 days; semi-major axis of 5.11 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.05 and an inclination of 19\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken at Palomar Observatory in October 1954, or 35 years prior to its official discovery observation at Gekko. == Numbering and naming == This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 30 January 1991 (). Since then, most low-numbered minor planets have received a name. Up to number 5000, only a small group of Jupiter trojans and near-Earth asteroids remain unnamed: * * * * * * '''''' * * == Physical characteristics == ' is an assumed C-type asteroid. It has a V\u2013I color index of 0.85, slightly below that seen for most Jovian D-type asteroids (also seen table below). === Rotation period === A rotational lightcurve of ' was first obtained by Stefano Mottola in November 1991, using the Loiano 1.52-meter telescope at Bologna Observatory in Italy. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.46 magnitude (). In September 2012, it was also observed in the R-band by astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory in California (). Since January 2015, several photometric observations by Robert Stephens at the Center for Solar System Studies in California confirmed Mottola's period determination from 1991, and measured a brightness amplitude of 0.50\u20130.53, which is indicative of a non-spherical, possibly elongated shape (). === Diameter and albedo === According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, ' measures between 62.10 and 65.93 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.060 and 0.079. It has not been observed by the Supplemental IRAS Minor Planet Survey. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous asteroid of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 63.91 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.7. == Notes == == References == == External links == * Lightcurve Database Query (LCDB), at www.minorplanet.info * Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (1)-(5000) \u2013 Minor Planet Center * * 004715 Category:Discoveries by Yoshiaki Oshima 19891009 ",
