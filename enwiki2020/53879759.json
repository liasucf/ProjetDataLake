    "text": "Archbishop Sava's Zakonopravilo (1262 manuscript of 1219 original). Medieval Serbian law comprises the legislation used in the Medieval Serbian state. From the 12th to 15th centuries (during the dynasties of Nemanji\u0107, Lazarevi\u0107 and Brankovi\u0107) there is a relatively large collection of legal documents. All legal acts were created through the monarch's legislative activity, although with strong influence from neighbouring states and cities (the Byzantine Empire, first and foremost, Republic of Ragusa, Dalmatian cities, Republic of Venice, and partly the Kingdom of Hungary). Medieval Serbian legal sources may be divided into charters, international treaties, codes of law and city statutes. The oldest known legal source is the monastery charter to Hilandar (1198\u201399) by Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja. ==See also== *Medieval Serbian charters *Serbian manuscripts ==References== ==Sources== ;Books * * * * * * * * ;Journals * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Medieval Serbian state Serbian ",
