Abergelle cattle are part of the Zenga breed group. The Abergele breed is known for its adaptation to the hotter and drier lowlands. It is also very tolerant to diseases and parasites and can cope with feed shortages during long dry periods. == Physical characteristics == The Abergele cattle generally have red coat colours. Bulls and oxen have thick and short horns and a cervicothoracic hump; cows have medium, thin horns. Oxen weigh 234kg and cows 153 kg on average. The average height at withers of 109 and 97 cm. ==Closely related types== * Arado cattle == Origin of the cattle breed == Ethiopia has been at a crossroads for cattle immigration to Africa due to * proximity to the geographical entry of Indian and Arabian zebu * proximity to Near-Eastern and European taurine * introgression with West African taurine due to pastoralism Furthermore, the diverse agro-ecology led to diverse farming systems which, in turn, made Ethiopia a centre of secondary diversi\ufb01cation for livestock : * The Sanga cattle originated in Ethiopia. They are a major bovine group in Africa \u2013 a cross-breeding of local long-horned taurines and Arabian zebus * The Zenga (Zebu-Sanga) breeds (including the Abergele), which resulted from a second introduction and crossing with Indian zebu == Stresses on the cattle breed == * socio-political: urbanisation, and civil wars * panzootic: cattle plague * environmental: destruction of ecosystems and droughts * modernisation stresses: extensive cross-breeding == References == Category:Cattle breeds Category:Cattle breeds originating in Ethiopia Category:Tigray Region ",
