    "text": "are a set of 863 Chinese characters known as \"name kanji\" in English. They are a supplementary list of characters that can legally be used in registered personal names in Japan, despite not being in the official list of \"commonly used characters\" (j\u014dy\u014d kanji). \"Jinmeiy\u014d kanji\" is sometimes used to refer to the characters in both the jinmeiy\u014d and j\u014dy\u014d lists. A ministerial decree of 1946 limited the number of officially sanctioned kanji for public use to the 1850 t\u014dy\u014d kanji. Only kanji on this list were acceptable as registered names, despite the fact that the list excluded many kanji frequently used in names up to that point. However, on May 25, 1951, the cabinet extended the set of characters usable in names by specifying the first 90 jinmeiy\u014d kanji. Over the years, the Minister of Justice has increased the number of name kanji, and has a plan for further addition in response to requests from parents. As of April 30, 2009, there were 985 jinmeiy\u014d kanji, but this number was reduced to 861 in late 2010 when 129 jinmeiy\u014d characters were transferred to the j\u014dy\u014d kanji list, and 5 characters were transferred from the j\u014dy\u014d kanji list to jinmeiy\u014d characters. In 2015 and 2017, 2 kanji in total were added to the jinmeiy\u014d list, making the total number 863. In Japan, name kanji are taught at the junior-high level, and mastery of the name kanji is required to achieve Level 2 of the Kanji Kentei, a Chinese-character proficiency test. ==History== Below is a list of changes made to the jinmeiy\u014d kanji list since its creation in 1951. ===May 25, 1951=== The first 92 characters of jinmeiy\u014d kanji were published: :\u4e11 \u4e1e \u4e43 \u4e4b \u4e5f \u4e98 \u4ea5 \u4ea6 \u4ea8 \u4eae \u4f0a \u5321 \u536f \u53ea \u543e \u5442 \u54c9 \u5609 \u572d \u5948 \u5b8f \u5bc5 \u5dcc \u5df3 \u5e84 \u5f18 \u5f25 \u5f66 \u608c \u6566 \u660c \u6643 \u664b \u667a \u66a2 \u670b \u6842 \u6850 \u6960 \u6a58 \u6b23 \u6b3d \u6bc5 \u6d69 \u6df3 \u718a \u723e \u732a \u73b2 \u7422 \u745e \u7766 \u78ef \u7950 \u7984 \u798e \u7a14 \u7a63 \u7dbe \u60e3 \u8061 \u8087 \u80e4 \u8276 \u8526 \u85e4 \u862d \u864e \u8776 \u8f14 \u8fb0 \u90c1 \u9149 \u9326 \u938c \u9756 \u9808 \u99a8 \u99d2 \u9bc9 \u9bdb \u9db4 \u9e7f \u9ebf \u4e80 Seven of them were later transferred to the j\u014dy\u014d kanji: :\u4ed9 \u5c1a \u6749 \u751a \u78e8 \u6589 \u9f8d With the last one also being simplified to (dragon). ===July 30, 1976=== 28 kanji were added, for a total of 120 characters. :\u4f51 \u5141 \u51b4 \u55ac \u601c \u65ed \u674f \u6893 \u68a2 \u68a8 \u6c99 \u6e1a \u7460 \u77b3 \u7d17 \u7d18 \u7d62 \u7fe0 \u8036 \u8299 \u831c \u85cd \u90a3 \u963f \u96bc \u9b8e \u8475 One was later transferred to the j\u014dy\u014d kanji: . ===October 1, 1981=== Introduction of the j\u014dy\u014d kanji list, which includes the 8 characters mentioned above; those 8 are thus removed from the jinmey\u014d kanji list. 54 other characters are added for a total of 166 name characters. :\u4f0d \u4f36 \u4f91 \u5c2d \u5b5f \u5cfb \u5d69 \u5dba \u5df4 \u5f6c \u60c7 \u60df \u6167 \u6590 \u65e6 \u6602 \u674e \u6817 \u6953 \u69d9 \u6c50 \u6d35 \u6d38 \u6e25 \u745b \u7476 \u7483 \u752b \u7693 \u7738 \u77e9 \u78a7 \u7b39 \u7dcb \u7fd4 \u8129 \u82d1 \u8309 \u8389 \u840c \u8429 \u84c9 \u8557 \u8679 \u8ad2 \u8d73 \u8fea \u9065 \u907c \u971e \u980c \u99ff \u9ce9 \u9df9 ===March 1, 1990=== 118 kanji were added for a total of 284 characters. :\u4f0e \u4f3d \u4f83 \u5016 \u502d \u5072 \u51b6 \u51cc \u51dc \u51ea \u637a \u65bc \u65fa \u6634 \u664f \u665f \u6668 \u6689 \u66d9 \u6714 \u51f1 \u52c1 \u53e1 \u53f6 \u5504 \u5544 \u594e \u5a9b \u5b09 \u5ba5 \u5d1a \u5d50 \u5d6f \u5dfd \u5f57 \u5f6a \u6055 \u61a7 \u62f3 \u6377 \u675c \u67ca \u67da \u67fe \u681e \u68a7 \u690b \u690e \u6930 \u693f \u694a \u699b \u69fb \u6a3a \u6a80 \u6bec \u6c40 \u6c70 \u6d32 \u6e67 \u6ec9 \u6f31 \u6faa \u7199 \u71ce \u71e6 \u71ff \u723d \u7396 \u7433 \u745a \u7473 \u7690 \u7709 \u77ad \u78a9 \u79e6 \u7a00 \u7a1c \u7ae3 \u7b19 \u7d2c \u7d43 \u7d9c \u7db8 \u7dba \u8000 \u80e1 \u821c \u82b9 \u8304 \u8305 \u839e \u83d6 \u83eb \u8494 \u84bc \u84ee \u8549 \u887f \u8888 \u88df \u8a62 \u8abc \u8ac4 \u9091 \u9187 \u91c7 \u96db \u97a0 \u98af \u9b41 \u9cf3 \u9d3b \u9d6c \u9e9f \u9ece \u9edb ===December 3, 1997=== 1 kanji was added, for a total of 285 characters. :\u7409 ===February 23, 2004=== 1 kanji was added, for a total of 286 characters. :\u66fd ===June 7, 2004=== 1 kanji was added, for a total of 287 characters. :\u7345 ===June 11, 2004=== No addition to the jinmeiy\u014d kanji was made on this date. However, a plan for 578 additions was put forward to the council on jinmeiy\u014d kanji of the legislative council of the Ministry of Justice. The list included certain characters in strong demand by parents for use in their children's names, such as: * (ichigo, \"strawberry\") * (haruka, \"distant\", traditional variant) * (akira, \"scintillating\") * (kiba, \"fang\") Many others were included not for their potential uses in names (as is noted), but rather because of their frequent use and being easy to read and write. Examples include: * (kuso, \"excrement\") * (noroi, \"curse\") * (shikabane, \"corpse\") * (gan, \"cancer\") At this same council, the decision was made to call for suggestions on characters to be included or excluded via the Ministry of Justice website, until July 9, 2004. ===July 12, 2004=== 3 kanji were added, for a total of 290 characters. :\u6bd8 \u7027 \u99d5 ===July 23, 2004=== No additions were made. After sharp protests, the council decided to withdraw nine characters from the 489 whose inclusion had been discussed. These nine characters were: * (kuso, \"excrement\") * (noroi, \"curse\") * (shikabane, \"corpse\") * (gan, \"cancer\") * (kansuru, \"rape, seduction\") * (midara, \"obscene\") * (urami, \"resentment\") * (ji, \"hemorrhoids\") * (mekake, \"concubine\") The 480 other characters still remained under consideration for inclusion, with one additional character added to them, namely (kiku, \"to draw up water with one's hands\"). ===September 27, 2004=== 484 characters and variant forms of 209 j\u014dy\u014d kanji were added, bringing the total number of the jinmeiy\u014d kanji to 983. ===April 30, 2009=== 2 more characters were added for a total number of 985 characters. :\u7977 \u7a79 ===November 30, 2010=== In late 2010, the Japanese government added 196 characters to the j\u014dy\u014d kanji list. The list now includes 129 characters previously classified as jinmeiy\u014d kanji, 11 of which are currently used in Japanese prefectures or nearby countries:Akihiko Shiraishi, (\"New draft table adds 196 everyday-use kanji\") in Asahi Shimbun, 23 October 2009, retrieved 25 October 2009.

making the total number of jinmeiy\u014d kanji 861: * (shaku, an old unit of measure approx. 18ml in volume, or 0.033m\u00b2 in area) * (sui or tsumu, a spindle or weight) * (sen, pig iron) * (ch\u014d or fuku[reru], to swell or bulge; mostly used in the compound , normally rewritten with instead) * (momme, a unit of weight approx 3.75g) ===January 7, 2015=== 1 kanji was added, for a total
