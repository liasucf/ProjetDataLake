The Bouloussou family of Yanam is one of the prominent native families in Yanam, Puducherry, since, French Indian era. Many members of that family have been successful in politics and engineering. Some others include that of Kamichetty, Mazety, Madimchetty, Nallam, Bezawada, Manyam etc.The Telugus of Yanam and Masulipatnam: From French rule to Integration with India (2007), by J B Prashant More.Frenchi Palanalo Yanam (2013), by Bolloju Baba. ==Origin== The people of surname Bouloussou/Bulusu (\u0c2c\u0c41\u0c32\u0c41\u0c38\u0c41) belong to Telugu Brahmins of smarta tradition with Gautama sagotraBrahmanula Indlaperlu Gotralu Pravaralu (2016), Mohan Publications, Rajahmundry-1. and adhere to \u0100pastamba Dharmas\u016btra from the Taitt\u012briya \u015b\u0101kh\u0101 of Krishna Yajurveda. The difference in orthography of the name is due to French and English translations, where it is written as Bouloussou in the former and Bulusu in the latter. As per narration in Narayaneeyam (Telugu) written by Sri Kalluri Venkata Subrahmanya Deekshitulu,Narayaneeyam, Sri Kalluri Venkata Subrahmanya Deekshitulu, Published by B.V.S.S.Mani, 95, Broadway, Madras, 1977 the original folk bearing this surname used to reside within the Kakatiya domain and the surname came from a common Telugu dish pulusu (\u0c2a\u0c41\u0c32\u0c41\u0c38\u0c41), which implies a spicy tamarind sauce in Telugu states. This surname over a period of time changed to Bulusu and the Islamic invasions forced the folk to move towards velanadu region. The any smarta vaidiki brahmin who resided in that region started to be referred traditionally as Velanati vaidika (\u0c35\u0c46\u0c32\u0c28\u0c3e\u0c1f\u0c3f \u0c35\u0c48\u0c26\u0c3f\u0c15) or recently in modern times as Vaidika velanatlu (\u0c35\u0c48\u0c26\u0c3f\u0c15 \u0c35\u0c46\u0c32\u0c28\u0c3e\u0c1f\u0c4d\u0c32\u0c41). The paternal ancestors of this Bouloussou family hail from nearby Ainapuram village situated the other side of Gautami Godavari river in the Konaseema region of Andhra Pradesh. Hence, they refer themselves as Ainapuram Bulusu to distinguish themselves from other Bulusu families. When and how this family moved to nearby French colony of Yanaon remains unknown. ==Prominent persons== Bouloussou Soubramaniom Sastroulou was politician, judge advocate at Yanam during early twentieth century.

On the eighth day of that festival, V\u0101hanam (Chariot carrying the holy deities) of the day will be Panchamukha \u0100njaneya V\u0101hanam (\u0c2a\u0c02\u0c1a\u0c2e\u0c41\u0c16\u0c3e\u0c02\u0c1c\u0c28\u0c47\u0c2f \u0c35\u0c3e\u0c39\u0c28\u0c2e\u0c41), i.e., The Five-headed Anjaneya Chariot. The Bulusu family were original sponsors of that day (\u0c09\u0c24\u0c4d\u0c38\u0c35 \u0c28\u0c3f\u0c30\u0c4d\u0c35\u0c3e\u0c39\u0c15\u0c41\u0c32\u0c41).

Other prominent native families who are sponsors of this festival are Bezawada, Singamsetty, Nallam, Grandhi and Kamichetty, etc. After independence of French India in 1962, none of them opted for restoration of French nationality.
