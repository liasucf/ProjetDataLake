This example is from around 1875 Henry Moule (1801\u20131880) was a priest in the Church of England and inventor of the dry earth toilet, a type of pail closet. ==Life== ===Education and priesthood=== Moule, sixth son of George Moule, solicitor and banker, was born at Melksham, Wiltshire, on 27 January 1801, and educated at Marlborough Grammar School. He was elected a foundation scholar of St John's College, Cambridge, and graduated B.A. 1821 and M.A. 1826. He was ordained to the curacy of Melksham in 1823, and took sole charge of Gillingham, Dorset, in 1825. He was made vicar of St George's at Fordington in the same county in 1829, and remained there for the remainder of his life. For some years he undertook the duty of chaplain to the troops in Dorchester barracks, for whose use, as well as for a detached district of his own parish, he built in 1846, partly from the proceeds of his published \u2018Barrack Sermons,\u2019 1845 (2nd edit. 1847), a church known as Christ Church, West Fordington. In 1833 his protests brought to an end the evils connected with the race meetings at Dorchester. ===Dry earth closet=== Moule's earth closet design, circa 1909. During the cholera epidemics of 1849 and 1854 his exertions were unwearied. Impressed by the insalubrity of the houses, especially in the summer of 1858 (the Great Stink), he turned his attention to sanitary science, and invented what is called the dry earth system. In partnership with James Bannehr, he took out a patent for the process (No. 1316, dated 28 May 1860). Among his works bearing on the subject were: \u2018The Advantages of the Dry Earth System,\u2019 1868; \u2018The Impossibility overcome: or the Inoffensive, Safe, and Economical Disposal of the Refuse of Towns and Villages,\u2019 1870; \u2018The Dry Earth System,\u2019 1871; \u2018Town Refuse, the Remedy for Local Taxation,\u2019 1872, and \u2018National Health and Wealth promoted by the general adoption of the Dry Earth System,\u2019 1873. His system was adopted in private houses, in rural districts, in military camps, in many hospitals, and extensively in the British Raj. ===Later years=== He also wrote an important work, entitled \u2018Eight Letters to Prince Albert, as President of the Council of the Duchy of Cornwall,\u2019 in 1855, prompted by the condition of Fordington parish, belonging to the duchy. In two letters in the Times of 24 February and 2 April 1874 he advocated a plan for extracting gas from Kimmeridge shale. He died at Fordington vicarage on 3 February 1880. ===Family=== Moule married Mary Mullett Evans in 1824; she died on 21 August 1877.
