With Socceroos Archie Thompson and Kevin Muscat in the squad, and the experience of 2 European internationals in Geoffrey Claeys and Richard Kitzbichler, expectations from the Melbourne fans were high. But they were left disappointed when the club finished the season 7th out of the 8 teams. After a promising start which saw them 1st after round 8, when they beat eventual champions Sydney FC 5\u20130, the team then won only 3 of the last 13 games. During the second season, The Victory won the 2006\u201307 A-League Premiership, 12 points clear of second placed Adelaide United. Melbourne Victory faced Adelaide United in the A-League Grand Final at the Telstra Dome on 18 February, winning the match 6\u20130 with Archie Thompson scoring an incredible five goals. The 2007\u20132008 season was a return to the disappointment of Merrick's first year in charge however, with the team finishing outside the Top 4 spots and thus failing to progress to the Finals Series. Melbourne Victory finished second in the group phase of the 2008 Asian Champions League. Gamba Osaka won the group and went on to win the Asian Champions League. In the 2008\u20132009 season, Melbourne Victory won the treble; the Pre-Season Cup, the Premiership and the Grand Final. In the Grand Final, Melbourne Victory defeated Adelaide United 1\u20130 to secure their second championship under Ernie Merrick's coaching. During the 2009\u20132010 season, Melbourne Victory, despite severe season-ending knee injuries to key players, Billy Celeski, Matthew Kemp and star striker Archie Thompson once again reached the Grand Final. Sydney FC took out the title after extra time on penalties. Kevin Muscat and Marvin Angulo missed their penalty kicks, allowing Sydney to take out the championship.

The board of Melbourne Victory stated that they were unhappy with Victory's season and the 5\u20131 defeat by Gamba Osaka in Japan in the opening match of the Asian Champions League. Anthony Di Pietro, chairman of Melbourne Victory, said \"Our club sets extremely high standards and we are disappointed with the results of the recent A-League season and also our start to the Champions League campaign\" and that \"Our intent is to continue to be the benchmark club in the A-League. We wish to be successful in Asia and believe this decision will assist in taking us to that level.\"Foxsports Australia http://www.foxsports.com.au/football/a-league/a-league-giants-melbourne- victory-sack-coach-ernie-merrick-after-asian-champions-league- disaster/story-e6frf4gl-1226020259849Sportal Sydney Morning Herald http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-sport/melbourne-victory-sack-coach- merrick-20110312-1brxl.html Merrick was the last foundation coach to be sacked.
