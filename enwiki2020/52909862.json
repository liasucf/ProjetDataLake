    "text": "Dragonica Mobile SEA is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Asiasoft Co., Ltd., Playpark Co., Ltd., Funigloo Co., Ltd., Gravity Co., Ltd., and Neo Cyon Inc. and licensed by Gravity Co., Ltd. (Gravity Games). The game was released on January 4, 2017 and for iOS and Android. The game features dungeon crawl side-scrolling gameplay, with tap-to- action controls, and a \"buddy system\" to ease daily grinding. A fatigue system is implemented, which means that players can not rush levels. Boss raids are also available, as well as a dungeon progression system, which means that more dungeons or PVE areas would be made available the higher level goes. == Gameplay == === Classes === Dragonica Mobile SEA features 6 different starting characters, each with their own unique attributes and playstyles, from magic cheesing Warlocks and Wizards, sneaky Thieves and Assassins, to plain dash- and-brawl Knights and Gladiators. === Tasks === Dragonica Mobile SEA features instances that allow players to gain access to items, experience, and currency as well as serve to advance the overall storyline in the game. These instances are known as \"missions\" and must be completed sequentially in order to unlock the final scenario that advances the plot. Each step in the mission becomes significantly more difficult than the previous and oftentimes requires a group to complete. Missions are often composed of four main mission modes (increasing in difficulty) and a fifth scenario (unlocked when the previous modes have been completed). Each step in the mission also features a grading system that attempts to rank players based on how a player has performed during that step. The grading system allows the player to obtain higher quality and quantity loot based on that individual's performance and group contribution. Players will often be sent into these missions to complete important quests, such as those needed to change class. Although many of these missions can be done by oneself, the benefits of tackling these missions with others far outweigh that of taking them on alone. Players in groups gain bonus experience and, with the right group composition, will find it much easier to progress through the game.The tasks of this game are just the same as its previous game version, Dragonica (2009). == References == Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:2017 video games ",
