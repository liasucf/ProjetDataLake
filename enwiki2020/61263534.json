    "text": "Rafael Ram\u00f3n Acosta Ar\u00e9valo (16 June 1969 \u2013 29 June 2019) was a Venezuelan military officer with the rank of corvette captain of the Armed Forces. Acosta Ar\u00e9valo was victim of forced disappearance and tortured by agents of the General Directorate of Military Counterintelligence (DGCIM) during his detention after being accused by the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of \"conspiring to carry out an attempted coup d'\u00e9tat\". Acosta Ar\u00e9valo died as a result of injuries suffered while in detention in the Military Hospital of the Army Dr. Vicente Salias Sanoja. The news of his death caused great impact in the media and the condemnation of both national and international authorities. ==Personal life== Acosta Ar\u00e9valo resided in Maracay. He graduated from the Military Academy of the Bolivarian Navy, where he obtained his rank of ensign in the component of the Bolivarian Navy, of the National Bolivarian Armed Forces. He was married to Walewska P\u00e9rez and was the father of two children. ==Death== ===Detention and torture=== On 22 June 2019, Acosta Ar\u00e9valo's wife denounced his disappearance and stated that she had spoken with him for the last time at 2:00 p.m. of the previous day, while he was in a \"personal meeting\" in Guatire, Miranda. On that day, officials from the General Directorate of Military Counterintelligence (DGCIM) and the Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN) detained seven people, including active and retired military and police officers. Among the detainees were two retired colonels, a brigadier general of the aviation, a lieutenant colonel of the Army, two retired commissaries of the Scientific, Penal and Criminal Investigation Corps (CICPC) and a corvette captain of the Navy, Acosta Ar\u00e9valo. On 26 July, after six days without knowing his whereabouts, Acosta Ar\u00e9valo's arrest was announced by Minister for Communication and Information Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, who accused three of them, including Captain Acosta Ar\u00e9valo, of committing \"the crimes of terrorism, conspiracy and treason\". According to the government, the accused were preparing a coup that \"included the death of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and Diosdado Cabello.\" On 28 June, Acosta Ar\u00e9valo was transferred by a DGCIM commission to the headquarters of the military court to hold his presentation hearing, where he arrived in a wheelchair with serious indications of torture. DGCIM officials prevented Acosta Ar\u00e9valo's interview with his lawyers from being private. Acosta Ar\u00e9valo presented many excoriations in the arms, little sensitivity in the hands, extreme inflammation in the feet, traces of blood in the nails, and injuries in the torso. Acosta Ar\u00e9valo was also unable to move his hands or feet, to get up or to speak, with the exception of accepting the appointment of his defender and asking his lawyer for help. The judge ordered that Acosta Ar\u00e9valo be transferred to the Army Military Hospital Dr. Vicente Salias Sanoja, located in Fort Tiuna in Caracas, upon observing his critical physical condition and his presentation hearing was postponed. Later, the judge of the case reported that Acosta Ar\u00e9valo had died at night in the hospital. After news of Acosta Ar\u00e9valo's death and the circumstances surrounding it were made public, it was reported that \"DGCIM\" could not be entered as a hashtag on Twitter, reportedly having been blocked. ===Investigations=== The government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro did not provide a cause of death but announced an investigation on the matter. The Maduro government issued statements following the death of Acosta Ar\u00e9valo with different contradictions. Jorge Rodr\u00edguez announced that Acosta Ar\u00e9valo's death occurred \"during the presentation ceremony in front of the competent court\". The attorney general appointed by the Maduro-aligned Constituent National Assembly, Tarek William Saab, said that Acosta Ar\u00e9valo \"was being brought before the court\" when he lost consciousness, and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez said Acosta Ar\u00e9valo fainted before the hearing began. Diosdado Cabello dismissed the possibility of an independent investigation, expressing \"we trust in our justice\", calling the Public Ministry to begin an investigation and mentioning that \"whoever has responsibility in the case must assume it\". According to the president of the NGO Control Ciudadano, Roc\u00edo San Miguel, \"Captain Acosta Ar\u00e9valo died innocent, since never since his arrest was he formally charged by the Venezuelan state, who violated the most basic constitutional guarantees of due process.\" The attorney general in exile, Luisa Ortega D\u00edaz, issued a statement in which she states that she appointed a multidisciplinary team to clarify the death, to determine the responsibility of the authors and impose the corresponding sanctions. According to exiled former prosecutor Zair Mundaray, who said he had been briefed on the autopsy findings by members of the judiciary with access to the report, Acosta had sixteen fractured ribs, eight on each side, fracture of the nasal septum, excoriations in shoulders, elbows, and knees, hematomas in the inner thigh and both extremities, whip-like injuries in the back and thighs, a fractured foot, multiple abrasions and signs of small burns in both feet which suggested that electric shocks had been used. According to the preliminary autopsy report, the cause of death was severe cerebral edema due to acute respiratory failure, leading to pulmonary thromboembolism, the product of rhabdomyolysis due to widespread polytrauma \u2014 lack of brain function after multiple physical injuries. The Public Prosecutor's Office charged two officials assigned to the Directorate General of Military Intelligence (DGCIM), Lieutenant Ascanio Antonio Tarascio and Sergeant Estiben Zarate, and requested their preventive detention as suspects. The officers were charged with the crime of \"pre- intentional concausal homicide\", which has a maximum penalty of nine years in prison. Gonzalo Himiob, vice-president of Foro Penal, denounced that a pre- intentional concausal homicide supposes that the death of the person was caused by executing intentional acts with the intention of injuring them, not killing them, and that defining as a common crime any act that is a serious violation to the human rights is a \"strategy aimed at distorting the truth and seeking impunity for those responsible\" and to qualify homicide as \"concausal\" implies that the death would not have taken place without the presence of pre- existing or unexpected conditions or situations unknown by the murderer, or unforeseen events, which would have not depended on their actions. Former ombudswoman Gabriela Ram\u00edrez regretted that the country's Law against Torture was not applied and that the plan developed in her administration was discarded, of which she blamed her successor, Tarek William Saab. ===Controlled burial=== Acosta Ar\u00e9valo's corpse spent twelve days in the guarded by the police and later buried in the , in Caracas. The Bolivarian National Police closed the access to the cemetery and the authorities conducted a controlled burial similar to that of \u00d3scar P\u00e9rez, in a sealed coffin and against the will of his relatives, whose will is for his remains to be buried in Maracay, Aragua, where most of the family resides. The same day, security officers raided the residence of Ar\u00e9valo's parents-in-law in Maracay. ===Reactions=== The European Union called for a \"complete and independent\" investigation into the death of Acosta Ar\u00e9valo, considering that the case highlights \"the arbitrary nature of the judicial system and the lack of guarantees and rights\" for detainees in Venezuela. The Lima Group, made up of 14 countries in the Americas, repudiated the captain's death in a statement, calling it a \"murder\". The secretary general of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, demanded \"truth and justice for the murder\" of Acosta Ar\u00e9valo, and directly blamed \"the dictatorship.\" The United States considered the case as \"a grim example\" of \"how far it goes the persecution against Maduro's adversaries.\" Germany declared that the death of Acosta Ar\u00e9valo \"is an obstacle to a negotiated solution in Venezuela\". France condemned Acosta Ar\u00e9valo's death and called for an \"independent investigation\" to clarify the circumstances in which it occurred. In Colombia, President Iv\u00e1n Duque strongly rejected the death of the captain, declaring that \"the world must put an end to that dictatorship\". The Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell, mentioned after what happened with the death of Acosta Ar\u00e9valo, that \"something happened and we want to know.\" He also asked for a clear investigation on the matter. The Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs expressed concern about the death of Acosta Ar\u00e9valo. Acosta Ar\u00e9valo's wife, Venezuelan human rights advocates, Juan Guaid\u00f3 and the US Department of State accused Maduro's government of torturing the captain to death. A statement from the internal policy committee of the National Assembly reported that the legislative body would request the International Criminal Court and the United Nations to investigate the death of the captain. Guaid\u00f3, President of the National Assembly and disputed interim President of Venezuela, described the event as \"abominable\" and declared that immediate contact was established with the family and the United Nations commission, which instructed both the appointed ambassadors and representatives abroad to file a complaint with foreign governments and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, and that information would continue to be collected on Acosta Ar\u00e9valo's death. Deputy Delsa Sol\u00f3rzano sent a statement to Bachelet demanding compliance with the Minnesota Protocol, a model procedure recommended by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to investigate crimes against humanity, in the case that illegal executions were committed, and which is aimed at preventing state officials suspected of having committed the crimes from acting or influencing the investigation. Opposition leaders such as Julio Borges and Antonio Ledezma also condemned the death. Due to the death of the captain, the delegation of Guaid\u00f3 in negotiations with the Maduro government suspended their trip to the third round of talks. On 2 July 2019, Acosta Ar\u00e9valo was posthumously promoted to frigate captain by Guaid\u00f3 in representation of the National Assembly. The NGO PROVEA asked the technical team in Venezuela of Bachelet that Maduro give an explanation for the death of Acosta Ar\u00e9valo. The Comit\u00e9 de Familiares de las V\u00edctimas (COFAVIC, \"Committee of Relatives of Victims\") issued a statement expressing its deep concern over the death of Acosta Ar\u00e9valo, arguing that \"torture is designed with the deliberate purpose of frighten\". Days later, the head of the Armed Forces high command, Remigio Ceballos, assured that the captain \"died while in custody\" and that he had conspired against the state for more than ten years. However, the official mentioned that \"the entire FANB regrets the events related to the loss of the retired officer\". On 30 June, a floral wreath with the message \"We join the pain of the Armed Forces: We demand justice\" was left outside the General Command of the Navy, in Caracas. The wreath and other floral offerings were rejected and kicked by military men who guarded the command. ==See also== *Carlos Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda *Fernando Alb\u00e1n Salazar ==References== == External links == * Venezuela: Dying before a judge: the arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, torture and death of Rafael Acosta Ar\u00e9valo - Amnesty International Category:1969 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Forced disappearances in Venezuela Category:People from Maracay Category:People of the Crisis in Venezuela Category:Political repression in Venezuela Category:Prisoners who died in Venezuelan detention Category:Venezuelan military personnel Category:Venezuelan people who died in prison custody Category:Venezuelan torture victims ",
