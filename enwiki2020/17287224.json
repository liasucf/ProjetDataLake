    "text": "Ernst Sp\u00e4th (14 May 1886, in Moravsk\u00fd Beroun (), northern Moravia - 30 September 1946, in Zurich) was an Austrian chemist, specializing in natural products. He was the first to synthesise mescaline and was one of the first to synthesize cuscohygrine on a small scale with Hans Tuppy. He lost everything in World War II, and died with no money. His former student Percy Lavon Julian returned to Vienna, paid for his funeral, and commissioned a bust of Sp\u00e4th, which is still displayed in the foyer of the Faculty of Chemistry of the University of Vienna. A second cast of the bust was erected in 1961 in the Arkadenhof of the University of Vienna. == References == == Biography == * == Publications == * Category:Austrian chemists Category:1886 births Category:1946 deaths Category:Moravian-German people Category:Austrian people of Moravian-German descent Category:Austrian expatriates in Switzerland Category:People from Moravsk\u00fd Beroun Category:20th-century Austrian scientists Category:20th-century chemists ",
