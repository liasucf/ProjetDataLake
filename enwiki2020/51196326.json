He learned the artistic aspects of the silk trade from his father and attended the School of Fine Arts in lyon between 1827 and 1833, studying painting and life drawing. In 1835 he moved to Paris to continue his training in the studio of Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. He then attended Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ozanam's college within the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, which advocated Catholic libertarian values (which were condemned by the Pope). This period was inspirational for Fr\u00e9net and inspired his later religious works. Following the closure of Ingres' workshop, Fr\u00e9net, with his friends Louis Janmot and Claudius Lavergne, undertook a study trip to Italy to visit Ingres, where the latter had become Director of the French Academy in Rome. A small colony from Lyon, also including Hippolyte Flandrin, centred around Ingres in the Villa Medici: they drew and painted the Roman monuments. In 1837 Fr\u00e9net visited Florence and then left Italy. Back in Lyon, Fr\u00e9net made his first public exhibition at the 1837 Exhibition, which consisted of works brought back from Italy. In 1840 he made a second trip to Italy and again exhibited his work on his return to France. He thereafter became a recognized member of the School of Lyon. However, art critics were not always kind to him. Failing to win any prizes in Paris, where he exhibited at the Salon in 1841, he decided to relocate to the village of Charly, near Lyon, where he had bought a house. He continued his work, mostly choosing religious subjects. He painted frescoes and designed stained glass for the Saint-Louis-de-la- Guilloti\u00e8re church in Charly. Following the Revolution of 1848, he became involved in municipal politics and was elected Mayor of Charly. He then applied to become a professor at the School of Fine Arts in Lyon, supported by Ingres, but was unsuccessful. His range then diversified to include printmaking, sculpture, and the new field of photography. From 1850 he worked on a large fresco project for the Church of St. Martin in Ainay, but unfortunately moisture caused his work to deteriorate and his sponsors refused to pay. The work was ultimately destroyed. Embittered, Fr\u00e9net didn't produce anything else before his death on 12 August 1889. ==Photography== Around 1850 Fr\u00e9net, met some photography pioneers in Lyon, and used photography to record his unsuccessful frescoes at Ainay. From this time, he becomes passionate about this new medium, and this mentally diverts him from the setbacks with his painting. Fr\u00e9net applies to out of decision stereotypical views of the time involving heavy stagings, and is one of the first to practice the instant, the familiar and intimate subject.
