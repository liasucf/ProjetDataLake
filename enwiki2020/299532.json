    "text": "Patchoulialso spelled \"patchouly\" or \"pachouli\" (; Pogostemon cablin), from Tamil paccu\u1e37i, is a species of plant from the family Lamiaceae, commonly called the \"mint\" or \"deadnettle\" family. The plant grows as a bushy perennial herb, with erect stems reaching around 75 centimetres (2.5 ft) in height and bearing small, pale pink-white flowers. It is native to tropical regions of Asia , and is now extensively cultivated in China, Indonesia, Japan, Cambodia, Myanmar, India, Maldives, Malaysia, Mauritius, Seychelles, Madagascar, Taiwan, Pakistan, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, South America and the Caribbean. ==Perfume== The heavy and strong scent of patchouli has been used for centuries in perfumes and, more recently, in incense, insect repellents, and alternative medicines. The word derives from the Tamil patchai () (green), ellai () (leaf). In Assamese it is known as xukloti. In Kannada it is known as Pachhethene. Pogostemon cablin, P. commosum, P. hortensis, P. heyneasus and P. plectranthoides are all cultivated for their essential oil, known as patchouli oil. ==Cultivation== Patchouli grows well in warm to tropical climates. It thrives in hot weather but not direct sunlight. If the plant withers due to lack of water, it will recover well and quickly after rain or watering. The seed-producing flowers are very fragrant and blossom in late fall. The tiny seeds may be harvested for planting, but they are very delicate and easily crushed. Cuttings from the mother plant can also be rooted in water to produce additional plants. ==Essential oil== Patchouli (Pogostemon cablin) essential oil ===Extraction=== Extraction of patchouli's essential oil is by steam distillation of the dried leaves, requiring rupture of its cell walls by steam scalding, light fermentation, or drying. The main chemical component of patchouli oil is patchoulol, a sesquiterpene alcohol. Leaves may be harvested several times a year and, when dried, may be exported for distillation. Some sources say the highest quality oil is produced from fresh leaves distilled close to where they are harvested;Grieve, Maude (1995) A Modern Herbal . 2007 others that boiling the dried leaves and fermenting them for a period of time is best.Leung A, Foster S Encyclopedia of common natural ingredients used in food, drugs and cosmetics John Wiley and Sons 1996 ===Components=== * Germacrene-B * Patchoulol * Norpatchoulenol ==Uses== ===Perfume=== Patchouli is used widely in modern perfumery, by individuals who create their own scents and in modern scented industrial products such as paper towels, laundry detergents and air fresheners.

More specifically, the patchouli plant is claimed to be a potent repellent against the Formosan subterranean termite. ===Incense=== Patchouli is an important ingredient in East Asian incense. Both patchouli oil and incense underwent a surge in popularity in the 1960s and 1970s in the US and Europe, mainly as a result of the hippie movement of those decades. ===Culinary=== Patchouli leaves have been used to make a herbal tea. In some cultures, patchouli leaves are eaten as a vegetable or used as a seasoning. ===Toys=== In 1985 Mattel used patchouli oil in the plastic used to produce the action figure Stinkor in the Masters of the Universe line of toys.Stinkor: Masters of the Universe ==References== ===Notes=== Category:Pogostemon Category:Incense material Category:Perfume ingredients Category:Insect repellents Category:Plants used in traditional Chinese medicine Category:Essential oils Category:Hippie movement Category:Plants described in 1848 ",
