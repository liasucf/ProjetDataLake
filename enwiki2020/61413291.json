They have played since the 2016\u201317 season in the Swiss League (SL), the second tier of the main professional ice hockey league in Switzerland, behind the National League, as the primary affiliate to EV Zug. ==History== The club name is derived from Zug's junior program \"The Hockey Academy\" and was founded with the purpose to serve as an affiliate club to shareholder and National League club, EV Zug. They submitted an application to play in the National League B and were permitted to play in the 2016\u201317 season. EVZ Academy plays its home games in the Zug's training rink, Academy Arena, as well as occasionally in the Bossard Arena, in Sursee, home to EV Zug. In their debut season, EVZ Academy collected just 10 wins in 48 games to finish in 10th place. In the 2018\u201319 season, Jason O'Leary replaced inaugural head coach Stefan Hedlund, who was promoted to EV Zug's coaching staff. Having won the Swiss League in 2017 with SC Langenthal, O'Leary led Academy to their second playoff berth, claiming 8th position before losing to regular season champions HC La Chaux-de-Fonds. At the conclusion of the season, O'Leary left to coach top flight DEL club Iserlohn Roosters, and he was replaced by Roger Hansson, as Academy's third head coach. ==References== ==External links== * EVZ Academy official website Category:Ice hockey teams in Switzerland Category:Ice hockey clubs established in 2016 Category:Zug ",
