    "text": "Palaeoaldrovanda splendens is a form taxon of uncertain identity. It was for a long time thought to be an extinct angiosperm allied to the carnivorous plant genus Aldrovanda.Degreef, J.D. 1997. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 26(3): 93\u201397. Anderson et al. (2005) wrote: \"synapomorphic characters that link the fossils seeds [of P. splendens] to extant Aldrovanda include hard testa with an outer epidermis of palisade cells and with a smooth, strongly reflecting surface, short micropylar neck, and extruding, pointed chalazal area\".Anderson, C.L., K. Bremer & E.M. Friis 2005. American Journal of Botany 92(10): 1737\u20131748. However, research published by He\u0159manov\u00e1 & Kva\u010dek (2010) has cast doubt on this hypothesis. These authors identified the fossilised remains of Palaeoaldrovanda as insect eggs, writing:He\u0159manov\u00e1, Z. & J. Kva\u010dek 2010.

Palaeoaldrovanda is only known from fossils of the late Turonian\u2013Santonian Klikov beds of the Czech Republic.Knobloch, E. & D.H. Mai 1984.
