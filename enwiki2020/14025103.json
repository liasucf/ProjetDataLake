    "text": "In enzymology, precorrin-3B C17-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :S-adenosyl-L-methionine + precorrin-3B \\rightleftharpoons S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + precorrin-4 The conversion of precorrin-3B to precorrin-4 is catalysed by the enzyme CobJ in Pseudomonas denitrificans The two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and precorrin 3B, and its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and precorrin 4. This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:precorrin-3B C17-methyltransferase. Other names in common use include precorrin-3 methyltransferase, and CobJ. This enzyme is part of the biosynthetic pathway to cobalamin (vitamin B12) in aerobic bacteria and during this step the macrocycle ring-contracts so that the corrin core of the vitamin is formed. ==See Also== * Cobalamin biosynthesis ==References== * * Category:EC 2.1.1 Category:Enzymes of unknown structure ",
