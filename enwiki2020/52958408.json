The album includes re-recorded tracks they performed on the seventh season of The X Factor Australia, where they came third. The album was released through Sony Music Australia on 16 December 2015. The album was preceded by the lead single \"Nothing Matters\", which debuted at number 29 on the ARIA Singles Chart. ==Reception== Lucy Barber-Hancock from Renowned for Sound said; \"Jess and Matt provide the kind of well-trained pop vocals which are the ideal blank canvas to carry all of their chosen tunes, whilst still allowing their unique brand of folk-pop to flow right through the album in the form of nifty finger-picked guitars and the pure tone of their vocal acrobatics.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015/16) !scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |} ==Release history== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Country ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| Catalogue |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia | 16 December 2015 | | Sony Music Australia | 88875189202 |- |} ==References== Category:2015 albums Category:Sony Music Australia albums ",
