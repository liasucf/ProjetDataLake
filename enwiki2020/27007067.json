It is of the early to middle Miocene epoch, (19.3 - 13.4 million years ago) in age, in the Neogene Period.Woodburne, M.O., Tedford, R.H., Swisher III, C.C. (1990). Lithostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and geochronology of the Barstow Formation, Mojave Desert, southern California: Geological Society of America Bulletin, Vol. 102, p. 459-477. It lends its name to the Barstovian North American land mammal age (NALMA). The sediments are fluvial and lacustrine in origin except for nine layers of rhyolitic tuff. It is well known for its abundant vertebrate fossils including bones, teeth and footprints.Lindsay, E.H. (1972). Small Mammal Fossils from the Barstow Formation, California. University of California Publications in Geological Sciences, Vol. 93. University of California Press, Berkeley. The formation is also renowned for the fossiliferous concretions in its upper member, which contain three- dimensionally preserved arthropods. ==Fossils== === Arthropods === The arthropods in the upper member of the Barstow Formation are preserved in concretions. The concretions are calcareous and range from 0.125 cm3 to 125 cm3. The fossils are typically three-dimensional and, on occasion, exhibit internal anatomy. Due to the preservation of soft-tissue, the Barstow Formation has been identified as a Konservat-Lagerst\u00e4tte deposit. The fauna was first recognized in 1954 by Allen M. Basset and Allison \"Pete\" R. Palmer.Palmer, A.R., Basset, A.M. (1954). Nonmarine Miocene arthropods from California. Science, Vol. 102, p.228-229 The concretions from the Barstow Formation preserve both allochthonous arthropod communities and rare autochthonous arthropod communities. Over 21 orders of arthropods have been recorded. The fossil assemblage is dominated by Diptera (Dasyhelea australis antiqua), Coleoptera (Schistomerus californese), and Anostraca (Archaebranchinecta barstowensis). ==See also== *Calico Mountains (California) *Rainbow Basin ==References== Image:Rainbow Basin.JPG|Syncline in the Barstow Formation exposed in Rainbow Basin near Barstow, California.
