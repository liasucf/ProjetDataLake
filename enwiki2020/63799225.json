    "text": "S\u00e1mi \u00c1igi was a Northern S\u00e1mi-language weekly newspaper established in 1978, providing an alternative to the Norwegian-language S\u00e1mi publication S\u00e1gat. S\u00e1mi \u00c1igi played a prominent role in building and empowering S\u00e1mi identity during the Alta controversy and throughout the 1980s. ==History== S\u00e1mi \u00c1igi (the title translates into English as \u201cS\u00e1mi Times\u201d) was launched with the backing of the Norwegian S\u00e1mi Association, Norwegian Reindeer Husbandry Association, and the Saami Council to build connections among the S\u00e1mi of Norway, Sweden, and Finland. The new paper was based in K\u00e1r\u00e1\u0161johka, Norway, but had readers across S\u00e1pmi. The development of a pan-Scandinavian Northern S\u00e1mi orthography gave additional relevancy to the new newspaper. S\u00e1mi \u00c1igi quickly drew readers away from the more conservative S\u00e1gat and within a year of launch the papers had a similar circulation level of about 2,000 readers, and the two papers competed for the subsidy provided by Norway for S\u00e1mi media. As a primary source of news and information in Northern S\u00e1mi, S\u00e1mi \u00c1igi was successful in covering increasing demands for respect for S\u00e1mi identity and concerns, including during the protests surrounding construction of a hydroelectric power plant in the Alta river in Finnmark. While the editors of S\u00e1gat struck a more conciliatory tone, S\u00e1mi \u00c1igi was firmly on the side of the protesters. The paper provided an outlet for debate and criticism of Scandinavian and S\u00e1mi political organizations and was also associated with the \u010cSV cultural movement. In 1986, S\u00e1mi \u00c1igi sponsored a contest, won by Astrid B\u00e5hl, to design a new S\u00e1mi flag. ==Legacy== Despite its wide readership and a state subsidy, S\u00e1mi \u00c1igi was plagued by economic issues for the majority of its existence. In April 1993, the paper ceased publication and entered bankruptcy. However, its staff and owners moved quickly to launch a new newspaper, Min \u00c1igi, which published until 2008 when it merged with rival \u00c1\u0161\u0161u to form the daily newspaper \u00c1vvir. ==See also== * Min \u00c1igi * \u00c1\u0161\u0161u * \u00c1vvir == Notes == Category:Northern Sami-language newspapers Category:Publications established in 1979 Category:Sami in Norway Category:1979 establishments in Norway ",
