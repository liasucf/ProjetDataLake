Monro's version reached number 5 on the UK's Record Retailer chart, while a version by Frank Sinatra and Count Basie reached number 35 the following year. ==Original version== \"My Kind of Girl\" was first released by Matt Monro, and was written by Leslie Bricusse. In February 1961, the British music magazine NME reported that Monro had won ITV's A Song for Britain with \"My Kind of Girl\"; however, according to his daughter Michele's autobiography Matt Monro: The Singer's Singer, Monro came second in this, although the song would later win an Ivor Novello award for \"The Most Performed Work of the Year\". Shortly after the result was announced, Monro, George Martin and Johnnie Spence sped into the studio to record the song but had to record the song's B-side, \"This Time\", beforehand since Spence had left it until late to hand Vic Fraser the score for the record and the copyist had not finished copying the parts for the orchestra.Monro, Michele (2012) Matt Monro: The Singer's Singer, Titan Books. pp. 224-225.
