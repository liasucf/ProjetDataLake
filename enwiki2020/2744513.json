The term 'local' means that the prison holds people on remand to the local courts, as well as sentenced prisoners. Leicester Prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service, and is situated immediately north of Nelson Mandela Park (formerly Welford Road Recreation Ground). According to Colin Crosby, a Blue Badge guide based in Leicester,http://www.crosbyheritage.co.uk tourists invariably ask if the prison is 'Leicester Castle', due to the embattled, medieval design of its frontage, and its unique appearance has also made it one of the city's most celebrated landmarks. Known throughout the nineteenth century as the 'County Gaol', today the prison has become synonymous with the thoroughfare on which it stands, and is commonly referred to as 'Welford Road Prison', or simply, 'Welford Road'.BBC Radio Leicester website, \"Where I Live in Leicester\", 24 September 2014 ==History== The prison was designed by Leicester county surveyor William Parsons to resemble a castle and cost \u00a320,000. The oldest part dates from 1825, and it was opened in 1828. The gatehouse including the adjoining building to north and south and the perimeter wall are grade II listed. The journalist William Cobbett, who wrote about his journeys around England in the early 19th century, criticised the people of Leicester for being proud of their new prison, feeling that it would be more praiseworthy to have an absence of crime.Royal Geographical Society: A free self-guided walk in Leicester, 2012 The prison's distinctive, red brick perimeter walls are thought to be the highest in the country, with an estimated height of 30 feet.http://www.crosbyheritage.co.uk/location/leicester/leicester-prison/ The only known escape by a prisoner through scaling the wall was an ill-fated one, made by renowned 'safe-blower', Albert Hattersley on the evening of 18 December 1953. Hattersley made his way through a skylight in the prison's workshop and used webbing and a long pipe which he had broken from a wall in the workshop toilets to help him scale the wall. He then chose to drop by his fingertips from a part of the wall which was located above the governor's garden, in the hope that the soft earth would help break his fall. However, Hattersley suffered a broken ankle, with his right tibia protruding the skin. After several hours on the run, he was re-captured the following day.Leicester Mercury, 19 December 1953 In 2014, it was reported that prison officers had thwarted a similar plan for an escape over the wall by an inmate who was serving six years for robbery. In describing what was envisaged by the inmate as a \"Shawshank Redemption-style prison break\", the Leicester Mercury reported that following a search of his cell, prison guards had discovered torn bed sheets tied together \"to form ropes\", along with mattress covers adjusted for use in negotiating barbed wire. It was reported that they also discovered a \"boarded-up section\" in the cell, with a panel that could be removed to access a hole the prisoner had been digging.Leicester Mercury, 17 January 2014 ==Building== The gatehouse, adjoining buildings and perimeter wall are Grade II listed. It was built between 1825-28 by William Parsons, the county surveyor, and received additions between 1844-46 by M.J. Dain. ==Executions at Leicester Prison== There have been 23 executions carried out at Leicester Prison, between the years 1829 and 1953. The youngest person executed was John Swift, aged 19 in 1877, and the oldest was Thomas Bloxham, aged 62, in 1887. With the exception of the first four executions (carried out for offences of horse theft and highway robbery), all executions were carried out for offences of murder.

On 20 April 1829, a triple execution was carried out in front of the newly opened prison when Charles Forrester (21), John Hinton (25) and William Varnam (24) were hanged for horse stealing. In reporting the incident, the Leicester Chronicle newspaper noted that after the executioner had pulled caps over the faces of the condemned men, \"a short but painful suspense took place, owing to some difficulty in removing the bolt which causes the platform on which they stood, to fall\". It was also noted that about half of the huge crowd that had assembled to watch the event were women and children.Leicester Chronicle, 25 April 1829 On 7 April 1830, John Watkins (28) was hanged for highway robbery.http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/1828.html On 26 March 1832, a particularly large crowd attended the hanging of Sarah Smith, a 28 year old woman from Mountsorrel.

James Cook (21) was a bookbinder, convicted of the murder of his creditor Paas, a manufacturer of brass instruments, in Leicester. He was executed on Friday 10 August 1832 in front of the prison. Following his execution it was noted: \"The head was shaved and tarred, to preserve it from the action of the weather; and the cap in which he had suffered was drawn over his face. On Saturday afternoon his body, attired as at the time of his execution, having been firmly fixed in the irons necessary to keep the limbs together, was carried to the place of its intended suspension.\" His body was displayed on a purpose-built gallows, 33 ft high in Saffron Lane near the Aylestone Tollgate and, according to The Newgate Calendar, \"thousands of persons were attracted to the spot, to view this novel but most barbarous exhibition; and considerable annoyance was felt by persons resident in the neighbourhood of the dreadful scene. Representations were in consequence made to the authorities, and on the following Tuesday morning instructions were received from the Home Office directing the removal of the gibbet.\" Gibbeting was soon after abolished in England, in 1834http://www.medievalwarfare.info/torture.htm William Hubbard (23) was hanged on 1 April 1846, for the murder of his wife at Leicester, having cut her throat with a butcher's knife.Leicestershire Mercury, 4 April 1846 John Fowkes (45) was hanged on 19 March 1856 for the murder of his 20 year old nephew, John Acres Fowkes, at Snarestone.Leicester Journal, 21 March 1856 The last public execution at Leicester Prison took place on 25 July 1856, when an estimated crowd of 25,000 gathered to watch the hanging of William (\"Peppermint Billy\") Brown, aged 33, for the murder of Edward Woodward, a 78 year old tollgate keeper of Thorpe Arnold and his ten year old grandson.Butt, Stephen: Melton Mowbray Through Time, Amberley Publishing, 2009http://www.crosbyheritage.co.uk/location/leicester/leicester-prison/ Following the Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868 public executions were abolished and all hangings thereafter were carried out inside the prison, behind closed doors. ===19th Century private executions=== For a short period between 1876 and 1877, executions at Leicester appear to have been carried out at the Borough Gaol on Highcross, where two hangings are recorded as having been carried out - those of John Thomas Green (41) on 20 December 1876Morpeth Herald, 20 December 1876 and John Henry Starkey (28) on 31 July 1877.Leicester Journal, Fri 3 August 1877 Both men were hanged for the murder of their wives.
