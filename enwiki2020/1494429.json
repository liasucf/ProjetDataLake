    "text": "Tortoise Wins by a Hare is a Merrie Melodies cartoon released on February 20, 1943 and directed by Bob Clampett. It stars Bugs Bunny and Cecil Turtle. Bob Clampett took Tex Avery's scenario from Tortoise Beats Hare and altered it for this film. The title is an appropriate pun on \"hair\". This is one of the first shorts to feature Robert McKimson's design of Bugs Bunny. A newspaper's front page (the Chicago Sunday Tribunk) shown in this cartoon accurately predicts Adolf Hitler's suicide two years later. ==Plot== Two years after the events in Tortoise Beats Hare, Bugs is watching footage of that cartoon, determined to learn how it was that Cecil managed to beat him (the cartoon seems to depict Cecil as having won fairly, rather than the truth, which was that the turtle engaged his cousins to cheat and help him win). Bugs then goes to Cecil's house disguised as an old man (a parody of Bill Thompson's \"Old Timer\" character from Fibber McGee and Molly) to ask about the turtle's secret for winning. Cecil is not the least bit fooled by the disguise, but goes along with the gag, claiming that his streamlined shell ensures his success; he produces a set of blueprints for his \"air-flow chassis.\" He also adds that, in contrast, the long ears of a rabbit only serve as \"wind resistance\", which slows the rabbit down. The turtle ends the conversation with the comment, \"Oh, and another thing...Rabbits aren't very bright, either!\" just before slamming the door in the enraged bunny's face. Not getting the hint that the turtle's story is a humbug, Bugs builds a shell of his own and prepares for the new race. Meanwhile, the bunny mob learns of the match-up, places all its bets on Bugs, and hints that \"the toitle\" will not even finish the race. Initially, Bugs takes the easy lead, after dressing up in his new chassis. The rabbit mob, mistaking Bugs for Cecil and, despite Bugs' insistence to the contrary, attack the rabbit. Cecil does not help Bugs' cause by dressing up in a rabbit suit. The rabbit mob fall for it and cheer Cecil as the real rabbit, causing the turtle to remark to the audience, \"I told you rabbits aren't very bright.\" Bugs still manages to regain the lead and nearly wins, until the mob stalls him right at the finish line, while other rabbits rush Cecil over the line and to victory. Bugs then bursts out crying, rips off his chassis and reveals that he was the real rabbit. In despair, the rabbit mob replies, \"Ehhh, now he tells us,\" and kill themselves with a single bullet through all their heads. ==Cast== *Sara Berner as Mrs. Turtle *Mel Blanc as Bugs Bunny, Cecil Turtle, Narrators, Rabbit Bookie and Rabbit Thugs *Kent Rogers as Rabbit with Telescope ==Analysis== The animated short contains wartime references. Bugs displays \"A\" and \"C\" ration cards. He claims he has a secret weapon. A Japanese cruiser is mentioned in a newspaper headline, as is the accurate prediction of Adolf Hitler's suicide two years later. A chorus of turtles sing \"He did it before and he can do it again\".Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 159 Nichola Dobson mentions the short as an example of both Bob Clampett's attention to detail and of the fast pace of his work.Dobson (2010), p. 44 The suicide gag at the end is normally edited out of television broadcasts, fading out just as the rabbits say, \"NOW he tells us.\" ==Availability== *This short can be found (uncut and uncensored) on Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1 and Looney Tunes Platinum Collection: Volume 2. ==Sources== * * ==See also== *Rabbit Transit ==References== ==External links== * *Tortoise Wins by a Hare at the Big Cartoon Database Category:1943 films Category:1943 short films Category:1943 animated films Category:1940s American animated films Category:1940s animated short films Category:American films Category:English- language films Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:Films about organized crime in the United States Category:Films directed by Bob Clampett Category:Running films Category:Self-reflexive films Category:Works based on fables Category:Films scored by Carl Stalling Category:Films produced by Leon Schlesinger Category:Films featuring Bugs Bunny Category:Warner Bros. animated short films, 1940s ",
