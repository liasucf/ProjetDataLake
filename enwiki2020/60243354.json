    "text": "A number of ships have been used for Danish marine research and Danish-led expeditions. Some were dedicated research ships and functional in many years, other were bought or chartered for a limited time for one or more dedicated expeditions. These expeditions are typically named after the ship. Most information has been compiled from Sandbeck (2007), Wolff (1967) and Christiansen (2010). Additional references are listed in the table. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Ship name !! Prior/later names !! Ship lifetime !! Time as research vessel !! Major expeditions !!
