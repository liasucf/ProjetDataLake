    "text": "The National Association for Women's Suffrage (, LSKF), was a Norwegian association for women suffrage, active from 1898 until 1913. It was founded as a national organization, in contrast to the previous suffrage organisation, Kvindestemmeretsforeningen (1885-1913), which was only a local organisation for the capital of Oslo. Among its founders and most active members were Gina Krog, Fredrikke Marie Qvam, Betzy Kjelsberg and Fredrikke M\u00f8rck. The LSKF was founded as a protest to the suffrage reform of 1898, when male suffrage was achieved, while women were left out. The year after, the members put forward a demand of women suffrage with 12 000 names for the parliament. In 1905, the organisation supported the dissolve of the union with Sweden. From 1906, it was a part of the International Council of Women. The purpose of the organisation was met with the introduction of women suffrage in 1913. ==See also== * Women's suffrage organizations * List of suffragists and suffragettes * Timeline of women's suffrage ==References== * Folkvord, Magnhild. 2013.
