    "text": "Tritimovirus is a genus of viruses, in the family Potyviridae. Plants serve as natural hosts. There are currently six species in this genus including the type species Wheat streak mosaic virus. ==Taxonomy== Group: ssRNA(+) ==Structure== Viruses in Tritimovirus are non-enveloped, with flexuous and filamentous geometries. The diameter is around 12-15 nm, with a length of 690-700 nm. Genomes are linear, monopartite or bipartite, and around 9.3-10.0kb in length. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! Genus !! Structure || Symmetry !! Capsid !!

Entry into the host cell is achieved by penetration into the host cell. Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of transcription. The virus exits the host cell by tubule-guided viral movement. Plants serve as the natural host. The virus is transmitted via a vector (mite). Transmission routes are vector and mechanical. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! Genus !! Host details !!
