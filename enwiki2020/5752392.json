He later worked as a staff journalist on the Catholic Herald and The Irish Times, where he wrote about religion and education. In 1969 Horgan was elected as a member of the 12th Seanad \u00c9ireann, representing the National University of Ireland. He was re-elected in 1973, to the 13th Seanad. At the general election in 1977 he was elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann as a TD for Dublin County South. After boundary changes for the general election of 1981 he was not re-elected in the new constituency of Dublin South and he was also unsuccessful at the general election in February 1982. He did not stand again. After John O'Connell resigned as one of the two Labour Party Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) for Dublin Horgan was appointed to replace him on 21 October 1981.

He was also a member of the Interim Radio Commission, the Commission on the Newspaper Industry and the Forum on Broadcasting. ===Press Ombudsman=== In August 2007 the newly formed Press Council of Ireland appointed Horgan as Ireland's first-ever Press Ombudsman. The Press Council began operations on 11 January 2008. Its Code of Practice sets out the standards expected from newspapers and periodicals published in Ireland, and members of the public can raise complaints about articles that directly affect or involve them, and that may breach the Code. The Ombudsman's role is to mediate and, if necessary, adjudicate on cases where a complainant has not reached agreement with a publisher. More complex cases may be referred to the full Press Council. The new system was launched partly to provide an alternatively to increasingly costly litigation and to head off the threat of a new privacy law. On 9 January 2008 the Minister for Justice, Brian Lenihan, announced that a proposed new privacy law would be postponed for two years to give the Press Ombudsman \"an opportunity to establish himself and the credibility of his office\". On 28 March 2014 Horgan announced that he would step down as Press Ombudsman on 1 September 2014. On that date Peter Feeney succeeded Horgan in the post. ==Published works== Books by John Horgan include: * \"Great Irish Reportage\" (editor).
