    "text": "Castlehaven Gaelic Football Club is a West Cork-based GAA club in the parish of Castlehaven near the town of Skibbereen, County Cork, Ireland. The club also draws players from the villages of Union Hall, Castletownshend, and Tragumna. The club participates in competitions run by Cork GAA and by the Carbery divisional board. The club is primarily concerned with the game of Gaelic football, but has fielded hurling teams in the past. The club is noted for its rapid ascent from playing at Junior B level in 1969 to reaching the Cork Senior Football Championship final only 10 years later. The club has remained at senior level ever since, even though it draws from a very small pool of players. ==Football== ===Honours=== *Munster Senior Club Football Championships: 3 ** 1989, 1994, 1997 *Cork Senior Football Championships: 5 ** 1989, 1994, 2003, 2012, 2013 Runner-Up 1979, 1997, 2011, 2015 * Kelleher Shield (Senior Football League) 3 ** 1993, 1998, 2007 *Cork Intermediate Football Championship 1 ** 1978 Runners-Up 1977 *Cork Junior Football Championship 1 ** 1976 *West Cork Junior A Football Championship 2 ** 1973, 1976 *West Cork Junior B Football Championship 2 ** 1944, 1969 *West Cork Junior C Football Championship 1 ** 2003 *Cork Under-21 Football Championship 5 ** 1981, 1983, 1998, 2007, 2010 *West Cork Under-21 A Football Championship 7 ** 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1998, 2007, 2010 Beaten finalists 1972, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1979, 1984, 1987, 1996, 2002, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2014 *Cork Minor A Football Championship 1 ** 2013, Runners-Up 2004 *West Cork Minor A Football Championship 3 ** 2001, 2004, 2013 Runner-Up 2005 *West Cork Minor B Football Championship 6 ** 1971, 1977, 1978, 1980, 1982, 1986 Beaten finalists 1974, 1983, 1987 *West Cork Minor C Football Championship 1 ** 2012 ==Hurling== ===Honours=== *West Cork Junior B Hurling Championship 2 ** 1973, 1980 Runner- Up 1978 *West Cork Under-21 B Hurling Championship 1 ** 1981 ==Notable players== * Michael Burns * Damien Cahalane * Niall Cahalane * John Cleary * Donie Collins * Mark Collins * Brian Hurley * Michael Maguire * Larry Tompkins ==References== ==External links== *Official Castlehaven GAA Club website *Munster Club Teams Category:Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Cork Category:Gaelic football clubs in County Cork Category:Hurling clubs in County Cork ",
