    "text": "The Mutual Association of Eastern Colored Clubs, more commonly known as the Eastern Colored League (ECL), was one of the several Negro leagues, which operated during the time organized baseball was segregated. == League history == ===Founding === The ECL was founded in 1923 when the Philadelphia-area Hilldale Club and the Bacharach Giants of Atlantic City, both associate members of the midwest-based Negro National League (NNL), broke with the NNL and allied with the white promoter Nat Strong to form an east coast league. The charter members were: Hilldale, the Bacharach Giants, the Brooklyn Royal Giants, the Cuban Stars (East), the Lincoln Giants of New York, and the Baltimore Black Sox. In 1924 the Harrisburg Giants and Washington Potomacs joined, bringing the circuit to eight clubs. The ECL raided the NNL for players, including Hall of Famers Oscar Charleston, Biz Mackey, and John Henry Lloyd, starting a war that lasted for two years. In 1925 the Washington Potomacs moved to Wilmington, Delaware, but still disbanded in July. Their 1926 replacement, the Newark Stars, folded after only 11 games. === Uneasy peace === At the end of the 1924 season the two leagues made peace and arranged for a Colored World Series between their champions. This series was played each year from 1924 through 1927. The only ECL club to win the World Series was Hilldale in 1925. === Demise === Beginning in 1927 the league was wracked by dissension between club owners. New York's Lincoln Giants dropped out for that season. They returned the next, but then Hilldale, the Brooklyn Royal Giants, and the Harrisburg Giants all dropped out. The Philadelphia Tigers were recruited to bring the league up to five teams for 1928. The ECL staggered through May, but finally disbanded in the midst of disputes over player contracts at the beginning of June. == ECL franchises == :Annual final standings: 1923, 1924, 1925, 1926, 1927, 1928 * Atlantic City Bacharach Giants (1923\u20131928) * Baltimore Black Sox (1923\u20131928) * Brooklyn Royal Giants (1923\u20131928) * Cuban Stars (East) (1923\u20131928) * Hilldale of Darby, Pennsylvania (1923\u20131928) * New York Lincoln Giants (1923\u20131928) * Harrisburg Giants (1924\u20131927) * Washington/Wilmington Potomacs (1924\u20131925) * Newark Stars (1926) * Homestead Grays (1928) === Member timeline === DateFormat = yyyy ImageSize = width:800 height:300 PlotArea = left:20 right:50 bottom:20 top:20 Colors = id:majorGridColor value:rgb(0.9,0.9,0.9) id:lineColor value:gray(0.6) id:nl1 value:gray(0.9) id:inactive value:gray(0.5) id:gold value:rgb(0.99,0.72,0.15) id:brown value:rgb(0.36,0.20,0.10) id:vegasgold value:rgb(0.80,0.72,0.49) id:green value:rgb(0, 0.51,0.28) id:darkgreen value:rgb(0, 0.20,0 ) id:orange value:rgb(1 ,0.39,0 ) id:redorange value:rgb(1 ,0.20,0 ) id:red value:rgb(0.80,0.01,0.07) id:red2 value:rgb(0.90,0.01,0.07) id:darkred value:rgb(0.50,0 ,0 ) id:iceblue value:rgb(0.20,0.60,0.80) id:lgray value:gray(0.1) id:gray value:gray(0.3) id:gray2 value:gray(0.5) id:sand value:rgb(0.94,0.89,0.77) id:navy value:rgb(0 ,0 ,0.30) id:teal value:rgb(0 ,0.65,0.65) id:teal2 value:rgb(0 ,0.45,0.45) Period = from:1923 till:1929 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy ScaleMajor = start:1923 increment:1 gridcolor:majorGridColor BarData = bar:ATC # Atlantic City Bacharach Giants bar:BAL # Baltimore Black Sox bar:BRK # Brooklyn Royal Giants bar:CUB # Cuban Stars (East) bar:HIL # Hilldale bar:NYL # New York Lincoln Giants bar:HAR # Harrisburg Giants bar:WIL # Washington / Wilmington Potomacs bar:NEW # Newark Stars bar:HOM # Homestead Grays Define $Up = shift:(,1) Define $Left = anchor:from align:right shift:(-1,) Define $Right = anchor:till align:left shift:(2,) Define $Right2 = anchor:till align:right shift:(-25,) Define $Down = shift:(,-10) Define $UpLeft = anchor:from align:right shift:(-1,1) Define $UpLeft2 = anchor:from align:left shift:(-1,1) Define $UpRight2 = anchor:till align:right shift:(-1,1) Define $UpRight = anchor:till align:left shift:(2,1) Define $DownRight = anchor:till align:left shift:(2,-10) Define $DownLeft = anchor:from align:left shift:(2,-10) Define $UpUpRight = anchor:till align:left shift:(2,10) PlotData = color:inactive textcolor:black width:20 fontsize:S mark:(line,black) anchor:middle # other options are anchor:from anchor:till align:center # other options are align:left align:right shift:(0,-5) # Note on dates: A team's bar begins with the season that team played its first game, and ends with the season after that team played its last game.

The league broke up midway through the season due to the breakdown of the founder (and manager of Hilldale) although the individual teams continued to play. == League champions == === Pennant Winners === The team in first place at the end of the season was declared the Pennant winner. Due to the unorthodox nature of the schedule (and little incentive to enforce it), some teams frequently played many more games than others did in any given season. This led to some disputed championships and two teams claiming the title. Generally, the team with the best winning percentage (with some minimum number of games played) was awarded the Pennant, but other times it was the team with the most victories. The \"games behind\" method of recording standings was uncommon in most black leagues. *1923 \u2013 Hilldale *1924 \u2013 Hilldale\u2021 *1925 \u2013 Hilldale\u2021 *1926 \u2013 Bacharach Giants\u2021 *1927 \u2013 Bacharach Giants\u2021 *1928 \u2013 None (league broke up in May; no champion was declared) \u2021 \u2013 Pennant winner went on to play in the Colored World Series. === Colored World Series === For the duration of the league, a Colored World Series took place four times, from 1924 through 1927. The ECL Pennant winner met the champion of the rival Negro National League. Three out of the four years, the Eastern Colored League team (below in bold) succumbed. *1924 \u2013 Kansas City Monarchs beat Hilldale Club, 5 games to 4 games (1 tie) *1925 \u2013 Hilldale Club beat Kansas City Monarchs, 5 games to 1 game *1926 \u2013 Chicago American Giants beat Atlantic City Bacharach Giants, 5 games to 4 games (2 ties) *1927 \u2013 Chicago American Giants beat Atlantic City Bacharach Giants, 5 games to 3 games (1 tie) == References == * Category:Sports leagues established in 1923 Category:Negro baseball leagues Category:Defunct baseball leagues in the United States Category:Sports leagues disestablished in the 1920s Category:1923 establishments in the United States Category:1928 disestablishments in the United States ",
