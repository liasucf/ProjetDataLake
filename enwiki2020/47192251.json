The problem with films starring great singers is that, with few exceptions, they tend to be undistinguished as contributions to the cinematic art.\" Kiepura sang the title song \"My Song for You\" written by Mischa Spoliansky and Frank Eyton. The song was released on an EP \"Tell Me Tonight\" (also a song by Spoliansky and Eyton) in 1957. ==Plot== Arriving in Venice for a production of \"Aida\", young tenor Ricardo Gatti meets the attractive Mary, who has sneaked into the opera house in an attempt to get her fianc\u00e9 hired as a pianist. Ricardo invites Mary to tea and she tells her story, describing her fianc\u00e9 as her \"brother\". Captivated by her, the tenor uses his influence to obtain the job with the orchestra. However, filled with guilt at her deception, Mary breaks off her engagement and consents instead to marry her parents' choice, a wealthy society man. But just before the wedding, she changes her mind and marries Ricardo instead. ==Cast== *Jan Kiepura as Ricardo Gatti *Sonnie Hale as Charlie *Emlyn Williams as Theodore Bruckner *Aileen Marson as Mary Newberg *Gina Malo as Fifi *Muriel George as Mrs Newberg *George Merritt as Mr Newberg *Reginald Smith as Baron Johann Felix Kleeberg ==Critical reception== The New York Times wrote, \"the film is at its best, of course, while its star is attuning his magnificent tenor to a variety of classic arias. The musical high spots of the show are the \"Ave Maria\" of Gounod, which M. Kiepura sings impressively during a church wedding, and the \"Celeste A\u00efda,\" which he rehearses during an amusing backstage sequence at the opera house while \"A\u00efda\" is being trundled through its paces\";https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B02EEDC173FE23ABC4F51DFB366838E629EDE and TV Guide called the film \"charming in parts, this is a nicely done musical with some good detailed direction.\" ==See also== * A Song for You (Ein Lied f\u00fcr Dich, German-language film, 1933) * All for Love (Tout pour l'amour, French-language film, 1933) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1934 films Category:1934 musical comedy films Category:British musical comedy films Category:British films Category:British multilingual films Category:English- language films Category:Cine-Allianz films Category:British black-and-white films Category:1934 multilingual films Category:1934 comedy films ",
