It stars Rajshree Thakur, Manav Gohil and Rati Pandey. == Plot == The story revolves around a mature couple, Preeti Jindal and Keertan Tibrewal (K.T.), business partners, and wedding planners in a marriage bureau named \"Shaadi Mubarak.\" While Preeti is a widow, Keertan's marriage is trouble. The story revolves around these two individuals who are completely different from each other but nicely complement each other. Thus begins a unique tale of self-respect, friendship and love. Preeti organizes her son Tarun's wedding single-handedly during the COVID-19 pandemic with necessary precautions for it. Later in the party, when Rajasthani film industry ex-film star Keertan Tibrewal aka K.T., arrives, he takes all the limelight. On the other hand, Preeti, who sacrificed her voice for her son as she took an oath when Tarun was just seven years to cure him and promised to break her silence when Tarun gets married, breaks it. Keertan decides to gift his mother a new almirah and sets his eyes on one commissioned by Preeti. Later, Preeti faces a miserable condition and decides to sell the almirah that she bought for Tarun to Keertan as Tarun wants a car. At the same time, Tarun and Rati find themselves under pressure to pay the car's full amount in a day as his pre-booking would be canceled, and the advanced money will be taken. While Rati and Tarun meet her boss, Rati steals their boss Chanda's expensive diamond ring, and Preeti is accused of the theft. Despite knowing it, to save their jobs, Preeti takes the humiliation but later confronts the two over her insult. Tarun ousts Preeti from the house, and Juhi brings Preeti to stay at her in-laws. While Kusum is initially reluctant to let Preeti stay, the two soon form a friendship. In Preeti's absence, Rati complained to Tarun about doing the household chores. Keertan meets Chanda at his residence who tries to get intimate with him. Chanda vents out her anger on Keertan for not accepting her. It is also revealed that Keertan's wife left him and ran away with her lover two years after their marriage. An emotional Keertan storms out of the house. Preeti and Kusum get a surprise grand celebration for Mother's Day from their kids. Preeti opens up about wanting to start a job and earn money and respect. Preeti decides to work in a marriage bureau. Kusum and her family help Preeti create a CV to attend interviews but has a hard time finding a job because of her age. Keertan comes to Kusum's house and asks Preeti to become his business partner. Preeti says she needs more time to think, and after Tarun and Rati's hurtful comments, Preeti resolves to work independently. However, after certain circumstances she agrees to work with him. Tarun surprises Rati by gifting her a brand new car. Elsewhere, Preeti and Keertan gear up for the inauguration of their new office. Preeti and her family arrive at the new office, but Keertan's mom doesn't like that she is a middle-class woman. Later, during the puja, Preeti Keertan chooses the name for their company \"Shaadi Mubarak\". Preeti receives a warning from Neelima for partnering up with Keertan for the new venture. Keertan tells Preeti that he didn't do anything without making a plan, but Preeti is still worried. Keertan comes late to work, and Preeti is worried when no one else is there besides the two of them. On the other hand, Tarun is left speechless after learning about a new employee in his office, none other than Priyanka. Keertan gets a surprise visit from Rati as she is looking for a job better than the one given by Chanda. Rati is left speechless after seeing that Shaadi Mubarak's co-owner is Preeti and insults her but gets humiliated after being unable to answer Preeti's questions. While Keertan trusts Preeti with his debit card she is told to give the advertisement company money as Keertan has promised he would give the next day. Preeti goes to the ATM but accidentally takes to much out. She gets accused of theft as Keertan does not remember giving Preeti his card leaving her upset. When Neelima talks about Preeti, Keertan realizes his mistake and apologizes to her. Elsewhere, an angry Priyanka lashes out at Juhi as she knew that she loved Tarun. When Preeti reaches Kusum's house, she finds that her in-laws are back with Tarun and Rati. Tarun again humiliates and disrespects Preeti, but she justifies her purpose for working with Keertan. Kusum takes a stand for Preeti and scolds Tarun. He is left with no choice and issues a challenge to Preeti. She refuses to accept his challenge but agrees after Tarun says that he will never talk again if she doesn't accept. Preeti and Keertan get many phone calls after their advertisement got released and are in for a major surprise as the business tycoon, Mr. Nathmal, contacts them for his daughter's wedding. When they reach his place, they meet up with Rati, but Mr. Nathmal tells her to leave as Chanda didn't show up for the project who, in turn, rebukes Rati for failing to convince him. Keertan and Preeti discuss the wedding plans for Mr. Nathmal's daughter's wedding. Rati complains to Tarun that Preeti dealt with Mr. Nathmal and Chanda yelled at her because of Preeti. Rati asks Tarun to \"love\" Priyanka so she could give all the information about Shaadi Mubarak so that Rati won't get fired from her job. Preeti and Juhi make preparations for Amit's arrival. Preeti video calls Kusum and sneakily shows her Priyanka and Amit talking to each other. When Preeti and Kusum talk about marriage, Preeti lies about how much her husband loved her while, in reality, he mistreated and hated her. Kusum's, on the other hand, was a love marriage, and they eloped. Priyanka and Amit's marriage is confirmed, and everyone celebrates. Priyanka gets a message from Tarun saying that he feels terrible about what he did at the office the other day. Preeti and Keertan start to talk about love, but some of their wounds get opened. Keertan and Preeti's memories become harsh, and Preeti runs off. Keertan gets this feeling that \"love\" has also hurt Preeti. After getting some strength, Preeti goes back and continues with the topic of \"love.\" After Kusum explains love to them, Preeti gets an idea for Mr. Nathmal's daughter's wedding. Meanwhile Tarun pretends to be nice to Priyanka. Preeti and Keertan design a presentation with their ideas on the computer. However, when they arrive at Mr. Nathmal's house they discover the computer isn't turning on. Chanda comes in with Rati who present K.T. and Preeti's idea. Preeti confronts Chanda while Rati insults Preeti but, Keertan stands up for her. Mr. Nathmal gives the deal to Chanda. Keertan realises someone fiddled with the computer and decides to find the culprit. Rati surprises Tarun with a celebration for his work. It is revealed the Priyanka is the one who got onto the computer and deleted the presentation because Tarun asked her to do so. It is also shown that Rati doesn't care about Tarun and is making him do all the work to bring Preeti back home and make her do all the household chores. Keertan brings in a technician to fix the computer and learns the software was deleted. Preeti scans through the keyboard and finds a broken fake nail stuck in the keys. She shows it to Keertan, and they find out that this person has stolen the idea was wearing fake nails. Neelima tells K.T. that maybe Preeti is the one who leaked the information to Chanda, but K.T. disagrees. Preeti shows the broken nail to Juhi who recognises the nail as Priyanka's but the latter changes her nails after overhearing their conversation. Keertan and Preeti meet their new client, Mrs. Goplani while Priyanka visits Tarun. Tarun proposes to Priyanka, but she refuses as Tarun is already married, and she is about to be married as well.
