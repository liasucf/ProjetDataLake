    "text": "Pictures at Eleven is the debut solo album by former Led Zeppelin singer Robert Plant, released in 1982. Genesis drummer Phil Collins played drums for six of the album's eight songs. Ex-Rainbow drummer Cozy Powell handled drums on \"Slow Dancer\" and \"Like I've Never Been Gone.\" The title was an often-heard phrase in U.S. television news that would follow a brief announcement of a story of interest to be shown later during a station's 11 p.m. news program. Pictures at Eleven is the only one of Plant's solo albums to appear on Led Zeppelin's record label Swan Song. By the time of Plant's next release, 1983's The Principle of Moments, Swan Song had ceased to function and Plant had started his own label titled Es Paranza, which would also be distributed by Atlantic Records. Rhino Entertainment released a remastered edition of the album, with bonus tracks, on 20 March 2007. == Critical reception == In a contemporary review for Rolling Stone, Kurt Loder wrote, \"even though there's nothing new going on in these grooves, the sheer formal thrill of hearing someone who knows exactly what he's doing makes Pictures at Eleven something of an event almost in spite of its modest ambitions.\" Robert Christgau from The Village Voice was impressed by Plant's ability to recreate Led Zeppelin's aural sensibilities with duller musicians and catchier undertones, but ultimately found the music somewhat insignificant. ==Track listing== All songs written by Robert Plant and Robbie Blunt, except \"Burning Down One Side,\" \"Fat Lip,\" and \"Far Post\" written by Plant, Blunt and Jezz Woodroffe. ;Side one #\"Burning Down One Side\" \u2013 3:55 #\"Moonlight in Samosa\" \u2013 3:58 #\"Pledge Pin\" \u2013 4:01 #\"Slow Dancer\" \u2013 7:43 ;Side two # * \"Worse Than Detroit\" \u2013 5:55 #\"Fat Lip\" \u2013 5:05 #\"Like I've Never Been Gone\" \u2013 5:56 #\"Mystery Title\" \u2013 5:16 ===2007 remaster bonus tracks=== # * \"Far Post\" \u2013 4:42 #\"Like I've Never Been Gone\" (Live at Houston, 1983) \u2013 7:31 ==Personnel== *Robert Plant \u2013 vocals *Robbie Blunt \u2013 guitars *Jezz Woodroffe \u2013 keyboards, synthesizers *Phil Collins \u2013 drums on tracks 1-3, 5, 6, 8, all bonus tracks *Cozy Powell \u2013 drums on tracks 4 and 7 *Paul Martinez \u2013 bass guitar *Raphael Ravenscroft \u2013 saxophone on track 3 ==Charts== Album {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Chart !Position |- |1982 |Australia (Kent Music Report) |align=\"center\"|6 |- |1982 |UK Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|2 |- |1982 |US Billboard 200 |align=\"center\"|5 |- |} Singles and album tracks {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Single !Chart !Position |- |1982 |\"Burning Down One Side\" |UK Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|73 |- |1982 |\"Burning Down One Side\" |US Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|64 |- |1982 |\"Pledge Pin\" |US Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|74 |- |1982 |\"Burning Down One Side\" |US Billboard Top Tracks |align=\"center\"|3 |- |1982 |\"Worse Than Detroit\" |US Billboard Top Tracks |align=\"center\"|10 |- |1982 |\"Pledge Pin\" |US Billboard Top Tracks |align=\"center\"|11 |- |1982 |\"Slow Dancer\" |US Billboard Top Tracks |align=\"center\"|19 |- |1983 |\"Far Post\" |US Billboard Top Tracks |align=\"center\"|12 |- |} ==References== ==External links== *Official Robert Plant Website *Rockfield Studios Category:Robert Plant albums Category:1982 debut albums Category:Swan Song Records albums Category:Albums recorded at Rockfield Studios ",
