Built in the 12th century (circa 1114), the building looks like a fortified rectangle from the exterior. The courtyard and four Iwan floorplan is that of the traditional standard Iranian mosque. The walls and the pishtaq (), the entrance way inside an iwan, are decorated with vegetal and geometric patterning that function to provide a good example of the \"Textile Metaphor\" seen in Islamic architecture of this era. The caravanserai consists of two inter-related four Iwan planned courtyards, famous for owning some of the most diverse and beautiful brick decorations in Iranian architecture. ==See also== *Timeline of Islamic history *Islamic architecture *Islamic art == References == Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1114 Category:12th-century architecture Category:Ribats Category:Architecture of Iran Category:Caravanserais in Iran Category:National Works of Iran Category:Tourist attractions in Razavi Khorasan Province ",
