    "text": "GPD Win is a Windows-based handheld computer equipped with a keyboard and gaming controls. It is an x86-based device which runs a full version of Windows 10 Home. The device was envisioned primarily with video game console emulation and PC gaming in mind, but is capable of running any x86 Windows- based application that can run within the confines of the computer's technical specifications. First announced in October 2015, it was crowdfunded via Indiegogo and two other crowdfunding sites in Japan and China, and was released in October 2016. == History == GamePad Digital (GPD) is a technology company based in Shenzhen, China. Among other products, they have created several handheld video game consoles which run Android on ARM architecture. For instance, GPD XD. GPD Win was meant to be a way to play PC games, PC-based video game console emulators, and hypervisors (such as VMware and VirtualBox clients) on a handheld device. The appeal of the Win was intended to be, that an x86 Windows handheld PC console offers far more PC and emulator gaming support than other architectures and operating systems that are widely used on mobile devices (such as Linux or Android on ARM hardware, or proprietary systems). GPD widely touts this ability on the device's Indiegogo page, with video demonstrations. GamePad Digital first pitched the idea of GPD Win to the community in October 2015 as concept for market research, with further planning in November. By December, the physical design and hardware specifications were determined. By March 2016, initial prototypes were finished, debugged, and shipped to select sources. GPD started accepting pre- orders in June 2016 through several online retailers, including the Indiegogo page. Pre-order backers are offered the device for a discounted price of $330, with an estimated final retail price of $499, but settling on a price of $330 after release. The initial stated goal was $100,000. By August 2016, a small batch shipment to industry personnel were shipped, and by September, the pre- order promotional pricing ceased. GPD started shipping the final product by October 2016, with pre-order backers receiving their devices first. == Software == GPD Win runs Windows 10 Home. GPD stated that per an April 2014 Microsoft decision, Windows is free on all devices with screens smaller than 9 inches. However, devices shipped to backers have a Windows 10 product key to input on initial boot and setup of the device. Unlike most Windows smartphones, GPD Win is able to run any x86 Windows application that can also be run on PC laptops and desktops. As of April 2017, several patches are available for the Linux kernel that allow a mostly complete functionality of the Win with a full desktop GNU/Linux like Ubuntu. There are also ways to get Android to work on GPD Win. There's a guide of how to install it and make it dual-boot on https://www.black-seraph.com == Technical and physical specifications == GPD Win has a full QWERTY keyboard, which includes 67 standard keys and 10 expanded function keys. For gaming, the controller is stylized similar to the OpenPandora and DragonBox Pyra style keyboard and controller layout: one D-pad, two analog sticks, four face buttons, and four shoulder buttons (two on each shoulder). GPD Win was initially intended to use the Intel Atom x5-Z8500 Cherry Trail CPU. The graphics processor is an Intel HD Graphics integrated GPU with a base clock speed of 200 MHz and a turbo boost of up to 600 MHz. GPD Win uses 4GB LPDDR3-1600 RAM, with 64GB ROM eMMC 4.51. It has a single microSD slot that can officially support a maximum of 128GB of storage. However, it can unofficially support a microSD card of 256GB. GPD Win is 15.5\u00d79.7cm in size. It has a 5.5-inch 1280\u00d7720 (720p) H-IPS multi-directional touch screen in 16:9 ratio. It is reinforced by Gorilla Glass 3. The audio system consists of a built-in speaker using the Realtek ALC5645 driver, and a microphone jack. It supports most popular audio, video, and image formats, including MP3, MP4, 3GP, WMV/WMA FLAC, AVI, MOV, JPG, PNG, and BMP. GPD Win has a 6700mAh polymer lithium-ion battery with USB C charging interface (5 V/2.5 A). It has a stated ability to play 80 continuous hours of music or 6\u20138 hours of online video or online gaming. It is Bluetooth 4.0 and 802.11 b/g/n/ac (5 GHz and 2.4 GHz) Wifi capable. GamePad Digital has continued to support GPD Win past release, taking user feedback into account, with driver and hardware updates. As of January 10, 2017, GPD revised the Win's hardware, providing a fix for Intel graphics driver stability issues, fixing the AC charging/boot-up bug (described in the reviews section), improved cooling, as well as improving the tactile feedback of the D-Pad, buttons, and keyboard. This includes a software update that improves the buttons' responsiveness, and makes changes to the functionality of the built- in pointer. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Category !!

JC Torres of Slashgear gave the Win a 7/10. Stating that it has solid technical specs per expected needs, it's ambitious for being a Windows 10-based handheld console in an industry dominated by Linux-based handhelds, and is well rounded with features. However, he also noted an inconsistent build quality among models, and mediocre sound quality (\"loud, but low\"). Ultimately, he called it an \"exceptional device\". Linus Sebastian made a video review of the GPD Win on his YouTube channel LinusTechTips. He complimented its gaming and multitasking capabilities, and was impressed with the hardware specs and hardware design and features overall (to include more I/O ports and features than for instance, a common MacBook). He did lament that the system had some flaws. Among them: The shoulder buttons felt cheaply assembled; the 5.5\" 720P screen was not friendly for scaling, and that the device has a bug where it must not be plugged into the AC adapter when pressing the power button in order to boot up (otherwise, it simply loads to the charging screen. It must be plugged back in only after system boot up starts. This issue has since been fixed in subsequent releases). His official verdict was that deciding whether it was worth the price was up to the user, and that the Win made him excited about the prospect of what UMPCs will be capable of in the near future as the hardware progresses further. He compared it to Apple's first iPhone (while stating that it was not as revolutionary), in that it's a great concept that has some flaws with its execution, but is ambitious, practical, and is set to be much better in the future. ==GPD Win 2== GamePad Digital announced the GPD Win 2 In early 2017. The Win 2 is a significant upgrade which is able to run AAA spec games, as well as better video game console emulation. It has an Intel Core m3 CPU, Intel HD 615 graphics, 8GB LPDDR3 RAM, a 128GB M.2 solid- state drive, as well as the same I/O ports as the GPD Win. There are a few external hardware changes, including moving the analog knobs outward, D-input will be dropped, and an additional shoulder button on each shoulder, for six total. The price for crowdfunding backers is $649, with a tentative retail price of $899. The Indiegogo campaign launched on January 15, 2018, with a final release date of May 2018. The Indiegogo campaign saw rapid success, far surpassing its stated goal within days. == See also == * Comparison of handheld game consoles * Dragonbox Pyra * GPD XD * GPD Win Max * Pandora (console) * PC gaming * Handheld gaming == External links == * GPD Win homepage * GPD Win Indiegogo page == References == Category:Handheld game consoles Category:Mobile computers Category:Indiegogo projects Category:Windows 10 Category:Subnotebooks ",
