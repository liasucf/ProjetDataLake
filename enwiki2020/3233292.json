    "text": "Rafael Santos Torroella (1914, in Portbou - 2002, in Barcelona) was a Spanish art critic, translator and poet.(ca)enciclopedia.cat Brother of \u00c0ngels Santos Torroella, he wrote several books on Joan Mir\u00f3, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dal\u00ed, among others, and helped renovate the avant-garde art scene in Spain after the Spanish Civil War. Santos published his Antolog\u00eda Po\u00e9tica in 1952. He is considered as a major authority in the artistic universe. His bibliography is very important (references in all important libraries, not only in European countries but all around the world). A lot of books and works, particularly about Mir\u00f3 and Dal\u00ed, have really established his fame. But it seems that his life is not very well known.(es) Obituary abc.es(es) Obituary Elcultural(es)El Pais, Jose Garcia-Velasco, \"Rafael Santos Torroella, cr\u00edtico y escritor\", 1 Oct. 2002(es)El Pais, Ian Gibson, \"Rafael Santos Torroella\", 14 Oct. 2003 == References == Category:1914 births Category:2002 deaths Category:Spanish art critics Category:People from Alt Empord\u00e0 Category:Spanish translators Category:Catalan translators Category:Translators from English Category:Translators from French Category:Translators to Catalan Category:Translators to Spanish Category:20th-century translators ",
