She stated: \"The effect of that linguistic shift made a writer out of me \u2013 the shedding of my native tongue (Geordie), and the language of the hearth to try to belong 'elsewhere' snapped a root that could never be mended and kept me, like most writers, on the edge, always the observer, the listener.\" France attended the University of Leeds, studying English and History.
