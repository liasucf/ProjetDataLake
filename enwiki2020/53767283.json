    "text": "Olga Hudlick\u00e1 (11 July 1926 \u2013 3 May 2014) was a Czech-born physiologist, who fled the normalization of communism in her country and moved to England. Working at the University of Birmingham, she studied blood flow and restriction, as well as capillary growth in cardiac and skeletal muscles. ==Early life== Olga Hudlick\u00e1 was born on 11 July 1926 P\u0159elou\u010d, Czechoslovakia to Marie (n\u00e9e Babackova) and Jaroslav Hudlick\u00fd. Her mother worked as a clerk and her father was an engineer in P\u0159elou\u010d. Hudlick\u00e1 began her schooling in Olomouc and then completed her secondary education in Prague. During her schooling, the Nazis invaded and occupied her homeland. After completing her mandatory work brigades, she finished high school in 1945. When World War II ended, Hudlick\u00e1 began her medical studies at Charles University, earning her medical degree in 1950. That same year, she married a physician who worked at Prague's main hospital, Andrei Klein. Hudlick\u00e1 continued her education at the (), inspired to study muscle blood flow by the work of Ernest Gutmann. Completing her PhD in 1954, she was invited to work in the Pharmacology Department at the Karolinska Institute of Stockholm in 1960. That same year, she became the honorary secretary of the Czechoslovak Physiological Society. In 1964, she was again invited to study abroad and took a position at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. After completing her Doctor of Science degree in 1968 at FG\u00da, she returned to Duke to study in the laboratory of Gene Renkin. Despite the Cold War, the liberalization during the Prague Spring allowed her obtain permission for the additional studies and to attend the International Congress of Physiological Sciences, held that year in Washington, D. C.. By the time that Hudlick\u00e1 returned to Czechoslovakia, just before Christmas, the period of liberalization was over and the USSR had brought in tanks to suppress the Czechoslovak government. In spite of the return to authoritarianism, Hudlick\u00e1 was allowed to present a paper at Oxford's Physiological Society in the summer of 1969. While they were in England, she and her husband made plans to evacuate their family from Czechoslovakia. Soon after their return to the country, on the pretense of a holiday visit with friends, they flew their son to London and sent their daughter to Colmar in northern France. With the children securely out of the country, Hudlick\u00e1 and Klein packed a small suitcase and drove to visit friends in Hungary. From Hungary, the couple drove on to France to meet their daughter, via Austria and Italy. In Paris, they were reunited with their son and the family made their way to Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland, where they met Hudlick\u00e1's mother and put her on a plane to USA for a visit with Hudlick\u00e1's older brother while the family decided where to settle. Their escape occurred just before the Czechoslovakian borders were closed on 15 September 1969. ==Career== Hudlick\u00e1 obtained work at the Max Planck Institute, but by the end of the year, she and her children moved to England as she had accepted an invitation to join the department of physiology of Birmingham University. By February 1970, her husband and mother were reunited with the family. Klein began working at a hospital in Birmingham, while Hudlick\u00e1 resumed her interest in blood flow. She published a monograph in 1973, Muscle Blood Flow, which was followed by Angiogenesis in 1986. This work was influential in its investigation of capillary growth in cardiac and skeletal muscles. Evaluating the mechanisms that regulate blood flow and the process by which new blood vessels form, Hudlick\u00e1 recognized that by indirectly using electrical stimulation on skeletal muscles, one could alter the mechanisms which deliver oxygen and nutrients to muscles. The therapeutic implications for patients included resistance to fatigue and increased blood flow, similar to that obtained by exercise training, for patients afflicted with heart failure, hypertension, or stroke. Hudlick\u00e1 authored or co-authored over 200 publications, edited and reviewed works for such publications as Microcirculation, and trained doctoral students. She served as honorary secretary of the British Microcirculation Society between 1985 and 1992 and as its president from 1996 to 1999. Hudlick\u00e1 served as a visiting professor at many international universities, including the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas, the University of California at Davis, and the University of Frankfurt am Main. She was the recipient of numerous awards, including delivering the Annual Review Lecture of the Physiological Society in 1990; the Benjamin W. Zweifach Award of the Microcirculatory Society in 1996; and the Malpighi Award of the European Society for Microcirculation in 2008. After her retirement in 1993, Hudlick\u00e1 continued working as a professor emeritus and continued practicing in surgery and conducting research. Among works she published were Application of Muscle/Nerve Stimulation in Health and Disease in 2008 and several cookbooks detailing recipes to treat specific types of ailments and disease. ==Death and legacy== Hudlick\u00e1 died on 3 May 2014, after a fall. Her work on the mechanisms regulating the growth of capillaries, how cancerous tumors are invaded by blood vessels and new blood vessels are formed, provided fundamental understanding of muscle performance and therapeutic approaches which can be used to alleviate vascular disease. == References == Category:1926 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Czechoslovak people Category:Women physiologists Category:20th-century Czech women writers Category:21st-century Czech women writers Category:Academics of the University of Birmingham Category:Czech women scientists ",
