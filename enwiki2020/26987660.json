    "text": "Margaret Corbin Monument is a monument and United States Military Academy Cemetery, in honor of Margaret Corbin (November 12, 1751 \u2013 January 16, 1800), a heroine of the American Revolution. She died in Highland Falls, New York and was buried near the Hudson River. In 1926, remains believed to be hers were disinterred and reburied near the entrance to the West Point Cemetery by the Daughters of the American Revolution. However, a 2017 study revealed that these were instead the remains of an unknown man; the location of Corbin's remains is unknown.A New Chapter in the Story of Revolutionary Heroine Margaret Corbin, DARNot Capt.
