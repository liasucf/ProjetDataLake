It is home to the Evansville Philharmonic Orchestra and also hosts local ballet and modern dance companies, theatre companies, and touring productions. Opened on June 16, 1921 and originally seating 2,500 patrons, the theater was part of the Sonntag Hotel \u2013 Victory Theater complex that was organized by Marcus Sonntag and associates who were stockholders in the American Trust and Savings Bank across Sixth Street from the theater. Along with Frederick H. Gruneberg, St., President of the Consolidated Theaters Corporation, Sonntag and his associates contracted with Hoffman Construction Company to build the theater. It was air conditioned with commercial ice.

In the Limelight \u2013 Historic Theaters of Evansville. Evansville: The Evansville Museum of Arts and Science, 1994, p. 6. The Loews's Victory Theatre closed in 1971. As the independent Victory Theatre it was divided into a triplex, but was closed in 1979. The theater was restored to its former glory and reopened in 1998 after a $15 million renovation. The Victory was designed by architect John Pridmore of Chicago. The exterior is in the restrained style characteristic of commercial buildings of the era, but the auditorium is more ornate. The stage, wide and deep, was at the time it was built one of the largest in the Midwest. In 1982 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. It is owned by the City of Evansville and is co-managed with The Ford Center by VenuWorks. ==References== ==External links== *The Centre website (which includes Victory Theatre events) *Historic Evansville; Victory Theater/Hotel Sonntag *Victory Theater and Hotel Sonntag, Historic Landmarks Foundation of Indiana, National Register of Historic Places (1983) Category:Buildings and structures in Evansville, Indiana Category:Culture of Evansville, Indiana Category:Cinemas and movie theaters in Indiana Category:Theatres in Indiana Category:Tourist attractions in Evansville, Indiana Category:Loew's Theatres buildings and structures Category:Theatres on the National Register of Historic Places in Indiana Category:Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Indiana Category:National Register of Historic Places in Evansville, Indiana ",
