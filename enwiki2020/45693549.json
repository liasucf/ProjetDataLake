Asprise OCR has been in active development since 1997. Version 2.1 of the software has been reviewed by PC World.Asprise OCR SDK for Java by PC World Many researchers have used Asprise OCR along with ABBYY FineReader to benchmark OCR performance. Pawe\u0142 \u0141upkowski and Mariusz Urbanski from Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna\u0144 uses Asprise OCR version 4 and ABBYY FineReader to perform CAPTCHA recognition.SemCAPTCHA\u2014user-friendly alternative for OCR-based CAPTCHA systems (Proceedings of the International Multiconference on Computer Science and Information Technology pp. 325\u2013329) Shuai Yuan from Cornell University implemented an image based room schedule retrieval system using Asprise OCR.Image Based Room Schedule Retrieval System Seongwook Youn from University of Southern California found \"By running a sample of 200 image e-mails, we determined that Asprise OCR was performing with an accuracy of 95%. It had the best detection rate among the approaches we analyzed; hence we decided to go with Asprise OCR for our research.\".
