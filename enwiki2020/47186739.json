The single elimination tournament was played at the Allen County War Memorial Coliseum in Fort Wayne, Indiana during May 2000. UCLA defeated Ohio State in the final match, 3\u20130 (15\u20138, 15\u201310, 17\u201315), to win their eighteenth national title. The Bruins (29\u20135) were coached by Al Scates. UCLA's Brandon Taliaferro was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Taliaferro, along with five other players, comprised the All-Tournament Team. ==Qualification== Until the creation of the NCAA Men's Division III Volleyball Championship in 2012, there was only a single national championship for men's volleyball. As such, all NCAA men's volleyball programs, whether from Division I, Division II, or Division III, were eligible. A total of 4 teams were invited to contest this championship. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Team ! Appearance !
