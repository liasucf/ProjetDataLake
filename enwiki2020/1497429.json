    "text": "Argybargy is the third album by the UK new wave band Squeeze. Written and recorded after the band's successful sophomore release, Cool for Cats, the album's lyrics were written by Chris Difford while living with his wife in New York City. The band reunited with Cool for Cats producer John Wood and, after Glenn Tilbrook composed music for Difford's new lyrics, recorded the album in late 1979. Argybargy was a commercial and critical success, reaching number 32 in the UK and becoming the first Squeeze album to chart in the US. The album has since been recognized as a classic of new wave and features multiple of the band's most famous songs, including \"Another Nail in My Heart,\" \"Pulling Mussels (from the Shell),\" and \"If I Didn't Love You.\" ==Background== Following the commercial success of the band's previous album, Cool for Cats, as well as a successful international tour, Squeeze reached its highest level of success to that point. This level of fame and recognition began to take its toll; Glenn Tilbrook worried of becoming \"too big for [his] boots\" and struggled with being recognized in public. He recalled, Following the Cool for Cats tour, Chris Difford married spent the summer of 1979 in the US with his wife. There he wrote over forty new lyrics, inspired by his new marriage and his time spent in Greenwich Village. He recalled, \"I would sit in the flat all day while [wife] Cindy went to work and this fluidity of lyricism came gushing forth. The whole of the Argybargy album came in one fell swoop and lots more besides that never saw the light of day.\" ==Recording== When asked by A&M; Records to produce a third album, the band brought back Cool for Cats producer John Wood and Tilbrook composed music for the best of Difford's new lyrics. The album was recorded during the tail end of 1979. Argybargy would be the last Squeeze album featuring founding member Jools Holland until Squeeze's first reunion album, 1985's Cosi Fan Tutti Frutti. Difford recalled, \"He was becoming less and less involved at this time. I think he was getting frustrated that he wasn't getting more of a shout in the band, but by then he was spending less time thinking about being in the band and more about his career.\" Holland would release a solo album before moving to a television career. ==Title== The album was titled Argybargy, a British expression that Difford said \"sums up succinctly what our lives were like at the time. We were in each other's pockets, travelling in a minibus and on Freddie Laker planes. It was getting tiring, but we lived on the adrenalin of it.\" Because the titular expression is not used in America, band manager Miles Copeland opposed the album name. Difford recalled, \"Miles told us no one would know what it meant but we didn't give a shit and were in a belligerent, young Englishmen's mood, so we kept it.\" ==Reception== Argybargy was released in February 1980 peaking at number 32 in the UK Albums Chart spending 15 weeks in that listing. The album was the first Squeeze album to chart in the US, reaching number 71. On the US dance chart, all cuts from \"Argybargy\" peaked at number 76, and spent 6 weeks on that listing, in the summer of 1980. Argybargy has seen critical acclaim from music writers. Chris Jones of the BBC called the album \"their crowning achievement\" and \"a masterpiece of kitchen sink pop,\" concluding, \"If you're going to own at least one Squeeze album, this has to be the one.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote, \"Argybargy doesn't stay in one place; it's restless and crackling with colors... with Argybargy it was clear that Squeeze were at the top of the pack among new wave popsters, and that their sardonic yet lively voice was unique among any pop group before or since.\" === Accolades === Paste Magazine named Argybargy as the 20th best new wave album, calling it the band's \"first truly great\" album and concluding, \"Clever, infectious, with genuine emotion lying just below the surface\u2014it's everything a great New Wave record should be.\" The John M. Borack book Shake Some Action - The Ultimate Guide To Power Pop ranked Argybagy at number 58 in its list \"The 200 Greatest Power Pop Albums\". ==Track listing== The track listing below is from the original UK LP release. On the American release, the song order was changed slightly, with \"If I Didn't Love You\" moved up to the first track of the second side, but the order otherwise remaining the same.
