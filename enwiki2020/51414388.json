    "text": "Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are now being used by cosmetic companies like L'Oreal and L'Core Paris when it comes to creating creams and lotions. Gold nanoparticles have been used in the past in pharmaceutical and medical uses, but it is only recently that cosmetic brands are seeking patents for gold nanoparticles to use them for cosmetic formulation. According to ongoing cancer studies, the use of gold nanoparticles can be an effective method to destroy malignant cells in the body though thanks to 3 treatments : * AuNPs as a way to deliver medecine inside the body. This allows a precise delivery of the medecine without causing an unwanted reaction from the body. * AuNPs as a way to kill cancer cells when combined with photodynamic therapy. This allows the use of light to create a reaction in the gold that will create a chemical reaction killing the cancer cell. * AuNPs as a way to kill cancer cells when combined with photothermal therapy. This allows the use of light to create a reaction in the gold that will increase the temperature of the AuNPs that kills the cancer cell. A research conducted by Tatsiana Mironava, PhD, from Stony Brook University claims that the size, concentration and frequency of application plays a major part in determining if the material is toxic. Research studies are being conducted to find out the benefits of using gold nanoparticles in cosmetic products and creams. Some of the products that claim to use gold in the formulation would include the L'Core Paris 24k Collection. The recent studies have concluded that gold is inert, and completely safe for internal medicine, but there is still an ongoing research as to the effects of gold when applied on other purposes in the body. ==Gold in skin care products== Gold is now considered as a go to ingredient in skin care products. It is now flaked, liquified and added in moisturizers, sunscreens, eye creams and lip balms. Spa centers also use gold facials, and these are priced around $100 to $1,000. Cosmetic makers cite the use of gold in medicine, it is given to patients with rheumatoid arthritis. A professor and cancer researcher named Debabrata Mukhopadhya at the Mayo Clinic stated that while gold nano particles show promise for skin care they are still toxic when injected in high doses in mice. A lot of Dermathologyst even go up to say this about gold in skin care :\"At best, they do nothing, and at worst, they can give you irritation of the skin\" ==Brands using Nanocosmetics== Using different surveys, it was found that almost all the major cosmetic manufacturers are already using nanotechnology in their products. Cosmetics Estee Lauder and L'Core Paris have entered the Nanomarket, with a range of products that make use of \"Nanoparticles\". Nano silver and Nanogold are harnessed for their antibacterial properties and used in cosmetic products. Manufacturers are producing underarm deodorants with claim that they provide 24-Hour antibacterial protection. Nanosized gold, like nanosilver, is said to be effective in disinfecting bacteria in the mouth and is added in toothpaste. ==References== Cosmetics Category:Cosmetics ",
