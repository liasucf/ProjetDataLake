    "text": "The Argentine presidential election of 1910 was held on 13 March to choose the president of Argentina. Roque S\u00e1enz Pe\u00f1a was elected president. ==Background== The ailing President Quintana's death in 1906 was the beginning of the end of Roca's dominance of national politics and policy. Moderate opposition to the PAN had greatly eroded its majorities in Congress, the very day the president died, and within months, Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre and Carlos Pellegrini were dead, as well. President Jos\u00e9 Figueroa Alcorta defied Roca by signing many of Congressman Palacios' labor law reform bills and by 1909, Figueroa Alcorta was poised to nominate the reformist who had been turned away in 1892: Roque S\u00e1enz Pe\u00f1a.Todo Argentina: 1910 Other prominent conservatives, such as La Naci\u00f3n publisher Emilio Mitre and Buenos Aires Governor Marcelino Ugarte, presented token candidacies. S\u00e1enz Pe\u00f1a, who was the Ambassador to Italy and did not campaign, was selected unanimously on April 12, 1910. He promptly began negotiations with UCR leader Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen for the introduction of legislation providing for universal male suffrage and the secret ballot. The president struggled over the bill with a still-conservative Congress, and on 10 February 1912, the Senate narrowly passed Law 8871. Providing for free and fair elections, as well as for the country's first uniform system of voter registration, the S\u00e1enz Pe\u00f1a Law brought the prolonged \"vote song\" to an end.Todo Argentina: 1912 ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=19% ! colspan=2| Argentine Republic |- | Population | align=right| 7,092,000 |- | Voters | align=right| 199,000 |- | Turnout | align=right| 2.8% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"50%\" |- !width=\"50%\"| Presidential Candidates !width=\"35%\"| Party !width=\"15%\"| Electoral Votes |-style=\"background:#cfc;\" | Roque S\u00e1enz Pe\u00f1a | National Autonomist Party | 265 |- | Adolfo Contte | Liberal Party of Corrientes | 1 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total voters | 266 |- | colspan=2| Did not vote | 34 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total | 300 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"50%\" |- !width=\"50%\"| Vice Presidential Candidates !width=\"35%\"| Party !width=\"15%\"| Electoral Votes |-style=\"background:#cfc;\" | Victorino de la Plaza | National Autonomist Party | 262 |- | Indalecio G\u00f3mez | \u2014 | 2 |- | Manuel Mar\u00eda de Iriondo | Radical Civic Union | 1 |- | Valent\u00edn Virasoro | Liberal Party of Corrientes | 1 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total voters | 266 |- | colspan=2| Did not vote | 34 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total | 300 |} === Results by Province === {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"65%\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=2| Province ! colspan=2| President ! rowspan=2 width=\"1%\"| ! colspan=4| Vice President |- !
