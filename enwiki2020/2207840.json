In the 1960s and 1970s, luminaries of the counter-culture, including Bob Dylan and Cat Stevens made pilgrimages to the ridge to visit these established inhabitants. In 1962, Allen Ginsberg came with Peter Orlovsky, Gary Snyder and Joanne Kyger to visit Lama Govinda. Ginsberg commented in a letter to John Kelley that \"Rishikesh and Almora were not unlike the Catskills readily accessible, only more spiritual.Baker, Deborah (2008).

Scottish psychiatrist, R. D. Laing spent some time there in the early 1970s; as did Robert Thurman, the Buddhist scholar, who spent six months with his wife Nena von Schlebr\u00fcgge and family, including their 3-year-old daughter Uma Thurman, studying with Lama Govinda as a part of his doctoral dissertation over the summer of 1971.Thurman, Robert and Wise, Tad.

Physician Karl-Heinz Gottmann, composer Peter Michael Hamel and the philosopher Volker Zotz visited his ashram. In the mid-seventies Alfred 'Sunyata' Sorensen was taken to San Francisco by the Alan Watts society. The village of Kasar Devi has now become a cult destination, many incognito celebs visit frequently and it also has a small community of backpackers. Participants of the hippie movement settled there ever since the place gained the reputation of being a Power Centre during the 1960s counter- culture. This reputation is due to the alleged gap in the Van Allen Belt above the ridge, a perception arguably strengthened by the free and easy availability of hemp on the slopes. There is also a Buddhist meditation center on the ridge. This Center is in a Buddhist Ashram (Bodh Ashram), originally the estate of Evans-Wentz, then of Lama Anagarika Govinda, then of a Tibetan- Ladakhi family. The Center is affiliated to the Drikung Kagyu order of Tibetan Buddhism. * Manali * Goa ==References== ==External links== * KasarDevi (Crank's Ridge) at Kumaon: Kala Shilp Aur Sanskriti :: www.himvan.com * Kasar Devi and Ridge videos and slideshows, especially from Lama Anagarika Govinda's Buddhist Ashram area and around, 2000-2007 and 2013 Category:Almora Category:Hippie movement Category:Landforms of Uttarakhand Category:Ridges of India Category:Tourism in Uttarakhand ",
