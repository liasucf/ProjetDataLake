The celebration features Bus\u00f3s (people wearing traditional masks) and includes folk music, masquerading, parades and dancing. Bus\u00f3j\u00e1r\u00e1s lasts six days, usually during February. It starts on a Thursday, followed by the Kisfarsang (Little Farsang) carnival on Friday, with the biggest celebration, Farsang vas\u00e1rnap (Farsang Sunday) on the seventh Sunday before Easter Sunday; the celebration then ends with Farsangtemet\u00e9s (Burial of Farsang) on the following Tuesday (Shrove Tuesday or Mardi Gras). These traditional festivities have been inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of the UNESCO in 2009. Bus\u00f3 festivities at Moh\u00e1cs: masked end-of-winter carnival custom. Description and decision at the UNESCO's website. Accessed on 11 January 2013. Locals explain the Carnival with two related but different legends. According to the most popular legend, during the Ottoman times of the territory, people from Moh\u00e1cs fled the town, and started living in the nearby swamps and woods to avoid Ottoman (Turkish) troops. One night, while they were sitting and talking around the fire, an old \u0160okac man appeared suddenly from nowhere, and said to them: \"Don't be afraid, your lives will soon turn to good and you'll return to your homes. Until that time, prepare for the battle, carve various weapons and scary masks for yourselves, and wait for a stormy night when a masked knight will come to you.\" He disappeared as suddenly as he arrived. The refugees followed his orders, and some days later, on a stormy night, the knight arrived. He ordered them to put on their masks and go back to Moh\u00e1cs, making as much noise as possible. They followed his lead. The Turks were so frightened by the noise, the masks, and the storm in the night, that they thought demons were attacking them, and they ran away from the town before sunrise. In the older, less popular story, the bus\u00f3s are scaring away not the Turks but Winter itself. In any case, the locals have celebrated the Bus\u00f3j\u00e1r\u00e1s in early February every year ever since, hosting \"guest Bus\u00f3 teams\" from neighbouring countries (Croatia and Serbia, local \u0160okci Croats and Slovenia) and also from Poland. ==Gallery== Buso masks.jpg|Bus\u00f3 masks (Moh\u00e1cs, February 2006) Mascara bus\u00f3.jpg|Bus\u00f3 mask from the collection of the Museu da Imigra\u00e7\u00e3o de S\u00e3o Paulo (Immigration Museum of S\u00e3o Paulo) - Brazil Bus\u00f3-walking - Bus\u00f3j\u00e1r\u00e1s.jpg|Bus\u00f3-walking - Bus\u00f3j\u00e1r\u00e1s Bus\u00f3-walking of the Hungarian Carnival - Farsangi bus\u00f3j\u00e1r\u00e1s.jpg|Bus\u00f3-walking of the Hungarian Carnival - Farsangi bus\u00f3j\u00e1r\u00e1s.
