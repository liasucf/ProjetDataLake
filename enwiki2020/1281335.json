Her father was a blacksmith. In 1924, she moved to M\u00fclheim and married Wilhelm Langefeld, who died in 1926 of lung disease. In 1928, Langefeld fell pregnant with another man, left him soon afterward, and moved to D\u00fcsseldorf, where her son was born that August. Langefeld was unemployed until age 34, when she began to teach domestic economy in an establishment of the city of Neuss. From 1935 onwards, she worked as a guard in a so-called Arbeitsanstalt (working institution) in Brauweiler, which was, in fact, a prison for prostitutes, unemployed and homeless women, and other so called \"antisocial\" women, who were then later imprisoned in concentration camps. From 1937 on, Langefeld was a member of the Nazi party. ==Camp work== In March 1938, Langefeld applied for a job as a camp guard in the first SS concentration camp for women in Lichtenburg. After one year, she became the female superintendent of this camp, where she stayed until the camp population was transferred to Ravensbr\u00fcck in May 1939. She was in charge of the selections in Ravensbr\u00fcck during the so-called \"14f13\u201d murder campaign. In March 1942, Langefeld was assigned to build a new women's camp in Auschwitz. There, she selected prisoners for the gas chamber. Rudolf H\u00f6ss, the Commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp, recalled his contact with Johanna Langefeld as follows: > The chief female supervisor of the period, Frau Langefeld, was in no way > capable of coping with the situation, yet she refused to accept any > instructions given her by the leader of the protective custody camp. Acting > on my own initiative, I simply put the women's camp under his jurisdiction. During the visit of Heinrich Himmler on 18 July 1942, Langefeld tried to get him to annul this order. In fact, Rudolf H\u00f6ss admitted after the war that \u201cthe Reichsf\u00fchrer SS absolutely refused\u201d his order and that he wished \u201ca women's camp to be commanded by a woman\u201d. Himmler ordered that Langefeld should stay in charge of the women's camp and that in the future, no SS man should enter the female camp. That month, the Auschwitz women's camp was moved to Auschwitz-Birkenau camp three km away. Two weeks later, Langefeld sustained an injury of her meniscus and required a cartilage operation in the Hohenlychen SS Sanatorium near Ravensbr\u00fcck. During her stay there, she went to see Oswald Pohl, the chief of the SS Economy and Administration Head Office, in Berlin- Lichterfelde, and convinced him to transfer her back to Ravensbr\u00fcck. Maria Mandl became the new Oberaufseherin of the women's prisoner camp in Auschwitz. Oswald Pohl instructed the Chief of Department D of his SS Economy and Administration Head Office, Richard Gl\u00fccks, to order that duties of protective custody camp leaders in the Women's Camps be executed thereafter by the female superintendents, the Oberaufseherinnen. Margarete Buber-Neumann, who became Langefeld's prisoner assistant in Ravensbr\u00fcck, recorded that Langefeld was dismissed for excessive sympathy with Polish prisoners; she was separated from her son, taken under arrest to Breslau, where an SS tribunal prepared a trial against her. Langefeld never went to trial, and was released from her camp duties. She then moved to Munich and started to work for BMW.Albert Langen\u2014Georg M\u00fcller, Milena\u2014Kafkas Freundin, Verlag, Munich, 1977 ==Arrest and death== On 20 December 1945, Langefeld was arrested by the U.S. Army, and in September 1946, was extradited to the Polish judiciary preparing a trial in Krak\u00f3w against SS personnel in Auschwitz. On 23 December 1946, she escaped from prison. Given her prior relatively positive treatment of inmates in this German Nazi concentration camp located on occupied Polish soil, the escape was assisted by Polish staff of the prison where she was held.Langefeld escape info, wysokieobcasy.pl; accessed 2 September 2017. After the escape she hid in a convent, working in a private home. Sometime around 1957, she returned illegally to live with her sister in Munich. She died in Augsburg, Germany on 26 January 1974, aged 73. ==Further reading== *Johannes Schwartz, Das Selbstverst\u00e4ndnis Johanna Langefelds als SS-Oberaufseherin, in: Ulrich Fritz, Silvija Kav\u010di\u010d, Nicole Warmbold (ed.): Tatort KZ, Neue Beitr\u00e4ge zur Geschichte der Konzentrationslager, Ulm 2003, pp. 71\u201395. *Johannes Schwartz, Geschlechterspezifischer Eigensinn von NS-T\u00e4terinnen am Beispiel der KZ- Oberaufseherin Johanna Langefeld, in: Viola Schubert-Lehnhardt (ed.),Frauen als T\u00e4terinnen im Nationalsozialismus, Protokollband der Fachtagung vom 17.-18.
