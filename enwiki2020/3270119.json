    "text": "Scratch the Surface is the third studio album by American band Sick of It All, released in 1994. It was the band's first major label recording on East West Records, their first venture away from an indie label. Although the album did not reach any of the major charts, Scratch the Surface subsequently became Sick of It All's most successful release, and it produced two singles \"Scratch the Surface\" and \"Step Down\". The video of \"Step Down\" was also featured in the Beavis and Butt-head episode \"Premature Evacuation\". ==Track listing== # \"No Cure\" \u2013 2:58 # \"Insurrection\" \u2013 1:50 # \"Consume\" \u2013 3:42 # \"Who Sets the Rules\" \u2013 2:45 # \"Goatless\" \u2013 1:21 # \"Step Down\" \u2013 3:15 # \"Maladjusted\" \u2013 2:25 # \"Scratch the Surface\" \u2013 2:51 # \"Free Spirit\" \u2013 1:53 # \"Force My Hand\" \u2013 2:28 # \"Desperate Fool\" \u2013 1:52 # \"Return to Reality\" \u2013 2:43 # \"Farm Team\" \u2013 2:22 # \"Cease Fire\" \u2013 2:58 ==References== Category:1994 albums Category:East West Records albums Category:Albums produced by Billy Anderson (producer) Category:Sick of It All albums ",
