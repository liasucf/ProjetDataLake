    "text": "Kevin Skadron is an American computer scientist, the Harry Douglas Forsyth Professor and Chair of Computer Science, and Director of the Center for Automata Processing, at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia. His research focuses on computer processor design under physical constraints such as temperature, power, and reliability. He and his colleagues have contributed numerous tools now widely used in the research community, including the HotSpot family of tools and the Rodinia Benchmark Suite. Skadron also helped co-found IEEE Computer Architecture Letters and served as editor- in-chief from 2010-2012. ==Education and career== Skadron received his BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering and his BA in Economics from Rice University in 1994. He then moved to Princeton University, pursuing doctoral research in Computer Science, with Doug Clark as his dissertation advisor and Margaret Martonosi as co-advisor. He earned his PhD in 1999. He became an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Virginia in August 1999. He has served as department chair since 2012. ==Awards and honors== Skadron received the ACM SIGARCH Maurice Wilkes Award in 2011 for outstanding contributions to thermal-aware computer architecture modeling and design and was named Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2013 for contributions to thermal modeling in microprocessors, and ACM Fellow for contributions in power- and thermal-aware modeling, design and benchmarking of microprocessors, including GPUs. ==References== ==External links== * Category:20th-century births Category:Living people Category:American computer scientists Category:Rice University alumni Category:University of Virginia faculty Category:Fellow Members of the IEEE Category:Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) ",
