Madea didn't like Anthony at all. Madea just got home from the hospital because she is diabetic. Another person Madea is helping out is Bobby Mitchell (Tyga Graham), a total stranger who just got out of doing 12 years in prison for possession of drug paraphernalia \u2013 even though, according to him, it was his two older brothers and since he was the youngest they told him to say it was his and he did. Bobby is Madea's handyman and usually cuts her grass and both Madea and Vianne really think he is attractive. Vianne doesn\u2019t want to admit it. Vianne sister, Maylee (Donna Stewart)\u2019s fourteen-year-old daughter, Keisha (Elaine O'Neal), is also staying with Madea. When Maylee was very young about Keisha's age, her mother wanted money for drugs. So her mother put her in a room with a guy who paid to do whatever he wanted to Maylee. As a result, Maylee got pregnant and had Keisha. Keisha resents her mother because of the way she acts and has never been there for her. When Maylee shows up to Keisha's school wearing a mini-skirt, Keisha is embarrassed. Later, Maylee comes to Madea\u2019s house with a new car bought by Anthony Griffin, and announces her upcoming marriage to Vianne's ex-husband! Keisha is still resentful towards her mother. When her mother tries to help with her homework, Anthony calls and Maylee runs to him.

Brown (David Mann), whom everyone calls Mr. Brown brings in Madea's mail. Mr. Brown says hi to Cora, who he hasn't seen in a long time.
