She likes adventure sports and outings. ===Miss Belgium 2017=== Schotte was crowned Miss Belgium 2017 by Lenty Frans (Miss Belgium 2016) at the grand finale of Miss Belgium 2017 on 14 January 2017, which was also live televised on FOX and AB3. ===Controversy=== Within a few days there was a media frenzy sparked by what was taken to be her approving response to a racist comment on a selfie she had posted to Instagram on which a black man was visible in the background. It was denied that this was the reason she was not going to be representing Belgium at the Miss Universe pageant. In May 2017 the man in question instituted legal proceedings for damages. ==References== ==External links== * Official Miss Belgium website Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Belgian beauty pageant winners Category:Belgian female models Category:Miss World 2017 delegates Category:Miss Belgium winners Category:Flemish models ",
