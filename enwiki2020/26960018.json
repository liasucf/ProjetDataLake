    "text": "Elections for Oxford City Council were held on Thursday 6 May 2010.http://www.oxford.gov.uk/Direct/OxfordCityCouncilElectionResults06May2010.pdf As Oxford City Council is elected by halves, one seat in each of the 24 wards was up for election. Labour gained 2 seats (Barton and Sandhills ward from the Liberal Democrats and Northfield Brook ward from the Independent Working Class Association), the Liberal Democrats also gained two seats (Carfax and St Clement's ward, both from the Green Party). As a result of this election, Labour gained control of the city council, with 25 out of 48 seats. A general election was held on the same day, which accounts for the higher turnout (61.7%). ==Election results== Note: one Independent is standing in 2010, compared with three in 2008 and two in 2006. No candidates representing the Independent Working Class Association are standing in this election. No UKIP candidates were standing in 2008. This result has the following consequences for the total number of seats on the Council after the elections: Political group leaders and senior politicians for the Oxford City Council (outgoing council at the election in 2010). From left to right: Jonathan Gittos candidate for the Conservatives, Councillor Stephen Brown leader of the political group of Liberal Democrats, Councillor John Tanner senior member of the Labour group, Councillor Craig Simmons leader of the Green group. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! valign=top colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 230px\"|Party ! valign=top style=\"width: 30px\"|Previous council ! valign=top style=\"width: 30px\"|Staying councillors ! valign=top style=\"width: 30px\"|Seats up for election ! valign=top style=\"width: 30px\"|Election result ! valign=top style=\"width: 30px\"|New council |- ! style=\"background-color: ; width: 3px;\" | | Labour | 23 | 12 | 11 | 13 | 25 |- ! style=\"background-color: ; width: 3px;\" | | Liberal Democrats | 16 | 8 | 8 | 9 | 17 |- ! style=\"background-color: ; width: 3px;\" | | Green | 7 | 3 | 4 | 2 | 5 |- ! style=\"background-color: ; width: 3px;\" | | Independent Working Class | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |- ! style=\"background-color: ; width: 3px;\" | | Conservatives | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |- ! style=\"background-color: ; width: 3px;\" | | UKIP | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |- ! style=\"background-color: ; width: 3px;\" | | Independent | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |- | colspan=\"2\" | Total | 48 | 24 | 24 | 24 | 48 |- |} ==Results by ward== Map of the Oxford wards Note: Gains and holds of wards are noted with respect to the 2006 council election (or a by-election of the same seat).
