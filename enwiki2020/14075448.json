Local Loop Unbundling (LLU) is the better known process of a third party using the \"last mile\" Copper.

Normally the phone number and analogue line is lost on getting a LLU based product.eircom wholesale GLUMPpdf In the last revision of GLUMP (assisted by Comreg) 2007 only Magnet Networks was availing of this eircom product and by late 2007 even Magnet was making little use as they concentrate on offering their triple-play (Phone, Broadband and TV) via fibre.
