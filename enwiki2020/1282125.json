Shortly afterwards, he was asked to play Mr. Lucas in a Comedy Playhouse pilot called Are You Being Served? and took the part in the series. It was originally intended as a vehicle for him as the average man caught up in the store full of odd characters and baroque customs, and, for the first four series, he received top billing every other episode, alternating with Mollie Sugden. However, as it developed into more of an ensemble piece, he found his role (and his billing) being greatly reduced as other characters came to the top. He left the role in 1980, as filming for the show clashed with a lengthy tour for a play. In 1972 he appeared as the weak-bladdered producer of a local theatre company in Steptoe and Son, Episode 2 series 7 \u2013 \"A Star is Born\". He played Peter Pitt in the 1988 BBC sitcom Wyatt's Watchdogs.

Although Bannister appeared in a few films including Reach for the Sky (1956), Au Pair Girls (1972) and the film version of Are You Being Served? (1977), he worked mostly in the theatre, with credits including Billy Liar and the farce Move Over, Mrs Markham. Bannister also performed in Shakespeare and was a regular in pantomime for more than 35 years, nearly always playing the dame. In 2007, he guest starred in the Doctor Who audio adventure, Nocturne. His last appearance was in the TV series New Tricks episode \"Old Fossils\" broadcast 4 July 2011. ==Family== Bannister was the youngest of three siblings. His first marriage was to actress Kathleen Cravos in 1959. They had three sons together \u2013 Jeremy, Simon and Timothy \u2013 and divorced. He married Pamela Carson in 1982 and lived with her in Surrey until the time of his death. ==Death== Bannister died on 14 April 2011, at the age of 76, after a heart attack at his allotment in Thames Ditton, Surrey.
