    "text": "Poy Poy, known in Japan as , is a party video game developed and published by Konami for the PlayStation in 1997. It was also released on the Japanese PlayStation Network on November 28, 2007. ==Gameplay== Poy Poy is a multiplayer action game in which four players battle each other using various props, such as rocks, logs and blocks of ice in one of six environments. Combat consists of picking up the various props, and throwing them at opponents. One can also pick up and throw the opponent's character directly. Each character has different strengths and weaknesses in terms of strength (ability to pick up heavier props and do so more quickly) and speed (agility moving about the play field). Players can also use special gloves that use psychopower to unleash different abilities. Each character has a glove with which they have a 100% synchronisation rate (they have the most aptitude for). In several environments, there are hazards that must be avoided by players, but some players with the proper abilities can use these environmental hazards against their opponents. Up to four players can participate at a time (provided the players have a multitap peripheral which is compatible with the PlayStation). Computer-controlled players fill any spaces not occupied by human players. In exhibition mode, players engage in three rounds of combat. Poy Poy Cup is the single-player mode in which three computer-controlled competitors try to defeat the player in each environment. Each victory gives the player prize money to be spent on upgraded equipment. ==Reception== Reviews for Poy Poy were mostly positive. Next Generation called it \"the best multiplayer game for the PlayStation, hands down\", elaborating that, \"There isn't too much strategy, per se, but with a long, impressive list of special powers each competitor can choose from before the match, and a few special items to grab for during a match (or avoid, since there are some dangerous doodads mixed in with the good ones), the amount of entropy generated is enough to please even the most die-hard of chaos theorists.\" Art Angel of GamePro called it \"a Bomberman-esque arcade/strategy game that rocks the house with great graphics, fun multiplayer action, and an unusual array of characters.\" Electronic Gaming Monthlys Shawn Smith described it as \"A swingin' multiplayer title that's easy to control, looks good and has long- lasting, one-player features to boot.\" He and the other three members of the EGM review team concurred that the game has enough variations and secrets to make it highly replayable even in one-player mode, though they still felt the multiplayer was the game's chief draw. Joe Fielder, who reviewed Poy Poy for GameSpot several months after it had been covered by other gaming publications, was a dissenting voice against the game. While he remarked that Poy Poy has much more strategy and depth than similar games, he felt that it simply lacked the addictive quality needed to make it a success. ==Sequel== The game was followed by Poy Poy 2, also released on PlayStation which featured similar gameplay to that of Poy Poy. ==References== Category:1997 video games Category:Action video games Category:Konami franchises Category:Konami games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Japan ",
