Moscow traditionally celebrates during the first weekend in September. The celebration involves free cultural events, a parade and evening fireworks. ==History== The Moscow City Day was on January 1, 1847, celebrating Moscow's 700th anniversary. At the end of prayers held in the Chudov Monastery, the bells in the Ivan the Great Bell Tower sounded. The city celebrated its 800th anniversary in 1947, this time during Soviet rule. According to a mandate of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, a special medal was awarded to almost 1.7 million Soviet citizens. In 1997, the 850th anniversary of Moscow was celebrated. Moscow Day was introduced as an annual event in 1986 by future-President Boris Yeltsin, who served as Secretary of the Moscow City Committee at the time.{{cite web|url=https://www.worldtravelguide.net/guides/europe/russia/moscow/city- events/ ==Celebrations== About 1,000 different events and activities are held during the holiday, including parades, fairs, street entertainment, sports contests, and live music concerts. 67 Moscow museums offer free admission. Over 170 free walking and bicycle tours are organised. Dozens of Moscow museums offer free admission on this day and historical tours are organised over the holiday weekend. ===Parade=== The celebrations begin with a procession along Tverskaya Street and finishes at the Kremlin. Tverskaya traditionally transforms into a pedestrian zone. The parade usually includes various national academic and military marching bands, and occasionally the participants of the Spasskaya Tower Military Music Festival and Tattoo, which takes place earlier in the month. ===Concerts=== Evening concerts usually take place in large areas such as Red Square, Cathedral Square and Manezhnaya Square. Classical music concerts are also held at city parks such as Kolomenskoye, Tsaritsyno and Sokolniki. The Patriarch Ponds annually hosts a unique concert-on-water. Concerts range from rising independent artists to international performers and urban classical orchestras. ===Mass event=== A traditional mass event is held at Luzhniki Stadium in the Khamovniki District. The event features amusement rides, games and competitions. The main stage opposite the central entrance features famous singers, while the car park by the South Sport Complex provides a venue for a rap music concert. === Other === Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Russia, the 2020 celebrations were reduced to a singular ceremony attended by President Putin in the Zaryadye Park Concert Hall. ==Controversies== The past two Moscow City Duma elections (in 2014 and 2019) have coincided with the city day commemorations. During the 2019 election, hip hop recording artist Timati took part in a congratulatory video featuring Guf in which both rappers expressed support for Mayor Sergey Sobyanin and criticized the political protests. On September 10, Guf apologized for the video by explaining that he was unaware of the political developments while Timati said that \"a high-profile opinion is often perceived through the prism of negativity, as any unpopular decision is\", but this time \"it was over-the-top\". ==Gallery== File:Putin - Day City Moscow 2017 (3).jpg| File:Moscow 09-13 img01 Moscow Day.jpg| File:\u041a\u0440\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044c \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430.JPG| File:800th anniversary of Moscow OBVERSE.jpg| File:RR5109-0013R 850-\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u0435 \u043e\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u044b.gif| File:Putin - Day City Moscow 2017 (6).jpg| ==See also== *Public holidays in Russia *Moscow *Defender of the Fatherland Day *Victory Day (9 May) *Russia Day *Red Square *Spasskaya Tower Military Music Festival and Tattoo *Moscow's 850th Anniversary Pageant ==References== ==External links== * \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0414\u043d\u044f \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0432 \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0435 * \u0424\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u0436 \u0441 870-\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0438\u044f \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u044b Category:Events in Russia Category:Observances in Russia Category:Public holidays in Russia Category:Russian culture Category:Summer events in Russia Category:Culture in Moscow ",
