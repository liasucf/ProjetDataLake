In 1984, French Polynesia gained internal autonomy. First Polynesian president, Gaston Flosse named him a member of the government of French Polynesia by assigning a large ministry in charge of Labor, Employment, Vocational Training and Housing. After the territorial elections of 1986, he took the portfolio of Youth, Sports and Housing. In December 1987, following a reversal of the majority, Michel Buillard returned to the Assembly of French Polynesia, where he sat as an advisor in the opposition Tahoeraa Huiraatira ranks. In 1989, he founded the association Ia Ora Papeete, at the head of which he was fighting for the first time the mayor of Papeete. He fails, but at 38, he gets a very honorable score of 21.5% against an outgoing mayor, Jean Juventin, then at the height of its popularity. After the territorial elections of March 1991, the Tahoeraa Huiraatira returns to power. Gaston Flosse appointed him vice-president of the government and awarded him the Ministry of Health, Solidarity, Housing and Research. On June 24, 1995, Michel Buillard was elected mayor of Papeete after the victory of his list Ia Ora Papeete in the second round against the outgoing mayor Louise Carlson. In June 1997, he was elected MP and left the government. He will remain in this position for three terms (RPR then UMP), re-elected in 2002 and again in 2007. He does not run again in 2012. He is re- elected mayor of Papeete in 2001, in 2008 and in 2014.

In September 2013, he published Tamarii Tahiti, a collection of memories of childhood and youth (Mahana - Les \u00c9ditions du Soleil - Tahiti). Designer and architect of the modern Papeete, he has worked a lot for the development of the seafront. Michel Buillard has also advanced community amenities, green spaces, quality of housing, cultural and commercial animation, actions in favor of the youth and the elderly, the reception of tourists ... It is due to the construction, from 2009, of an ambitious network of collective sanitation cited as a model in the South Pacific by the Union which contributes to its financing. He is the first mayor to really preserve and enhance the collective memory and the historical and cultural heritage of Papeete. ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:People from Papeete Category:Rally for the Republic politicians Category:Union for a Popular Movement politicians Category:Mayors of Papeete Category:Deputies of the 12th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Deputies of the 13th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic ",
