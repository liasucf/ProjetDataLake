    "text": "Abu al-Yusr al-Bazdawi (), known with the honorific title of Sadr al-Islam, was a prominent Central Asian Hanafi-Maturidi scholar and a qadi (judge) in Samarqand in the late eleventh century. He is known to be teacher to several well-known Hanafi scholars, such as Najm al-Din 'Umar al-Nasafi and 'Ala' al- Din al-Samarqandi (who was teacher to Al-Kasani). == Name == Abu al-Yusr Muhammad b. Muhammad b. al-Hussein b. 'Abd al-Karim b. Musa b. Mujahid al- Nasafi al-Bazdawi. The attribution al-Bazdawi indicates that he or his family originated from Bazda or Bazdawa, a small town with a castle on the road between Nasaf and Bukhara. He is the younger brother of Fakhr al-Islam Abu al- Hassan al-Bazdawi, the author of the acclaimed Kanz al-Wusul, famously known as Usul al-Bazdawi. == Birth == He was born around the year 421 A.H. (1030 A.D.) and received his earliest education in Maturidism disciplines from his father. His grandfather Abu Muhammad 'Abd al-Karim b. Musa al-Bazdawi (d. 390 AH/1000\u20131001 CE), who was a direct student of al-Maturidi, and his elder brother Fakhr al-Islam 'Ali b. Muhammad al-Bazdawi (d. 482\u2013483 AH/1089\u20131090 CE) were leading Hanafi scholars and authored many books. == Teachers == * Shams al-A'imma 'Abd al-'Aziz al-Halwai (d. 456/1064) who was also a teacher to Al-Sarakhsi.Hanif, Sohail, 2019, \"Al-Hadith al-Mashhur: A Hanafi Reference to Kufan Practice?\", in Locating the Shari'a: Legal Fluidity in Theory, History and Practice by Sohaira Siddiqui (ed.), Brill Publications, Leiden, 2019. * Fakhr al-Islam al-Bazdawi (d. 482 AH) who was his elder brother. == Students == Some of his well known students are: Najm al-Din 'Umar al-Nasafi, and 'Ala' al-Din al-Samarqandi (who was teacher to 'Ala' al-Din al-Kasani). == Works == He was the author of several works on law, including a commentary on the major work of Abu Hanifa, after whom the Hanafi school is named, and a commentary on a work of Abu Hanifa's student Muhammad al-Shaybani, who was one of the founders of the Hanafi school. The most important of his books which remain is Kitab Usul al-Din (edited with a biographical introduction by Hans- Peter Linss). Al-Bazdawi\u2019s Kitab Usul al-Din, as it was described by Hans- Peter Linss, could be classified in: # Firstly, a short review of all literature of the heretics on dogma and theology in Islam. # Secondly, Hanafi- Sunni orthodoxy defense against the dissenting opinions and teachings of the heretical sects. # Finally, a study on the heterodox factions in Islam, their subdivisions and their most important heads. He is also author of Ma'rifat al- Hujaj al-Shar'iyya () in Usul al-Fiqh. Dr. Haytham Abdul-Hamid Khazna () said in his book Tatawur al-Fikr al-Usuli al-Hanafi () that this book should not be attributed to Abu al-Yusr al-Bazdawi, because the books of Tarajim (biographies and bibliographies) didn't mention it, and because the book is weak in style analysis. == Death == After serving for a period of time as a magistrate in Samarqand, he eventually moved to Bukhara and died there in 493 A.H. (1100 A.D.). == See also == * Abu Hanifa * Abu Mansur al-Maturidi * Abu al-Mu'in al-Nasafi * List of Hanafis * List of Ash'aris and Maturidis * List of Muslim theologians == References == ==External links== * Islamic Pedia - Abu al-Yusr al-Bazdawi * Eb\u00fc\u2019l-Y\u00fcsr el-Pezdev\u00ee * (Usul-\u00fcd-Din) Eb\u00fc\u2019l-Y\u00fcsr el- Pezdev\u00ee\u2019nin (\u00f6. 493/1100) kel\u00e2ma dair eseri Category:Hanafis Category:Maturidis Category:Muslim theologians Category:Sunni imams Category:Sunni Muslim scholars Category:Hanafi fiqh scholars Category:Uzbekistani Muslims Category:10th-century Muslim scholars of Islam Category:11th-century Muslim scholars of Islam Category:1030s births Category:1100 deaths Category:11th-century jurists ",
