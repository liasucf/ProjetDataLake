Leslie was born one of twins in Bandung, Indonesia under Japanese occupation, to his mother Lydia. He had an elder brother, sister and two aunts. At the time, his father William was interned in a POW camp in West central Java and would not see the twins until the Japanese surrender three and a half years later. His father was from Aberdeen, Scotland and mother was born in Gnadenfeld, Ukraine. Both migrated from war torn Europe for a better life in the thriving Dutch-British East Indies. His mother\u2019s family was of white Russian origin and fled their homeland to escape persecution under the Communist Bolshevik tyranny. They raised their four children in Java where William Leslie was a manager for a large Anglo-Dutch export company. An idyllic life ended abruptly with the Japanese Imperial Army\u2019s invasion in February 1942. For his first three years, Ian and his family spent life behind bamboo as POWs in a separate camp to his father.
