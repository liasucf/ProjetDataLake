In 1836, Scottish engineer James Nasmyth, in partnership with Holbrook Gaskell, built the Bridgewater Foundry in Patricroft. Nasmyth chose Patricroft, located on the west side of Manchester, \u2018because of the benefit of breathing pure air, realising that a healthy workforce is a more efficient workforce'. He named the works \"Bridgewater Foundry\" in memory of Canal Duke, the first canal maker in Britain. Bridgewater Foundry was located adjacent the Bridgewater Canal and the Manchester to Liverpool railway line. The foundry soon expanded to become a major supplier of steam locomotives. During the First World War the factory's production was mainly diverted to munitions work. At the start of the Second World War it became a Royal Ordnance Factory, producing shells, tanks and guns. The engineering works closed in 1989: the site is now part of a business and technology centre. The area was part of the municipal borough of Eccles in Lancashire until 1974 when it was incorporated into Salford, Greater Manchester. ==Churches== *Christ Church Christ Church on Liverpool Road is the Anglican Parish Church of Patricroft. Construction was begun by the Rev Samuel Dale, curate at Eccles and later first Vicar at Patricroft.
