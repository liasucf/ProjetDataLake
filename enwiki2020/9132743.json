It is located at an altitude of within the Babele complex of rock formations. The first photo of the Great Bucegi Sphinx was probably taken in about the year 1900. This photograph was taken from a front position, not from a lateral one, as it usually appears in pictures nowadays. It only acquired its nickname, referring to the Great Sphinx of Giza, in the year 1936. The image of the sphinx appeared when the rock, having an 8 m height and a 12 m width, was watched from a certain angle. The megalith has its clearest outline on 21 November, at the time the sun goes down.http://www.tourist-informator.info/en/tourist- information/busteni/free_time_entertainment-local_attractions- sfinxul_din_bucegi_-60-busteni/ ==In Romanian film== The Sphinx features in the 1967 film The Dacians, in which it is a place of sacrifice to the god Zalmoxis.
