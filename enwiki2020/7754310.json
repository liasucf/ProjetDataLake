In 1911, he attended the coronation of George V and carried his grandfather's coronet.London Gazette \u2013 26 September 1911 He began at Eton College in 1914 but was dismissed two years later. Although possessing one of Scotland's most distinguished titles, the earls, by this time, had no wealth, and had to develop careers to earn their living. In 1920, Hay was appointed honorary attach\u00e9 at Berlin under his father, who was earlier appointed charg\u00e9 d'affaires there before the arrival of Edgar Vincent, 1st Viscount D'Abernon.London Gazette \u2013 23 January 1920 His father was soon appointed High Commissioner to the Rhineland, but Hay stayed in Berlin and served under Lord D'Abernon until 1922. After passing the Foreign Office examinations, Hay was expected to follow his father into diplomacy, but instead became infatuated with Lady Idina Sackville, a daughter of Gilbert Sackville, 8th Earl De La Warr, divorced wife of the politician Euan Wallace and the wife of Charles Gordon. Lady Idina soon divorced her husband in 1923 and she and Hay were married on 22 September 1923. ==Kenya== After causing a society scandal due to their marriage \u2013 she was twice- divorced, notoriously unconventional in many ways, and eight years his senior \u2013 Hay and his wife moved to Kenya in 1924, financing the move with Idina's money. Their home was a bungalow on the slopes of the Aberdare Range which they called Slains, after the former Hay family seat of Slains Castle which was sold by Hay's grandfather, the 20th Earl, in 1916. The bungalow was sited alongside the high altitude farms which other white Kenyans were establishing at the time. The Happy Valley set were a group of elite, colonial expatriates who became notorious for drug use, drinking, adultery and promiscuity, among other things. Hay soon became a part of this group and accumulated debts. Hay had inherited his father's titles in 1928 and his wife divorced him in 1930 because he was cheating her financially. Hay then married the divorced Edith Maude (\"Molly\") Ramsay-Hill on 8 February 1930. They lived in Oserian, a Moroccan-style house on the shores of Lake Naivasha, and his new wife became involved with the hedonistic lifestyle of Happy Valley. On a visit to England in 1934, Lord Erroll joined Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists and on his return to Kenya a year later, became president of the Convention of Associations. He attended the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937 and was elected to the legislative council as member for Kiambu in 1939.London Gazette \u2013 10 November 1936 On the outbreak of World War II that year, Lord Erroll became a captain in the Kenya Regiment and accepted the post of Military Secretary for East Africa in 1940. On 13 October 1939, Lady Erroll died. At the Muthaiga Country Club in 1940, Lord Erroll met, and subsequently had an affair with Diana, Lady Broughton, the wife of Sir Jock Delves Broughton, Bt. (and, ultimately, Baroness Delamere). ==Murder== Delves Broughton learned of the affair and after spending a night with Lady Broughton, Lord Erroll was found shot dead in his Buick at a crossroads on the Nairobi-Ngong road on 24 January 1941. Sir Jock was accused of the murder, arrested on 10 March and stood trial from 26 May. There were no eyewitnesses to the killing; the evidence against him proffered in court was weak; and his barber \u2013\u201cThe question of the scent in the Buick was made much of, (in the trial) when it was probably no mystery at all. Joss reeked of the Truefitt & Hill scent CAR, as all his close friends knew,\u201d excerpt from The Life and Death of Lord Erroll, Errol Trzebinski, Fourth Estate, 2000. was also foreman of the jury. Sir Jock was acquitted on 1 July. He died by suicide in England a year later. Lord Erroll is buried in the graveyard of St Paul's Anglican Church in Kiambu, Kenya, next to his second wife, Molly. His earldom and lordship of Hay passed to his only child, Diana, by his first wife, while his barony of Kilmarnock passed to his brother, Gilbert, who changed his surname to Boyd in 1941. ==Popular culture== *The BBC television drama The Happy Valley, first transmitted on 6 September 1987, told the story of Erroll's murder, as seen through the eyes of 15-year-old Juanita Carberry, daughter of John Carberry (10th Baron Carbery), to whom Broughton confessed his guilt even before he was arrested. *The incident inspired James Fox's 1982 investigative book White Mischief, which was adapted into the 1988 film of the same title by Michael Radford. *The case featured in the documentary Altitude, Alcohol and Adultery, directed by Vanni Ocleppo, and first broadcast on BBC1 on 4 June 1993. *The incident was also adapted into an episode of the series Julian Fellowes Investigates: A Most Mysterious Murder \u2013 The Case of the Earl of Erroll in 2005. *Hay\u2019s murder, and the subsequent trial of Sir Jock Delves Broughton, Bt., are referenced in Lucinda Riley\u2019s novel The Sun Sister. ==Ancestry== ==See also== *List of unsolved murders ==References== ==Sources== * Davenport-Hines, Richard \u2013 Hay, Josslyn Victor, twenty-second earl of Erroll (1901\u20131941), colonist in Kenya and philanderer \u2013 Oxford Dictionary of National Biography * Genealogy website ==External links== * *Josslyn Hay's burial site in Kiambu, Kenya Category:1901 births Category:1941 deaths Category:British emigrants to Kenya Category:British fascists Category:British people murdered abroad Category:British Union of Fascists politicians Category:Deaths by firearm in Kenya Category:Diplomatic peers 22 Category:English people of Scottish descent Category:Kenya Regiment officers Category:Members of the Legislative Council of Kenya Category:People educated at Eton College Category:People from Mayfair Category:People murdered in Kenya Category:Unsolved murders in Kenya ",
