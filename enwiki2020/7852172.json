Domingo. JjCenter for IT Hall houses the Graduate School The Graduate School of University of the East first started with the organization of the Graduate School of Business followed later by the Graduate School of Education. The Graduate School of Business was organized in 1948 in response to the clamor of accounting graduates of UE for a graduate degree. The first program offered was a one-year master's degree course in accounting which was later superseded by two-year programs in Master in Business Administration (MBA) and Master of Arts in Economics (MA Economics). This curricular change aimed at meeting the increasing demand for trained professionals in business and industry as well as in developing well- equipped and intellectual leaders in this profession. Later the degree programs in MBA for executives and MBA for practitioners were instituted. On the other hand, the Graduate School of Education, which was established in 1963, primarily aimed to develop high scholarship and leadership in the field of teacher education. With the influx of students from all over the country as well as foreign students from neighboring nations, the two Graduate Schools reached the peak of their popularity in the 1970s, thus, turning that decade into their \u201cgolden age.\u201d In 1982, the two graduate schools were merged into one with Dr. Milda Ang as its first dean. The merger led to a centralized Graduate School unit in the University under the leadership of succeeding Deans, namely, Dr. Isidro Cari\u00f1o, Dr. Arturo Trinidad, Dr. Rosario Lamug, Dr. Teresita Pascual, Dr. Josefina R. Cortes, Dr. Rosario E. Maminta and Dr. Danilo M. Yanga. The former Dean of the Graduate School is Dr. Rosario E. Maminta, a respected specialist in Applied Linguistics trained at the UCLA in United States and the University of British Columbia in Canada. A former Commissioner of the National Language Commission, she took over the Deanship from Dr. Josefina R. Cortes, who became UE President and who is an expert in development education with a Ph.D. from Stanford University. Dr. Cortes relinquished her position upon her appointment as Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and subsequently as President. The present Dean, who assumed office last June 1, 2004, is Dr. Danilo M. Yanga. A former Dean of the College of Science at the University of the Philippines Diliman, he is a respected physicist and a holder of Ph.D. in Physics degree. At present, the Graduate School offers degree programs in Business, Teacher Education, Public Administration, Library Science and Environmental Science. ==Graduate programs== ===College of Dentistry (CDent)=== *Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) *Pre-Dentistry Program (two school years) ===College of Law (CLaw)=== *Juris Doctor (JD) - Bar Refresher Course (a two-semester course) ===Graduate School=== *Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) **Major in Financial Management **Major in Human Resource Management **Major in Marketing Management **Major in Production/Operations Management *Doctor of Education (Ed.D.) **Major in Educational Administration and Leadership *Master in Business Administration (MBA) **Major in Entrepreneurship **Major in Financial Management **Major in Marketing Management **Major in Operational and Supply Chain Management **Major in Human Resource Management **Major in Tourism and Hospitality Management *Master in Information Management (MIM) - in coordination with the UE College of Computer Studies and Systems *Master of Science in Construction Management (MSCM) *Master in Education **Major in Biological Science **Major in English **Major in Filipino **Major in History **Major in Mathematics **Major in Physical Education **Major in Political Science **Major in Pre-Elementary School Teaching (Early Childhood Education) *Master of Arts in Education (MAEd.) **Major in Educational Administration **Major in English as a Second Language **Major in Filipino **Major in Guidance *Master of Public Administration (MPA) **Major in Human Resource Administration **Major in Fiscal Administration **Major in Public Policy and Program Administration *Master of Science (MSES) **Major in Environmental Science *Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) *Master of Science in Dentistry (MScD) **Specialization in Endodontics **Specialization in Orthodontics **Specialization in Periodontics **Specialization in Prosthodontics *Master in Engineering Science *Master of Science in Accountancy (MSA) **Major in Management Accounting **Major in Internal Auditing **Major in Taxation *Master in Accountancy (MA) **Major in Management Accounting **Major in Internal Auditing **Major in Taxation *Master of Science in Dental Education (MSDE) ===UERMMMC Graduate School=== Further Information: UERMMMC *Master of Science in Nursing *Master of Science in Public Health *Master of Science in Clinical Medicine *Master of Science in Internal Medicine *Diploma Course in Diabetes Studies ==See also== *University of the East *UERMMMC'' ==References== *University of the East http://www.ue.edu.ph *University of the East Graduate School http://www.ue.edu.ph/manila/gs.htm ==External links== *University of the East *University of the East Graduate School Graduate School Category:Business schools in the Philippines Category:Graduate schools in the Philippines Category:Educational institutions established in 1948 Category:1948 establishments in the Philippines ",
