    "text": "A collection of Punjabi Qisse in Patiala, Punjab, India. A Punjabi Qissa ( (Shahmukhi), (Gurmukhi); Plural: Qisse) is a tradition of Punjabi language oral story-telling that came to South Asia with the fusion of local people and migrants from the Arabian peninsula and contemporary Iran. Where Qisse reflect an Islamic and/or Persian heritage of transmitting popular tales of love, valour, honour and moral integrity amongst Muslims, they matured out of the bounds of religion into a more secular form when it reached India and added the existing pre-Islamic Punjabi culture and folklore to its entity. ==Etymology== The word Qissa (pronounced ) is an Arabic word meaning \u2018epic legend\u2019 or a \u2018folk tale\u2019. It has influenced almost all the languages of South Asia and occurs as a regular common noun in Indo-Aryan languages like Punjabi, Bengali, Gujarati, Urdu and Hindi. If used informally, the word means an \u2018interesting tale\u2019 or \u2018fable\u2019. ==Qisse and the Punjabi culture== The Punjabi language is famous for its rich literature of qisse, most of the which are about love, passion, betrayal, sacrifice, social values and a common man's revolt against a larger system. In the Punjabi tradition, friendship, loyalty, love and \u2018qaul\u2019 (verbal agreement or promise) are given utmost importance and most of the stories in the qisse hinge on these critical elements. Qisse are attributed to have inspired folk music in Punjabi and have added depth and richness to its delivery. These traditions were passed down generations in oral or written forms and were often recited, told as bedtime stories to children or performed musically as folk songs. Each qissa, if performed, has its unique requirements. A person able to sing or recite one may not necessarily transmit another. The vocal ranges of the musical scale and accurate pauses, if not performed well, leave a performer breathless and unable to continue. Most of the beats used in modern Punjabi music (often misleadingly labelled Bhangra), originated from qissa tradition and recitations in old times. Qisse also boast to be among the best poetry every written in Punjabi. ==Poetry based on Qisse== Waris Shah's (1722\u20131798) qissa of \u2018Heer Ranjha\u2019 (formally known as Qissa \u2018Heer\u2019) is among the most famous Qisse of all times. The effect of Qisse on Punjabi culture is so strong that even religious leaders and revolutionaries like Guru Gobind Singh and Baba Farid, etc., quoted famous Qissas in their messages. It will not be wrong to say that popularity and nearly divine status of Qisse in Punjabi actually inspired many generations of spiritual leaders and social activists to combine the message of God with teenage love tales. This gave rise to what is known as the Sufi movement in Punjab region. The most popular writer/poet to have written Punjabi Sufi Qisse was Bulleh Shah (c.1680-1758). So popular are his Kalams (poems) that he is frequently quoted by young and old alike with same respect and on matters of both love and God. In recent times, South Asian singer's have sported these folklores on their albums, for instance, the most famous folklore duo like Kuldeep Manak and Dev Tharike Wala wrote and sang about almost every Qissa, and Recently, Rabbi by (Rabbi Shergill) contained \u2018Bulla Ki Jaana Main Kaun\u2019, translated in English as \u2018I know not who I am\u2019, written by Bulleh Shah. A few years back another singer, (Harbhajan Maan), a Canada-based Punjabi singer rejuvenated the story of \u2018Mirza Sahiban\u2019, a work by Peelu. Daim Iqbal Daim from Mandi Bahauddin District, Pakistan also wrote many qissas in Punjabi language like Mirza Sahiban, Laila Majnu, Sohni Mahiwal, Bilal Biti etc. Daim got popularity by writing \"Shah Nama Karbla\" and \"Kambal Posh\". ==Notable Qisse== Most of the Punjabi qisse were written by Muslim poets who wandered the land. The oldest were usually scripted in Urdu. Some of the most popular qisse are listed below. * \u2018Mirza Sahiba\u2019 by Peelu * \u2018Heer Ranjha\u2019 by Waris Shah * \u2018Sohni Mahiwal\u2019 by Fazal shah Syyed * \u2018Sassi Punnun\u2019 by Hasham Shah / * \u2018Sucha Singh Soorma\u2019 * \u2018Jeona Morh by Bhagwan Singh * \u2018Shirin Farhad\u2019 * \u2018Pooran Bhagat by Kadaryaar * \u2018Kehar Singh Ram Kaur\u2019 * \u2018Sham Kaur, Sham Singh, Sham Lal\u2019 * \u2018Dhol Sammi\u2019 * \u2018Yusuf and Zulaikha by Hafiz Barkhurdar * \u2018Laila Majnu\u2019 * \u2018Kaulan\u2019 * \u2018Dulla Bhatti\u2019 * \u2018Manu Guggu\u2019 * \u2018Ustaad Harman\u2019 * \u2018Jatt Parmz\u2019 ==See also== *Bengali Kissa ==References== * ==External links== * ApnaOrg offers one of the most reliable but largely incomplete list of Punjabi literature and music. * Punjabi People & Old Stories Network of Punjabi People Category:Punjabi culture Category:Punjabi literature Category:Punjabi folklore Category:Pakistani folklore ",
