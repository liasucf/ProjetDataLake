This was a series of concerts featuring Queen, The Clash, the Pretenders, The Who, Elvis Costello, Wings, and many more artists which took place at the Hammersmith Odeon in London, England during December 1979 to raise money for the victims of war-torn Cambodia. The event was organized by McCartney and Kurt Waldheim, and it involved older artists such as McCartney and The Who as well as younger new wave acts like The Clash and the Pretenders. The last of the concerts was the last concert of Wings. Most of the Rockestra wore silver suits for this performance. On the Concerts for Kampuchea home video, McCartney can be heard making a comment about Townshend before playing the song, making reference to Townshend being a \"poof\" (gay in British slang). \"Thank you, Peter. Only lousy sod who wouldn't wear the silver suit. Cuz he's a poof.\" Townshend made comment about it in several interviews following the performance.The Solo Beatles Film & TV Chronicle 1971-1980 p. 307 Juber can be seen walking up behind Townshend after McCartney's comment, and placing a silver top hat on his head. Townshend quickly grabs the hat and flings it into the audience. ==Aftermath== \"Rockestra Theme\" won the 1980 Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In France it was used as the opening theme of 'Chlorophylle' a pop-rock program on the radio station Europe 1. ==References== Category:Paul McCartney songs Category:1979 singles Category:Wings (band) songs Category:Songs written by Paul McCartney Category:All-star recordings Category:Charity singles Category:Parlophone singles Category:Song recordings produced by Paul McCartney Category:Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance Category:Song recordings produced by Chris Thomas (record producer) Category:Music published by MPL Music Publishing Category:1978 songs ",
