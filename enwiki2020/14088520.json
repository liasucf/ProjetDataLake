    "text": "The Kansas City Roller Warriors (KCRW) is a women's flat track roller derby league based in Kansas City, Kansas that was founded in 2004. The members of the league are split into four home teams that play within the league and two travel teams that represent KCRW in competition with other leagues. KCRW is a founding member of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA), and the Kansas City Roller Warriors All Star travel team was the winner of the 2007 WFTDA Championships, the \"Texas Shootout\", which took place in Austin, Texas. ==History== KCRW was founded in 2004 by Brooke Leavitt and Mandy Durham, who worked together as librarians. Inspired by the Texas Rollergirls, the KCRW LLC was solidified by June 2004. That summer, the two and a group of other women began practicing in a parking lot, forming the first practice of the Kansas City Roller Warriors. John Hernandez, a friend of the founders from college, became the team's first coach and the small contingent of team members distributed hand fliers to promote women to try out for the team. By the fall of 2004 the team was practicing at a local community center, on a basketball court. Since its formation, the group consists of more than 80 players and four at-home teams: The Black Eye Susans, the Dreadnought Dorothys, the Knockouts and the Victory Vixens. KCRW originally held their bouts at the Winnwood Skate Center and Hale Arena in Kansas City before moving to the Kansas City Municipal Auditorium, where they skated through 2015. KCRW now plays home games and practices at Memorial Hall (Kansas City, Kansas) in Kansas City, Kansas. Approximately 30 people provide volunteer assistance for each at-home event, including referees, announcers, score keepers and other support staff. ==Teams== The league has four home teams: the Black Eye Susans, the Dreadnought Dorothys, the Knockouts and the Victory Vixens. The Victory Vixens hold the KCRW home championship title for 2015, having won against the Dreadnought Dorothys. The Roller Warriors held their first official season from January through June 2005 at Winnwood Skate Center. The founding season for KCRW drew 800 attendees. Through 2016, average bout attendance has been 2,000. The Victory Vixens won the KCRW home championship title in 2015, having won against the Dreadnought Dorothys. ==Travel teams== A Kansas City Roller Warriors bout in 2009. The All Star team, founded in 2005, is composed of members of the four home teams of the Kansas City Roller Warriors. They compete at a national and international level. In 2007, the KCRW All Stars won the Women's Flat Track Derby Association Championships against the Rat City Rollergirls. The All Stars won the 2010 WFTDA South Central Regional Tournament and the league hosted the WFTDA 2011 South Central Regional Tournament. The All Stars placed first in the 2015 WFTDA International Division 2 Tournament held in Cleveland, Ohio. Plan B is KCRW's second travel team, with members from all home teams who travel regionally. The team made its debut in 2011. ==Junior derby== In 2010, Ami Geddon, a Kansas City Roller Warrior, worked to grow a junior roller derby league in Kansas City. She recruited other skaters with experience in coaching and teaching children. Along with Ami Geddon, Connie Magic, Jade Lightning, Bomb Pop, PDQ, Maiden Hell, Damsel of D'tension and Murphy's Law were the team's first coaches. The league is open to girls and boys ages 8 \u201317. ==WFTDA competition== KCRW logo pre-2017 In February 2006, KCRW sent their All Star travel team to play in the first National WFTDA Championships in Tucson, Arizona.
