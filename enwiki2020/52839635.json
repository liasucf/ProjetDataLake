    "text": "Chris Johnson (born 1986) is an English rugby union footballer, currently playing at Fly-half or Centre for Sale in National League 1. An outstanding player who can kick points, drop goals, and score tries, he is one of the most prolific scorers of all time in both National League 2 North and National League 1, with over 3,000 points spread across the two divisions from his time with Huddersfield, Fylde and Sale. Johnson has also had a very successful representative career, winning the Bill Beaumont Cup five times with Lancashire, and captaining the England Counties XV. == Career == === Huddersfield === Growing up in Lancashire where he played junior rugby at Rochdale, upon finishing school Johnson moved across the Pennines to study at the University of Huddersfield. While at university Johnson came to the attention of local rugby union side, Huddersfield, who were playing in North Division 1 (now known as National League 3 North) and signed with them for the 2006\u201307 season. In 2008 Huddersfield finished runners up in the league to Kendal, qualifying for a promotion playoff against Midlands Division 1 runners up Luctonians, with the Yorkshire side gaining home advantage due to a better comparable league standing. Johnson was outstanding in the playoff game at Lockwood Park, kicking 18 points in the 22\u20137 victory against Luctonians, and helping Huddersfield achieve a first ever promotion to the National Leagues. The 2008\u201309 season was the first for Huddersfield in National Division 3 North and they managed to finish 10th out of the 14 teams, way clear of relegation. Johnson also adapted well to the higher level with 248 points making him the third top scorer in the division, which included 7 drop goals across the season. Outside of the league, Chris starred in a Huddersfield side that made it to the semi-finals of the Yorkshire Cup, going out 6\u201313 to eventual winners Leeds Carnegie. This form saw Lancashire born Johnson selected by reigning county champions Yorkshire as member of their 2009 Bill Beaumont Cup squad, although he could not help the side retain the cup. He also made his England Counties XV debut in March 2009, starting in the 19\u201327 defeat to France Federale XV at the match at Twickenham. The 2009\u201310 season saw National Division 3 North re-branded as National League 2 North as part of the RFU's changes to the English league system, which would also see the division increase by 2 teams to 16. Huddersfield ended the season in 11th while Johnson scored 327 points to one more finish as the third most prolific points scorer in the division. At the end of the season Johnson's form with his club side would once again see him called up by Yorkshire for the 2010 Bill Beaumont Cup. The 2010\u201311 season saw Huddersfield finish 8th in the league with Johnson becoming the top scorer in the division with 387 points, including a career best 15 tries. He also played a key role in Huddersfield winning the Yorkshire Cup for the first time in the club's history, scoring 15 points in a 25\u201318 win over Hull in the final held at York. The final act of Johnson's season saw him switch his county allegiance from Yorkshire to the county of his birth, Lancashire, and he was part of the squad that would win the 2011 Bill Beaumont Cup. 2011\u201312 would be Johnson's final season at the club and he went out on a successful note as he helped Huddersfield to a highest ever position in the league as they finished in 6th place. Once again he would also finish as top scorer in the league with 362 points. He was also picked once for Lancashire for the 2012 Bill Beaumont Cup, playing in the final at Twickenham Stadium in a 38 \u2013 20 defeat to Hertfordshire. Despite finishing runners up, Johnson had a fantastic tournament scoring 62 points, with 24 of those coming in the 54\u201333 victory away to former county side Yorkshire in front of 2,023 supporters at Scarborough \u2013 a record crowd for the ground. === Fylde === In the summer of 2012, after six seasons with Huddersfield and over 1,800 points scored, Johnson decided to move back to Lancashire to sign for Fylde, playing one division higher in National League 1. His first season in National League 1 saw him became a regular in a Fylde side that finished the 2012\u201313 season in 6th place, scoring 251 points (the 4th highest tally in the division). As well as playing league games, Johnson also took part in the Fylde side that reached the semi-finals of the Lancashire Cup, losing 24\u201325 to rivals Preston Grasshoppers at home. Johnson was also called up to the Lancashire for the 2013 Bill Beaumont Cup where he had an excellent tournament, scoring 36 points (the second highest in the competition), 15 of which came the final in a 35\u201326 victory against Cornwall. He finished off the year by being selected for the England Counties XV side on their tour summer tour of Belgium. He played against Belgium 'A', leading his side out as captain and scoring 28 points (including 1 try) in a 78\u20130 victory. A second appearance would follow as he scored a try in a 57\u20135 win over Belgium to cap off a very successful season. The 2013\u201314 season with Fylde saw his club finish an excellent 3rd in the league with Johnson once more one of the top scorers in the league with 272 points including 10 tries. Consistent good performances with Fylde saw Johnson come to the attention of Premiership side, Sale Sharks, and he was picked to play for the Jets development side, making his A-League debut in October 2013, scoring a try and drop goal in a 40\u201319 win against Northampton Wanderers at Heywood Road. At the start of 2014 Johnson captained England Counties XV as they lost very close games against France Federale XV and an Irish Club XV. His season finished with for Lancashire at the 2014 Bill Beaumont Cup, finishing as the competition's top scorer with 60 points as his county retained the trophy with a 36\u201326 victory over last year's finalists, Cornwall. The 2014\u201315 season saw Fylde drop one place down to finish 5th in the league, with Johnson ending up as the second highest scorer in the division with 252 points (behind Richmond's Rob Kirby). Johnson would also return to action with England Counties XV at the start of 2015, scoring 7 points in a 37\u20133 victory against a Scottish Club XV in front of 1,200 supporters at Fylde's Woodlands Memorial Ground. He was even better in the next game for Counties as he bagged all 24 points in a 24 \u2013 15 win against France Federale XV at P\u00e9rigueux. The year would finish with Lancashire at the 2015 Bill Beaumont Cup, scoring 21 points as his side reached their fourth successive final, only to lose 18\u201313 against Cornwall, who avenged the two previous final defeats. The 2015\u201316 season was the last for Johnson at Fylde, scoring 215 points from 25 games as his side finished in 6th place. He also made further appears for England Counties in a 27 \u2013 57 defeat against Scottish Clubs XV at Netherdale, as well as appearing for Lancashire at the 2016 Bill Beaumont Cup as his side failed to make the final for the first time in eight years. === Sale FC === In the summer of 2016, after four seasons with Fylde, over 900 points scored for the club, and multiple county championship triumphs with Lancashire, Johnson decided to sign for Sale FC, playing one division below in National League 2 North. Reasons given for the move were that Johnson wanted to cut down on travel (Sale FC were closer to where he worked) and that his new club had more potential for winning silverware in the future. Although he was relegated to reserve kicker behind team-mate Luke McGovern he featured in all of Sale's games as they finished second to league champions Caldy. Unfortunately for Johnson his team were unable to grab promotion at the second chance of asking as they lost their promotion playoff game at home to National League 2 South runners up Old Elthamians. The disappointment of missing out on promotion was tempered as Johnson was called up to the Lancashire who went on to win the 2017 Bill Beaumont Cup. He started the final and kicked two conversions as his side beat Cornwall 19\u20138 at Twickenham Stadium for the counties 24th title and the first since 2014. His second season (2017\u201318) at Sale FC was an excellent one. With Luke McGovern leaving the club, Johnson once again became the main kicker. He was ever present in the Sale FC that went on to become champions of National League 2 North, contributing 324 (second highest in league) as his club finished five points clear of runners up Sedgley Park to gain promotion to National League 1. Promotion was followed by more silverware as Johnson scored 55 points for Lancashire during the 2018 Bill Beaumont Cup, including 22 points in the 33-16 win over Hertfordshire in the final. ===Second spell at Huddersfield === Although Johnson started the 2018\u201319 season with Sale FC in National League 1, in November 2018 he decided to drop down a league and return to play for former club, Huddersfield in National League 2 North, after an absence of six years. The reasons for him leaving were due to family commitments and the greater amount of travel required in National League 1. Despite not playing a full-season, he still managed to finish in the top 5 scorers in the league, scoring 222 points, and helping Huddersfield to a best- ever 4th place finish. ===Second spell at Sale FC=== In June 2019, Johnson resigned with Sale FC, once more playing in National League 1 for the 2019-20 season. == Season-by-season playing stats == ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Season !Club !Competition !Appearances !Tries !Drop Goals !Conversions !Penalties !Total Points |- | rowspan=2 align=left |2006\u201307 || rowspan=14 align=left | Huddersfield || North 1 || 18 || 2 || 1 || 27 || 34 || 169 |- | Yorkshire Cup || 2 || 1 || 0 || 3 || 0 || 11 |- | rowspan=3 align=left | 2007\u201308 || North 1 || 14 || 10 || 4 || 24 || 26 || 188 |- | EDF Energy Trophy || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 3 || 9 |- | Yorkshire Cup || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 9 |- | rowspan=3 align=left | 2008\u201309 || National Division 3 North || 22 || 5 || 7 || 29 || 48 || 248 |- | EDF Energy Trophy || 2 || 1 || 0 || 7 || 0 || 19 |- | Yorkshire Cup || 3 || 5 || 0 || 12 || 4 || 61 |- | rowspan=2 align=left | 2009\u201310 || National League 2 North || 28 || 7 || 0 || 62 || 56 || 327 |- | Yorkshire Cup || 1 || 0 || 0 || 2 || 1 || 7 |- | rowspan=2 align=left | 2010\u201311 || National League 2 North || 27 || 15 || 5 || 72 || 51 || 387 |- | Yorkshire Cup || 3 || 0 || 1 || 5 || 9 || 40 |- | rowspan=2 align=left | 2011\u201312 || National League 2 North || 30 || 10 || 6 || 48 || 66 || 362 |- | Yorkshire Cup || 1 || 1 || 0 || 3 || 0 || 11 |- | rowspan=2 align=left | 2012\u201313 || rowspan=5 align=left | Fylde || National League 1 || 28 || 7 || 1 || 66 || 27 || 251 |- | Lancashire Cup || 1 || 0 || 0 || 3 || 1 || 9 |- | 2013\u201314 || National League 1 || 28 || 10 || 1 || 81 || 19 || 272 |- | 2014\u201315 || National League 1 || 29 || 7 || 0 || 89 || 13 || 252 |- | 2015\u201316 || National League 1 || 25 || 4 || 3 || 60 || 22 || 215 |- | 2016\u201317 || rowspan=3 align=left | Sale FC || National League 2 North || 30 || 5 || 3 || 1 || 7 || 57 |- | 2017\u201318 || National League 2 North || 30 || 4 || 1 || 98 || 39 || 324 |- | rowspan=2 align=left | 2018\u201319 || National League 1 || 9 || 0 || 1 || 22 || 12 || 83 |- | Huddersfield || National League 2 North || 20 || 5 || 4 || 52 || 27 || 222 |- | 2019\u201320 || Sale FC || National League 1 || || || || || || |- |} ===County/Representative=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Season !Club !Competition !Appearances !Tries !Drop Goals !Conversions !Penalties !Total Points |- | rowspan=2 align=left | 2008\u201309 || England Counties XV || Test match || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 |- | rowspan=2 align=left | Yorkshire || Bill Beaumont Cup || 2 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 2 || 11 |- | 2009\u201310 || Bill Beaumont Cup || 1 || ? || ? || ? || ? || ? |- | 2010\u201311 || rowspan=3 align=left | Lancashire || Bill Beaumont Cup || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 |- | 2011\u201312 || Bill Beaumont Cup || 4 || 3 || 0 || 16 || 5 || 62 |- | rowspan=2 align=left | 2012\u201313 || Bill Beaumont Cup || 3 || 2 || 0 || 6 || 5 || 37 |- | England Counties XV || Tour of Belgium || 2 || 2 || 0 || 10 || 1 || 33 |- | rowspan=2 align=left | 2013\u201314 || | England Counties XV || Test matches || 2 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 10 |- | Lancashire || Bill Beaumont Cup || 4 || 4 || 0 || 14 || 4 || 60 |- | rowspan=2 align=left | 2014\u201315 || | England Counties XV || Test matches || 2 || 0 || 0 || 2 || 9 || 31 |- | Lancashire || Bill Beaumont Cup || 4 || 0 || 0 || 3 || 5 || 21 |- | rowspan=2 align=left | 2015\u201316 || | England Counties XV || Test matches || 1 || 0 || 0 || 3 || 2 || 12 |- | Lancashire || Bill Beaumont Cup || 3 || 1 || 0 || 6 || 5 || 32 |- | 2016\u201317 || rowspan=2 align=left | Lancashire || Bill Beaumont Cup || 2 || 0 || 0 || 5 || 1 || 13 |- | 2017-18 || Bill Beaumont Cup || 3 || 0 || 17 || 6 || 1 || 55 |- |} == Honours and records == ===Club=== Huddersfield *North 1 v Midlands 1 promotion play-off winner: 2007\u201308 *Yorkshire Cup winner: 2011 Sale FC *National League 2 North champions: 2017\u201318 Yorkshire *Represented county in Bill Beaumont Cup: 2009, 2010 Lancashire *Bill Beaumont Cup winner (5): 2011, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2018 ===Personal=== *National League 2 North top points scorer (2): 2010\u201311 (387 points), 2011\u201312 (362 points) *Bill Beaumont Cup top points scorer (2): 2014 (60 points), 2018 (55 points) *Capped by England Counties XV: 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 == Notes == == References == == External links == *Huddersfield RUFC *Fylde Rugby *Sale FC Rugby *Lancashire RFU *England RFU Category:Living people Category:English rugby union players Category:1986 births Category:Rugby union fly-halves Category:Rugby union centres Category:Fylde Rugby Club players Category:Sale Sharks players Category:Lancashire County RFU players Category:Huddersfield R.U.F.C. players ",
