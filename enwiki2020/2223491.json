    "text": "Follow the leader is a children's game. First a leader or \"head of the line\" is chosen, then the children all line up behind the leader. The leader then moves around and all the children have to mimic the leader's actions. Any players who fail to follow or do what the leader does are out of the game. When only one person other than the leader remains, that player becomes the leader, and the game begins again with all players joining the line once again. == Other versions == In 2007, The Wiggles wrote a song \"Follow the Leader\" about the game for The Wiggles' album Getting Strong (Wiggle and Learn). The song was available on DVD in The Wiggles' You Make Me Feel Like Dancing. == See also == *List of traditional children's games *Simon says *Tag == External links == * Follow the leader.
