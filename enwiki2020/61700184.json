    "text": "Axiom's End is a science fiction novel and debut novel by Lindsay Ellis. Set in 2007, the novel is about a U.S. government coverup of contact with extraterrestrial life. Axiom's End entered The New York Times Best Seller list at number 7. ==Plot== In an alternate version of the United States in 2007, a famous whistleblower named Nils Ortega leverages his large online following to repeatedly attack the Bush administration, alleging a series of government cover-ups. The nature of Nils's work forced him to flee the country, abandoning his family. The story follows Nils's daughter Cora Sabino, a young college dropout living along with her mother and her two younger siblings in Southern California, where her paternal aunt also resides. Cora's family find themselves under constant supervision by agents of the U.S. government, including a high-ranking CIA official named Sol Kaplan. Following a meteor strike not far from where they live, Cora's family is abducted by government agents while Cora flees from a monstrous alien creature that broke into their house at night. The alien eventually catches Cora, implanting a tracking and communication device into her, using her as a human puppet to launch an infiltration of the Googleplex for unknown reasons. This infiltration fails when a mysterious pulse of energy knocks out the alien controlling Cora. It is revealed that the alien came to Earth to figure out how another member of his species died while being held in captivity by the government. Cora and the alien strike a wary alliance, as Cora wants to reunite with her abducted family members while the alien needs a human interpreter. Cora names the alien Ampersand. As the story unfolds, more and more dark secrets about both Cora's family and Ampersand's species come to light, with it being revealed that humanity will likely be wiped out by the hostile alien species Ampersand belongs to. Meanwhile, Nils and his followers continue to attack the government, embroiling George W. Bush personally in a scandal around an alleged attempt to cover up first contact with an alien species. Through it all, Cora and Ampersand forge a deep, romantic bond in spite of the vast differences between their species, biology, and culture. ==Reception== Reviewers liked Axiom's Ends fast pace and cultural commentary.\"Axiom's End.\" Publishers Weekly.
