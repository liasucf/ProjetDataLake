    "text": "Victor Berge (1891 - 1974) was a pioneering diver of the early 20th century, raised in the Swedish town of Ockelbo, \"a little village in the pine forests of Gestrickland\" according to a description in \"Pearl Diver\". After his father died at a young age, he eventually went to sea, where he spent the next forty years diving in the Pacific. Two books chronicle his life, \"Pearl Diver\" (1930), which covers his life up to 1930 or so, and \"Danger is My Life\" (1954), which chronicles his life up to that point, and through World War II (when he was captured and imprisoned by the Japanese). After the war he returned to Sweden, where he died in 1974 in Stockholm. In line with his instructions, he is buried in Ockelbo. ==Biographical works and materials== Image:Victor berge pearl diver.jpg Pearl Diver: Adventuring Over and Under Southern Seas Victor Berge and Henry Wysham Lanier (as told to) Illustrations by Stephen Haweis Hardcover, dustjacket, first published, 1930 352pp. Line drawings.
