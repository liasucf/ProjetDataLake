    "text": "Spider-Woman (Martha \"Mattie\" Franklin) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. She is the third character to be called Spider-Woman. ==Publication history== The character first appeared in Spectacular Spider-Man #262 (in the shadows), in November 1998. Her first full appearance was in The Amazing Spider-Man #441 (1998), and her first appearance as Spider-Woman was in The Amazing Spider-Man vol. 2 #5 (1999), the beginning of a three-part crossover which led directly into the launch of her own Spider-Woman series. Like Spider-Woman volume 1, Spider-Woman volume 3 pitted the protagonist against macabre and grotesque villains, and featured a closing story arc in which she looks into a mirror and sees her own face shriveled down to skin and bones. As a running joke, Spider-Woman constantly changes costumes throughout the series, including a four-issue run (#2\u20135) in which she adopts a new costume every issue. However, sales were mediocre and the series was cancelled with issue #18 (December 2000). After an almost two- year absence, Mattie Franklin returned for a six-issue story arc in Alias #16\u201321, but the character spends the entire story (save a three-page epilogue) in a semi-conscious state. The 2007\u20132008 limited series Loners thus represented Mattie Franklin's first active adventure in more than six years. ==Fictional character biography== Martha \"Mattie\" Franklin is a troubled youth who grew up with her father after her mother died.
