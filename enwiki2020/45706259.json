    "text": "Beaugrenelle Paris is a shopping mall located in Paris' 15th arrondissement, close to the River Seine and 10 minutes' walk from the Eiffel Tower. It is one of the biggest shopping malls in Paris' inner city. A mix between a department store and a shopping mall, Beaugrenelle is home to 120 shops and restaurants. Another landmark close to the mall is the 37.73-foot high replica of the Statue of Liberty, a gift from the USA to France in 1889. == History == Beaugrenelle Paris\u2019 story began in the 1970s with the development of a new neighborhood. The first Beaugrenelle shopping mall, which opened in 1979, was an integral part of a residential complex built in the typical brutalist style of the time. By 1999, the shopping mall was in decline, consequently a complete renovation project was launched in 2003 by the new owner Gecina. The architecture was largely responsible for this slow, irreversible decline. The neighborhood had been designed according to a utopian vision particular to France: in the 1960s and 1970s, urban planners believed that functional areas, such as shops and living spaces, should be elevated and separated from the traffic. This functionalism also lay behind the design of La D\u00e9fense, La Part Dieu in Lyon and other new towns, and was based on the sanitary principles laid out in the Athens Charter. \"France, being absolutist and excessively theoretical, was the only country to apply this new type of urban planning concept to the letter,\" notes Denis Valode. When the decision was taken to redevelop the mall, Apsys, won the competition. Located in France and Poland since 1996, Apsys, an investor-developer, manages a portfolio of 31 shopping centres and pilot 6 projects under development. Its project was to demolish the existing center, extend its perimeter, incorporate it into the city and bring it down to the Seine. Ten years later, Beaugrenelle Paris opened its doors on 23 October 2013. == Architecture == === Buildings === Designed by Valode & Pistre, a Paris-based architecture firm known for designing and building Renault Technocentre and Incity Tower in Lyon, the shopping mall extends over six floors. One hundred and twenty stores and restaurants are spread over 50,000 m2 of fashion retail space, divided into three buildings: Magnetic, Panoramic and City. The Magnetic and Panoramic buildings are linked by a covered pedestrian bridge, creating a gateway to the 15th arrondissement from the River Seine. One of the special architectural features of the Beaugrenelle mall is the exoskeleton walkway, an external steel skeleton wrapped round a glass tube. Its form is reminiscent of its illustrious neighbors: the Eiffel Tower and Bir-Hakeim bridge. The mall's main construction materials are metal, resin, double glazing and lacquered metal, giving the building a modern and futuristic atmosphere. Denis Valode and Jean Pistre wanted the mall \"to fit in with the neighborhood's architectural history, continuing the style of the metal frame architecture of the Bir- Hakeim viaduct and the Eiffel Tower, which are both close by\". Metal was therefore the obvious material for the latticing framing the building islands and enclosing the walkways. Light is present everywhere thanks to the glass walls and the blue glass dome capping the atrium. === Atrium === The two atria are illuminated by skylights, filling the shopping mall's six floors with natural daylight. Each atrium is covered in a metallic glass roof which changes color according to the time of day and the light conditions, ranging from cooler shades during the day to warmer ones at night. A matching blue mobile, designed by the French artist Xavier Veilhan, adorns one of the atria and creates a link between retail and culture. The 'Grand Mobile' is 15 meters high and was originally created for the Dynamo exhibition at the Grand Palais in 2013. === Cinema === Beaugrenelle Paris is also home to a 10-screen movie theater Path\u00e9 designed by the French designer Ora-\u00efto. His approach was to engage the senses. The undulating lines on the ceilings and floors help to guide through the various spaces. Strong, contemporary colors, such as \u2018Path\u00e9\u2019 yellow and gray are used throughout, and combined with natural wood. Ora-\u00efto also used white and yellow Corian for the ticket counters and service areas. === Green Roof === Sustainability was one of the main concerns regarding the construction of the building. Considering the risks to biodiversity in cities, the architects decided to develop a green roof. Measuring 7,000 m2, it is the biggest green roof in Paris. The roof is home to 40,000 plant species irrigated by rainwater, bees and birds, which benefit from a partnership concluded with the French league for the protection of birds (LPO). The bees are kept in six hives on the roof, producing 50\u2013100 kg of honey a year. A 700 m2 community garden allows local inhabitants to take care of their production. Beaugrenelle is the first shopping mall to have double environmental certification: HQE1 and Level 2 BREEAM (rated 'Very Good'). == Stores == There are 120 shops and restaurants in the mall. === Fashion & more === Beaugrenelle Paris is a mix between a department store and a shopping mall. Its three theme-oriented buildings are home to 61 dedicated fashion outlets, selling everything from high street to luxury brands. There are stores dedicated to women's, men's and children's fashions, as well as lingerie, footwear, jewelry and leather goods. The mall also includes 10 stores dedicated to beauty and well-being products, 12 devoted to household items, and 14 that sell cultural and leisure goods. In addition, Beaugrenelle offers some brands that don't usually feature in shopping malls, such as Guerlain and Baccarat. === Restaurants & bars === The shopping mall also features 11 restaurants and 8 snack bars. A wide range of cuisine from all over the world, including Mexican, Italian, French, Lebanese and Japanese is available. A centralized tax refund service, free Wi-Fi, tourist information, personal shopper and hotel delivery are some of the services available. == Access == Metro lines 6 and 10 have stops close to the mall (10 Javel, 10 Charles Michel and 6 Bir Hakeim), as well as the suburban train line, RER C. There are also a variety of buses that stop here. In addition, the mall has an Autolib station (electric cars), a Velib station (bicycles) and 1100 parking spaces. The Batobus river bus service also have a stop at Beaugrenelle. == Events == Beaugrenelle Paris organizes events every year. The Nuit Blanche event on 6\u20137 October 2012 gave visitors an opportunity to visit a work-in-progress site that previously wasn't open to the public. As part of this event, Beaugrenelle hosted an installation, Lumi\u00e8res en vibration by the Argentinian artist Julio Le Parc, featuring various sensory experiences. In 2015 the mall participated to the International Contemporary Art Fair in Paris. Named \"Think Big\" an exhibition of 16 works of art was displayed in the mall. At Christmas time, it partners with Disneyland Paris to decorate the shopping mall with Disney characters. == Awards == Beaugrenelle is an innovative shopping mall that has won international awards: * Award for Excellence \u2013 Conseil National des Centres Commerciaux (2014) * Janus retail award \u2013 French Institute of Design (2014) * Special Jury Prize \u2013 MAPIC Awards (2014) * Finalist \u2013 MIPIM Awards (2015) * Best European Shopping Centre Award \u2013 ICSC (International Council of Shopping Centers) (2015) * Global Award for Excellence \u2013 ULI (Urban Land Institute) (2015) * 'Honoree' prize \u2013 ICSC (Design & Development category) (2016) == References == == External links == * Category:Shopping centres in France Category:Shops in Paris Category:Retailing in Paris Category:Tourist attractions in Paris Category:Buildings and structures in the 15th arrondissement of Paris Category:Shopping malls established in 2013 ",
