He served as the head football coach at the University of Texas at Austin from 1951 to 1956, compiling a record of 33\u201327\u20131. After Blair Cherry's abrupt resignation, Price was promoted to head coach. In his first three seasons, Price carried over the success of Dana X. Bible and Cherry, leading the Longhorns to three winning seasons and two Southwest Conference titles. In 1954, Texas went 4\u20135\u20131, its first losing season in 15 years. After capping off three losing seasons in a row with a 1\u20139 season, the worst record in school history, Price tendered his resignation in 1956. He stayed on at Texas, first in the physical education department and later as assistant dean of students. Price died on March 1, 1976, at his home in Austin, Texas. ==Head coaching record== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1909 births Category:1976 deaths Category:American men's basketball players Category:Texas Longhorns baseball players Category:Texas Longhorns football coaches Category:Texas Longhorns football players Category:Texas Longhorns men's basketball players Category:High school football coaches in Texas Category:People from Brownwood, Texas Category:People from Navarro County, Texas Category:Players of American football from Texas Category:Baseball players from Texas Category:Basketball players from Texas ",
