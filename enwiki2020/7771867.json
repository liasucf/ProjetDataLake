    "text": "\"Mississippi\" is a song by Dutch country pop band Pussycat. Written by Werner Theunissen and produced by Eddy Hilberts, \"Mississippi\" was the group's first number-one single in their home country, as well as their only number-one single in most countries worldwide. In New Zealand and South Africa, however, \"Mississippi\" was their first of two number-one singles; in the latter country, \"Mississippi\" was the best-selling single of 1977. ==History== Werner Theunissen wrote \"Mississippi\" in 1969 being inspired by the Bee Gees song \"Massachusetts\". The song grabbed EMI Bovema's attention, and they decided to sign the band. By December 1975, the song had topped the Dutch Singles Chart. Its international success came in 1976, when it reached number one in Belgium, Germany, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, as well as number two in Australia, number four in Austria, and number six in Sweden. In South Africa, \"Mississippi\" was the highest- selling single of 1977. It is estimated to have sold five million copies worldwide. Outside the Netherlands, Pussycat would later achieve more number- one singles in New Zealand and South Africa, but in most territories, \"Mississippi\" was their highest-charting effort. In the UK, the song was promoted by John Saunders Hughes through a Liverpool radio station. The lyrics are about the history of music, and how rock music became more popular than country music. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1975\u20131977) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (Kent Music Report) |2 |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Denmark (Denmark Radio) |9 |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Israel (Israel Broadcasting Service) |3 |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|South Africa (Springbok Radio) |1 |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1975) !scope=\"col\"|Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Single Top 100) |77 |} {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1976) !scope=\"col\"|Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (Kent Music Report)Kent (1993). \"1976 Top 25 Singles\". p. 428. |13 |- !scope=\"row\"|Austria (\u00d63 Austria Top 40) |18 |- !scope=\"row\"|Belgium (Ultratop) |3 |- !scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Single Top 100) |56 |- !scope=\"row\"|New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) |3 |- !scope=\"row\"|Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade) |5 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |3 |} {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1977) !scope=\"col\"|Position |- !scope=\"row\"|South Africa (Springbok Radio) |1 |} ==Sales and certifications== ==Covers== Swedish dansband Vikingarna covered the song in Swedish, with lyrics by Margot Borgstr\u00f6m, in April 1976, less than six months after the original release.
