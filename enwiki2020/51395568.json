The song was written by Trina Braxton, Herman \"P-Nut\" Johnson and Ahmad Jamal McGhee and produced by Johnson, McGhee, Braxton and Ronnie Garrett. ==Background and release== On February 6, 2012, Braxton performed the song for the first time at the Bass Mint SuperBowl Party in Atlanta, GA. On April 9, 2012, Braxton announced a casting call for models and dancers would take place for the shooting of the music video for the single. On April 10, Braxton gave an interview with 107.5 WBLS studios talking about the single release, stating: \"I didn't want to stay in that box because I'm a black girl... If I wanted to do something that reflected me I had to do it myself\". She made 60 milllon in sales. ==Critical reception== Upon its release, \"Party or Go Home\" received positive reviews from music critics. Singersroom wrote \"Trina Braxton unleashes the music video for her debut solo single \"Party Or Go Home.\" In the visuals, Trina takes the role of a party queen as she rocks out til the morning light. The bass heavy electro-pop track, lined with catchy and fun lyrics, will undoubtedly help 'Miss Boom Boom,' who sang backup for her superstar sister Toni Braxton, separate herself from her siblings. She drops the word \"bougie\" in the song's first line and rhymes \"hands in the air\" with \"your derriere,\" celebrating her new-found solodom.\" ==Music video== A music video was shot during Season 2 episode 23 \"Party or Go Home\" of Braxton Family Values, directed by Derek Blanks. The music video was released on Trina Braxton's VEVO account on October 9, 2012. The video features cameos from sisters Traci and Towanda Braxton. ==Track listings and formats== Digital download #\"Party or Go Home\" \u2013 3:30 ==Personnel== Credits adapted from Discogs. *Writing \u2013 Herman \"P-Nut\" Johnson, Ahmad Jamal McGhee, Trina Braxton *Production \u2013 Herman \"P-Nut\" Johnson, Ahmad Jamal McGhee *Additional production \u2013Ronnie Garrett, Trina Braxton *Vocals \u2013 Trina Braxton *Audio mixing \u2013 Herman \"P-Nut\" Johnson ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| United States | rowspan=\"5\"| March 26, 2012 | rowspan=\"5\"| Digital download | rowspan=\"5\"| Sol Tri Entertainment | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Canada | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| United Kingdom | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Namibia | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2012 songs Category:2012 singles Category:American pop songs Category:Dance-pop songs ",
