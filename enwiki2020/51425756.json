Illanes Alvarado (18 August 1958 \u2013 25 August 2016) was a Bolivian lawyer and politician who served as Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs from 14 March 2016 to 25 August 2016, during the third cabinet of President Evo Morales. ==Biography== Rodolfo Illanes was born in the city of La Paz in 1958. He was a lawyer at the Higher University of San Andr\u00e9s (UMSA). He had also had a specialty in Criminal Sciences, from the University of Costa Rica. He was an adviser to President Evo Morales in his first term. In the Ministry of Labour he held the position of Superintendent of Civil Service and then Deputy Minister of Work, Employment, and Social Security. On 14 March 2016, he assumed the position of Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs, replacing Marcelo El\u00edo Ch\u00e1vez. ==Kidnapping and death== On 25 August 2016, Illanes was kidnapped along with his assistant while heading to Panduro to speak to anti-government protesters and then was later killed by the striking miners who abducted him. His murder shocked the South American country. Defence Minister Reymi Ferreira broke down on television as he described how Illanes, appointed to his post in March, had apparently been \"beaten and tortured to death\". Government minister Carlos Romero called it a \"cowardly and brutal killing\" and asked the miners to immediately hand over the body. ==References== Category:1960 births Category:2016 deaths Category:People from La Paz Category:Bolivian murder victims Category:People murdered in Bolivia Category:Murdered ministers Category:Deaths by beating Category:Movement for Socialism (Bolivia) politicians Category:Higher University of San Andr\u00e9s alumni Category:University of Costa Rica alumni Category:21st-century lawyers Category:21st-century politicians Category:Bolivian lawyers Category:2016 crimes in Bolivia Category:2016 murders in South America Category:2010s murders in Bolivia ",
