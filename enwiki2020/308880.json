    "text": "The Apple Bandai Pippin, stylized PiP P!N, is a multimedia technology console, designed by Apple Computer. The console is based on the Apple Pippin platform \u2013 a derivative of the Apple Macintosh platform. Bandai produced the ATMARK and @WORLD consoles between 1996 and 1997. It was sold at $599. The goal of the Bandai Pippin was to create an inexpensive computer system aimed mostly at playing CD-based multimedia software, especially games, but also functioning as a thin client. The operating system is a version of System 7.5.2, and is based on a 66 MHz PowerPC 603 processor and a 14.4 kb/s modem. It features a 4\u00d7-speed CD-ROM drive and a video output that can connect to a standard television display. ==Marketing== In Japan, Bandai produced Pippin-based systems called the . Most of the Atmark systems use the same platinum color used on many of the Apple Macintosh models at the time. In the United States and most parts of Europe, Bandai named the system the Bandai Pippin @WORLD (pronounced \"at-world\"). The @WORLD has the same specifications as the Pippin Atmark, but runs an English version of Mac OS. Most of the western systems use a black color. ==History== Bandai manufactured fewer than 100,000 Pippins, but reportedly sold 42,000 systems before discontinuing the line. Production of the system was so limited, there were more keyboard and modem accessories produced than actual systems.Assembler (via Archive.org). Apple Bandai Pippin. Retrieved March 21, 2008.
