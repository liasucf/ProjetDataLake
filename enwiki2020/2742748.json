The short film was the first commissioned for The Tonight Show and premiered there on February 27, 2002. It also appears on the 10th anniversary Clerks X DVD. The DVD cut is remastered and features an introduction by Kevin Smith. ==Plot== While stuck in a traffic jam, Dante and Randal have another philosophical, pop culture-laden conversation \u2014 this one sparked when Randal asks Dante what he would hypothetically sacrifice in exchange for marketing rights to a flying car from The Jetsons. The hypothetical scenarios Randal continues to suggest grow increasingly ridiculous, culminating in Dante agreeing to have his foot cut off with a hacksaw, get knocked out, and get molested by the German inventor and his friends in exchange for the flying car. Randal expresses disgust that Dante would \"do it with a bunch of guys just to get a car\". ==Cast== * Brian O'Halloran as Dante Hicks * Jeff Anderson as Randal Graves ==References== ==External links== * * * The Flying Car at View Askew's Web site; includes the film in QuickTime, RealVideo and Windows Media formats * Transcript * The Flying Car on Kevin Smith's YouTube channel Category:2002 short films Category:2002 television films Category:2002 films Category:View Askew Productions films Category:View Askewniverse films ",
