    "text": "Armenium or Armenion () was a town of Pelasgiotis in ancient Thessaly, situated between Pherae and Larissa, near Boebeis Lake, said to have been the birthplace of Armenus, who accompanied Jason to Asia, and gave his name to the country of Armenia. It is hardly necessary to remark, that this tale, like so many others, arose from the accidental similarity of the names. There is conjecture that this town may be the same as that of Ormenium, but others equivocate or disagree.tentatively equating, rejecting and proposing a wholly different site, Homero, Il\u00edada, edici\u00f3n de Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Blanco y Luis M.

The site of Armenium is located near the modern site of Petra. ==References== Category:Populated places in ancient Thessaly Category:Former populated places in Greece Category:Pelasgiotis ",
