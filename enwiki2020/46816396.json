    "text": "M-21 highway () is a Montenegrin roadway. It runs concurrently with European route E763. ==History== Because the M-21 highway flowed through the heart of the city of Bijelo Polje, it caused heavy traffic delays. As a means to alleviate traffic in the city, the Montenegrin Ministry of Transport and Maritime Affairs commissioned a project to create a bypass around the city. As a result, on 27 March 2014, the Ministry of Transport and Maritime Affairs officially realigned the M-21 highway to its current alignment. The M-21 highway would now run along the bypass, no longer running through the city. ==Major intersections== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\" | Municipality !scope=\"col\" | Location !scope=\"col\" | km !scope=\"col\" | mi !scope=\"col\" | Destinations !scope=\"col\" | Notes |- |rowspan=\"3\" | Bijelo Polje |Barski Most ! scope=\"row\" align=right | 0 |align=right | 0 |nowrap=\"yes\" | (Serbia) |Border crossing with Serbia |- |Bijelo Polje ! scope=\"row\" align=right | |align=right | | | |- |Ribarevine ! scope=\"row\" align=right | |align=right | | | |} ==References== M21 ",
