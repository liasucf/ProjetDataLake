He was nominated as the best player of Georgia as well as the best player by the Georgian Professional Football league survey. ==Club career== ===Tbilisi and Trabzonspor=== Arveladze played at Dinamo Tbilisi, Trabzonspor, and Ajax, and finished at least one season as the top goal scorer at all three. In 1993, he scored an effective first Euro Tournament goal in the history of independent Georgian Football in the match against Linfield, Northern Ireland. When he led Trabzonspor in goals in 1995\u201396, he also led the S\u00fcper Lig, making him the second non-Turk to date to lead that league in goals after Tarik Hod\u017ei\u0107 1983\u201384. He is recorded as \"most loved foreign player\" for Trabzonspor supporters. ===Ajax Amsterdam=== In summer 1997, Arveladze signed for Ajax Amsterdam. Later, he declared that he was so nervous during his first training session, that he even forgot to take football boots with him. He became a close friend to Ronald de Boer during his spell in Amsterdam. His first game at Amsterdam Arena was a special day for the Georgian player. On 15 August 1997, Ajax Amsterdam faced Brazilian side Gr\u00eamio in a friendly game. Arveladze scored a goal, while his wife Tamuna gave birth to their first child, Giorgi hours before the game. Arveladze made a debut for Ajax against Vitesse Arnhem, where he replaced Gerald Sibon and scored the fourth goal for the club. During his first season, he scored three hat-tricks in Eredivisie and total 25 goals in 31 appearances. The manager of the Amsterdam-based club Morten Olsen was very pleased with the performance of the young striker. Arveladze was a key figure for the club during 1997\u201398 UEFA Cup as well. He scored 7 goals in 8 games for the club, including hat-trick against NK Maribor. Ajax were eliminated in quarter-finals, against Spartak Moscow. Arveladze scored the club's single goal in a tie. During his first season, he faced twice NAC Breda, where his twin brother Archil played. This remains as one of the most memorable facts in Shota's career. In summer 1998, Ajax signed Arveladze's close friend Giorgi Kinkladze from Manchester City for \u00a35 million. They had been friends since their childhood and that looked like a dream move for both. However, Kinkladze's spell at Ajax proved unsuccessful. ===Rangers=== Arveladze joined Rangers from Ajax for \u00a33m in 2001. He agreed a four-year deal with the club. It was obvious that the Georgian would face a fierce competitions for the starting place in the Rangers' strikeforce from the players like Tore Andre Flo, Claudio Caniggia, Michael Mols, Kenny Miller, Billy Dodds, Ronald de Boer and Russell Latapy. During the first season with Glasgow-based club, Arveladze scored 17 goals overall, including 11 in Scottish Premier League. He only managed to take part in 30 games, after being injured in February in the quarterfinal of the Scottish Cup against Forfar Athletic, an injury which meant he missed the 2002 Scottish League Cup Final. However, he scored six goals for his club, which managed to win the title. Arveladze played in the final, replacing Claudio Caniggia. This was his first title with the Scottish club. The following season was the most successful in the career of the Georgian player. Rangers won treble. In March 2003, Rangers defeated their arch-rivals Celtic in the League Cup Final. Later in the Scottish Cup Final, Rangers won another title, after they managed to defeat Dundee with a goal from Lorenzo Amoruso. Arveladze's two compatriots, Georgi Nemsadze and Zurab Khizanishvili also took part in this game. The latter joined Arveladze at Rangers during that summer. In May 2005, Arveladze declared that he will leave the club after the end of the season, in which he managed to scored 9 goals. He confirmed receiving offers from the various clubs throughout Europe, including the teams from England, Germany, the Netherlands and Turkey. During his time at Rangers, Arveladze had a nickname Mr. Bean, because of his facial likeness to Rowan Atkinson. During a legal case in 2015, Arveladze's agent claimed that the true transfer fee had been 12 million Euro, the equivalent of \u00a38.5 million at the time. Arveladze scored the 300th goal in the SPL and was part of Rangers squads that won the domestic treble in 2002\u201303 and a double in 2004\u201305. ===AZ=== Arveladze departed Rangers for Dutch side AZ on a free transfer before the start of 2005\u201306 season, signing a two-year deal with the club.

Alkmaar participated in UEFA Cup this time as well. In 6 game for the club, Arveladze made 2 assists and scored 2 goals, one of them against Real Betis.

During the second and the final season with the club, Arveladze was appointed as the new captain of the club. He was offered the armband after Denny Landzaat and Joris Mathijsen left for Wigan Athletic and Hamburger SV respectively. The Georgian was praised by Louis van Gaal, under whose guidance he played at Ajax Amsterdam as well. Van Gaal compared Arveladze to Danny Blind and Frank Rijkaard in terms of personality, calling him the top professional in the squad. He scored 23 goals, accumulating total 48 goals for AZ in 89 competitive appearances. The Georgian striker scored 7 goals in UEFA Cup as well, two of them in Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez Pizju\u00e1n Stadium in a 2\u20131 away win against Sevilla. ===Levante=== In July 2007, Arveladze passed a medical and agreed a one-year contract with the Spanish club Levante. Unfortunately he injured during the summer training session of the club and missed nearly ten months. He got injured in July and when underwent surgery in Amsterdam. The Georgian returned and made a debut against Villarreal in March, replacing Juanma. He managed to take part in other 3 games until the end of the season. In April, Levante confirmed that Arveladze would retire at the end of the season. In the last game of his career he played at Santiago Bernabeu against Real Madrid, in which Los Blancos won 5-2.
