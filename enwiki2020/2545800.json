    "text": "USS Lexington explodes during the Battle of the Coral Sea. Spitfires shortly before World War II. This is a list of military engagements of World War II encompassing land, naval, and air engagements as well as campaigns, operations, defensive lines and sieges. Campaigns generally refer to broader strategic operations conducted over a large bit of territory and over a long period. Battles generally refer to short periods of intense combat localised to a specific area and over a specific period. However, use of the terms in naming such events is not consistent. For example, the Battle of the Atlantic was more or less an entire theatre of war, and the so-called battle lasted for the duration of the entire war. Another misnomer is the Battle of Britain, which by all rights should be considered a campaign, not a mere battle. == Battles == ===1939=== {| style=\"background:transparent; font-size:95%;\" cellspacing=\"0\" |- valign=\"top\" |width=\"190px\"| \u2022 Invasion of Poland :: :: Battle of the Bzura :: Battle of M\u0142awa :: Battle of Tomasz\u00f3w Lubelski :: Battle of Kock :: Siege of Warsaw | Poland invaded by Nazi Germany. : : : : : : |- | \u2022 Soviet invasion of Poland :: Battle of Lw\u00f3w :: Battle of Wilno :: Battle of Grodno :: Battle of Szack :: Battle of Wytyczno | Poland invaded by Soviet Union. : : : : : |- | \u2022 Slovak invasion of Poland || Poland invaded by Slovakia |- | \u2022 Saar Offensive || French attack on Saarland. |- valign=\"top\" | \u2022 Winter War :: Battle of Tolvaj\u00e4rvi :: Battle of Suomussalmi | Finland invaded by the Soviet Union and, initially, resists successfully. | : : |- | \u2022 First Battle of Changsha || First Japanese attempt to take Changsha in China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. |- | \u2022 1939\u201340 Winter Offensive || First large-scale Chinese counter-offensive operation. |- | \u2022 Battle of the River Plate || The Admiral Graf Spee chased into Montevideo harbour and later scuttled. |} ===1940=== {| style=\"background:transparent; font-size:95%;\" cellspacing=\"0\" |- |width=\"190px\"| \u2022 Battle of the Atlantic || Name given to the conflicts in the Atlantic Ocean between 1940 and 1945. |- valign=\"top\" | \u2022 Winter War :: Battle of Kollaa :: Battle of Honkaniemi | : : The only tank battle during the Winter War. |- | \u2022 German invasion of Denmark |- | \u2022 Battle of Dr\u00f8bak Sound || Took place on the first day of the German invasion of Norway. |- | \u2022 Battles of Narvik || Minor Allied victory in Norway. |- | \u2022 Battle of Namsos || Failed Allied attempt to halt the Germans in Norway. |- | \u2022 Invasion of Iceland |- | \u2022 Battle of the Netherlands || Germany defeats the Dutch in Europe during the opening stages of the first operation of the Battle of France, \"Case Yellow\" (Fall Gelb). |- | \u2022 Battle of Belgium || Germany defeats Belgium during the continuation of Fall Gelb. |- | \u2022 Battle of France :: Battle of Dunkirk :: Battle of Arras :: Battle of Boulogne |- | \u2022 Attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir || Operation \"Catapult\".
