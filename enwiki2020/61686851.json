    "text": "The Philippines is expected to compete at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the Games have been postponed to 23 July to 8 August 2021, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the nation's official debut in 1924, Filipino athletes have appeared in every edition of the Summer Olympic Games, but did not attend the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of the nation's partial support for the US-led boycott. Philippine Football Federation president Mariano Araneta was appointed in August 2019 as chef de mission of the Filipino delegation to the Games by Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) president Abraham Tolentino. Araneta succeeded Joey Romasanta who was appointed as chef de mission for the same edition of the Olympics by Tolentino's predecessor, Ricky Vargas. As of March 2020, the Philippines qualified four athletes for Tokyo 2020, Ernest Obiena in men's pole vault, Carlos Yulo in artistic gymnastics, Eumir Marcial for men's middleweight in boxing and Irish Magno for women's flyweight in boxing. The Philippines is targeting to qualify around 38 athletes for the Olympics. ==Athletics== Filipino athletes further achieved the entry standards, either by qualifying time or by world ranking, in the following track and field events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event): ;Field events {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Qualification !colspan=\"2\"|Final |-style=\"font-size:95%\" !Distance !Position !Distance !Position |-align=center |-align=center |align=left|Ernest Obiena |align=left|Men's pole vault | | | | |} == Boxing == The Philippines entered two boxers (one per gender) into the Olympic tournament. 2019 world silver medalist Eumir Marcial (men's middleweight) and 2019 Southeast Asian Games runner-up Irish Magno (women's flyweight) secured places in their respective weight divisions, with the former advancing to the semifinals and the latter scoring a box-off triumph, at the 2020 Asia & Oceania Qualification Tournament in Amman, Jordan. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !Round of 32 !Round of 16 !Quarterfinals !Semifinals !colspan=2|Final |-style=\"font-size:95%\" !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Opposition Result !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Eumir Marcial |align=left|Men's middleweight | | | | | | |-align=center |align=left|Irish Magno |align=left|Women's flyweight | | | | | | |} ==Gymnastics== ===Artistic=== The Philippines entered one artistic gymnast into the Olympic competition for the first time since 1968.
