    "text": "was a Japanese Heian period bureaucrat, who held the post of Sadaijin (Minister of the Left). His father was Fujiwara no Kanemichi. Akimitsu is known for having been involved in a strange set of circumstances regarding his daughter, En-shi. En-shi was married to the Emperor's son, Imperial Prince Atsuakira (\u6566\u660e\u89aa\u738b) (later, Ko-Ichij\u014d In, \u5c0f\u4e00\u6761\u9662). When Imperial Prince Atsuakira chose to take on a daughter of Fujiwara no Michinaga as a second wife in return for declination from Crown Prince, En-shi grew spiteful and turned to Akimitsu for help. She died soon afterwards of grief, and Akimitsu is said to have asked a bonze (a monk) named D\u014dman to cast a spell or curse on Michinaga. Akimitsu thus came to be known as Akury\u014d-safu (\u60aa\u970a\u5de6\u5e9c), meaning \"the safu (=Sadaijin) with evil spirits.\" ==References== *Papinot, Edmond (1910).
