    "text": "Ocotea odorifera is a species of plant in the family Lauraceae. It is an evergreen tree in the genus Ocotea. It is commonly known as Brazilian sassafras or American cinnamon; though it is not a true sassafras nor a true cinnamon, these plants are close relatives. In trade, the junior synonym Ocotea pretiosa is often used, and there is considerable confusion between the present taxon and Ocotea cymbarum. ==Distribution== It is native to Brazil, in the states of Bahia, Minas Gerais, Paran\u00e1, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and S\u00e3o Paulo. It may also be native to Misiones province of Argentina and to Paraguay, but is unverified there. It is threatened by habitat loss. ==Gallery== Image:Ocotea odorifera - Jardim Bot\u00e2nico de S\u00e3o Paulo - IMG 0329.jpg|Tree Image:Ocotea odorifera - Jardim Bot\u00e2nico de S\u00e3o Paulo - IMG 0330.jpg|Leaves Image:Ocotea odorifera - Jardim Bot\u00e2nico de S\u00e3o Paulo - IMG 0275.jpg|Seeds ==References== ==External links== odorifera Category:Trees of Brazil Category:Flora of Atlantic Forest (biome) Category:Flora of Bahia Category:Flora of Minas Gerais Category:Flora of Paran\u00e1 (state) Category:Flora of Rio de Janeiro (state) Category:Flora of Rio Grande do Sul Category:Flora of Santa Catarina (state) Category:Flora of S\u00e3o Paulo (state) Category:Vulnerable flora of South America Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
