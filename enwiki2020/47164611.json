    "text": "Andrew Hardie McCulloch (died May 1908) was an Australian politician. His father was also called Andrew Hardie McCulloch, but further details of his birth are unknown. He was a Sydney solicitor and also a pastoralist with runs near Canonbar. He was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Central Cumberland at the 1877 election. He held the seat until financial difficulty forced him to resign it in December 1887. He regained the seat at the resulting by-election, however financial difficulty caused him to resign again in May 1888. He announced his intention to recontest the seat at the May 1888 by-election, however he decided not to stand. He was struck off the roll of solicitors on 29 May 1888. The Parliament of New South Wales records his date of death as 8 May 1908, however the death notice published in The Argus lists McCulloch as dying on 28 May 1908, aged 63 years. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing Category:1908 deaths Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:Free Trade Party politicians ",
