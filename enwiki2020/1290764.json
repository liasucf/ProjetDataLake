    "text": "Ranong ( (Pronunciation)) is a town (thesaban mueang) in southern Thailand, former capital of the Ranong Province and the Mueang Ranong District. The town covers completely the area of the tambon Khao Niwet (\u0e40\u0e02\u0e32\u0e19\u0e34\u0e40\u0e27\u0e28\u0e19\u0e4c). As of 2005, it had a population of 16,163. Ranong lies south-southwest of Bangkok by road. ==Geography== Ranong is on the estuary of the Pak Chan (or Kraburi) River, opposite Myanmar's Kawthaung (formerly Victoria Point). The Tenasserim Hills rise directly to the east of Ranong, and another small ridge runs along the edge of the estuary to the town's north. ==Climate== Ranong has a tropical monsoon climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Am). There is little variation in the temperature throughout the year, although the pre-monsoon months (February to April) are somewhat hotter in the day. However, Ranong's position to the west of the Tenasserim Hills means that the monsoon season's rains are greatly amplified, resulting in torrential rains from May until October, and significant rainfall in the transition months of April and November. ==Transportation== Phet Kasem Road (Thailand Route 4) runs through the city. Ranong Airport is about south of town. The Port Authority of Thailand operates the Ranong Port, which is Thailand's principal Indian Ocean port. In 2008, the Ranong human-smuggling incident resulted in 54 deaths. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Populated places in Ranong Province Category:Myanmar\u2013Thailand border crossings Category:Ports and harbours of the Indian Ocean Category:Cities and towns in Thailand ",
