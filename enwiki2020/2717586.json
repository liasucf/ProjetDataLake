    "text": "Dove Holes railway station serves the village of Dove Holes, Derbyshire, England. The station is on the Manchester Piccadilly to Buxton line south east of Piccadilly. It is managed and served by Northern. It was opened in 1863 by the LNWR at the summit of its line between Whaley Bridge and Buxton. Originally the Midland Railway had hoped that the LNWR would join it in extending the line that they jointly leased between Ambergate and Rowsley. The LNWR declined, then built this one from Buxton to meet its line to Manchester. Later the Midland built a line from Millers Dale through Chapel to Chinley passing 183 feet beneath it in Dove Holes Tunnel. ==Facilities== The station is unmanned and has no ticket provision, so all tickets must be bought on the train or prior to travel. There are no permanent buildings other than waiting shelters on each platform; train running details are provided by telephone and timetable poster boards. Step-free access is available to both platforms via ramps.Dove Hole station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 17 May 2017 == Accident == In 1957, the steep gradient north of here down towards Chapel-en-le-Frith was the scene of a serious accident, in which the driver of a runaway freight train, John Axon remained at his post and died when it ran into the back of a preceding train.Accident at Chapel-en-le Frith on 9 February 1957 The Railways Archive; Retrieved 17 May 2017 He was subsequently awarded a posthumous George Cross for his actions. == Service == There is a train every two hours Monday-Saturday towards Manchester Piccadilly northbound and Buxton southbound (other trains pass through without calling); some extra calls are provided at peak times.
