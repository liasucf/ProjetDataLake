The album also reached the top ten in Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Portugal and Chile. Three tracks appeared in Hans Canosa's 2005 American film Conversations with Other Women (\"J'en connais\", \"Le plus beau du quartier\", and \"L'excessive\"), and the song \"Le plus beau du quartier\" was used in H&M;'s Christmas 2006 commercial.

The song \"Le Ciel Dans Une Chambre\" also appeared in an episode of Skins, series 3. ==Details== The second track, \u201cRapha\u00ebl\u201d, is named for Bruni's then-lover, philosophy professor Rapha\u00ebl Enthoven, When Carla Bruni broke hearts -- Gala, Eliane Georges , 17 August 2005 with whom she had a son, Aur\u00e9lien Enthoven, in 2001. Bruni has further collaborated with the producer, Louis Bertignac, in 2005 duetting with him on the song \"Les Fr\u00f4leuses\" on his new album. == Track listing == == Song summaries == ;1. Quelqu'un m'a dit (Someone Told Me): This melancholy song from which the album draws its name speaks of the sadness of life \u2013 \"On me dit que nos vies ne valent pas grand chose, / Elles passent en un instant comme fanent les roses.\" (\"They tell me that our lives are not worth very much, / They pass in an instant as roses wilt.\") \u2013 and that time and fate (destiny) care nothing for us. She forlornly hopes that \"you still love me\" \u2013 \"quelqu'un m'a dit / Que tu m'aimais encore,\" (\"Somebody told me / that you loved me still\") \u2013 recalling that somebody told her, but she cannot remember who. ;2. Rapha\u00ebl: In this lively and playful song, Bruni sings of her love for her then-lover Rapha\u00ebl Enthoven, first reveling in his name \u2013 \"Quatre consonnes et trois voyelles / c'est le pr\u00e9nom de Rapha\u00ebl,\" (\"Four consonants and three vowels / that's the first name of Rapha\u00ebl\") \u2013 then delighting in his wickedness and their time together. The middle of the song features mysterious lyrics \u2013 \"Peau de chagrin, p\u00e2tre \u00e9ternel / Archange \u00e9trange d\u2019un autre ciel\" (\"ShagreenShagreen is a type of leather, from French chagrin, of complex etymology./Sorrow skin, eternal father / Strange archangel from another heaven/sky\"), alluding to the magical skin that is slowly used up in Balzac's novel La Peau de chagrin. She later sings of their love being in the moment \u2013 \"Pas de promesse \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9ternel\" (\"No promises of eternity\") \u2013 compare the title of her next album, No Promises, and the eventual end of her relationship with Rapha\u00ebl. ;3. Tout le monde (Everyone): This melancholy song tells of how everyone has known disappointment \u2013 forgotten childhood memories, remains of dreams (\"restes de r\u00eaves\"), and devastation \u2013 and then absurdly suggests that this solitude should be fixed by passing a law \u2013 \"Il faudrait que tout l'monde r\u00e9clame aupr\u00e8s des autorit\u00e9s, / Une loi contre toute notre solitude,\" (\"Everyone should demand from the authorities / A law against all our solitude.\"), musing on French socialism. ;4. La noy\u00e9e (Drowned): This is a cover of a song by Serge Gainsbourg, which Bruni heard on the soundtrack to the movie Romance of a Horsethief (1971); another cover was released near the same time in the 2002 album C'\u00e9tait ici. :The song speaks of time and memory separating people, using contrasting images of water \u2013 \"la rivi\u00e8re du souvenir\" (\"the river of memory\") and \"l'oc\u00e9an de l'oubli\" (\"the ocean of forgetting\"). ;5. Le toi du moi (You of Me): This love song consists of various pairings of the form \"You are my X, I am your Y\", \"I am the X, you are the Y\", or \"You are the X of my Y\", beginning \"Je suis ton pile / Tu es mon face\" (\"I am your tails / You are my heads\" [We are two sides of the same coin]), passing through over fifty pairs, climaxing 2/3 of the way through and again ending with \"T'es le jamais de mon toujours / T'es mon amour t'es mon amour.\" (\"You are the never of my forever / You are my love you are my love.\") :Some of the images are playful \"T'es la moustache de mon Trotski\" (\"You are the mustache of my Trotsky\"), while some allude to drugs \"Toi tu es l\u2019herbe et moi le joint\" (\"You are the weed and I'm the joint\" \u2013 marijuana) and \"Toi la paille et moi la poudre\" (\"You the straw and I the powder\" \u2013 cocaine); compare Tu es ma came (\"You're My Drug\") from her third album, Comme si de rien n'\u00e9tait. ;6. Le ciel dans une chambre (Heaven in a Room): ;7. J'en connais (I Know Some): ;8. Le plus beau du quartier (The Most Handsome Boy Of The Neighbourhood): ;9. Chanson triste (Sad Song): ;10. L'excessive (The Excessive): ;11. L'amour (Love): ;12. La derni\u00e8re minute (The Last Minute): The last song is one minute long, exactly as it says on the tin. It features a metronome tick-tock beat. The lyrics refer to someone at the end of her life, not yet ready to die (\"Quand je verrai ma mort juste au pied de mon lit (When I see my death at the foot of my bed)/ Que je la verrai sourire de ma si petite vie (I'll see a smile from my little life)/ Je lui dirai \u201c\u00e9coute ! laisse-moi juste une minute\u201d (I will say [to death], \"Listen! Give me just a minute!\"). == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (2002\u20132004) !Peak position |- |Austrian Album ChartQuelqu'un m'a dit, in various albums charts Lescharts.com (Retrieved 27 July 2008) |align=\"center\"|27 |- |Belgian (Flanders) Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|9 |- |Belgian (Wallonia) Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|1 |- |French Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|1 |- |German Albums ChartQuelqu'un m'a dit, in various albums charts Acharts.us (Retrieved 28 July 2008) |align=\"center\"|14 |- |Italian Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|4 |- |Portuguese Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|5 |- |Swiss Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|4 |- |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|End of year chart (2002) !align=\"center\"|Position |- |align=\"left\"|French Albums Chart2002 French Albums Chart Ifop.com (Retrieved 28 July 2008) |align=\"center\"|27 |- !align=\"left\"|End of year chart (2003) !align=\"center\"|Position |- |align=\"left\"|Belgian (Flanders) Albums Chart2003 Belgian (Flanders) Albums Chart Ultratop.be (Retrieved 28 July 2008) |align=\"center\"|53 |- |align=\"left\"|Belgian (Wallonia) Albums Chart2003 Belgian (Wallonia) Albums Chart Ultratop.be (Retrieved 28 July 2008) |align=\"center\"|1 |- |align=\"left\"|French Albums Chart2003 French Albums Chart Ifop.com (Retrieved 28 July 2008) |align=\"center\"|3 |- |align=\"left\"|Swiss Albums Chart2003 Swiss Albums Chart Hitparade.ch (Retrieved 28 July 2008) |align=\"center\"|41 |- !align=\"left\"|End of the year chart (2004) !align=\"center\"|Position |- |align=\"left\"|Belgian (Wallonia) Albums Chart2004 Belgian (Wallonia) Albums Chart Ultratop.be (Retrieved 28 July 2008) |align=\"center\"|49 |- |align=\"left\"|French Albums Chart2004 French Albums Chart Ifop.com (Retrieved 28 July 2008) |align=\"center\"|61 |- |} ==Certifications and sales== |relyear=2003}} |relyear=2003}} !scope=\"row\"|Worldwide | |2,000,000 |- ==References== ==Further reading== * * * Carla Bruni homepage \u2013 lyrics and audio samples Category:2002 debut albums Category:Carla Bruni albums ",
