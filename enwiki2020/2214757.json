    "text": "The Encyclop\u00e9die nouvelle, ou dictionnaire philosophique, scientifique, litt\u00e9raire et industriel, offrant le tableau des connaissances humaines au XIXe si\u00e8cle was a French encyclopedia founded by Pierre Leroux and Jean Reynaud and published in installments from 1834 through 1847. It reflected the socialist philosophy of the founders. Volume 1 (with an imprint of 1836, though the first installment appeared in 1834) covered A-Ari; volume 2, Ari- Bos; volume 3, Bot-Cons; volume 4, Const-\u00c9pic; and volume 8, Sap-Zor. Volumes 5 through 7 were never finished as planned, but materials issued in installments and intended for these volumes were eventually bound together in a miscellaneous volume covering the sequences Episc-Force and Organog-Phil. ==Bibliography== * Marisa Forcina, I diritti dell\u2019esistente : la filosofia della \"Encyclop\u00e9die nouvelle\" (1833-1847), Lecce: Milella, 1987. ==External links== * Sulle tracce di Descartes: l\u2019enciclopedia sintetica del XIX secolo; L\u2019Encyclop\u00e9die Nouvelle di Leroux e Reynaud (in Italian) Nouvelle (Leroux, 1939) Category:1834 non-fiction books Category:19th-century encyclopedias ",
