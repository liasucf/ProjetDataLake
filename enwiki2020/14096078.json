    "text": "Trent Reznor in 2008. This is a comprehensive discography of Trent Reznor, an American musician, singer, producer, and multi-instrumentalist most famous as the frontman and primary creative force behind the industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails. Reznor has also been associated with the bands Option 30, Exotic Birds, and Tapeworm, among others. Though the majority of material released from Reznor has been under the Nine Inch Nails moniker, some material has been credited to Reznor himself, including writing, production, instrumental performances, and vocal contributions. Reznor has also remixed songs for a number of artists, including David Bowie, N*E*R*D, Megadeth, and Queen. Trent has released three singles with his band, How to Destroy Angels. This band features the vocals of Mariqueen Maandig, Reznor's wife and former West Indian Girl frontwoman. Their first album was released as a free download via the band's website on June 1, 2010; with the single \"A Drowning\". This was Trent Reznor's first new material since his initial hiatus from Nine Inch Nails, which he later returned to. ==Soundtrack work== ===Films=== All music composed together with Atticus Ross, unless otherwise noted. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=\"33\" | Year ! width=\"300\"| Name ! width=\"500\"| Notes |- |align=\"center\"| 1997 | Lost Highway | Solo work, two compositions: \"Videodrones; Questions\" and \"Driver Down\" |- | align=\"center\"| 2010 |The Social Network | |- | align=\"center\"| 2011 |The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo | |- | align=\"center\"| 2013 | Sound City: Real to Reel | One song: \"Mantra\", with Dave Grohl and Josh Homme |- | align=\"center\"| 2014 |Gone Girl | |- | align=\"center\"| 2016 | Visions of Harmony (short film) | One composition: \"Juno\"; released as a single |- | align=\"center\"| 2016 | Before the Flood | Composed with Ross, Gustavo Santaolalla and Mogwai |- | align=\"center\"| 2016 | Patriots Day | |- | align=\"center\"| 2017 | The Black Ghiandola (short film) | Unreleased soundtrack |- | align=\"center\"| 2018 | Mid90s | |- | align=\"center\"| 2018 | Bird Box | |- | align=\"center\"| 2019 | Waves | |- | align=\"center\"| 2020 | Soul | |- | 2020 | Mank | |- |} ===Television=== All music composed together with Atticus Ross. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=\"33\" | Year ! width=\"300\"| Name ! width=\"500\"| Notes |- | align=\"center\"| 2017 | The Vietnam War | |- | align=\"center\"| 2018 | The Fourth Estate | Main title only; soundtrack remains unreleased (score by H.
