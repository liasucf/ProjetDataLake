    "text": "Slan\u00fd (; ) is a town in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 16,000 inhabitants. It is located about 25 km northwest of Prague. The town is part of the Prague metropolitan area. ==Administrative parts== The villages of Dol\u00edn, \u017delev\u010dice, Lotou\u0161, Blahotice, Netovice, Kv\u00edc, Kv\u00ed\u010dek, Trpom\u011bchy and Otruby are all administrative parts of Slan\u00fd. ==Geography== The town is situated in the Slan\u00fd Plain (the northwestern part of a geomorphologic whole called the Prague Plain). A creek called \u010cerven\u00fd potok (Red creek) flows through it from the southwest to the northeast. Its dominant feature is Sl\u00e1nsk\u00e1 Hill. ==History== The Bohemian Chronicle of V\u00e1clav H\u00e1jek records Slan\u00fd as having been founded in 750, at the site of a salt spring below Sl\u00e1nsk\u00e1 Hill (slan\u00fd is Czech for \"salty\"). The town grew as a result of its location on the trade route between Prague and Saxony. The Benedictines established a hospital here in 1136, together with a church dedicated to St. Gotthard. It was this large presence of the church, and the unconsolidated state of landed property that went with it, that allowed king Wenceslas II to charter Slan\u00fd as a town and give his royal assent to its Magdeburg rights only sometime in the decade after 1295. In 1348, an earthquake damaged the now-fortified town; in 1371, a large fire broke out, and the church had to be rebuilt. Slan\u00fd was captured by the Taborites in 1425 during the Hussite Wars, and remained in their hands until 1434. Not only did the Benedictine monks have to leave \u2014 this town by the hill was also one of Hussite holy cities, and their preachers expected it to survive the anticipated end of the world. Later, the Hussite king George of Pod\u011bbrady gave Slan\u00fd many privileges, after the town had supported his election to the throne. The town also participated in the Bohemian Revolt that opened the Thirty Years' War, housing the family of king Frederick V of the Palatinate. After the battle of White Mountain, that meant a defeat for the cause, the town suffered as a result of the ravages of war. Afterwards, the new Catholic possessors of Slan\u00fd, the Martinic, erected many a baroque church and edifice that, together with a new monastery, adorn the town to this day. Since the middle of the 19th century, Czech has been the dominant language there. Industrial development was delayed until around 1860. An important engineering factory was built in 1872 and more followed. A factory producing batteries was founded in 1918. The infrastructure and amenities of a modern town have been gradually added since the second half of the 19th century. ==Transport== The town of Slan\u00fd is situated at the crossing of the Prague \u2013 Louny, Prague \u2013 Karlovy Vary roads. The Prague \u2013 Most railway also goes through the town.
