Zorn's forceful undertaking is realized through the expert and passionate musicianship\".Layne, J. [ Allmusic Review] accessed March 16, 2009. Guy Peters stated \"Kristallnacht is an attempt at a musical recreation of one of the darkest chapters of the Nazi reign, with music ranging from fairly conventional roots music to extreme near-industrial chaos... Zorn has never aimed at major popularity, preferring total independence above all, and this is what makes an album like Kristallnacht possible... Luckily there are several tracks in which he finds a much more impressive and bearable balance between disturbing noise and affecting beauty, a combination that\u2019s characteristic of several of his releases. Or maybe it\u2019s about disturbing beauty and affecting noise, I\u2019m not entirely sure\".Peters, G.
