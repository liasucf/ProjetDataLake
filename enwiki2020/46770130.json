St Albans was within twenty miles of London, and had close connections, through its cells at Tynemouth, Belvoir, Binham and Wymondham, with the north, the midlands and East Anglia. Its guest-house served as a hotel for visitors from all over England and from abroad (in 1228 an Armenian archbishop, and in 1252 a group of Armenians, stayed in the abbey25). Henry III visited the abbey at least nine times before 1259.\" The first Armenian community in Britain was formed in Manchester in the 19th century.
