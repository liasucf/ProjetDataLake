To understand this culture, one has to have some idea of the history of this land, which again is different from that of other countries of the world. Starting from Lord Jagannath himself, history has it that he was a tribal deity, adorned by the Sabar people, as a symbol of Narayana. Another legend claims him to be Nilamadhava, an image of Narayana made of blue stone and worshipped by the aboriginals. He was brought to Nilagiri (blue mountain) or Nilachala and installed there as Shri Jagannath in company with Balabhadra and Subhadra. The images made of wood are also claimed to have their distant linkage with the aboriginal system of worshipping wooden poles. To cap it all the Daitapatis, who have a fair share of responsibilities to perform rituals of the Temple, are claimed to be descendants of the aboriginals or hill tribes of Orissa. So we may safely claim that the beginning of the cultural history of Shrikshetra is found in the fusion of Hindu and Tribal Cultures. This has been accepted as a facet of our proud heritage. The three deities came to be claimed as the symbols of Samyak Darshan, Samyak Jnana and Samyak Charita usually regarded as Triratha (of the Jain cult), an assimilation of which leads to Moksha (salvation) or the ultimate bliss... Jagannath is worshipped as Vishnu or Narayana or Krishna and Lord Balabhadra as Shesha. Simultaneously, the deities are regarded as the bhairava with Vimala (the devi or the consort of Shiva) installed in the campus of the temple. So ultimately we find a fusion of Saivism, Shaktism and Vaishnavism of the Hindu religion with Jainism and up to an extent Buddhism in the culture of Jagannath and the cultural tradition so reverently held together in Shrikshetra. ===About Char Dham=== The temple of Jagannath Puri is one of the holiest Hindu Char Dham (four divine sites) sites comprising Rameswaram, Badrinath, Puri and Dwarka.Chakravarti 1994, p. 140 Though the origins are not clearly known, the Advaita school of Hinduism propagated by Sankaracharya, who created Hindu monastic institutions across India, attributes the origin of Char Dham to the seer. The four monasteries lie across the four corners of India and their attendant temples are Badrinath Temple at Badrinath in the North, Jagannath Temple at Puri in the East, Dwarakadheesh Temple at Dwarka in the West and Ramanathaswamy Temple at Rameswaram in the South. Though ideologically the temples are divided between the sects of Hinduism, namely Saivism and Vaishnavism, the Char Dham pilgrimage is an all Hindu affair.Brockman 2011, pp. 94-96 There are four abodes in Himalayas called Chota Char Dham (Chota meaning small): Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri - all of these lie at the foot hills of Himalayas Gupta 2008, p. 484-486 The name Chota was added during the mid of 20th century to differentiate the original Char Dhams. The journey across the four cardinal points in India is considered sacred by Hindus who aspire to visit these temples once in their lifetime.last=Gwynne 2008, Section on Char Dham Traditionally the trip starts at the eastern end from Puri, proceeding in clockwise direction in a manner typically followed for circumambulation in Hindu temples. ==Structure== The huge temple complex covers an area of over , and is surrounded by a high fortified wall. The temple has four distinct sectional structures, namely - # Deula, Vimana or Garba griha (Sanctum sanctorum) where the triad deities are lodged on the ratnavedi (Throne of Pearls). In Rekha Deula style; # Mukhashala (Frontal porch); Among the existing temples in Nabha, the temple of Thakur Shri Saty Narayan Ji is the highest. The temple tower was built on a raised platform of stone and, rising to sky above the inner sanctum where the deities reside, dominates the surrounding landscape. The pyramidal roofs of the surrounding temples and adjoining halls, or mandapas, rise in steps toward the tower like a ridge of mountain peaks. ===Minor Temples=== There are numerous smaller temples and shrines within the Temple complex where active worship is regularly conducted. The Mata Naina Devi is considered one of the most important of the Shaktipeeths The temple of Hanuman has an important role. He is in Ramayan Rama, Hanuman and Eshaneshwara. ===The Mandapas=== There are many Mandapas or Pillared halls on raised platforms within the temple complex meant for religious congregations.

Shri Krishna Janamashtmi is the most important festival of the temple. Birthday of lord Krishna is celebrated at mid night. There are elaborate daily worship services. There are many festivals each year attended by hundreds of people. The most important festival is the Rath Yatra or the Chariot festival. This spectacular festival includes a procession of huge chariot bearing the idols of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra through the Devi Chowk meaning the Grand Avenue of Nabha till their final destination the Saty Narayan Ji Temple. Early European observers told tales of devotees being crushed under the wheels of this chariot, whether by accident or even as a form of meritorious suicide akin to suttee. These reports gave rise to the loan word juggernaut suggesting an immense, unstoppable, threatening entity or process operated by fanatics. Many festivals, There are special ceremonies in the month of Kartika. ===Rath Yatra at Saty Narayan Mandir, Nabha=== Jagannath Ratha Yatra, Nabha The Jagannath triad are usually worshiped in the sanctum of the temple at Puri, but Shri Saty Narayan Ji Mandir Commi tee once during the year (usually falling in month of August or September), they are brought Jagannath out onto the Devi Chowk (main street of Nabha) and travel to the Shri Saty Narayan Ji, Temple in huge chariot (ratha), allowing the public to have dar\u015bana (Holy view). This festival is known as Ratha Yatra, meaning the journey (yatra) of the chariot (ratha). The Ratha is huge wheeled wooden structure, which is built anew every year and are pulled by the devotees. The chariot for Jagannath is approximately 20 feet high and 15 feet square and takes about 1 week to construct. The Committee Members, artists and painters of Nabha, Dhuri decorate the car and paint flower petals and other designs on the wheels, the wood-carved charioteer and horses, and the inverted lotuses on the wall behind the throne. The huge chariot of Jagannath pulled during Rath Yatra is the etymological origin of the English word Juggernaut. The Ratha-Yatra is also termed as the Shri Gundicha yatra. Prabhu Hari Kishore Joshi Holdin Lord Jagannath The most significant ritual associated with the Ratha-Yatra is the chhera pahara. During the festival, people wears the outfit of a sweeper and sweeps all around the deities and chariot in the Chera Pahara (sweeping with water) ritual. King cleanses the road before the chariots with a gold-handled broom and sprinkles sandalwood water and powder with utmost devotion. As per the custom, although the King has been considered the most exalted person in the kingdom, he still renders the menial service to Jagannath. This ritual signified that under the lordship of Jagannath, there is no distinction between the powerful sovereign King and the most humble devotee. Jagannath Katha is held on Seven days before, on the first day of the Ratha Yatra, the last day of the festival, when the deities are ceremoniously brought back to the Shri Mandir.

Moreover, Starza notes that the ruling Ganga dynasty instituted the Rath Yatra at the completion of the great temple around 1150 AD. This festival was one of those Hindu festivals that was reported to the Western world very early. Friar Odoric of Pordenone visited India in 1316-1318, some 20 years after Marco Polo had dictated the account of his travels while in a Genoese prison. In his own account of 1321, Odoric reported how the people put the \"idols\" on chariots, and the King and Queen and all the people drew them from the \"church\" with song and music. ===Snana Purnima=== On the Purnima of the month of Jyestha the Gods are ceremonially bathed and decorated every year on the occasion of Snana Yatra. ===Chandrayan Vrat or Purnima=== Chandrayan Vrat in Punjab is commonly known as Purnima Vrat, but it\u2019s not purnima vrat.
