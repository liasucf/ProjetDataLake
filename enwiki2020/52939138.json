    "text": "FlyQuest is a professional esports organization based in the United States that was founded on January 6, 2017. It is owned by Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Wesley Edens and Fortress Investment Group. FlyQuest was originally founded after the acquisition of the League of Legends roster of Cloud9 Challenger, which was the sister team of the Cloud9 organization. Cloud9 Challenger qualified for the North American League Championship Series in August 2016, alongside the main Cloud9 roster. LCS rules forbid an organization from owning multiple teams in the same league, so the team was sold to its current owners and rebranded to FlyQuest, with the team roster unchanged. == League of Legends == === Rosters === ==== LCS team ==== ==== Academy team ==== === Tournament results === {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible mw- collapsed\" !

This roster played in RLCS Season 4, finishing sixth in the regular season and missing out on a LAN spot after a 4-0 loss to Ghost Gaming in the regional playoffs. In the offseason between Seasons 4 and 5, Flyquest dropped their first roster and picked up the Ambition Esports roster. This team finished first in RLRS league play for Season 5, earning them a spot in the promotional playoffs. They went on to defeat Out of Style and Counter Logic Gaming in the playoffs, earning them a spot in the RLCS for Season 6. FlyQuest finished fifth in league play, but again missed out on a LAN spot after losing to NRG in the regional playoffs. In December 2018, FlyQuest announced that they would be dropping their Rocket League roster, with AyyJayy and Wonder being transferred to Rogue and Pluto staying with the organization as a content creator. === Former roster === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! !
