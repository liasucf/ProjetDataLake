He shoots Miller to end his misery. Haunted by the experience, Willard loses his faith in God. After the war, on his way home to Coal Creek, West Virginia, Willard passes through Meade, Ohio, where he meets Charlotte, a waitress at a diner. Willard and Charlotte marry and move to Knockemstiff, Ohio, where they have a child named Arvin. In 1950, Helen Hatton, a neighbor of Willard's family, marries the disturbingly charismatic evangelical preacher Roy Laferty, who pours live spiders over his body during his sermons. They have a child named Lenora. Roy is bitten by a spider on his face and has a severe allergic reaction that affects his grip on reality. Believing that he can resurrect the dead, he takes Helen out into the woods, kills her and tries to resurrect her, but fails. After realizing his actions, he abandons his crippled brother Theodore and tries to return home to Lenora. Roy hitchhikes and gets a ride with a pair of married serial killers, Carl Henderson and his wife Sandy. Their ritual involves picking up male hitchhikers, encouraging them to have sex with Sandy while Carl takes photographs, and then murdering them. Carl murders Roy by shooting him in the head after he refuses to have sex with Sandy. In 1957, Charlotte is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Willard believes that if he prays fervently enough he can influence God to save her life. He obsessively and strenuously prays to God, kneeling before a rustic cross he had erected in the woods behind his house. Despite going so far as to crucify Arvin's dog as a sacrifice, Charlotte dies. Willard commits suicide by slitting his own throat. Now an orphan, Arvin goes to live with his grandmother and his uncle in Coal Creek. At his new home, Arvin meets his adopted \"step-sister\", Lenora Russell. In 1965, Arvin is given his father's Luger pistol as a birthday present. The church has a new preacher, Reverend Preston Teagarden. Some bullies have been harassing Lenora, and Arvin confronts and savagely beats them. Preston takes advantage of Lenora's innocence and then tricks her into having sex with him, resulting in her becoming pregnant. She tells Preston, but he refuses to help and calls her a whore. Not wanting to bring shame to the family, she is about to commit suicide by hanging before realizing she and her baby would be fine. However, she slips, accidentally hanging herself. Arvin is told that she was pregnant and suspects that Preston was the father. He follows Preston and sees him seduce and have sex with another girl. At the church, Arvin confronts Preston and kills him with the Luger before fleeing in his truck. Arvin hitchhikes and is picked up by Carl and Sandy. When Carl tries to make a move on Arvin, Arvin shoots him in the chest. Sandy and Arvin then shoot each other at the same time, but Carl had earlier loaded Sandy's gun with blanks, feeling he couldn't trust her. Sandy dies, and Arvin finds a fetish collection in the car's glove box consisting of a picture of Sandy holding Roy's dead body and rolls of film. Sandy's brother Lee Bodecker, Meade's corrupt sheriff, learns about Sandy's murder, and to protect himself and his reelection campaign, goes to Carl and Sandy's apartment and finds and burns all of Carl's photos and any other incriminating evidence. Arvin goes to Meade to visit his childhood home. Sheriff Bodecker learns that Arvin murdered Preston from the Coal Creek sheriff and decides to kill him. They confront each other in the woods where Willard's rustic cross resides, where Arvin is able to get off a single shot that fatally wounds the sheriff. Before he dies, Arvin confronts Sheriff Bodecker with the picture of Sandy posing with Roy's dead body. Arvin plants the film and photos on Bodecker's corpse to expose Carl's crimes. Before fleeing from the scene, Arvin buries the Luger with his dog's remains. Arvin hitchhikes and is picked up by a hippie driving a VW van. As he is riding in a car with a stranger, he tries very hard not to fall asleep. The film ends with him daydreaming and contemplating his future as possibly a husband or as a soldier in the Vietnam War. ==Cast== * Donald Ray Pollock as The Narrator * Tom Holland as Arvin Eugene Russell, Willard and Charlotte's son who grows into a troubled, violent young man. ** Michael Banks Repeta as 9-year-old Arvin Russell * Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as Willard Russell, Arvin's father, Charlotte's husband, and Emma's son, haunted by his experience serving in World War II. * Robert Pattinson as Reverend Preston Teagardin, a charismatic but morally corrupt preacher who seduces and abandons Lenora when she becomes pregnant. * Sebastian Stan as Sheriff Lee Bodecker, Sandy's brother, a dirty cop who is both protective of his sister and willing to do anything to protect his position. * Riley Keough as Sandy Henderson, Carl's wife and Lee's younger sister.

The website's critics consensus reads, \"The Devil All the Times descent into darkness can be harrowing to the point of punishment, but it's offset by strong work from a stellar cast.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\" The Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips wrote, \"It's easy on the eyes... worth seeing for an intriguingly cast ensemble, authenticating the milieu as much as possible. Holland's terrific, taking in each new setback in [his character's] life without revealing the full extent of the damage.\" Ryan Lattanzio of IndieWire gave the film a \"C\u2013\" and called it \"colossal misfire, a sweaty mess from start to finish,\" although he praised Holland and Pattinson's performances. Owen Gleiberman of Variety said that \"it's hard to imagine how a movie with this much sordid crime and violence could be this rote\" and wrote \"The Devil All the Time shows us a lot of bad behavior, but the movie isn't really interested in what makes the sinners tick. And without that lurid curiosity, it's just a series of Sunday School lessons: a noir that wants to scrub away the darkness.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:2020 films Category:2020 psychological thriller films Category:American films Category:American psychological thriller films Category:English-language Netflix original films Category:Films about child abuse Category:Films about psychopaths Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films critical of religion Category:Films directed by Antonio Campos Category:Films set in 1945 Category:Films set in 1950 Category:Films set in 1957 Category:Films set in 1965 Category:Films set in Ohio Category:Films shot in Alabama ",
