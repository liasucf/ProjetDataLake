This district is named after Saifullah Khan, who was from the Mirdadzai (Khoidadzai) tribe of Kakar Sunzerkhail. He was the great grandson of Zarh Nikka (Faiz Ullah Akhunzada), a renowned religious scholar of the region. ==Historical background== Saifullah khan The British sent its Zhob Expedition in 1884 in order to occupy the Zhob region through Baratkhail. Meanwhile, the castles of Saifullah Khan Khoidadzai and Shah Jehan Jogezai (Badshah of Zhob) were demolished. On 7 October 1884, an assault on the Qalla (castle) of Shah Jehan near Akhterzai resulted the killings of many tribal people including Malik Hamza Daulatzai and Mohammad Ghous who fought bravely. All 500 tribal Sardars admitted their submission before the British forces and also signed an agreement that they will not interfere in the affairs of British Government in Zhob region except Saifullah Khan Khoidadzai and Shah Jehan Jogezai who had a narrow escape from the battle scene and established themselves at Kalat; where they used to operate their insurgency campaign against the British and never subdued before the British occupying forces.Zhob Gazetteer, Volume 2, Zhob and Pashtoon & Angrazi Isthamaar by Ulasyaar Early in the 13th century the country came within the sphere of the raids organised by Genghis Khan, the Mongol. In 1398 AD, an expedition against the Afghans of the area was led by Pir Muhammad, grandson of Amir Timur. Although no authentic information exist about any foreign occupation, many forts, mounds and karezes are attributed to the Mughals. Both Nadir Shah (reigned 1736\u201347) and Ahmed Shah (reigned 1747\u201373) extended their power through Balochistan and thenceforth Zhob remained under the more or less nominal suzerainty of the Durranis and Barakzais until it came under British protection. In the middle of the 18th century Ahmed Shah granted a sanad (certificate) to Bekar Nika, fourth in descent from Jogi and the head of the Jogezai family, conferring upon him the title and position of \"Badshah or Ruler of Zhob\". Shah Jehan Jogezai was conferred as Badshah of Zhob. The descendants of Shah Jehan Jogezai used to live in Loralai District of Balochistan. ==Administration== The district is administratively subdivided into the following tehsils:Tehsils & Unions in the District of Killa Saifullah - Government of Pakistan * Killa Saifullah * Muslim Bagh At present the district is divided into two sub-divisions: Qilla Saifullah and Muslim Bagh.
