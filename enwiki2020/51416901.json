    "text": "George Mukabi (1930\u20131963) was a folk musician from Kenya, and was one of the first recording musicians in the country. In his short musical career he recorded less than 30 songs. He was influenced by \"Nyasa\" Malawian bands and set out to play similar music in the finger-picking style. His playing was massively popular and influential, affecting urban players like John Mwale, and created what became sukuti music, popular among western Kenya's traditional people. He was killed when an argument with his wife's family got out of hand. ==References== Category:1930 births Category:1963 deaths Category:Kenyan musicians Category:People from Kakamega Category:Kenyan guitarists Category:20th-century guitarists ",
