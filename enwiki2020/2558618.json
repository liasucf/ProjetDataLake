    "text": "Logan-Cache Airport is three miles northwest of Logan in Cache County, Utah. It is owned under the Logan-Cache Airport Authority formed by Inter-local Agreement between Cache County and Logan City in 1992. The airport was previously owned by Cache County and managed by county commissioners. This organization is subsidized by the city and county, having no authority to tax or bond for additional funding. Revenues are derived from leases of land, buildings, fuel and maintenance fees. ==History & Services== Western Airlines served Logan from 1946 until West Coast Airlines replaced them in 1959; West Coast pulled out in 1964. Key Airlines served the airport from Salt Lake City from 1964 to 1976. In that year, Utah carrier Transwestern Airlines had its company headquartered at the airport, with flights to their hub at Salt Lake City, until its acquisition by Horizon Air in December 1983. Currently, scheduled services come from Ameriflight and Gem Air under contract for UPS and FedEx Express, transporting from several nearby states. Frequent charter flights occur on behalf of Utah State University's athletic teams and their opponents. Utah State also occupies several hangars on the north end of the airport access road for its fixed-wing and rotorcraft training programs, and operates the dispatch office in the main passenger terminal. The airport also hosts Leading Edge Aviation, which offers flight training, FBO services, and a pilot supply shop. There are also several independent CFIs based at the airport. == Facilities == The Logan-Cache Airport covers and has two runways: * 17/35: 9,010 x 100 ft.
