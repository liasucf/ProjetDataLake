    "text": "Scaphites is a genus of heteromorph ammonites belonging to the Scaphitidae family. They were a widespread genus that thrived during the Late Cretaceous period; they have a possible fossil record during the Paleocene (as recent as c.61 Ma) in the Southern United States and Turkmenistan. ==Morphology== Scaphites generally have a chambered, boat-shaped shell. The initial part (juvenile stage) of the shell is generally more or less involute (tightly- coiled) and compressed, giving no hint of the heteromorphic shell form yet to come. The terminal part (adult stage) is much shorter, erect, and bends over the older shell like a hook. They have transverse, branching ribs with tubercles (small bumps) along the venter. Suture pattern of ScaphitesReconstructions of the body within the shell can be made to portray Scaphites as either a benthic (bottom-dwelling) or planktonic animal, depending on where the center of gravity is located. Since useful fossils of the soft-body parts of cephalopods are highly rare, little is known about how this animal actually fit into its shell and lived its life. ==Age== Because Scaphites and its relatives in Superfamily Scaphitoidea are restricted to certain ages of the Cretaceous (ca. 144 to 66.4 million years ago), they are useful in some areas as an index fossil. A notable example is the Late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway in North America, in which several endemic lineages of scaphite species evolved and now serve as the basis for a highly resolved regional biostratigraphy. == Species == * Scaphites binneyi \u2020 Reeside, 1927 * Scaphites carlilensis \u2020 Morrow, 1935 * Scaphites depressus \u2020 Reeside, 1927 * Scaphites ferronensis \u2020 Cobban, 1951 * Scaphites frontierensis \u2020 Cobban, 1951 * Scaphites hippocrepis \u2020 DeKay, 1827 * Scaphites impendicostatus \u2020 Cobban, 1951 * Scaphites leei \u2020 Reeside, 1927 * Scaphites nanus \u2020 Reeside, 1927 * Scaphites nodosus \u2020 * Scaphites obliquus \u2020 J.
