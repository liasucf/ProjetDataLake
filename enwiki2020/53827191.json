    "text": "Colette Roy-Laroche (born August 2, 1943) is a Canadian former politician, who served as mayor of Lac-M\u00e9gantic, Quebec from 2002 to 2015.\"Lac-M\u00e9gantic mayor praised for efforts to unite town after devastating rail disaster\". National Post, July 25, 2013. She is best known for her handling of the 2013 Lac- M\u00e9gantic rail disaster, which earned her the affectionate nickname \"The Granite Lady\" for her unflappable strength.\"Lac-M\u00e9gantic: \u2018We are all together,\u2019 Granite Lady says\". Montreal Gazette, September 26, 2013. Born and raised in the nearby town of Sainte-C\u00e9cile-de-Whitton, she moved to Lac- M\u00e9gantic at age 17.\"Roy-Laroche more m\u00e8re than mayor; Right from the beginning, veteran politician let the town know that she had things under control\". Montreal Gazette, August 19, 2013. After a brief marriage to a husband who died of cancer at a young age, she remarried in her 20s to Yvan Laroche, an officer with the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec. A teacher by career, she rose to become director of the town's school board before being elected mayor in 2002. Earlier in 2013, Roy-Laroche had announced that she would not run for another term in the 2013 municipal elections. Following the rail disaster, however, the incumbent council's term in office was extended two years so that the town would not have to cope with an election in the middle of the tragedy and its aftermath.\"Council extends mandate of popular mayor\". Montreal Gazette, July 15, 2013. She earned the \"Granite Lady\" designation in part for her adamant refusal to permit the railway line on which the accident occurred to be rebuilt on its existing path through the downtown core. At least one observer, a Haitian immigrant living in Montreal, praised her as having been more visible and active throughout the crisis than Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val had been following the 2010 Haiti earthquake. By August 14, just over one month after the accident, the town had preliminary plans in place to rebuild the destroyed downtown.\"Lac-Megantic forges bold plan to relocate downtown\". The Globe and Mail, August 14, 2013. For her own part, Roy-Laroche downplayed the praise, telling the media that \"I am just doing what any mayor would do when faced with disaster. I'm the mayor of a little city of 6,000 people that has to deal with what they're calling the biggest train accident in Canadian history. I was head of the school board, I had to deal with angry parents. That was nothing. I am in great health, I have a lot of energy. My advice is, keep your health, stay in harmony with your family.\"\"Made of strong stuff - they have to be\". National Post, July 13, 2013. In December, when the provincial government of Quebec organized a special ceremony to present the first responders in the disaster with a medal of honour for their service and bravery, Roy-Laroche herself was also named as an honoree.\"First reponders, mayor honoured\". The Globe and Mail, December 9, 2013. Through 2014 and 2015, Roy-Laroche took on a public role as an advocate for improved rail safety.\"'It's time to demand changes,' Lac-Megantic mayor says\". Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, August 20, 2014. In March 2014, she travelled to Washington, DC as part of a delegation lobbying the United States Congress to improve American rail safety regulations.\"Lac-Megantic mayor pushes rail safety during trip to Washington\". Calgary Herald, March 11, 2014. Later in 2014, she spoke more openly to the media about the disaster's personal impact on her; the deceased had included two of her cousins, and had she been able to babysit her grandchildren on the night of the derailment, her own son would have been at the Musi-Caf\u00e9 as well.\"Mayor bares soul about rail tragedy; Leader lost two cousins in derailment but urges fellow citizens 'to move forward'. Halifax Chronicle- Herald, July 2, 2014. As the special election approached in 2015, Roy-Laroche announced that she would not run for another term as mayor, reconfirming her original announcement of her intention to retire in 2013.\"Lac-Megantic mayor will not run this fall\". Calgary Herald, August 21, 2015. Following the special election in November, she was succeeded as mayor by Jean-Guy Cloutier.\"Jean-Guy Cloutier elected mayor of Lac-M\u00e9gantic succeeding Colette Roy-Laroche\".
