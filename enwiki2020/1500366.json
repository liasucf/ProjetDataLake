    "text": "Chuck-A-Rama is a chain of buffet restaurants based in Salt Lake City, Utah; as of October 2016, the company operates ten restaurants in Utah and two in Idaho. Fare includes American comfort food. Main entr\u00e9es include meats such as baked and fried chicken, carved turkey, ham, and roast beef, and mashed potatoes and gravy, among others. A salad bar is included with every meal and a rotating variety of soups are provided. ==Name== The company's name was devised by Don Moss, and is a portmanteau of the word \"chuckwagon\" and the term \"Scout-O-Rama\". ==Controversy== In 2004 Chuck-A-Rama gained national attention when, at its Taylorsville, Utah location, a couple following the Atkins diet were kicked out for trying to go back to the carved roast beef twelve times. The chain stated that, although they are a buffet, they are not an all-you-can-eat restaurant. However, the owners of Chuck-a-rama revised that statement and apologized to the couple. ==See also== * List of buffet restaurants * List of Utah companies ==References== ==External links== * Category:1966 establishments in Utah Category:Companies based in Salt Lake City Category:Buffet restaurants Category:Restaurants established in 1966 Category:Restaurants in Utah Category:Utah cuisine ",
