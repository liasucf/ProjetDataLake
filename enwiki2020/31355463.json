    "text": "Dennis Chin (born 4 June 1987) is a Jamaican professional footballer who plays as a forward. ==Club career== ===Youth and college=== Chin was born in Kingston, Jamaica to a Jamaican mother and a Chinese Jamaican father. He moved to the US when he was ten and attended Oviedo High School, before playing college soccer at Rollins College from 2005 through 2007. He scored 7 goals and 3 assists in each of his junior and senior years (2006 and 2007). During his time at Rollins, he also played for the Central Florida Kraze of the USL Premier Development League from 2005 to 2010. ===Orlando City=== Chin playing for Orlando City in 2014 Chin turned professional when he signed with Orlando City of the USL Professional Division in 2011. He made his professional debut on 14 May 2011, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 1\u20130 win over the Pittsburgh Riverhounds. He then scored a goal and provided two assists in their first round match in the 2011 Lamar Hunt US Open Cup, in a 4\u20130 win over ASC New Stars. After spending the early portion of the 2011 season learning Orlando City Head Coach Adrian Heath's system, Chin came alive in the later part of the campaign and became known as the super-sub. As a result, the speedster ended his rookie season with four goals, two of which came during the Lions' memorable three-game playoff run, which saw the club secure its first USL PRO Championship. In December 2011, Orlando signed Chin to a contract extension through the 2014 season. Moving into his second season, Chin's confident play towards the end of his rookie year certainly carried over into his second term with the club. Dennis transitioned from his super- sub role, held in year one, to become the primary goal-scorer for the Lions. Chin's first goal came just three minutes into their first game of the season against the Charlotte Eagles, and would set the tone for the kind of year he was about to embark on. All season long, Chin's pace and finishing ability caused problems for opposing teams' back lines and led to the striker scoring 11 goals during league play, which was a team record. Those 11 goals were also good for best in the league and saw Chin finish as Top Goal Scorer and Scoring Champion (27 points) of the USL Pro in only his second season as a professional. In addition, Chin also notched three assists during league play and also scored in the Lamar Hunt US Open Cup against Major League Soccer club Sporting Kansas City. Chin's impressive play led to the Oviedo native being named to the USL Pro All-League first team, while also being nominated for USL Pro Most Valuable Player (MVP) and Central Florida Athlete of the Year. Dennis also accepted invitations to train with MLS sides Chicago Fire and D.C. United during the 2012 off-season. In his third year with Orlando City, Chin was once again an integral part of the Lions' Championship run. After notching five goals and five assists in the regular season, Chin was lethal in the playoffs and recorded four goals and three assists, in three games played, leading the USL Pro playoffs in both categories. Two of those four goals were scored in the USL Pro Championship match and helped Orlando City secure its second USL Pro title, after being upset by the Wilmington Hammerheads in the year prior. He was released upon the conclusion of the 2014 season, a casualty of the club's transition to Major League Soccer. ===Arizona United=== After exploring some opportunities in Europe, Chin ultimately signed with another USL team, Arizona United SC. He ended up scoring in the first two matches of 2015. ===Ottawa Fury=== In December 2015, Chin signed with Canadian NASL club Ottawa Fury FC. He scored one goal for Ottawa in 17 appearances in all competitions, including seven starts. ===Ironi Nesher=== On August 26, 2016 he was transferred to recently promoted Israeli second division club Ironi Nesher. ===Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC=== On February 23, 2018, Chin joined the Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC of the United Soccer League. ===Richmond Kickers=== On January 7, 2019, Chin joined the Richmond Kickers of the USL League One.https://www.richmondkickers.com/news_article/show/982649 ==Personal life== Chin's great grandparents came from Guangdong, China and they are Hakka. His last name Chin in Chinese is \u9648 (Chen). ==Honours== ===Orlando City=== * USL Pro Championship 2011 * USL Pro Commissioner's Cup 2011 * USL Pro Commissioner's Cup 2012 * USL Pro Top Goal Scorer 2012 * USL Pro Scoring Champion 2012 * USL Pro First Team All-League 2012 * USL Pro MVP Candidate 2012 * Central Florida Athlete of the Year Nominee 2012 * USL Pro Championship 2013 * USL Pro Commissioner's Cup 2014 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Jamaican footballers Category:Jamaican expatriate footballers Category:Jamaican people of Chinese descent Category:Jamaican people of Hakka descent Category:African-American people Category:American people of Hakka descent Category:Association football forwards Category:Expatriate footballers in Israel Category:Expatriate soccer players in Canada Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States Category:Hakka sportspeople Category:Ironi Nesher F.C. players Category:North American Soccer League players Category:Orlando City SC (2010\u20132014) players Category:Orlando City U-23 players Category:Ottawa Fury FC players Category:Phoenix Rising FC players Category:Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC players Category:Richmond Kickers players Category:Rollins College alumni Category:Rollins Tars men's soccer players Category:San Antonio Scorpions players Category:Soccer players from Florida Category:USL League One players Category:USL League Two players ",
