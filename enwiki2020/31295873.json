Each team consisted of four members \u2013 three men and one woman \u2013 with no weight categories, although fights were same-sex only (e.g. women faced women, men faced men). There were thirteen teams from two continents (Europe and North America) taking part in the competition and each of the matches was four rounds of one minute each (each fighter on a team fought one round against the opposing team, with the women fighting last), fought under Semi-Contact rules. Due to there not being enough teams for a tournament designed for sixteen, three of the teams had byes through to the quarter finals. The tournament gold medallists were Team Great Britain who defeated Team Hungary in the final by points decision. Team USA and Team Germany occupied the bronze medal spots. ==Results== ===Key=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Abbreviation !
