    "text": "Todd Haley (born February 28, 1967) is an American football coach who is the offensive coordinator for the Riverview High School football team. From 1997 to 2006, he had stints as the wide receivers coach of the New York Jets, Chicago Bears, and Dallas Cowboys. He served as the offensive coordinator of the Arizona Cardinals from 2007 to 2008, the head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs from 2009 to 2011, the offensive coordinator of the Pittsburgh Steelers from 2012 to 2017, and the offensive coordinator of the Cleveland Browns in 2018, but he was fired in Week 8 of his first season with the team following a loss to his previous team, the Pittsburgh Steelers. ==Early years== Haley was born on February 28, 1967, in Atlanta, Georgia He is the son of Dick Haley, formerly Director of Player Personnel for the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Jets and also a former NFL cornerback. As a youth, Haley was a ball boy for the Steelers and attended Steelers training camps with his father. Alongside his father, Haley would watch the Steelers' game and practice film. While his family was located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for his father's profession, Haley attended Upper St. Clair High School. He went on to attend the University of Florida and University of Miami, playing on the two schools' respective golf squads. Haley graduated from the University of North Florida in 1991 with a bachelor's degree in communication. ==Coaching career== ===New York Jets=== Haley was hired by the New York Jets in 1995 and served as an assistant in the scouting department for two seasons. At the time, Haley's father Dick was working with the Jets as Director of Player Personnel. In 1997, he was promoted to offensive assistant/quality control coach and worked closely with then-offensive coordinator Charlie Weis. From 1999 to 2000 Haley was the Jets' wide receivers coach, helping Keyshawn Johnson make his second Pro Bowl appearance. During his tenure with the Jets, Haley began his association with Scott Pioli, who served as Director of Pro Personnel for the Jets from 1997 to 1999. Pioli later became the general manager of the Kansas City Chiefs and hired Haley as the team's head coach in 2009. ===Chicago Bears=== In 2001, Haley joined the Chicago Bears as wide receivers coach and served in the position until 2003. ===Dallas Cowboys=== From 2004 to 2006, Haley was the wide receivers coach and passing game coordinator for the Dallas Cowboys. Haley helped develop quarterback Tony Romo and the Cowboys' passing offense, which centered around wide receivers Terry Glenn and Terrell Owens. ===Arizona Cardinals=== In 2007, Haley joined Ken Whisenhunt's coaching staff for the Arizona Cardinals as the team's offensive coordinator. Haley did not start calling plays for the Cardinals until late in the season. The Cardinals finished in the top half of the NFL in multiple offensive categories. Under Haley\u2019s guidance, the Cardinals offense in 2008 was one of the league\u2019s most innovative and explosive units. Arizona tied for third in the league in scoring, registering a franchise-record 427 points (26.7 ppg). The Cardinals were fourth in total offense, averaging 365.8 yards per game. Arizona was second in the league in passing offense (292.1 ypg) and ranked sixth in the NFL with 20.5 first downs per game. The Cardinals finished the season with a 9\u20137 record and a playoff berth after winning the NFC West Division title. The Cardinals went on to appear in their first Super Bowl in franchise history after the team scored more than 30 points in each of its three playoff games. In Super Bowl XLIII, the Cardinals offense played the NFL's top-ranked Pittsburgh Steelers defense. Trailing 17-7 at halftime, the Cardinals offense fought back after a 13-point deficit and led the game 23-20 with just over two minutes remaining. The Cardinals lost 27-23 in the game's final seconds. ===Kansas City Chiefs=== On December 14, 2008, a last-minute loss to the San Diego Chargers led longtime Kansas City Chiefs General Manager Carl Peterson to abruptly announce his resignation the following day. This paved the way toward the hiring of General Manager Scott Pioli on January 13, 2009. The decision to hire Pioli led to speculation that Herman Edwards, who had been serving as the Chiefs' head coach since 2006, was not likely to return for 2009. Edwards was fired on January 23, just five days after the Arizona Cardinals defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship Game. Leading up to Super Bowl XLIII, Haley was repeatedly questioned about Kansas City and the possibilities of joining his former colleague Pioli. Haley would later say that it was the day after the Super Bowl, which the Cardinals lost, that he heard his name mentioned for the Chiefs' coaching position. In the days after the Cardinals' appearance in Super Bowl XLIII, Haley was offered the head coaching position of the Chiefs. Haley accepted the position on February 6, 2009, and signed a four-year contract. For his first coaching staff, Haley hired Joel Collier, Gary Gibbs, Steve Hoffman, Bill Muir, Clancy Pendergast, Pat Perles, and Dedric Ward to unspecified positions on the Chiefs' 2009 coaching staff and retained Bob Bicknell, Joe D\u2019Alessandris, Chan Gailey, Tim Krumrie, Brent Salazar, and Cedric Smith from Herm Edwards' staff. Ward and Pendergast had previously served on the Cardinals' coaching staff with Haley. Initially there were doubts as to whether Chan Gailey would be retained under Haley's coaching staff, because Haley had just concluded a successful stint as offensive coordinator at Arizona. Haley initially expressed satisfaction in working with Gailey, saying, \"The more I work with the guy, the more I like him...\" However, after the Chiefs lost their first three pre-season games partially due to an abysmal offensive performance, Haley reportedly refused to bow to Gailey's suggestion to once again install a spread offense similar to the one installed midway through the 2008 season. Gailey was relieved of duties and Haley assumed offensive play-calling duties throughout the rest of the season. The Chiefs lost their first five games under Haley in 2009. Haley won his first game as the Chiefs' head coach on October 18, 2009 beating the Washington Redskins 14\u20136. In late October 2009 the Chiefs suspended starting running back Larry Johnson for one week in response to his public comments on Twitter where he questioned Haley's coaching abilities and for using homophobic slurs when he addressed the media. Johnson's Twitter comments were: \"My father got more creditentials than most of these pro coaches\" [Sic]. That was followed by: \"My father played for the coach from \"Remember the Titans\". Our coach played golf. My father played for the Redskins briefly. Our coach. Nuthin.\" [Sic]espn When Johnson returned from his suspension, he was released. After Haley released Johnson, he led the Chiefs to their first two-game winning streak since the 2007 season with victories against the Oakland Raiders and Pittsburgh Steelers on November 15 and 22. The 27\u201324 victory over the Steelers\u2014the defending Super Bowl champions\u2014came in overtime. The Chiefs ended their season with a victory against the Denver Broncos who were looking to clinch a Wild-Card playoff berth with a win. This was the first Kansas City win at Denver since 2000 and their first victory at Invesco Field at Mile High which opened in 2001. This concluded the Chiefs season with a 4\u201312 record, a two-win improvement from 2008. In Haley's second season, the Chiefs won their first three games, including the season opener on Monday Night Football against the San Diego Chargers, and were the last undefeated team remaining in the NFL before losing at Indianapolis in Week 5. Kansas City went on to win the AFC West for the first time since 2003. On January 9, 2011, the Chiefs played the Baltimore Ravens at Arrowhead Stadium. The Chiefs lost the game 30\u20137 with Matt Cassel passing for 70 yards and 3 interceptions. The only touchdown was a 41-yard touchdown run by Jamaal Charles. On September 2, 2011, Haley elected to play his starters against the Green Bay Packers in the final preseason game of the year. Tight end Tony Moeaki, a crucial piece of the team's 2011 offensive plans, injured his knee at the beginning of the second quarter and was ruled out for the remainder of the season. In a game played mostly by the Chiefs starters and the Packers' backups, the Chiefs lost, 20\u201319, leading many to question Haley's decision to use his best players late into the game. Despite having lost several key players to injuries, on October 31, 2011, Haley led The Chiefs to a come-from-behind victory on Monday Night Football. The win was KC's fourth in a row, which moved them into first place in the AFC West. It marked the first time in NFL history that a team which started 0\u20133 was leading its division by the halfway point of the season. Chiefs starting quarterback Matt Cassel broke his hand during a week 11 game vs. the Denver Broncos. He was replaced by Tyler Palko, and had surgery on the injured hand on November 14. On November 21, Cassel was placed on injured reserve, ending his season. Palko proved to be inadequate as a backup to a merely serviceable Cassel, leading many to question how a team with legitimate playoff hopes entering the 2011 season had remained so thin at so many key positions during the off- season, especially at quarterback and safety, where the Chiefs' lack of depth was more than woeful. Haley was fired on December 12, 2011, after leading his team to a 5\u20138 record during the 2011 NFL season. The 2011 season began with three losses, including two blow-outs to Detroit and Buffalo. The team appeared to regroup, winning four straight games, before losing the next 5 of 6, including a complete team collapse in Haley's final game against the New York Jets. Late in that game Haley was flagged for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, allowing the Jets to complete a touchdown drive that ultimately put the game out of reach. After the loss, defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel was promoted to replace Haley.http://www.kansascity.com/2012/11/02/3897097/sam- mellinger-hold-your-nose-when.html ===Pittsburgh Steelers=== On February 13, 2012, the Steelers announced that Haley would be the team's new offensive coordinator. Haley grew up in the Pittsburgh suburb of Upper Saint Clair, Pennsylvania, and his father was the Steelers' former personnel director. He was the first offensive coordinator in 13 years to be hired from outside the organization. On January 17, 2018, the Steelers announced that Haley's contract, which had expired at the conclusion of the 2017 season, would not be renewed. ===Cleveland Browns=== On January 22, 2018, Haley was hired by the Cleveland Browns as their offensive coordinator. On October 29, 2018, Haley was fired along with head coach Hue Jackson. ===Riverview High School=== On February 14, 2020, Haley was hired as the offensive coordinator for the Riverview Rams in Sarasota, Florida. ===Coaching style=== Haley has been described as an aggressive coach and can be combative with players. During the 2008 NFC Championship Game against the Eagles, he had a first-half argument with quarterback Kurt Warner, then a short blowup in full view of television cameras with wide receiver Anquan Boldin later in the game. He also had a spat with Terrell Owens when he was the wide receivers coach in Dallas. Defending his style, Haley said \"It's part of how I coach... It's part of how I motivate, and I like to think I've had some success doing it.\" ==Personal life== Haley has five children with his wife, Chrissy. In 2006, Haley filed a 1.5 million-dollar lawsuit against McDonald's after his wife found a dead rat in her salad. The salad was purchased at a Southlake, Texas McDonald's restaurant while Haley was a member of the Dallas Cowboys coaching staff. His wife and their live-in babysitter began to eat before noticing the rat. The case was settled out of court for a confidential amount. On December 31, 2017, a team spokesman stated Todd Haley was injured in a fall Sunday evening following the Steelers' Week 17 game. It was initially reported that Haley had been injured in an altercation at a bar outside Heinz Field, however a spokesman for the Pittsburgh City Police stated that it was Haley's wife, Christine, who was involved in a \"minor scuffle\" at the bar Tequila Cowboy which was quickly ended. Todd Haley was not involved nor injured in the incident. ==Head coaching record== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"|Team !! rowspan=\"2\"|Year !! colspan=\"5\"|Regular season !! colspan=\"4\"|Postseason |- !Won!!Lost!!Ties!!Win %!!Finish!!
