It is long and connects with the toll highway C-16 highway (Spain). Despite its shortness, it is the most-transited motorway in Catalonia and one of the most-transited highways in Spain. It is also the first highway that has implemented a new HOV Lane (in Spanish, Carril Bus-VAO), which was inaugurated on October 29, 2012. After Terrassa, it continues as a conventional highway to Manresa, parallel to the C-16 highway. Category:Roads in Catalonia ",
