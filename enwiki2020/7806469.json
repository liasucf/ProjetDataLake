It had a Corporation, and the electorate consisted of 13 burgesses and 50 freemen. The parliamentary representatives of the borough were elected using the bloc vote for two-member elections and first past the post for single- member by-elections. In the Patriot Parliament of 1689 summoned by King James II, Ardfert was not represented.O'Hart (2007), p. 502 It continued to be entitled to send two Members of Parliament to the Irish House of Commons until the Act of Union merged Parliament of Ireland into the Parliament of the United Kingdom on 1 January 1801. The constituency was disenfranchised on 31 December 1800. Thereafter borough was represented in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom as part of the county constituency of Kerry. ==Members of Parliament, 1634\u20131801== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Election!!!!First member!!First party!!!!Second member!!Second party |- |1634||rowspan=2| ||rowspan=2|David Crosbie||rowspan=2| || ||James FitzJames Pierce http://www.tara.tcd.ie/handle/2262/77206|| |- |1639|| ||Anthony Stoughtonhttp://www.igp-web.com/Kerry/maggie2.html|| |- |1661|| ||Thomas Amory|| || ||John Carricke|| |- | 1689 Patriot Parliament | style=\"background- color: \" | | Roger MacElligot | | style=\"background-color: \" | | Cornelius MacGillicuddy | |- | 1692 | style=\"background-color: \" | | Christopher Dominick | | rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color: \" | | rowspan=\"3\" | Andrew Young | rowspan=\"3\" | |- | 1699 | style=\"background-color: \" | | Theobald Purcell | |- | 1703 | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color: \" | | rowspan=\"2\" | Henry Rose | rowspan=\"2\" | |- | 1713 | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color: \" | | rowspan=\"2\" | William Crosbie | rowspan=\"2\" | |- | 1735 | rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color: \" | | rowspan=\"3\" | William Crosbie Styled as The Honourable from 1758 | rowspan=\"3\" | |- | 1743 | style=\"background-color: \" | | Edmond Malone | |- | 1758 | rowspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: \" | | rowspan=\"4\" | Maurice Coppinger | rowspan=\"4\" | |- | 1762 | style=\"background-color: \" | | Lancelot Crosbie | |- | 1776 | style=\"background-color: \" | | Viscount Crosbie | |- | 1781 | style=\"background-color: \" | | Edward Gleadowe | |- | October 1783 | style=\"background-color: \" | | John Scott Also elected for Portarlington in 1783, for which he chose to sit | | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background-color: \" | | rowspan=\"2\" | Sir Frederick Flood, 1st Bt | rowspan=\"2\" | |- | 1783 | style=\"background-color: \" | | John Tydd | |- | 1790 | rowspan=\"3\" style=\"background-color: \" | | rowspan=\"3\" | Robert Day | rowspan=\"3\" | | style=\"background-color: \" | | Richard Archdall | |- | January 1798 | style=\"background-color: \" | | Arthur Wolfe Also elected for Dublin City in 1798, for which he chose to sit | |- | 1798 | rowspan=\"4\" style=\"background- color: \" | | rowspan=\"4\" | Lord Charles FitzGerald | rowspan=\"4\" | |- | 1798 | style=\"background-color: \" | | Lorenzo Moore | |- | February 1800 | style=\"background-color: \" | | John Talbot | |- | September 1800 | style=\"background-color: \" | | Matthew Franks Elected, but never took his seat | |- | 1801 | || colspan=\"5\" | Disenfranchised |} ===Notes=== ==References== ==Bibliography== * *Johnston-Liik, E.
