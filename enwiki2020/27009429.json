The families left Sweden in response to the terrible conditions in the three years of misery in Sweden.Scandia Kansas History She spent the first 13 years of her life in Scandia. Her father was of Norwegian and Swedish heritage. In 1920 her family moved to Mountain View, California. ==Shooting of Harold Galloway== Granstedt first gained notoriety and widespread media attention in April 1922 after she shot her 17-year-old boyfriend, Harold Galloway, with a pistol she borrowed from a friend. Granstedt, then only 14 years old, claimed in interviews that the shooting was accidental, a claim that coincided with Galloway's own story of the incident.

I took the gun with me because I guess I felt afraid to walk out > there and back alone. (. . .) I started home and I met a boy friend who > offered to give me a lift.

I guess I didn't know what I wanted to do. I hid > behind a tree but my foot caught in my cape and I stumbled and he saw me. > Harold came up to me and said: 'Oh, what's the use of fighting! Let's make > up and have things as they were before. Let's start all over again!' But > something inside of me wouldn't let me make up. I didn't feel as if things > could ever be all right again. And I said: 'No - if I'm not good enough to > speak to at school, I'm not good enough to make up with!' (. . .)Harold took > a step towards me and I told him to stay where he was - not to touch me. And > I took the gun out of the holster and thought I'd scare him. Harold said > 'Shoot - I'm not yellow!' and then he grabbed the gun and it went off.The > Evening News - Apr 20, 1922 \"Boy Near to Death Today Although newspapers originally printed this version of things, they soon switched to a more tantalizing view, claiming Granstedt hid in the shadows with the gun, waiting to shoot Galloway as revenge for him attending the Parish dance with another girl. This version of the story would continue to be printed, even decades later.The Pittsburgh Press - Nov 3, 1933 \"Exiled 'Typical Flapper' of 1922 Becomes a Bride'\" Galloway's father and aunt leaned towards this story saying Granstedt was jealous and possessive, and that she procured the gun and sought out Galloway in order to scare him. The aunt believed Granstedt shot Galloway to keep him from entering into the navy and thus leaving her.The Evening News - Apr 25, 1922 \"Young Sweethearts Not to Meet Again\" Granstedt was not charged by the victim or his parents. It was originally believed Galloway would die when peritonitis developed in the wound,.The Evening News - Apr 21, 1922 \"Girl Waits Youth's Word\" however his condition greatly improved within days.The Evening News - Apr 24, 1922 \"Galloway Boy Gaining Fast\" Granstedt was brought to trial in juvenile court on June 30, 1922The Evening News - Jun 24, 1922 \"Irene Granstedt Goes to Trial June 30\" where she was sentenced to time in a reform school and was banished from Mountain View.Bellville, Kansas, Telescope, September 12, 1929 ==Pre- career== Greta left Mountain View as a young woman and spent the next several years in San Francisco. Among other ways of making a living, she modeled at San Francisco Art Association in the summer of 1926. In 1927 she and a companion travelled from San Francisco to Los Angeles. There is some confusion about who the companion was, or the way the pair got to Hollywood. She and Bessie Hyde reportedly took a steamer from San Francisco to Los Angeles. Bessie met Glen Hyde on that trip, falling in love and sealing her fate as a lost river runner. Greta, it is said, disembarked from the trip with the desire to become a movie star and the choice of a new name. She boarded as Eraine, a name she'd adopted in San Francisco, and departed as Greta. She boarded as a Kansas born Californian, disembarked as a Swedish born starlet in waiting.Dimock, Brad. Sunk Without a Sound. Flagstaff: Fretwater Press Another source maintains that Greta, barely surviving the hardships of living on her own in San Francisco, hitch-hiked from northern to southern California in the company of Geraldine Andrews By 1929 Greta had reconciled with her parents. They embarked from San Francisco aboard the aging passenger steamer, the San Juan. On September 2 the San Juan collided with oil tanker S. C. T. Dodd off Pigeon Point, California, near the location of the Pigeon Point lighthouse. Her father survived, but her mother was among the 77 drowned in the incident. The tragedy played out for several months in Los Angeles, with the crew being found negligent. ==Career== By the mid-1920s, Greta had appeared opposite Joseph Schildkraut in a Los Angeles production of From Hell Came a Lady.1920 Federal Census, Fruitvale, Sunnyvale Township, Santa Clara, California One of her early film appearances was in a small role in Buck Privates (1928), with Hungarian film actress Lya de Putti, and made her sound debut in The Last Performance (1929).

Her first marriage, in 1923, to Robert Blieber, was annulled because Greta was a minor. Her second marriage, to Robert Lowenthal, a California artist, in 1926, was also annulled. Her third marriage, to Ramon Ramos, in 1933, was celebrated by the one year, one term Mayor of New York, John P. O'Brien. The marriage lasted only eighteen months. Ramos was a Latin band leader, and tango dancer. Granstedt joined him at the Miami Biltmore in the fall of 1933 Miami News, November 17, 1933 In 1935 Granstedt married French World War I veteran, designer and photographer Marcel Olis, in Greenwich, Connecticut. It is unclear how long this marriage lasted, but it also ended in divorce. Her fifth husband was Max de Vega, a matte painter Matte Shot - a tribute Matte painting is a motion picture special effects technique involving the painting of movie backgrounds on glass. Married in Mexico, she was considering divorce when she discovered that de Vega was still married to a previous wife, and thus she sought annulment rather than divorce. It was with de Vega that Granstedt had a house designed for her by the California Architect Harwell Harris.Southern California Architectural History The Hollywood home is still extant, and Greta lived in the house through the 1950s. In 1944 Granstedt wed for a sixth time, this time to Major Lawrence Wright. The marriage was annulled, when Wright, like de Vega proved to still be married to another woman. In 1947 she married for a seventh time. Because four of the previous marriages had been annulled, newspaper reports of the time described this as \"her second wedding, his first.\" She and husband Arthur G. Forbes (1947\u20131951) adopted a son from Tennessee in 1948. In the 1951 Greta was awarded custody of the child she and Forbes had adopted three years earlier.
