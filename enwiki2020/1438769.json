    "text": ", the New York City Subway system has lettered or numbered route designations. * The ', ', ', ', ', ', and ' trains are fully local, making all stops. * The ', ', ', ', ', ', ', ', ' and ' trains have portions of express and local service. * The ' train normally operates local, but during rush hours it is joined by the ' train in the peak direction. Both run local, express or skip- stop on different parts of their route. * The ' and ' are fully local, but during rush hours, express variants of the routes, designated by diamond- shaped route markers, are operated alongside the locals in the peak direction. * The ' has portions of express and local service, but during rush hours, an express variant of the route, designated by a diamond-shaped route marker, is operated alongside the local in Brooklyn in the peak direction. * The letter ' is used for three shuttle services: the Rockaway Park Shuttle, Franklin Avenue Shuttle, and 42nd Street Shuttle. Due to the subway operating 24 hours a day, there are five different service patterns. There are rush-hour, midday, evening, weekend and late-night service patterns. Each service has a table in its article to show what tracks are used and when. This article lists all the current services, along with their lines and terminals and a brief description; see Unused New York City Subway service labels for unused and defunct services. In the New York City Subway nomenclature, numbered or lettered \"services\" use different segments of physical trackage, or \"lines\". The services that run on certain lines change periodically. == Time periods == The New York City Subway is one of the few subways worldwide operating 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, every day of the year. The schedule is divided into different periods, with each containing different operation patterns and train intervals. The MTA defines time periods as follows; these are used in articles (sometimes abbreviated by numbers in superscript or the symbol indicated): * (1) rush hours \u2013 6:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., Monday\u2013Friday ** (1a) rush hours in the peak direction (toward Manhattan in the morning, away from Manhattan in the afternoon) * (2) middays \u2013 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., Monday\u2013Friday ** (2a) middays in the peak direction ** (2b) middays in the non-peak direction * (3) evenings \u2013 8:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m., Monday\u2013Friday ** (3a) early evenings \u2013 8:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. ** (3b) evenings in the peak direction ** (3c) early evenings in the peak direction \u2013 8:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. * (4) weekends \u2013 6:30 a.m. to 12:00 a.m., Saturday and Sunday * (5) late nights \u2013 12:00 a.m. to 6:30 a.m., every day ** (5a) weekday late nights ** (5b) weekend late nights Other symbols are derivatives and are defined based on the rules above: * all times \u2013 24 hours a day, 7 days a week ** all times except rush hours in the peak direction ** all times except weekdays in the peak direction * daily \u2013 criteria (1), (2), (3), and (4) above (all times except late nights) ** daily except rush hours in the peak direction ** daily \u2013 criteria (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5b) above (all times except weekday late nights) * weekdays \u2013 criteria (1), (2), and (3) above * nights and weekdays \u2013 criteria (1), (2), (3), and (5) above ** weekdays and weekday nights \u2013 criteria (1), (2), (3), and (5a) above * nights and weekends \u2013 criteria (4) and (5) above ** weekends and weekend nights \u2013 criteria (4) and (5b) above * limited service during rush hours \u2013 criterion (1) above, but only for selected trains ** limited service during rush hours in the peak direction * service during rush hours in the reverse peak direction \u2013 opposite of criteria (1) above ** limited service during rush hours in the reverse peak direction == Service listing == Lines with colors next to them are the primary trunk line of the corresponding service; they determine the color of the service bullets and diamonds, except shuttles, which are dark gray. ===Current services=== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! width=1% | ! width=9% | Route ! with=20% | Line(s) ! width=15% | North terminal ! width=15% | South terminal ! width=40% | Service pattern(s) |- ! align=center colspan=6 | A Division (IRT) |- | | Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Local | IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line | | | Operates at all times, fully local, making all stops |- | | Seventh Avenue Express | IRT White Plains Road Line IRT Lenox Avenue Line IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line IRT Eastern Parkway Line IRT Nostrand Avenue Line | | | Operates at all times, express on the IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line in Manhattan, and local elsewhere Operates fully local late nights |- | | Seventh Avenue Express | IRT Lenox Avenue Line IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line IRT Eastern Parkway Line IRT New Lots Line | | (late nights) | Operates the full route at all times except late nights, express on the IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line in Manhattan and local elsewhere Short turns at Times Square\u201342nd Street late nights |- | | Lexington Avenue Express | IRT Jerome Avenue Line IRT Lexington Avenue Line IRT Eastern Parkway Line IRT New Lots Line | | (some rush hour trips and late nights) | Operates at all times; normally express on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line in Manhattan and IRT Eastern Parkway Line in Brooklyn and local on the IRT Woodlawn Line in the Bronx Skips 138th Street rush hours in peak direction.

Several services operate shorter routes during lower ridership hours, but these are neither signed differently nor counted as separate services. Although service changes caused by General Orders for construction occur on most days during midday and overnight hours, and throughout most weekends, these changes are not counted as separate services. ====Variants unaccounted for by formal designations==== Because of inconsistencies in usage there are, in practice, more distinctly identifiable services operating simultaneously than are represented by the color/letter/number designations: * Limited rush hour 2 trains operate to and from a different southern terminal (). * Limited rush hour 4 trains are extended to and from . * Limited rush hour 5 trains operate to and from two different northern terminals ( and ) and two different southern terminals ( and ). * Overnights, the A train between and is replaced by a shuttle which originates at Euclid Avenue. * Limited rush hour E trains operate to and from a different northern terminal (). * Limited rush hour N trains operate to and from a different northern terminal (). * One rush hour R train operates to a different northern terminal (). * Limited rush hour W trains are extended to and from . ====Event variants==== 23rd Street (Sixth Avenue) station.

During other traffic periods, intervals range usually from 4 to 12 minutes or up to 20 minutes on outer sections. During late nights, only selected express services are operated and all late-night services usually run every 20 minutes. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" colspan=\"26\" | Train headways in minutes |- style=\"background-color: #F0F0FF\" !
