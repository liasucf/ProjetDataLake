When asked about VanFleet's involvement during an interview with hardDrive Radio, Scabbia said, \"It all started because Marco, our bass player, produced her record and that's when we met her in Milano. When we thought about a piano version of the songs and an acoustic part of the 119 Shows in New York, we immediately thought about her. We asked her and she was super excited because she has been a Lacuna Coil fan and we had a great time. We rehearsed for the first time the same day as the first show but everything went amazing.\" ==Artistry== VanFleet's sound has been described as atmospheric alternative metal with orchestral and gothic elements. She has said that she naturally gravitates toward dark themes and topics when writing songs. She suffers from anxiety and magical thinking obsessive-compulsive disorder and uses her mental health as inspiration for her lyrics.
