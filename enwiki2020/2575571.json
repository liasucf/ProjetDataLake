According to historian and scholar Walter Spink, Jogeshwari is the earliest major cave temple in India and (in terms of total length) \"the largest\". The caves are located off the Western Express Highway, and are surrounded by encroachments. The caves are accessed through a long flight of stairs into the main hall of this cavernous space. It has many pillars and a Lingam at the end. Idols of Dattatreya, Hanuman, and Ganesh line the walls. There are also relics of two doormen. The cave also has a murti and footprints of goddess Jogeshwari (Yogeshwari), whom the area is named after. The goddess is considered a Kuladevi by some Marathi people, and also worshipped by some migrant groups from Gujarat. ==Gallery== Image:Jogeshwari_Caves_carving.jpg|Jogeshwari carving detail Image:Jogeshwari_Caves_entrance.jpg|Entrance to Jogeshwari caves Image:Ganapati Mandir JogCaves.jpg|Ganesh Temple in Jogeshwari caves Image:Hanuman Mandir JogCaves.jpg|Hanuman Temple in Jogeshwari caves ==References== ==External links== Category:Buddhist temples in India Category:Hindu temples in Mumbai Category:Hindu cave temples in India Category:Buddhist caves in India Category:Buddhist monasteries in India Category:Indian rock-cut architecture Category:Former populated places in India Category:Buddhist pilgrimage sites in India Category:Caves containing pictograms in India Category:6th-century Hindu temples Category:6th-century establishments in India Category:Gupta art ",
