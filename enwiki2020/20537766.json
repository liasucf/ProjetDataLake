    "text": "The Epiphany Chapel and Church House is a historic church at Odenton, Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States. It is a two-story gable-roofed frame building constructed in 1918 and laid out in cruciform plan in the Arts and Crafts style. It is significant for its association with the mobilization of the United States military for World War I, since it was constructed adjacent to Camp Meade (now known as Fort George G. Meade), a major training camp for troops bound for the Western Front in Europe. Its design was an early work of the prominent Baltimore architect Riggin T. Buckler (1882-1955) of the partnership/firm of Sill, Buckler & Fenhagen. The Epiphany Chapel and Church House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. == Gallery == Image:Epiphany Chapel and Church House Marker Dec 09.JPG|Epiphany Chapel and Church House, Historic Marker, December 2009 ==References== ==External links== *, including photo from 2001, at Maryland Historical Trust *Epiphany Episcopal Church website Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Maryland Category:Episcopal church buildings in Maryland Category:Churches in Anne Arundel County, Maryland Category:Churches completed in 1918 Category:20th-century Episcopal church buildings Category:National Register of Historic Places in Anne Arundel County, Maryland Category:Odenton, Maryland ",
