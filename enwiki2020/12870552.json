The Munro Baronetcy, of Foulis in the County of Ross, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 7 June 1634 for Colonel Hector Monro, with remainder to his heirs male whatsoever. On the death of his son, the second Baronet, in 1651, the male line of the first Baronet failed and the title was inherited by Robert Munro, grandson of George Munro, uncle of the first Baronet. The sixth Baronet represented Tain Burghs in the House of Commons and also fought at the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745. He was killed at the Battle of Falkirk in 1746. The seventh Baronet sat as Member of Parliament for Ross-shire and Tain Burghs. The ninth Baronet fought in the Peninsular War and later commanded a division of the Colombian Army under Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar. The eleventh Baronet served as Lord-Lieutenant of Ross and Cromarty from 1899 to 1935. The presumed sixteenth Baronet never successfully proved his succession and was never on the Official Roll of the Baronetage. The presumed 17th and present Baronet has also not successfully proven his succession and is not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered dormant since 1996. The Baronets were also Chiefs of Clan Munro until the death of the eleventh Baronet in 1935 when the chieftancy passed to his daughter and was separated from the baronetcy. From 1954, the baronets were styled \"of Foulis-Obsdale\" to distinguish their Arms and Designation from those of Munro of Foulis.For more information, follow this link. The Munro Baronetcy, of Lindertis in the County of Forfar, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 6 August 1825 for the soldier and colonial administrator Thomas Munro. He was a Major- General in the Army and served as Governor of Madras between 1820 and 1827. The Munro Baronets of Linderits descend from the Munros of Culcraggie, a cadet branch of the Clan Munro who descend from George Munro (died 1452), traditionally the 10th Baron of Foulis.Mackenzie, Alexander.
