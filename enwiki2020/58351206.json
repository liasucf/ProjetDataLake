She attended the Clinton Liberal Institute where her artistic training was encouraged. In 1866 she married Foundry owner John Dillon. He died less than ten years later, compelling Julia to become involved with the administration of the company, the McEntee and Dillon Rondout Foundry. The income from the foundry helped fund her pursuit of her artistic career. Around this time she traveled to Europe where she copied old masters. Back in New York state, she spent time in the studio of her cousin, the Hudson River School artist Jervis McEntee. In the 1880s Julia moved into New York City, moving back to Kingston in 1893. Dillon exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts and The Woman's Building at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois. She exhibited her paintings at the National Academy of Design, the Brooklyn Art Association, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the Art Institute of Chicago. Dillon died in 1918. ==Legacy== In 2005 \"Julia Dillon: A Retrospective\" was held at the Fred Johnston Museum in Kingston, New York. ==Gallery== File:Julia Mcentee Dillon - A Still Life With Peonies And Other Flowers In A Glass Vase.jpg|A Still Life With Peonies And Other Flowers In A Glass Vase, nd File:Julia Mcentee Dillon - Watermelon.jpg|Watermelon, 1893 File:Julia McEntee Dillon -unknown title.png|Still life, nd ==References== ==External links== * *images of Dillon's art on MutualArt Category:1834 births Category:1918 deaths Category:American women painters Category:19th-century American women artists Category:19th-century American painters Category:People from Kingston, New York Category:Painters from New York (state) ",
