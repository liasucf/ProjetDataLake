    "text": "Eurasian otter, the most likely species Otr took the form of. In Norse mythology, \u00d3tr (alternately: Ott, Oter, Otr, Ottar, Ottarr, Otter) is a dwarf. He is the son of the king Hreidmar and the brother of Fafnir and Regin. According to the Prose Edda, he could change into any form and used to spend his days in the shape of an otter, greedily eating fish. \u00d3tr was slain accidentally by Loki, who wanted to keep his pelt. Initially, Hreidmar demanded a life for a life, but with the argument that the murder had been an accident when nobody involved knew that \u00d3tr was a dwarf, he settled for receiving a large weregild for \u00d3tr's death, namely to fill \u00d3tr's skin with yellow gold and to then cover it entirely with red gold. When the skin was covered, one whisker was still protruding, forcing Loki to give up the ring Andvarinaut to hide it. The ring had been stolen from, and cursed by, the dwarf Andvari. It is suggested that this story was meant to show the benefits of not only adhering to the letter of the law (repayment for manslaughter) but sticking to the spirit of the law as well (demanding an exorbitant ransom). Greed for this cursed treasure ultimately caused the deaths of Hreidmar and his two surviving sons: Hreidmar was killed by Fafnir, who transformed into a dragon, and the other two were slain by Sigurd's sword Gram. ==References== Category:Nibelung tradition Category:Norse dwarves Category:Shapeshifting Category:V\u00f6lsung cycle sv:Dv\u00e4rg (mytologi)#Dv\u00e4rgar med mindre roller ",
