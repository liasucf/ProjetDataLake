It is widespread in the Southern Cone countries of South America; in all these countries T. infestans is almost an exclusively domestic species, except in Bolivia where sylvatic forms have been recorded in rock piles in association with wild guinea pigs. This region has joined the control intervention called Southern Cone Initiative managed by the PAHO. During the Beagle survey voyage, Charles Darwin noted in his journal for 26 March 1835 having \"experienced an attack, & it deserves no less a name, of the Benchuca, the great black bug of the Pampas. It is most disgusting to feel soft wingless insects, about an inch long, crawling over ones body; before sucking they are quite thin, but afterwards round & bloated with blood, & in this state they are easily squashed.\" Richard Keynes describes this Benchuca as being Triatoma infestans. ==See also== *Triatominae *Triatoma protracta ==External links== *Information on Triatoma infestans and other members of Triatominae, by Andreas Rose *Information on Triatominae, by Fernando Ot\u00e1lora-Luna == Notes == * Category:Reduviidae Category:Insect vectors of human pathogens Category:Chagas disease Category:Fauna of Argentina Category:Fauna of Bolivia Category:Fauna of Chile Category:Fauna of Peru Category:Insects of South America Category:Insects described in 1834 Category:Taxa named by Johann Christoph Friedrich Klug ",
