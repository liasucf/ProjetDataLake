    "text": "FR500GT at the FIA GT3 European Championship 2008 The Ford Racing Mustang FR500 is a highly tuned race variant of the Ford Mustang, featuring a V8 engine. These are turn key race cars not designed for public road use. Each FR500 model is built with a unique Ford Racing number, and not a DOT VIN. Each is built when ordered through Ford Racing. Each FR500 is built by the same plant, in Flat Rock (Michigan), as the standard Mustang. Recently, Ford has announced that it will continue to offer the FR500 models in 2010. ==Concept (1999)== The concept vehicle was developed by Dan Davis and the Special Vehicles Team (SVT) at Ford Motor Company. It has top speed of 281.6 km/h (175.0 mph). The car was based on the 1999 SVT Cobra, but did have some changes compared to the base car. === Engine === The slightly larger than stock (4997 cc) engine was modified by a variable intake head, later available as an aftermarket part called the FR500 cylinder head. The exhaust was a special exhaust which kept the 2.5\" diameter, but had a second crossover in the shape of an X-pipe behind the rear axle just before the exhaust tips. The mufflers had flaps, which opened under high pressure, thus making the exhaust more free flowing. The exhaust was also later sold as an aftermarket part by Ford Racing as the M-5230-M58 kit. Altogether, the engine modifications resulted in a horsepower increase to 415 from the stock 320 in the Cobra engine. === Drivetrain etc. === The FR500 concept came with a six-speed Tremec T56 transmission as compared to the 1999-standard T45 5 speed. Also, the wheelbase of the car was 5 inches larger than standard, which was due to the fact that the front axle had been moved forward by 5 inches. The car also had 14\" Brembo brake discs with 4 piston calipers at the front end, Lincoln LS calipers with 13\" rotors on the rear, and sported the so-called FR500 18\" wheels, which also became available as an addon later. === Exterior === The FR500 had a special carbon fiber hood and front fascia. The hood was more aerodynamic than the standard Cobra/GT one, and did not feature an open hole between the lights. Instead, the air for cooling and the engine was taken from under the bumper. The car also came with special C-pillar covers, giving a sleeker appearance and changing the shape of the rear windows, close to the shape that was later resurrected for the 2001 Bullit Mustang. The longer wheelbase also mandated special carbon fiber fenders. Finally, as an aerodynamic touch, the side scoops were shaved. ==Road Racing== ===FR500C=== Ford Mustang FR500C GT4 Powered by a 5.0L \"Cammer R50\" engine, it delivers . It includes a Tremec T56 6-speed transmission and other race-spec parts including a Grand Am-spec rollcage. It is permitted to be used in the Grand Am Grand Sport (GS) Class.Grand Am Rules & Regulations The FR500C can either be obtained as a turnkey costing $125,000 or by modding an existing Mustang GT with specified parts from Ford Racing. It is also known by its nickname \"Boy Racer\", assigned by Ford executives. This model won the manufacturers title in the Koni Challenge racing series in 2005 & 2008\\. This was after several attempts to slow the car down- such as a rearend gears change and additional weight. ===FR500S=== Powered by Ford's 4.6L V8 engine, it is rated at 325HP. The FR500S is often slotted in between the FR500C ('Boy Racer') and FR500GT ('Man Racer'). The car was designed by both Ford Racing and Miller Motorsports for the Ford Racing Mustang Challenge series (a racing series founded by Larry Miller). The car features similar aerodynamic parts like those used on the FR500GT, but uses a DOT approved racing tire- BFGoodrich g-Force R1. With the end of the Ford Racing Mustang Challenge, the FR500S has been homologated for competition in the SCCA World Challenge GTS class. ===FR500GT=== Codenamed Man Racer, the 5.0L V8 engine is rated at . This model features all of the features of a full race car, from heavily modified suspension to the large aerodynamic parts (which are effective). It also uses a 5.0L V8 engine built by Roush/Yates... ==Drag Racing== ===FR500CJ=== The FR500CJ (Cobra Jet) was released in 2008, and was built to commemorate the 40th Anniversary of Ford winning NHRA Winternationals with 1968 Cobra Jet Mustang.

Essentially the same car as the FR500C, it has a few changes (none are aerodynamic) to make it legal for GT4 competition. ===FR500C Salt Flats Racer (FR500C Variant)=== Paul's High Performance and Ford Racing built a Salt Flat Racer from a FR500C. This one is powered by Ford GT 5.4L engine fueled by E85 fuel.
