    "text": "thumb|right|300px|Family tree of the early sharifian dynasties of Mecca. The Sharif of Mecca (, Shar\u012bf Makkah) or Hejaz (, Shar\u012bf al-\u1e24ij\u0101z) was the title of the leader of the Sharifate of Mecca, traditional steward of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina and the surrounding Hejaz. The term sharif is Arabic for \"noble\", \"highborn\", and is used to describe the descendants of Prophet Muhammad's grandson al-Hassan ibn Ali. The Sharif was charged with protecting the cities and their environs and ensuring the safety of pilgrims performing the Hajj. The title is sometimes spelled Sheriff or Sherif, with the latter variant used, for example, by T. E. Lawrence in Seven Pillars of Wisdom. The office of the Sharifate of Mecca dates back to the late Abbasid era. Until 1200, the Sharifate was held by a member of the Hawashim clan, not to be confused with the larger clan of Banu Hashim from which all Sharifs claim descent. Descendants of the Banu Hashim continued to hold the position until the 20th century on behalf of various Muslim powers including the Ayyubids and the Mamluks. In 1517, the Sharif acknowledged the supremacy of the Ottoman Caliph, but maintained a great degree of local autonomy. During the Ottoman era, the Sharifate expanded its authority northwards to include Medina, and southwards to the frontiers of 'Asir, and regularly raided Nejd. The Sharifate came to an end shortly after the reign of Hussein bin Ali, who ruled from 1908, who rebelled against the Ottoman rule during the Arab Revolt of 1916. After the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in 1918 and its subsequent dissolution in 1923, Hussein declared himself Caliph. The British granted control over the newly formed states of Iraq and Transjordan to his sons Faisal and Abdullah. In 1924, however, in the face of increasing attacks by Ibn Saud, Hussein abdicated his secular titles to his eldest son, Ali bin Hussein, who was to become the last Grand Sharif. At the end of 1925, Ibn Saud conquered the Hejaz and expelled the Hashemites. The House of Saud has ruled the holy cities and overseen the Hajj since that time. ==List of Sharifs of Mecca (967\u20131925)== ===During the Fatimid Dynasty (967\u20131101)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Emir !style=\"min-width:150px;\"|Reign !Notes |- !colspan=3|Ja'farid dynasty |- |Ja'far ibn Muhammad al-Hasani |967\u2013980 | |- |Isa ibn Ja'far |980\u2013994 | |- |Abu'l-Futuh al-Hasan ibn Ja'far |994\u20131012 |Briefly anti-Caliph in 1012 |- |Abu Tayeb Daoud bin Abdul Rahman bin Abi Al- Fatik |1012\u20131039 | |- |Shukr ibn Abi'l-Futuh |1039\u20131061 |Died childless, end of the Ja'farid dynasty |- !colspan=3|Hawashim dynasty |- |Abu Hashim Muhammad ibn Ja'far |1062\u20131094 | |- |Ibn Abu'l-Hashim al-Thalab |1094\u20131101 | |} ===During the Ayyubid Empire (1201\u20131254)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Emir !style=\"min-width:150px;\"|Reign !Notes |- |Qatada ibn Idris al-Hasani al-Alawi |1201\u20131220 |Killed at age 90 by his son; founder of the Banu Qatada, the dynasty which ruled Mecca until 1925. |- |Hasan ibn Qatada al-Hasani al-Alawi |1220\u20131241 |Al-Zahir Baibers ruler of Egypt sends a prince to collect Zakat from the area including the surrounding bedouins |- |Al-Hassan abul-Saad |1241\u20131254 | |} ===1250\u20131301=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ ! style=\"min- width:250px;\" |Emir ! style=\"min-width:150px;\" |Reign AH ! style=\"min- width:200px;\" |Reign CE !Notes !References |- |Abu Sa'd Hasan ibn Ali ibn Qatadah |647\u2013651 |1250\u20131253 |Reigned until his death.
