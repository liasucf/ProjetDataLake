As such, the values are based on the nominal calculations. Considering a fireball would likely be noticed if it had collided with the Moon, as it would have created a crater over 150 meters in diameter, it can probably be concluded that the actual orbit was not too far from the nominal one- with a closest approach somewhere between 0.5 and 0.8 lunar distances. |- |2009-11-15 || || ||align=\"center\"|0.69 ||align=\"center\"|9-30 ||align=\"center\"|26.8 || |- |2009-11-16 || || ||align=\"center\"|0.91 ||align=\"center\"|3-10 ||align=\"center\"|29.2 || |- |2009-11-20 || || ||align=\"center\"|0.46 ||align=\"center\"|7-23 ||align=\"center\"|27.4 || |- |2009-11-24 || || ||align=\"center\"|0.39 ||align=\"center\"|8-26 ||align=\"center\"|27.1 || |} === Notes === ==Additional examples== An example list of near-Earth asteroids that passed more than 1 lunar distance (384,400 km or 0.00256 AU) from Earth in 2009. * (~990 meters in diameter) passed 11.33 Lunar distances (4.4 million km) from Earth on 17 January 2009. * (~285 meters in diameter) passed 4.39 Lunar distances (1.7 million km) from Earth on 18 February 2009. * (~41 meters in diameter) passed 2.82 Lunar distances (1.1 million km) from Earth on 17 March 2009. * (~95 meters in diameter) passed 1.22 Lunar distances (468,000 km) from Earth on 20 March 2009. *(410777) 2009 FD (472 meters in diameter) passed 1.62 Lunar distances (624,000 km) from Earth on 27 March 2009. *(136617) 1994 CC (~990 meters in diameter) passed 6.55 Lunar distances (2.5 million km) from Earth on 10 June 2009. *2009 MU (~41 meters in diameter) passed 2.31 Lunar distances (889,000 km) from Earth on 24 June 2009. * (~41 meters in diameter) passed 1.94 Lunar distances (745,000 km) from Earth on 11 September 2009. * (~5 meters in diameter) may have passed as close as 1.01 Lunar distances (390,000 km) from Earth on 14 September 2009, but the nominal orbit suggests an approach nearer to 2.40 LD (922,000 km). * (1277 meters in diameter) passed 9.79 Lunar distances (3.8 million km) from Earth on 8 October 2009. * (~2067 meters in diameter) passed 29.68 Lunar distances (11.4 million km) from Earth on 20 October 2009. * (~54 meters in diameter) passed 2.91 Lunar distances (112,000 km) from Earth on 1 December 2009. == See also == *List of asteroid close approaches to Earth *List of asteroid close approaches to Earth in 2008 *List of asteroid close approaches to Earth in 2010 == References == * ",
