They have reformed under different guises but for the majority of their 113 years they have been known as Maesteg Harlequins. The club is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union having been made full members in 1987. ==Club badge== The club badge consists of a central shield surrounded by an elaborate gold border. The shield contains the traditional image of Maesteg a burning castle (Castell Coch which was sited in the nearby village of Llangynwyd and home to the ruling earls of the area). The burning castle shows the historical rejection of Norman rule by local Welsh people. Above the castle is the traditional emblem of Wales a red dragon rampant. The words 'Tir Iarll' (Earl's Land) lies below the shield on a scroll and this was the name of the area in the Middle Ages. The burning castle banner was flown at Agincourt by the influential archers of the area. ==Club honours== * WRU National League 1 West Central Champions 2017-2018 * WRU West Championship Play-Off Winners 2017-2018 * WRU National League 2 West Central Champions 2013-2014 * WRU National League 3 West Central Champions 2011-2012 * WRU National League 3 West Central Champions 2004-2005 * WRU National League 4 West Central Champions 2010-2011 * WRU National League 5 West Central Champions 2001\u20132002 * WRU National League 6 West Central Champions 2000\u20132001 * WRU National League 7 West Central Champions 1997\u20131998 * Glamorgan County Silver Ball Winners: 2000\u20132001 & 2010-2011 * Glamorgan County Silver Ball Finalists: 2011-2012 & 2017-2018 * Glamorgan County President\u2019s Cup Winners: 2000\u20132001 & 2010-2011 * Glamorgan County President\u2019s Cup Finalists: 1997-1998 * Hancocks HB Trophy Winners: 1997 \u2013 1998 * Glamorgan County 'Performance of the Year': 1997 \u2013 1998 * WRU SWALEC National Bowl Finalists: 2010-2011 * Central Glamorgan Cup Finalists: 1995\u20131996, 1997\u20131998 & 2001\u20132002 * Wistech Central Glamorgan League 3 Runner-up 1989-1990 * Wistech Central Glamorgan League 2 Runner-up 1990-1991 * Maesteg and District Champions 1899-1900 * Mid-Glam D.R.U.
