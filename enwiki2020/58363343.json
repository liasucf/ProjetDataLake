    "text": "\"Head Above Water\" is a song by Canadian singer Avril Lavigne from her sixth studio album of the same name (2019). It was written by Lavigne and Travis Clark of We The Kings alongside its producer Stephan Moccio. It was released as the lead single from the album on September 19, 2018, by BMG Rights Management. It is Lavigne's first single since \"Fly\", released on April 2015. Commercially, the song peaked at number 64 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and entered the charts of 24 other countries and regions. In August 2019, a new version featuring vocals from We The Kings' Travis Clark was released. ==Background and release== After more than a year from the release of the last single from her fifth studio album, on December 25, 2016, Lavigne announced via her Instagram account that she was working on new music for her upcoming sixth studio album. On August 18, 2018, Lavigne posted on Instagram that new music is coming in September. At the end of August, the song \"Head Above Water\" was registered and Lavigne deleted almost all her pictures on Instagram. On September 1, Lavigne shared a picture of her underwater via her social media. Several people reported that the image was related to the song \"Head Above Water\". On September 6, Lavigne posted a lengthy letter to her fans on her website detailing her struggle with Lyme disease in the past few years and how she overcame it. This also included a release date for \"Head Above Water\". She wrote on the letter about the song \"I had accepted death and could feel my body shutting down. I felt like I was drowning. Like I was going under water and I just needed to come up for air. Like I was in a river being pulled in a current. Unable to breathe. Praying to God for Him to help me just keep my head above the water. To help me see through the stormy weather.\" Lavigne shared a 30-second-snippet of the song on September 13, 2018. The song was officially released on YouTube and streaming services on September 19, 2018. ==Writing== The song was written by Lavigne, Travis Clark of the band We The Kings, and the song's producer Stephan Moccio. Lavigne described the writing process as \"a beautiful experience\". She explained she started writing the song during a tough time battling Lyme disease a few years prior, thinking her life was over. She recalled: \"one night when I was starting to feel better, I had a party at my house and somehow Travis was there. I had never met him before. I found him on my piano and I just thought he was so unbelievably talented, and I asked him to finish the song with me\". Lavigne further said they worked \"so hard\" on the song and were able to take her story and put it out in the world. She concluded, \"I hope that my words in this song [...] bring you hope, faith, light,and strength and that you also are able to keep your head above the water\". ==Composition== \"Head Above Water\" is an \"empowering\" pop rock and Christian rock ballad, backed by steady-building mix of piano, strings, synths and thunderous drums. Lavigne described it as a \"spiritual experience.\" Lavigne's vocal range spans from low F3 to high F5 in the song. Musically the song is in the key of F major and shifts between 2/4 and 4/4 time signatures. ==Critical reception== Marina Pedrosa of Billboard wrote that \"Head Above Water\" \"is a powerful, spiritual epiphany detailing the Canadian singer's journey through her battle with Lyme disease.\" Robin Murray of Clash complimented the track's production and deemed it a \"highly personal note\". Murray described the song's lyrics and production in detail: \"Now, we've never been 100% behind Avril Lavigne's music, but we can't help but be touched by the way she's approached what must be an enormously challenging situation.\" Writing for Spin, Anna Gaca described the track as a \"dramatic piano ballad of resilience\". Madeline Roth of MTV Canada named \"Head Above Water\" an \"emotionally charged comeback\". Roth was impressed with the fact that the song wasn't \"just metaphorical\", because \"it documents a culminating moment in Lavigne's years-long struggle with Lyme disease\". Katherine Gillespie from Paper wrote that \"Head Above Water\" is a \"heavy piano ballad about just that: trying to stay alive.\" Lindsay Elizabeth of Faithwire gave the song a positive review, calling it a \"powerful worship ballad\". Elizabeth further praised that \"Lavigne details her relationship with God, and how He saved her when she thought she was at the end of her life.\" Michael Foust of Christian Headlines described the song as a \"God-centric song\" that even could be labeled \"praise and worship\", while Maria Sherman of Jezebel considered the song's nature as \"dramatic Christian rock vibes\" and compared it to Rachel Platten's 2015 single \"Fight Song\". ==Alternate version== On August 30, 2019, nearly a year after the song's release, a new version was released featuring Travis Clarke of the band We the Kings, who helped write the original version. This version features \"heavenly harmonies and adds to the emotion of the already heartstring-tugging melody\". ==Music video== Filmed in V\u00edk \u00ed M\u00fdrdal, Iceland and directed by Elliott Lester, the official music video for \"Head Above Water\" was released on September 27, 2018 to coincide with Lavigne's 34th birthday. The music video ends with a message to join Lavigne's namesake foundation, which supports Lyme disease prevention, treatment and research. The music video was premiered on Entertainment Tonights official Facebook page.
