    "text": "Sir Peter Teazle (1784 \u2013 18 August 1811) was a good British bred Thoroughbred racehorse, a Leading sire in Great Britain & Ireland nine times, and carried on the sire line of Herod. == Breeding == Sir Peter Teazle was a brown horse bred and owned by Edward Smith-Stanley, 12th Earl of Derby. His sire Highflyer was on the Leading Sire list 16 times, producing 469 winners, seven of which won classic races. Highflyer also got the mare Prunella, and the sons Delpini, Diamond, and Traveller. Sir Peter Teazle's dam, Papillon, was by Snap, himself on the Leading Sire list four times and a great producer of raw speed. Papillon had some success as a racehorse, finishing third out of 22 in the 1773 Craven Stakes, losing to Firetail and Miss Timms. Sir Peter was her 7th out of 12 living foals, and one of several winners she produced, including the filly Lady Teazle (1781), who was second in The Oaks and won 11 races during her career. The name comes from a character in the classic comic play The School for Scandal. ==Racing career== Sir Peter first came to the track at three, and continued the season undefeated. He won The Derby at his first start, a sweepstakes at Ascot, the 1,000 Guineas subscription race for his age group, and the Prince of Wales's Plate, before beating Bullfinch (by Woodpecker) in a 500 guineas match and winning again against Bullfinch by forfeit for a second match. He then won a 40 guineas subscription purse and a sweepstakes by walkover. At age four (1788) at Newmarket First Spring he won the Jockey Stakes, the rich Claret Stakes, and the Fortescue Stakes, twice beating Buzzard, and received a compromise in a scheduled match against Mentor. At Newmarket July he won the Grosvenor Stakes over two miles. In October at Newmarket he received a forfeit in a 700 guineas match against Mentor. He then suffered his first defeat, in a 500 guineas match against the Duke of Queensberry's four-year-old Florizel colt, Dash, giving Dash 32 pounds in weight; Sir Peter had had to stop training several days before the race because he had \"got pricked in shoeing.\" His final race of the year was a 300 guineas match against the good mare Maria (by Telemachus), which he won. He was seven for eight that season, his only loss one in which he was conceding gobs of weight.http://www.tbheritage.com/Portraits/SirPeterTeazle.htm His luck then turned, losing a 500 guineas match to Dash (by Florizel)\u2014who was carrying 32 lbs. less in weight\u2014although this was possibly because Sir Peter was pricked during shoeing, and had to take several days off work before the race. He then defeated Maria (by Telemachus) in a 300 guineas match. He finished his four-year-old season with seven wins from eight starts. Sir Peter then won the Newmarket Craven, beating Meteor again. He then forfeited two races\u2014a six- mile, 1,000 guineas match against Dash, and 500 guineas match against Meteor\u2014probably due to physical problems. Sir Peter then lost to Mulberry (by Florizel), who was carrying 28 lbs less, over the four mile Beacon course at Newmarket. He then broke down in a later race, and was retired to stud. ==Stud record== Sir Peter stood at Derby's Knowsley Stud in Lancashire, where he had great success in the breeding shed. During this time, he sired a Doncaster Cup, four Epsom Derby winners, two Epsom Oaks winners, four St. Leger winners, and finished his career as the Leading Sires list nine times (1799\u20131802, 1804\u20131809).
