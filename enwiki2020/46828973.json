    "text": "IEEE 802.3bz, NBASE-T and MGBASE-T refer to standards for Ethernet over twisted pair at speeds of 2.5 Gbit/s and 5 Gbit/s. This represents intermediate speeds between Gigabit Ethernet and 10 Gigabit Ethernet. The resulting standards are named 2.5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T. ==Technology== The physical (PHY) layer transmission technology of IEEE 802.3bz is based on 10GBASE-T, but operates at a lower signaling rate. By reducing the original signal rate to or , the transfer rate drops to 2.5 or 5 Gbit/s, respectively. The spectral bandwidth of the signal is reduced accordingly, lowering the requirements on the cabling, so that 2.5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T can be deployed at a cable length of 100 m on unshielded Cat 5e and Cat 6 cables, respectively. The IEEE Standard 802.3bz defines: * 2.5 Gbit/s up to at least 100 m of Cat 5e * 5 Gbit/s up to 100 m of Cat 5e * 5 Gbit/s up to at least 100 m of Cat 6 == Power over Ethernet == Unlike the preceding 10GBASE-T standard, equipment manufacturers have indicated their intention to implement 802.3at type Power over Ethernet on certain types of NBASE-T switches. This implementation is intended to support high-bandwidth wireless access points (802.11ac / 802.11ax) which exceed the speed capabilities of 1000BASE-T. == Comparison of twisted pair based Ethernet technologies== Comparison of twisted pair based ethernet technologies {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !

IEEE 802.3bz will also support Power over Ethernet, which has generally not been available at 10GBASE-T. As early as 2013, the Intel Avoton server processors integrated 2.5 Gbit/s Ethernet ports. Whilst Broadcom had announced a series of 2.5 Gbit/s transceiver ICs, 2.5 Gbit/s switch hardware was not widely commercially available at that point; 10GBASE-T switches do not generally support the intermediate speeds. In October 2014, the NBASE-T Alliance was founded, initially comprising Cisco, Aquantia, Freescale, and Xilinx. By May 2015, it had expanded to 34 members covering most producers of networking hardware. The competing MGBASE-T Alliance, stating the same faster Gigabit Ethernet objectives, was founded in December 2014. In contrast to NBASE-T, the MGBASE-T says that their specifications will be open source. With the forming of the IEEE 802.3bz draft standard under the patronage of the Ethernet Alliance in June 2015, the two NBASE-T and MGBASE-T Alliances are forced to collaborate. IEEE 802.3's \"2.5G/5GBASE-T Task Force\" started working on the 2.5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T standards in March 2015. On September 23, 2016, the IEEE-SA Standards Board approved IEEE Std 802.3bz-2016. ==NBASE-T Alliance== The NBASE-T Alliance was founded in 2014 by Aquantia Corporation, Cisco Systems, Freescale Semiconductor, and Xilinx. It now consists of more than 45 companies, and it aims to have its specification compatible with 802.3bz. == References == == External links == * IEEE P802.3bz 2.5G/5GBASE-T Task Force * NBASE-T Alliance * MGBASE-T Alliance Category:Ethernet standards ",
