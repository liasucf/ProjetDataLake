The project was co-directed by Diana Lary and Bernard Luk. A Joint Centre for Asia Pacific Studies was established between the University of Toronto and York University. It collected 5,000 items since its inception. With a $500,000 grant from the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (Canada), the Canada-Hong Kong Resource Centre \u52a0\u6e2f\u6587\u737b\u9928 was set up in 1994 at 1 Spadina Crescent. By 1998, the Resource Centre\u2019s collection reached 40,000 items. In 1999, the Resource Centre received a major gift of $500,000 from Senator Vivienne Poy, and a reading room named Ming Chak Hin \u9298\u6fa4\u8ed2 (Richard Charles Lee Studio) was created at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto. In 2006, the Resource Centre received a donation of $3,000,000. It was relocated to the current location on the 8th floor of Robarts Library at the University of Toronto. The Centre was renamed to the Richard Charles Lee Canada-Hong Kong Library in 2008. == External links == * Official Website * Official Facebook page * Richard Charles Lee Canada-Hong Kong Library at the Internet Archive == References == Category:University of Toronto libraries Category:Academic libraries in Canada Category:Libraries in Toronto Category:Special collections libraries ",
