There is a steady demand for the services of talented and experienced professionals. The work is studio or office based, but will usually also involve visiting clients or exhibition sites and in some cases may also involve being outside (i.e. outdoor zoos, parades). ==Education and Training== Exhibition Designers may come from many different backgrounds such as industrial design/product design, architecture, interior design or graphic design. Exhibition Designers are responsible for an exhibit from conception to completion and will incorporate many of the following knowledge and skills: * Conceptual design * Computer Aided Design (CAD) and 3D visualisation * Knowledge of safety, regulations and applicable standards * Knowledge of current build methods * Expertise in Mathematics * Model making skills * Programming of CNC devices Many different companies will have their own multi- purpose system that may be used for the construction of smaller Exhibition stands, there are several different systems available and training into the specifics of each is usually conducted on a case by case basis. For larger stands such as double or triple-deckers, a good knowledge of architectural build methods is useful. An exhibition designer will usually work in conjunction with a [structural engineer] to ensure the safe implementation of structural columns and beams. When designing larger stands the designer will take into account all local safety regulations, budget constraints, logistics, design aesthetics and any requirements for electrical and water supply. ==See also== *Ralph Appelbaum Associates, U.S. firm *Local Projects, U.S. firm *Gallagher & Associates, U.S. firm *Event Communications, London firm *Cultural tourism ==References== Category:Visual arts occupations Category:Museum occupations Category:Communication design Category:Graphic design ",
