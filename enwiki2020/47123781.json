Andy Kellman of AllMusic said, \"The majority of Ego Death is tighter. Bennett has refined her songwriting without reducing the candid approach that colors her past compositions. Additionally, the tangents are fewer and more substantive.\" Pat Levy of Consequence of Sound said, \"In addition to their more fully formed sound, one of the more exciting things about The Internet is the music's point of view.\" Michael J. Warren of Exclaim! said, \"Ego Death frees the Internet from Odd Future connotations and R&B; norms; it's their best work yet.\" Tshepo Mokoena of The Guardian said, \"There's wit and honestly behind her observations of courting and heartbreak, making her pinhole focus on love more about nuance than navel-gazing. It's just as well the band stayed together.\" Ronald Grant of HipHopDX said, \"Ego Death is an album both suited specifically for the social media age of music listeners but simultaneously rich and permeated with the traditions of the soul and R&B; music of the past.\" Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said, \"There's convincing thump at work here, but not so much as to overwhelm the lustrous keyboards, the nuzzling bass, the way several of the songs unfurl like blooming roses.\" Sean Fennell of PopMatters said, \"Ego Death and The Internet require a little bit of patience, but if you are willing to give it a full go, it will reward you with one of the most interesting albums in recent memory.\" Patrick Taylor of RapReviews said, \"Ego Death is the perfect summer record. Breezy, smooth, lazy, and meant for warm nights.\" Craig Jenkins of Pitchfork said, \"The Internet's songs have always felt like scenes of salaciousness happening just out of earshot. Ego Death finally pulls us into the maelstrom.\" Suzy Exposito of Rolling Stone said, \"The best tracks fade away into gravity-defying instrumental outros that make Syd's heartache feel sublimely serene.\" ===Awards=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |+Awards for Ego Death |- ! scope=\"col\"| Year ! scope=\"col\"| Ceremony ! scope=\"col\"| Category ! scope=\"col\"| Result |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2016 | Grammy Awards | Best Urban Contemporary Album | |} ==Track listing== == Credits and personnel == Credits adapted from the album's liner notes.
