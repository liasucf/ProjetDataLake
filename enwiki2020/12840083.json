    "text": "The Southern Alliance was a short-lived football league competition for teams in the South of England. At the time, there were no Southern teams in the Football League and no equivalent competition existed for clubs in the south. The Southern Alliance was set up in 1892 and ran for just one season, in 1892-93. The league featured seven leading amateur teams from the Home Counties, namely: * Erith * Old St Stephen's * Polytechnic * Slough Town * Tottenham Hotspur * Upton Park * Windsor & Eton Notable in their absence were leading Southern sides such as Woolwich Arsenal (who had turned professional in 1891 and were banned from local competitions) and Millwall Athletic. ==Final table== Not all matches in the 1892-93 competition were played, however Old St. Stephens topped the final table. The competition was disbanded at the end of the season. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! !! !!P!!W!!D!!L!!F!!A!!Pts |- |1||Old St Stephen's||12||10||1||1||44||15||21 |- |2||Erith||11||8||1||2||29||14||17 |- |3||Tottenham Hotspur||12||7||2||3||29||21||16 |- |4||Polytechnic||8||4||0||4||18||12||8 |- |5||Slough Town||11||2||2||7||21||33||6 |- |6||Windsor & Eton||10||2||1||7||14||37||5 |- |7||Upton Park||10||1||0||9||7||36||2 |} ==References== *Final league table and details of Tottenham's campaign ==See also== *Southern Football League, a successor competition founded in 1894 Category:1892\u201393 in English association football leagues Category:Defunct football leagues in England ",
