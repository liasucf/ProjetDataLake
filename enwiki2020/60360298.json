    "text": "Alexis Lucas Delgado (born 24 March 1995) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a centre-forward for F\u00e9nix. ==Career== Delgado started life in senior football with Guaran\u00ed Antonio Franco; signing from Boca Juniors. He featured six times in Torneo Federal A, including for his debut against Sol de Am\u00e9rica on 7 February 2016. Delgado moved to Barracas Central on 2 September. One goal, in an April draw versus Trist\u00e1n Su\u00e1rez, in eleven matches subsequently occurred. Primera Divisi\u00f3n team Temperley signed Delgado in July 2017. His first goal for them arrived on 27 April in a win away to Chacarita Juniors, though he was later sent off in the game. He returned on 12 May for a match with Belgrano, netting in a win as they were relegated. In March 2019, Delgado joined Latvian Higher League side FK Liep\u0101ja; terminating his Temperley contract to do so. His first goal came during his second appearance, as he netted in a victory away from home versus FK Jelgava on 5 April. A further goal, against Daugavpils, occurred across twelve games, prior to Delgado mutually ending his contract in early June; exercising a clause that was inserted back in March. Delgado then headed off to Nacional Potos\u00ed of the Bolivian Primera Divisi\u00f3n. He'd make just seven appearances, of which only two were starts, before departing at the end of the year. In September 2020, following months of inactivity after a failed move to Swedish football and the COVID-19 pandemic, Delgado returned to Argentina with Primera B Metropolitana's F\u00e9nix. ==Personal life== Delgado is the nephew of former Argentina international footballer Marcelo Delgado. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Guaran\u00ed Antonio Franco |2016 |rowspan=\"1\"|Torneo Federal A |6||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||6||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Barracas Central |2016\u201317 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera B Metropolitana |10||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1Appearance(s) in the Primera B Metropolitana play-offs||0||11||1 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Temperley |2017\u201318 |rowspan=\"1\"|Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n |6||2||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||6||2 |- |2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera B Nacional |5||0||4||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||9||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !11!!2!!4!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!15!!3 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|FK Liep\u0101ja |2019 |rowspan=\"1\"|Higher League |12||2||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||12||2 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Nacional Potos\u00ed |2019 |rowspan=\"1\"|Bolivian Primera Divisi\u00f3n |7||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||7||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|F\u00e9nix |2020\u201321 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera B Metropolitana |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !46!!5!!4!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0!!1!!0!!51!!6 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:People from San Lorenzo Department Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Latvia Category:Expatriate footballers in Bolivia Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Latvia Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Bolivia Category:Torneo Federal A players Category:Primera B Metropolitana players Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Primera B Nacional players Category:Bolivian Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Guaran\u00ed Antonio Franco footballers Category:Barracas Central players Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Temperley footballers Category:FK Liep\u0101ja players Category:Nacional Potos\u00ed players Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico F\u00e9nix players ",
