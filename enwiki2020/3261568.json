The name occurs in a footnote appended to The Complete Works of Josephus, translated by William Whiston. The town is named alongside a reference to another place in Armenia called The Place of Descent, thought by the natives of the country to be the place where the ark of Noah alighted. ==References== Category:Jewish mythology Category:Mythological populated places ",
