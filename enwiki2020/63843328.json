Booker was a two-time first-team All-Patriot League selection in his junior and senior seasons. As a junior, he was named the Patriot League Tournament MVP after averaging 17.5 points and 11 rebounds in wins over Lafayette and Bucknell. At the conclusion of the 1997\u201398 season, Booker was named the winner of the Chip Hilton Player of the Year Award, a national award given by the NCAA to a Division I player who demonstrated outstanding character, leadership, integrity, humility, sportsmanship, and talent.
