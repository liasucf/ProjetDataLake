    "text": "Women in Music was an American newsletter founded in July 1935 by its publisher and editor, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Petrides, then the conductor of the Orchestrette Classique - an orchestra based in New York made-up of female musicians. The publication ran until December 1940. The thirty-seven extant issues were reprinted in the 1991 book by Jan Bell Groh, Evening the Score: Women in Music and the Legacy of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Petrides. The newsletter title Women in Music was coined in 1935 by Petrides's husband, journalist, Peter Petrides to encapsulate the gist of its contents.Groh (1991), p. 5Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique Petrides Papers == History == Women in Music was founded in the summer of 1935 for the purpose of enlightening the public with little-known historical facts and current developments pertaining to female conductors, composers, instrumentalists, singers and women-led orchestras. Its scope was not limited to contemporary musicians - it chronicled the activities of female musicians from Ancient Egyptian times to the then present. The publication was sent free-of-charge to newspaper and magazine editors, libraries, music schools, institutions, and individuals in New York and elsewhere. The publication had a circulation of over 2,500.LePage (1983), pp. 203-204 Major print media, including music journals, general magazines, and newspapers have cited Women in Music as a primary source for opinions, facts, and quotes.
