It was completed by the California Shipbuilding Company on June 30, 1944 and served in the Pacific during World War II. Victory Ship class vessels were designed to replace the Liberty Ship class. Victory Ships were designed to last longer and to serve the US Navy after the war. The Victory Ships were faster, longer, wider, and taller than the Liberty ships, and they had a thinner stack set farther toward the superstructure as well as a long raised forecastle.National parks, Reading 2: Victory Ships ==Launch== The SS Navajo Victory was christened by Mrs. Tom Price, wife of the general manager of Kaiser Shipyards; the matron of honor was Mrs. Frank Backman.

Menestheus had departed Balboa, Canal Zone, on April 5 en route to Long Beach Harbor with a cargo of rice. An explosion in the engine room (which occurred when the Menestheus was about 90 miles northwest of Magdalena Bay and 130 miles west of Baja California) started a fire which forced the crew to abandon ship. The crew of 80, who were in the lifeboats by the time of Navajo Victorys arrival, were rescued by the Navajo Victory and taken to San Diego. The Navajo Victory towed the Menestheus for nearly 500 miles but was eventually forced to abandon her.The Baytown Sun from Baytown, Texas \u00b7 Page 1, April 16, 1953Long Beach Independent from Long Beach, California \u00b7 Page 8, April 17, 1953 Navajo Victory sat idle in Astoria, Oregon until 1966. ==Vietnam War== In 1966 the Navajo Victory was reactivated for the Vietnam War.
