    "text": "East Ventures is a Jakarta, Indonesia-based early stage venture capital (VC) firm. Founded in 2009, it is one of the longest-serving seed investors in Southeast Asia. ==History== East Ventures was founded in 2009 by Batara Eto, Chandra Tjan, Taiga Matsuyama, and Willson Cuaca as one of the first VC firms in Indonesia. The company's first investment was for Indonesian tech company Tokopedia, which eventually became known as a tech unicorn. In April 2017, the company saw its largest exit when mobile payments processor and early East Ventures investment Kudo was acquired by ride-sharing firm Grab, for US$100 million. In March 2018, East Ventures launched the EV Growth fund, a joint venture between East Ventures, SMDV, and Yahoo! Japan, which provides series B and later-stage funding to startups in Southeast Asia. In May 2019, EV Growth announced it raised funding of US$200 million from Softbank Group, Pavilion Capital, and Indies Capital. In August, the firm raised US$75 million for its sixth fund. ==Investments== East Ventures has invested in over 160 startups with more than US$4 billion in follow-on rounds. In addition to Tokopedia, its portfolio includes unicorn startup Traveloka, Japanese e-commerce Mercari, co- working startup CoHive (previously known as EV Hive), Indonesian education technology company Ruangguru, and cashback reward platform ShopBack. East Ventures is one of the most active venture capital investors in Southeast Asia. It was recognised by Crunchbase as one of the top eight seed investors worldwide in Q3, 2018. According to data from research firm Preqin, the fund is among the most consistent top performing venture capital fund managers in the world. East Ventures is one of five firms worldwide to have three funds ranked in Preqin\u2019s top quartile; that puts it alongside names like Benchmark Capital. == References == Category:Venture capital firms of Singapore ",
