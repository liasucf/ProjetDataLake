    "text": "James Edward Winston Langwith (20 April 1945 \u2013 26 September 2020), known professionally as Jimmy Winston, was an English musician and actor. He was the original keyboard player with Small Faces. Winston had apparently previously worked under the stage name James Moody, before switching to Winston as a possible reference to Winston Churchill. His acting credits include the 1968 stage musical Hair and the 1972 Doctor Who serial Day of the Daleks. == Small Faces == In early 1965, Winston, along with his acquaintance Steve Marriott, formed Small Faces with Ronnie Lane and Kenney Jones. While originally a guitarist, his role was soon shifted to become a keyboardist. Winston was fundamental in the band's emergence, as his parents owned the Ruskin Arms pub located in Manor Park, a place where the group would rehearse and occasionally perform. After a performance at the Cavern Club on Leicester Square, an assistant of manager Don Arden stepped up to the band and managed to secure them a contract with Decca Records. The band released their debut single \"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\" later that year, peaking at number 14. The success of this single would be followed by \"I've Got Mine\", which despite good reviews failed to chart. The group including Winston performed the song in Dateline Diamonds (1965). Shortly after this release, Winston left the group, and was promptly replaced by Ian McLagan. A factor that has been rumoured about his termination is that during an episode of Thank Your Lucky Stars, Winston snubbed Marriott. There has been controversy whether Winston left the group himself or was fired. Lane stated in an interview that he was fired: However, Kenney Jones later said: \"He [Winston] got above his station and tried to compete with Steve Marriott.\" Reality is he left. == Death == Winston died on 26 September 2020, at the age of 75. == Discography == === Solo === \"Sun In the Morning\" / \"Just Wanna Smile\" (1976) === with Small Faces === (While he is credited as the sole keyboardist on their first two singles, Winston is also credited on some tracks on four further albums released by the band) * \"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\" / \"What's A Matter Baby\" (1965) * \"I've Got Mine\" / \"It's Too Late\" (1965) * Small Faces (1966) * From the Beginning (1967) * The Autumn Stone (1969) * The BBC Sessions (1999) === with Jimmy Winston and His Reflections === \"Sorry She's Mine\" / \"It's Not What You Do (But the Way That You Do It)\" (1966) === with Winston's Fumbs === \"Real Crazy Apartment\" / \"Snow White\" (1967) == Filmography == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" ! scope=\"col\" |Title ! scope=\"col\" |Year ! scope=\"col\" |Role ! scope=\"col\" |Director ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |Notes |- ! scope=\"row\" |Dateline Diamonds |1966 |Himself |Jeremy Summers |as a member of Small Faces |- ! scope=\"row\" |Doctor in the House | rowspan=\"2\" |1969 |Hairy | rowspan=\"2\" |David Askey |Episode: The Students Are Revolting! |- ! scope=\"row\" |Never a Cross Word |Hippie |Episode: Sir or Madam |- ! scope=\"row\" |No Blade of Grass | rowspan=\"3\" |1970 |1st Hun. |Cornel Wilde | |- ! scope=\"row\" |UFO |Rating |Ken Turner |Episode: Destruction |- ! scope=\"row\" |The Ballad of Tam Lin |Second Coven |Roddy McDowall | |- ! scope=\"row\" |Day of the Daleks |1972 |Shura |Paul Bernard |All episodes |- ! scope=\"row\" |Justice |1973 |Cyril Butler |James Ormerod |Episode: Covenant for Quiet Enjoyment |- ! scope=\"row\" |The Sweeney |1978 |Sid (uncredited) | |Episode: Hearts and Mind |- ! scope=\"row\" |BBC2 Playhouse |1983 |Flash Man |Jim O'Brien |Episode: Jake's End |- ! scope=\"row\" |Small Faces: All or Nothing 1965\u20131968 |2010 |Himself |David Peck |as a member of Small Faces, and also interviews |} == References == ==External links== * * * Entries at 45cat.com * Category:1945 births Category:2020 deaths Category:English keyboardists Category:English rock keyboardists Category:People from Stratford, London Category:British rhythm and blues boom musicians Category:Small Faces members Category:20th-century English male actors Category:English male film actors Category:English male television actors Category:Male actors from London Category:Musicians from London ",
