    "text": "The Evangelical Social Congress (, ESK) was a social-reform movement of German evangelists founded in Whitsuntide in 1890. Various groups were united in the Congress, although, in the end, the Congress failed to set forth a united programme of \"Christian socialism\" (more so because people like Friedrich Naumann and Adolf Stoecker would depart from the Congress). The Congress never carried a large membership, and was only marginal compared to the Verein f\u00fcr Socialpolitik, an organization that currently still exists. ==Associated people== * Otto Baumgarten * Paul Gohre * Adolf von Harnack (longtime president of the Congress) * Friedrich Naumann * Martin Rade * Paul Rohrbach * Gerhart von Schulze-G\u00e4vernitz * Walter Simons * Adolf Stoecker * Max Weber ==Further reading== * * * Category:Lutheran organizations ",
