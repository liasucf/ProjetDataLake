    "text": "Peach Pit is an indie pop band from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The Canadian band is led by singer and rhythm guitarist Neil Smith, lead guitarist Christopher Vanderkooy, bassist Peter Wilton, and drummer Mikey Pascuzzi. They describe their own music as \"chewed bubblegum pop\", whereas critics have described their sound as sad pop, and surf rock and is characterized by a soft spoken vocal style and guitar driven rock melodies. The band's music videos are produced by videographer Lester Lyons-Hookham. The band sported the same clothes for every live performance during their \"Being So Normal\" album phase after buying them for their first music video shoot. == History == The group formed when high school friends, Neil Smith and Chris Vanderkooy, decided to collaborate on a musical project in 2014. Peter Wilton and Mikey Pascuzzi joined them on bass and drums. In June 2016, the band released its debut EP, Sweet FA, produced and recorded by Smith's former roommate Harley Small at The Space Studios in Vancouver BC. The name comes from Chris\u2019s great-great grandfather, who was a legend amongst local peach farmers. They quickly began work on their follow up release and debut LP, Being So Normal. The album was again produced and recorded by Harley Small at The Space Studios and was released in September 2017 on the Vancouver indie label Kingfisher Bluez.' Vocalist/rhythm guitarist Neil Smith was formerly part of the folk band Dogwood and Dahlia. Smith and bassist Peter Wilton formerly worked as Amazon delivery drivers, guitarist Christopher Vanderkooy worked at a local Vancouver brewery, and drummer Mikey Pascuzzi worked as a carpenter. The band quit their jobs to go on their first tour of North America, Europe and Asia from 2017-2018. They have been touring steadily ever since the release of their debut album. Peach Pit performed at Bonnaroo, Shaky Knees Music Festival, CBC Music Festival, and Capital Hill Block Party in 2019 and opened for Two Door Cinema Club in a tour of the U.S. and Canada in 2019. \"You and Your Friends\" is their sophomore album, released on 4/20. == Members == * Neil Smith \u2014 lead vocals, rhythm guitar * Christopher Vanderkooy \u2014 lead guitar * Peter Wilton \u2014 bass guitar, live vocal harmonies * Mikey Pascuzzi \u2014 drums == Discography == === Albums === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\" |Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:23em;\" |Album details |- |- ! scope=\"row\" |Being So Normal | * Released: September 15, 2017 * Label: Self-released * Format: Digital download, streaming, vinyl, CD |- ! scope=\"row\" |You and Your Friends | * Released: April 3, 2020 * Label: Columbia Records * Format: Digital download, streaming, vinyl, CD |} === EPs === *Sweet FA (2016) === Live albums === *Peach Pit on Audiotree Live (2017) === Singles === * Alrighty Aphrodite (September 12, 2017) appeared on Billboard Canada Rock chart for 15 weeks, peaking at #37 * Did I Make You Cry on Christmas Day?
