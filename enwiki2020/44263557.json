    "text": "State Route 88 Frog Jump is an unincorporated community in Crockett County, Tennessee, in the United States. The community lies along a rural stretch of State Route 88 between Halls to the west and Maury City to the east. The community's name is believed to be a humorous reference to its small size, namely that it's small enough for a frog to jump over in a single hop.Larry Miller, Tennessee Place Names (Indiana University Press, 2001), p. 80. ==Notable inhabitants== * Stephen Fincher, a former U.S. congressman, lives in Frog Jump ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Crockett County, Tennessee Category:Unincorporated communities in Tennessee ",
