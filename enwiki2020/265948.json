    "text": "The Jiaqing Emperor (13 November 1760 \u2013 2 September 1820), personal name Yongyan, was the seventh emperor of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty, and the fifth Qing emperor to rule over China proper, from 1796 to 1820. He was the 15th son of the Qianlong Emperor. During his reign, he prosecuted Heshen, the corrupt favorite of his father, and attempted to restore order within the Qing Empire while curbing the smuggling of opium into China. ==Early years== Yongyan was born in the Old Summer Palace, 8 km (5 mi) northwest of the walls of Beijing. His personal name, \"Yongyan\" (\u6c38\u7430), was later changed to \"Yongyan\" (\u9852\u7430) when he became the emperor. The Chinese character for yong in his name was changed from the more common \u6c38 to the less common \u9852. This novelty was introduced by the Qianlong Emperor, who believed that it was not proper to have a commonly used Chinese character in an emperor's personal name due to the longstanding practice of naming taboo in the imperial family. Yongyan was the 15th son of the Qianlong Emperor. His mother was Noble Consort Ling, the daughter of Wei Qingtai (\u9b4f\u6e05\u6cf0), a Han Chinese official whose family had been long integrated into the Manchu Eight Banners as part of a Han Banner. The Qianlong Emperor originally had two other sons in mind for succeeding him, but both of them died early from diseases, hence in December 1773 he secretly chose Yongyan as his successor. In 1789, the Qianlong Emperor instated Yongyan as \"Prince Jia of the First Rank\" (\u5609\u89aa\u738b; or simply \"Prince Jia\"). ==Accession to the throne== In October 1795, the 60th year of his reign, the Qianlong Emperor announced his intention to abdicate in favour of Prince Jia. He made this decision because he felt that it was disrespectful for him to rule longer than his grandfather, the Kangxi Emperor, who was on the throne for 61 years. Prince Jia ascended the throne and adopted the era name \"Jiaqing\" in February 1796, hence he is historically known as the Jiaqing Emperor. For the next three years however, the Jiaqing Emperor was emperor in name only because decisions were still made by his father, who became a Taishang Huang (emperor emeritus) after his abdication. After the death of the Qianlong Emperor in the beginning of February 1799, the Jiaqing Emperor took control of the government and prosecuted Heshen, a favourite official of his father. Heshen was charged with corruption and abuse of power, stripped of his titles, had his property confiscated, and ordered to commit suicide. Heshen's daughter-in-law, Princess Hexiao, a sister of the Jiaqing Emperor, was spared from punishment and given a few properties from Heshen's estates. At the time, the Qing Empire faced internal disorder, most importantly the large-scale White Lotus (1796\u20131804) and Miao (1795\u20131806) rebellions, as well as an empty imperial treasury. The Jiaqing Emperor engaged in the pacification of the empire and the quelling of rebellions. He endeavored to bring China back to its 18th-century prosperity and power. However, due in part to large outflows of silver from the country as payment for the opium smuggled into China from British India, the economy declined. ===Renaming Vietnam=== The Jiaqing Emperor refused the Vietnamese ruler Gia Long's request to change his country's name to Nam Vi\u1ec7t. He changed the name instead to Vi\u1ec7t Nam.Woodside 1971, p. 120. Gia Long's \u0110\u1ea1i Nam th\u1ef1c l\u1ee5c contains the diplomatic correspondence over the naming. ===Opposition to Christianity=== The Great Qing Legal Code includes one statute titled \"Prohibitions Concerning Sorcerers and Sorceresses\" (\u7981\u6b62\u5e2b\u5deb\u90aa\u8853). In 1811, a clause was added to it with reference to Christianity. It was modified in 1815 and 1817, settled in its final form in 1839 under the Daoguang Emperor, and abrogated in 1870 under the Tongzhi Emperor. It sentenced Europeans to death for spreading Catholicism among Han Chinese and Manchus. Christians who would not repent their conversion were sent to Muslim cities in Xinjiang, to be given as slaves to Muslim leaders and beys. ===Chinese nobility=== The Jiaqing Emperor granted the title Wujing Boshi () to the descendants of Han Yu. ==Death and burial== On 2 September 1820, the Jiaqing Emperor died at the Rehe (Jehol) Traveling Palace (\u71b1\u6cb3\u884c\u5bab), 230 km (140 mi) northeast of Beijing, where the imperial court was in summer quarters. The Draft History of Qing did not record a cause of death. Some have alleged that he died after being struck by lightning, but others prefer the theory that he died of a stroke, as the emperor was quite obese. He was succeeded by his second son, Mianning, who became known as the Daoguang Emperor. Renzong was interred amidst the Western Qing Tombs, 120 km (75 mi) southwest of Beijing, in the Chang (\u660c; lit. \"splendid\") mausoleum complex. ==Family== See also: Consorts of the Jiaqing Emperor Consorts and Issue: * Empress Xiaoshurui, of the Hitara clan (; 2 October 1760 \u2013 5 March 1797) ** Second daughter (2 June 1780 \u2013 6 September 1783) ** Minning, the Daoguang Emperor (; 16 September 1782 \u2013 26 February 1850), second son ** Princess Zhuangjing of the First Rank (; 20 October 1784 \u2013 27 June 1811), fourth daughter *** Married Manibadala (; d. 1832) of the Tumed Borjigit clan in November/December 1802 ** Miscarriage at three months (18 August 1785) * Empress Xiaoherui, of the Niohuru clan (; 20 November 1776 \u2013 23 January 1850) ** Seventh daughter (2 August 1793 \u2013 July/August 1795) ** Miankai, Prince Dunke of the First Rank (; 6 August 1795 \u2013 18 January 1838), third son ** Mianxin, Prince Ruihuai of the First Rank (; 9 March 1805 \u2013 27 September 1828), fourth son * Imperial Noble Consort Heyu, of the Liugiya clan (; 9 January 1761 \u2013 27 April 1834) ** Prince Mu of the Second Rank (; 4 February 1779 \u2013 10 June 1780), first son ** Princess Zhuangjing of the Second Rank (; 30 January 1782 \u2013 4 April 1811), third daughter *** Married Sodnamdorji (; d. 1825) of the Khorchin Borjigit clan on 24 December 1801 * Imperial Noble Consort Gongshun, of the Niohuru clan (; 28 May 1787 \u2013 23 April 1860) ** Eighth daughter (8 March 1805 \u2013 December 1805 or January 1806) ** Princess Huimin of the First Rank (; 18 February 1811 \u2013 June/July 1815), ninth daughter ** Mianyu, Prince Huiduan of the First Rank (; 8 March 1814 \u2013 9 January 1865), fifth son * Consort Shu, of the Wanyan clan () * Consort Hua, of the Hougiya clan (; d. 3 August 1804) ** Sixth daughter (2 August 1789 \u2013 1790) * Consort Zhuang, of the Wanggiya clan (; d. 9 March 1811) * Consort Xin, of the Liugiya clan (; 26 April 1783 - 26 November 1822) * Concubine Jian, of the Guan clan (; d. 14 May 1780) ** First daughter (14 May 1780 \u2013 24 November 1783) * Concubine Xun, of the Shen clan () ** Princess Hui'an of the Second Rank (; 31 December 1786 \u2013 June/July 1795), fifth daughter * Concubine Chun, of the Donggiya clan (; d. 30 November 1819) * Concubine Rong, of the Liang clan (; d. 15 June 1826) * Concubine En, of the Uya clan (; 21 October 1791 \u2013 7 March 1846) * Concubine An, of the G\u016bwalgiya clan (; 1 March 1785 \u2013 29 July 1837) ==Ancestry== ==In fiction and popular culture== * Portrayed by Yu Yang in War and Beauty (2004) * Portrayed by Xin Baiqing Legend of Jiaqing (2005) * Portrayed by Shaun Tam in Succession War (2018) * Portrayed by Tang Jiatong in Story of Yanxi Palace (2018) * Portrayed in Throne of Jade (2006), a historical fantasy novel by Naomi Novik. == See also == * Chinese emperors family tree (late) == References == === Citations === === Sources === * * * == External links == * Category:1760 births Category:1820 deaths Category:Qing dynasty emperors Category:18th-century Chinese monarchs Category:19th-century Chinese monarchs Category:Emperors from Beijing Category:Persecution of Christians Category:1790s in China Category:1800s in China Category:1810s in China Category:Qianlong Emperor's sons ",
