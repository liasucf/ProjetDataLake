    "text": "A nipper or tile nipper (like a pair of scissors or pliers) is a tool used to \"nip\" or remove small amounts of a hard material, such as pieces of a tile which needs to be fitted around an odd or irregular shape. Drop forged tile nippers with soft plastic handle sheaths.For tile that requires a straight cut a tile cutter is used. This is a small mechanical device where the tile is placed, aligned and clamped on a platform; lightly \"scored\" with a cutting wheel and snapped in two with a handled slicer (blade similar to a paper cutter in appearance). For larger jobs an electric tile saw or wet saw is used; this saw is similar to a small mitre saw except that water is distributed on the saw blade to lessen the effects of heat and friction. A rail nipper is used in rail transport modelling to cut rail tracks. ==See also== *Tin snips *Pliers *Electrical wire cutting == References == * Reader's Digest Book of Skills & Tools Category:Cutting tools ",
