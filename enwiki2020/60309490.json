    "text": "About the Boy Who Plays the Tin Drum () is the thirteenth studio album by Latvian band Brainstorm. It was produced by Povel Olson and David Larsson, and was released on 25 April 2018 by Pr\u0101ta V\u0113tras ska\u0146u ierakstu komp\u0101nija. English and Russian language versions with different track listings were released later in the year. Upon release, the album received mixed reviews by the Latvian media. == Background and recording == The lyrics and music for the album' songs were written by the band as a whole as opposed to any particular member. The album's title is a reference to German writer G\u00fcnter Wilhelm Grass' book Tin Drum, about the boy Oskar Matzerath, who distances himself from the horror of World War II. The album was recorded in three places: R\u012bga, Ik\u0161\u0137ile and Stockholm, and was produced by Swedish producers Povel Olson and David Larsson. As customary for the band, the album's songs were recorded in three different versions: Latvian, Russian and English. == Release == The Latvian version of the album, Par to z\u0113nu, kas sit sk\u0101rda bungas, was released on April 25, 2018. One month later on May 25, the band released the English version, About the Boy Who Plays the Tin Drum, with lyrics of most songs translated into English as well as a different track order and without the Latvian version's title track. A third version, Wonderful Day, was released in Moscow on December 13. == Reception == The album received mixed reviews by the Latvian media. Kaspars Zavi\u013cevskis of Delfi described the album as balladic and romantic, calling it a candidate for the best pop album of 2018. On the other hand, Sandris Vanzovi\u010ds from Neatkar\u012bg\u0101 R\u012bta Av\u012bze wrote it was the worst of their albums, claiming that other than \u201c\u201dPar to z\u0113nu, kas sist sk\u0101rda bungas\u201d, \u201cTevis d\u0113\u013c\u201d and \u201cPa\u0161u d\u0101rg\u0101ko,\" the rest was \"a mix of Eurovision, ABBA-esque pop hits, Latvian 80s music and unnecessary experiments.\" J\u0101nis \u017dilde wrote for TVNET that the album sounded like \u201cfour men doing their jobs,\u201d calling the music \"popcorn rock\" that didn't differentiate itself from other music on the radio. == Track listing == ===Par to z\u0113nu, kas sit sk\u0101rda bungas (Latvian version)=== ===Wonderful Day (Russian Version)=== ===About the Boy Who Plays the Tin Drum (English Version)=== == References == Category:2018 albums Category:Brainstorm (Latvian band) albums ",
