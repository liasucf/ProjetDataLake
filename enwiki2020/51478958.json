    "text": "White Topee (1954) is a novel by Australian writer Eve Langley.Austlit - White Topee by Eve Langley ==Plot summary== The novel is set in Gippsland, Victoria, which is depicted as an idyllic place with peoples from many nations working on the land in harmony. The novel is a sequel of sorts to the author's earlier book The Pea-Pickers, and features the same characters two years later. ==Critical reception== Peter Harding, writing in The Sydney Morning Herald, found the novel \"is, more than anything else, a poem. Plain prose and formal verse intersperse many of its 250 pages, but much of it is a poem disguised as prose. The poem is about Australia and Italians, and about a poet's ecstatic, anguished memories of youth in Gippsland and probably somewhere in northern Australia. And in reading it one is in the presence of something great amid a rambling eccentricity.\"\"The Burning Red Log\" by Peter G. Harding, The Sydney Morning Herald, 21 August 1954, p11 Peggy Wright was impressed with the novel in The News (Adelaide): \"It is impossible to be lukewarm about Eve Langley. Either you lap up her strikingly original prose, or you wonder what the heck she's writing about. Personally, I can take all Eve Langley likes to write, and come back for more...The book is packed with lively characters music- loving Italians, and casual Australians, university graduates and laborers. Every page is rich with a sincere, almost passionate love of Australia.\"\"Her Prose is Striking\" by Peggy Wright, The News, 29 July 1954, p23 == See also == * 1954 in Australian literature ==References== Category:1954 Australian novels Category:Angus & Robertson books Category:Novels set in Victoria (Australia) ",
