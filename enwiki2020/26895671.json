Morenci is the largest copper mine in North America, and Morenci copper mineral specimens are beautiful, abundant, and relatively inexpensive. Creedite specimen, 11 x 7 x 3 cm, from Santa Eulalia, Chihuahua, formerly in the Perkins D. Sams collection. Mineral collecting is the hobby of systematically collecting, identifying and displaying mineral specimens. Mineral collecting can also be a part of the profession of mineralogy and allied geologic specialties. Individual collectors often specialize, for example collecting examples of the various colors and forms taken by the mineral calcite, calcite from widely scattered locations in a region or the world, or minerals found in pegmatites. ==History== Generally considered the \"father of mineralogy\", Georgius Agricola (1494\u20131555) was also an avid mineral collector. He wrote several books, including two of enduring significance: De Re Metallica, an early treatise on mining, and De Natura Fossilium, the first (1546) modern textbook of mineralogy. Another famous 16th century mineral collector was Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II (1552\u20131612). He built a large mineral collection while employing Anselmus de Boodt (ca. 1550\u20131634), his court physician and another avid mineral collector, to expand and tend his collections. After Rudolf's death his collection was dispersed. ==Motivations== Mineral collectors find a variety of reasons to collect minerals. Many minerals are strikingly beautiful and collected for their aesthetic value. Others collect to learn more about mineralogy, the local mining industry and/or local geology. Some simply enjoy exploring the outdoors and socializing and trading with other mineral collectors. Serious collectors will go so far as traveling great distances to find the right specimen. ==Notable public mineral collections== *Australian Museum, Albert Chapman Mineral Collection, Sydney *Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Hillman Hall of Minerals and Gems, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania *Fersman Mineralogical Museum, Moscow *Geological Museum, Mineral Collection, London *Houston Museum of Natural Science, Cullen Hall of Gems and Minerals, Houston *Mercer County District Library (900 specimens on display), Ron & Ruth Langsdon Mineral Collection, Celina, Ohio *Mim Museum (over 1800 specimens representing 450 species on display), www.mim.museum, Beirut, Lebanon * Mineralogisches Museum Hamburg (1500 specimens on display) Mineral hall, Hamburg *Mus\u00e9e de Min\u00e9ralogie, \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des mines de Paris, Paris *Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano, Milan *National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Gem and Mineral Collection, Washington, D.C. *Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, Hall of Gems and Minerals Natural History Museum of Los Angeles; Gems and Minerals. access date: 5/22/2010. *Naturhistorisches Museum Wien (Vienna, Austria), Mineralogy and Petrography Exhibition nhm-wien.ac.at * Terra Mineralia, Mineral Exhibition of the TU Bergakademie Freiberg, Germany, (3500 specimen on display) terra-mineralia.de ==Notable mineral collectors== Malachite specimen from the Copper Queen Mine, Bisbee, Arizona.
