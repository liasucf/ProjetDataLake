The mountains lie between the cerrado biome to the west, Atlantic Forest to the east and caatinga to the north. In the higher regions there are rocky fields, an ecosystem with considerable biodiversity. In 2005 UNESCO recognized a large portion of the Espinha\u00e7o Chain in Minas Gerais as a Biosphere Reserve. Discussions followed on how to better conserve the ecosystems, and the first proposals for a Mosaic of Units of Conservation of the Espinha\u00e7o: Alto Jequitinhonha - Serra do Cabral were made at the end of 2007. Official activities began in April 2008, coordinated by the Biotropics Institute, a scientific and conservationist NGO, in partnership with the Minas Gerais State Forest Institute (IEF) and with the support of Conservation International Brasil and the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). The relevant area was defined as of the upper portion of the Jequitinhonha and Serra do Cabral valley, including conservation units and their buffer zones. It included seven fully protected units and five environmental protection areas in 14 municipalities: Itamarandiba, Senador Modestino Gon\u00e7alves, S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo do Rio Preto, Fel\u00edcio dos Santos, Rio Vermelho, Couto de Magalh\u00e3es de Minas, Santo Ant\u00f4nio do Itamb\u00e9, Serra Azul de Minas, Serro, Diamantina, Buen\u00f3polis, Joaquim Fel\u00edcio, Bocai\u00fava and Olhos-d'\u00c1gua. ==Organization== The Espinha\u00e7o Mosaic in the state of Minas Gerais was recognized by ordinance 444 of 26 November 2010, which also created the managing council. The council includes representatives of public bodies and civil society organizations. It is administered by the ICMBio. As an integrated management tool for a set of conservation units that overlap or are near each other, the mosaic expands conservation actions beyond the scope of the individual units. ==Component units== The mosaic was created with the following conservation units: Rio Preto State Park {|Class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Unit !!
