In 1671 the family returned for a few months to Amsterdam, but then moved to Flanders and settled in Antwerp. His parents joined in Antwerp the secret society of local Calvinists, 'de Consistorie van de Brabantsche Olijfberg' (Consistory of the Olive Mountain of Brabant). Ph.

He signed 'C. bilcius', sometimes the first name in full 'Cornelius' or in short 'Corn:' His dated works are from the period 1672 to 1686. His large-scale canvases were used as wall decorations for castles in Germany such as the Br\u00fchl Palaces. Biltius created mainly trompe l'oeil compositions which are clearly influenced by similar works of his father. Examples of illusionistic effects in his works are the trompe-l'oeil frames, the shade cast by objects on the canvas and the hyperrealist rendering of falling plumes and the dripping of blood of suspended game birds.Cornelis Biltius, Trompe l\u2019oeil with quails, kingfisher, bird net and whistle and Trompe l\u2019oeil with two quails, bird net and whistle at Sotheby\u2019s ==Notes== ==External links== Category:Dutch male painters Category:Dutch still life painters Category:Dutch Golden Age painters Category:Artists from The Hague ",
