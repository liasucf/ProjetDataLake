The village has one pub, the Cross Keys, a small and historic Anglican church and a Methodist chapel. It is from the market town of Leyburn. Bellerby is approximately north of London. Bellerby is situated above sea level and is surrounded by low-lying hills with an open south-easterly aspect. Moorland is located to the North and the West of the village. Becks are an attractive feature of the village, which boasts many. The residents of Bellerby are also proud of their large population of ducks who thrive in the becks and in the suitable gardens of many friendly residents. The closest big town is Leyburn. ==Population and history== A graph showing the changing population of Bellerby between 1881 and 1961. Between 1870 and 1872 Bellerby was described as : \"a township-chapelry in Spennithorne parish, N. R. Yorkshire; 1\u00bd mile N of Leyburn r. station\". According to the 2011 census Bellerby had a population of 364 people. This is an increase of the noted population 130 years earlier in 1881 at 311 people residing within Bellerby. The population of the village decreased to 266 in 1901, proceeding to stay low until 1931 when the population peaked at 370 people. The population then decreased to 318 in 1961 and appears to have remained constant ever since. The population of Bellerby could have decreased in the early 1900s due to a large proportion of people migrating from the UK (and from all over Europe) to America seeking job opportunities and to experience the ever- expanding American cities such as New York. Another reason for the decrease of the village population could be Urbanisation. Because urbanisation offers many job opportunities and the prospect of a better and more fulfilled life within the city many villagers and people who had formerly lived in rural areas of the UK migrated to the bigger cities. Bellerby is mentioned in the Domesday Book. In the book Bellerby was known as \"Belgebi\" which derives from Old Norse meaning Berg's farmstead or clearing. The book describes Bellerby as being medium by having a population of 15 households, and the total tax assesd as large (6 geld units). The households are broken down into 13 villagers and 2 smallholders. Bellerby's Value to the Lord in 1066 is noted as \u00a31.6 and its Value to lord in 1086 remains the same. Bellerby had 6 ploughlands (ploughs possible), 1 lord's plough team, 4 men's plough teams and an 8-acre meadow. The Lord in 1066 was Thor. The Lord in 1086 was Enisant Musard. The Tenant-in- chief in 1086 was Count Alan of Brittany.

It has three buildings, the first of the three buildings was built before 1801. The present church was designed to be more colourful than her predecessor, with stained glass windows showing the birth, death and resurrection of Jesus. Bellerby was first documented in the Domesday Book in 1806, and originally in the Parish of Spennithorne. It is recorded that the parishioners of Bellerby and Skeltoncote sent a petition to the Pope in Rome in 1474 (Pope Sixtus IV), asking him to sponsor the use of a chapel in Bellerby for Mass and the appointment by the Rector of Spennithorne of a priest to serve the Chapel, and provided him with a home in Bellerby. In 1847 Belleby chapel was licensed for Baptisms, Marriages, Burials, and this is also when the registers began. After a lot of fund raising on the parish's behalf, the church was restored with a new roof and decoration inside. In January 2006, a carpet was fitted with in St John's Church. ==Weather== A graph showing the average monthly temperatures for Bellerby and the UK during 2012 Bellerby has experienced severe floods across its history, with the most recent floods occurred during October 2012 (said to be the second great flood since the 1930s), and in June 2019.
