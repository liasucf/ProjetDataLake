    "text": "The Christian Standard Bible The Christian Standard Bible (CSB) is a modern English Bible translation of the Christian Bible. Work on the translation was completed in June 2016, with the first full edition released in March 2017. ==History== The Christian Standard Bible (CSB) is a major revision of the 2009 edition of the Holman Christian Standard Bible (HCSB). The CSB incorporates advances in biblical scholarship to improve upon translation decisions, word choice, and style. It also removes some of the novel features of the HCSB, such as consistently translating the tetragrammaton as \"Lord\" rather than \"Yahweh\" and using \"brothers and sisters\" for the plural term \"brothers\" in Greek.Strauss, M.L. A Review of the Christian Standard Bible. Theomelios 44:2. Retrieved 12/16/2019: https://themelios.thegospelcoalition.org/article/a-review-of-the-christian- standard-bible/ The HCSB was translated by an international team of 100 scholars from 17 denominations. The HCSB New Testament was released in 1999, and the entire translation was released in 2004. Work on the CSB revision was undertaken by the Translation and Review Team, a trans-denominational group of 21 conservative Evangelical Christian biblical scholars. Backgrounds represented include Southern Baptist, Lutheran, Presbyterian, conservative Anglican, and non-denominational Evangelical churches. Ongoing translation decisions are governed by the ten member CSB Translation Oversight Committee, co-chaired by Dr. Thomas R. Schreiner and Dr. David L. Allen. ==Translation philosophy== The CSB (and original HCSB) translators used a methodology they termed \"Optimal Equivalence.\" Optimal Equivalence draws from both formal and dynamic translation philosophies, balancing contemporary English readability with linguistic precision to the original languages. Based upon criteria from a quantitative linguistic comparison of eight popular English Bible translations, the CSB was found to hold the most optimal balance of Readable vs. Literal scores. ==Textual basis== The CSB Translation and Review Team used the latest available Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic texts. The Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia 5th Edition (BHS5) was used for the Old Testament and the Novum Testamentum Graece 28th Edition (NA28) and United Bible Societies 5th Edition (UBS5) was used for the New Testament (the HCSB used BHS4 and NA27/UBS4). ==References== == External links == * CSB Bible official website * CSB Bible online reader * Endorsements of the CSB Category:2017 books Category:2017 in Christianity Category:Bible translations into English ",
