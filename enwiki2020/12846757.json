He was a former middleweight boxer with 19 fights from 1926\u20131928.Cy Schindel He was later bitten by the acting bug, and found work as an extra at Columbia Studios, most notably appearing with comedy team the Three Stooges. A skilled stuntman, Schindell performed many pratfalls himself. His ability to deliver straight, tough dialogue (\"youse mugs\") made him a natural for parts as heavies. Shorts like Calling All Curs, Nutty But Nice and Fright Night gave Schindell a chance to bully the Stooges around to great effect. In Matri-Phony and Fright Night the ex-pugilist was knocked cold by the trio, only to have the Stooges (concealed behind a curtain) maneuver the unconscious Schindell like a puppet (when Fright Night was remade in 1955 as Fling in the Ring, this footage was reused). Schindell also memorably played Chizzilini, a parody of Benito Mussolini, in the short I'll Never Heil Again. In addition to his work in Three Stooges shorts, Schindell also appeared briefly in It's a Wonderful Life as the bouncer at Nick's, and made numerous film appearances playing mainly blue collar roles such as a truck driver, a butcher and a policeman. ==Military service and illness== Schindell enlisted in the United States Marine Corps during the 1920sThe Leatherneck, Volume 11 Marine Corps Institute, 1928 and returned to active service for World War II. While on Guadalcanal, he developed a severe case of jungle rot, which eventually developed into terminal cancer. Knowing he was dying, Schindell worked constantly during his illness to assure his family would be financially secure after his death. Schindell died on August 24, 1948 at age 41, and was buried at Los Angeles National Cemetery, Los Angeles, California. His final film appearance was in 1948's Three Stooges film Crime on Their Hands; heavy makeup was used to mask Schindell's cancer-ridden face. ==Selected filmography== * Fugitive Lady (1934) - Man (uncredited) * Murder in the Clouds (1934) - Man at Shooting Gallery (uncredited) * Stranded (1935) - Bridge Worker (uncredited) * The Farmer Takes a Wife (1935) - Fight Spectator (uncredited) * Undersea Kingdom (1936, Serial) - Khan's Guardsman (uncredited) * Fury (1936) - Townsman (uncredited) * Bullets or Ballots (1936) - Bookie Who Throws Bag (uncredited) * The Big Noise (1936) - Schmidt's Henchman (uncredited) * Two-Fisted Gentleman (1936) - Mahoney * Dizzy Doctors (1937, Short) - Dr. Arm's Assistant (uncredited) * 3 Dumb Clucks (1937, Short) - Wedding Guest (uncredited) * I Promise to Pay (1937) - Cy (uncredited) * Back to the Woods (1937, Short) - Indian (uncredited) * It Can't Last Forever (1937) - Hansen's Second (uncredited) * Cash and Carry (1937, Short) - Vault Guard (uncredited) * The Perfect Specimen (1937) - Injured Boxer (uncredited) * Boy of the Streets (1937) - Blackie's Henchman (uncredited) * Wells Fargo (1937) - Minor Role (uncredited) * The Buccaneer (1938) - Pirate (uncredited) * Little Miss Roughneck (1938) - Prisoner (uncredited) * When G-Men Step In (1938) - Phone Man (uncredited) * Over the Wall (1938) - Shower Room Guard (uncredited) * Prison Break (1938) - Party Waiter (uncredited) * I Am the Law (1938) - Strong-Arm Hood at Lindsay's House (uncredited) * You Can't Take It with You (1938) - Man (uncredited) * Juvenile Court (1938) - Referee (uncredited) * Hold That Co-ed (1938) - Policeman (uncredited) * The Spider's Web (1938, Serial) - Cadman (uncredited) * Mutts to You (1938, Short) - Policeman (uncredited) * Hawk of the Wilderness (1938, Serial) - Three Pines (uncredited) * The Little Adventuress (1938) - Performer (uncredited) * Smashing the Spy Ring (1938) - Richards (uncredited) * Three Little Sew and Sews (1939, Short) - Guard (uncredited) * North of Shanghai (1939) - Mug * Flying G-Men (1939, Serial) - Osborne (uncredited) * The Lady and the Mob (1939) - Henchman Collecting Payment (uncredited) * A Ducking They Did Go (1939, Short) - Fruit Vendor (uncredited) * The Rookie Cop (1939) - Butch - Joey's Henchman (uncredited) * Mandrake the Magician (1939, Serial) - Bank Henchman (uncredited) * Missing Daughters (1939) - Mugg (uncredited) * Behind Prison Gates (1939) - Convict (uncredited) * Girl from Rio (1939) - Patron of Blue Bird Gardens (uncredited) * Calling All Curs (1939, Short) - Tony - Dognapper (uncredited) * Golden Boy (1939) - Fighter (uncredited) * Those High Grey Walls (1939) - Convict (uncredited) * A Woman Is the Judge (1939) - Mickey (uncredited) * Beware Spooks!
