It provided district, school and classroom level website support for administrators, parents, teachers and students from kindergarten through 12th grade. The firm's website stated that its service was used by schools in all 50 U.S. states and had been featured in publications such as Newsweek. The firm had acquired the earlier-established competitive products of Jackson Software, the makers of GradeQuick, and Orbis Software, the makers of Easy Grade Pro. == Usage == Edline was used in many schools aiming to have paperless classes and homework, thereby cutting costs. The instructor/teacher could upload such material as upcoming tests, projects, homework, class expectations, and progress reports. The website mainly helped parents see if students have missed any homework. Parents or students could even e-mail teachers if any kind of help is needed. Different schools may have uploaded varying amounts of data and information, depending on teacher preference and school requirements. For instance, it could have been used as a companion website to classroom instruction or textbooks. It could also serve as an online class platform where it would have been possible for students to learn remotely, particularly from their home. Edline worked with other emerging technologies and this could be demonstrated in the way that schools used it with social networks and applications such as Google Apps for Education. In 2009, Archipelago Learning acquired a minority interest in Edline as part of its acquisition by Providence Equity Partners. Providence Equity's Archipelago Files For IPO; Firm Buys Edline .
