    "text": "Wadi Hamra (, red valley) is a valley of Gilf Kebir, in New Valley Governorate in the extreme south-west of Egypt. It is known for its vegetation and rock encarvings.R. A. Bagnold, O. H. Myers, R. F. Peel and H. A. Winkler; An Expedition to the Gilf Kebir and Uweinat, The Geographic Journal, 1939, vol. 93, nr. 4, pp. 281\u2013313. ==Geography== The approximately 20 km long wadi \u1e24amra is the easternmost of three valleys originating from the Abu Ras Plateau in Gilf Kebir running north, consisting of wadi \u1e6cal\u1e25 in the west and wadi Abd el- M\u0101lik in the middle. The name of the wadi derives from the color of the sand, which appears reddish due to its high iron oxide content. ==Vegetation== The upper section of wadi Hamra receives run-off from the plateau and provides groundwater storage capacity for a remarkable growth of trees and shrubs despite of its hyper-arid climate. The vegetation includes Acacia raddiana, shrubs like Maerua crassifolia, fagonias and Zilla spinosa. ==Rock engravings== In wadi Hamra there are three remarkable sites with rock engravings and petroglyphs depicting wild fauna such as giraffes, gazelles and antelopes:Rock art sites of wadi Hamra Retrieved 2020/04/20. * Rhotert\u2019s site in the upper reaches of the wadi, discovered during the Frobenius-Rhotert expedition in 1935.Hans Rhotert, Libysche Felsbilder: Ergebnisse der 11. und 12. deutschen innerafrikanischen Forschungs-Expedition (Diafe) 1933/1934/1935.
