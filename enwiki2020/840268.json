    "text": "The cliffs of Duino () and the gulf of Sistiana, Province of Trieste, Italy, seen from the Rilke Trail The Karst Plateau or the Karst region (, ), also locally called Karst, is a karst plateau region extending across the border of southwestern Slovenia and northeastern Italy. It lies between the Vipava Valley, the low hills surrounding the valley, the westernmost part of the Brkini Hills, northern Istria, and the Gulf of Trieste. The western edge of the plateau also marks the traditional ethnic border between Italians and Slovenes. The region gave its name to karst topography. For this reason, it is also referred to as the Classical Karst. == Geographical position == Typical rural Karst houses in \u0160tanjel (Municipality of Komen), Slovenia Approximate extent of the Karst region The plateau rises quite steeply above the neighboring landscape, except for its northeastern side, where the steepness is less pronounced. The plateau gradually descends from the southeast to the southwest. On average it lies 334 m above sea level. Its western edge, known as the Karst Rim (), is a continuation of the U\u010dka mountain range in eastern Istria, and rises to the east and southeast of Trieste, ending in steep cliffs between Aurisina and Duino. Many interesting geological phenomena occur along the Karst Rim, including the picturesque Rosandra Valley (also known as Glin\u0161\u010dica). Because the Karst steeply descends towards the Adriatic Sea, it is less exposed to the beneficial climatological effects of the Mediterranean. In the past, the main vegetation on the plateau was oaks, but these were replaced by pine forests in the 19th and 20th centuries. Forests now cover only one- third of the Karst. Starting in the Middle Ages, the plateau suffered radical deforestation for economic reasons. Although much of the wood for the closely spaced piles that support the island city of Venice, Italy came from this region, Venice carefully managed the Karst forests as a reserve for naval timber. The most radical deforestation occurred in the mid-nineteenth century due to clear-cutting by local farmers and conversion of the land into pastures for sheep. The Karst is famous for its caves. In Slovenia, they include Vilenica Cave (the oldest show cave in Europe), Lipica Cave, Diva\u010da Cave, Ka\u010dna Cave, Postojna Cave, and \u0160kocjan Caves (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), and Grotta Gigante in Italy (the largest show cave in the world). Most of the Karst is located in the Slovenian Littoral, covering an area of 429 square kilometres, with a population of about 19,000 people. The Karst as a whole has exactly 100 settlements. The town of Se\u017eana is the center of the region on the Slovene side of the border. The main rural centers are the settlements of Diva\u010da, Dutovlje, and Komen. \u0160tanjel is a picturesque clustered settlement at the top of the northern rim of the plateau; its houses are tightly clustered around Turn Hill, giving it the appearance of a medieval town. On the Italian side of the border, important settlements include Opicina, Duino, and Aurisina. Natural conditions, including the bora () wind, and the local way of life all shaped the elements of Karst architecture, creating simple but well- defined forms. One of the main tourist centers in the area is Lipica, with its stud farm (the home of the Lipizzan horse breed) and other tourist facilities. == Language, culture and traditions == Traditional Karst folk costumes in a Slovenian commemorative celebration in Basovizza near Trieste The vast majority of the inhabitants of the Karst Plateau are ethnic Slovenes. Traditionally, only the village of San Martino del Carso (in the municipality of Sagrado), has been inhabited by Friulian speakers, while all the rest of the region was almost entirely Slovene-speaking from the Middle Ages till the late 1940s and 1950s, when Istrian Italians fleeing from Yugoslavia were settled in Karst villages in the Province of Trieste, especially in the municipality of Duino. As a consequence, today an estimated one fifth of the population of the Karst Plateau is Italian speaking, while the rest is mostly Slovene speaking. The Slovenes in the region speak two closely related Slovene dialects, both belonging to the Littoral dialect group. In the southern part of the plateau (in the municipalities of Diva\u010da and Hrpelje-Kozina, and the southern part of the Municipality of Se\u017eana, in the Italian municipality of Monrupino, and in most of the Slovene-speaking areas of the municipality of Trieste), the Inner Carniolan dialect is spoken. In the northern part (the northern part of the Municipality of Se\u017eana, in the Slovenian municipalities of Komen and Miren-Kostanjevica, in the Italian municipalities of Sgonico, Duino-Aurisina and Doberd\u00f2 del Lago, as well in some eastern suburbs of Trieste, like Barcola), the Karst dialect is spoken. The Karst is renowned for its strong red wine, known as teran, prosciutto and its traditional cuisine, which is a mixture of Mediterranean and Central European cuisine. The traditionally produced Karst prosciutto, a sort of dry-cured ham, is protected at the European level. == Prominent natives and residents == Karst peasants in an engraving from Johann Weikhard von Valvasor's work The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola, 17th century Prominent persons that were born or lived in this region include the poets Sre\u010dko Kosovel, Igo Gruden, Ciril Zlobec, and Branka Jurca, social activist Danilo Dolci, architect Max Fabiani, painters Avgust \u010cernigoj and Lojze Spacal, writers Alojz Rebula, Igor Torkar, and Bogomir Magajna, theologian Anton Mahni\u010d, politicians Drago Maru\u0161i\u010d, Josip Ferfolja, and Majda \u0160irca, economist Milko Brezigar, and actress Ita Rina. The picturesque Karst landscape inspired numerous artists who were not from this region, including the poets Rainer Maria Rilke, Alojz Gradnik, and Edvard Kocbek, essayists Scipio Slataper and Marjan Ro\u017eanc, writers Italo Svevo, Fulvio Tomizza, and Susanna Tamaro, and film director Jan Cvitkovi\u010d. Many artists and authors settled in the area, including Josip Osti and Taras Kermauner. == Geographical extension== Municipalities that are completely or partially in the Karst include: *Italy **Savogna d'Isonzo () (partially) **Doberd\u00f2 del Lago () **Sagrado () (partially) **Fogliano Redipuglia () (partially) **Ronchi dei Legionari () (partially) **Monfalcone () (partially) **Duino-Aurisina () **Sgonico () **Monrupino () () **Trieste () (partially) **San Dorligo della Valle () (partially) *Slovenia **Miren-Kostanjevica (partially) **Komen **Se\u017eana **Diva\u010da **Hrpelje-Kozina (partially) Sometimes, the region around Pivka and Postojna is also included. ==See also== * Karst Living Museum Image:View from \u0160tanjel.JPG|The Karst landscape as viewed from \u0160tanjel Image:San Giovanni di Duino - Stivan.jpg|Landscape near Duino Image:Duino castello 09022008 01.jpg|The cliffs of Duino Image:Il Carso a Duino.JPG|Karst landscape in the Province of Trieste Image:Repentabor3.jpg|The fortified church in Monrupino Image:Lokev,Slovenija.jpg|The village of Lokev near Se\u017eana Image:Karst italy doberdo lake.jpg|Lake Doberd\u00f2 Image:Karst italy landscape.jpg|Karst landscape near Doberd\u00f2 del Lago ==References== == Further reading == *Rosanna Bubola, Vivere il Carso edito dalla Pro Loco di Trieste (Basadello di Campoformico (Udine): La tipografica, 2006) *Massimo Gobessi& Sergio Dolce, Il Carso in tasca (Trieste: Edizioni Luglio, 2006) *Elio Forznari\u010d et al., Kras je krasen: vodnik po ob\u010dinah Kra\u0161ke gorske skupnosti (Trieste: Kra\u0161ka gorska skupnost/ Comunit\u00e0 Montana del Carso, 1991) *Daniel Jarc, Il patrimonio culturale del Carso goriziano/ Kulturna dedi\u0161\u010dina gori\u0161kega Krasa (Trieste: SLORI, 1997) *Miran Lapanje, Se\u017eanski Kras (Se\u017eana: Jamarsko dru\u0161tvo, 1984) *Mojca Osvald et al., Kras in slovenska Istra (Ljubljana: Gimnazija Be\u017eigrad, 2007) *Matja\u017e \u017dnidar\u0161i\u010d, Slovenski Kras: umetnostna dedi\u0161\u010dina (Cerknica: Naklo, d.o.o, 1996) ==External links== *Karst in Slovenia.
