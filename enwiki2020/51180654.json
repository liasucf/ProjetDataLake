Booklist praises its \"clever banter\" and \"pitch-perfect emotional resonance,\" affirming that \"with all the fun of a classic teen movie, this one should fly off the shelves.\" In a starred review, Kirkus Reviews writes that \"Alsaid cracks the teen-lit trope of friends becoming lovers wide open, exposing a beautiful truth inside. He also perfectly captures the golden glow of senioritis, a period when teens are bored and excited and wistful and nostalgic all at once. Everything is possible in this handful of weeks, including making up for squandered time.\" == References == == External links == * Author website * Twitter * Facebook * Instagram * Publisher website * Agency website Category:21st-century Mexican writers Category:Mexican male novelists Category:Writers from Mexico City Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Mexican expatriates in the United States Category:University of Nevada, Las Vegas alumni ",
