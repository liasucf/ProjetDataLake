In Catalonia Corriente Roja is called Corrent Roig, while in Galiza it is called Corrente Vermella. ==History== CR was formed as an internal current in the United Left (IU) in 2002, characterized by the defense of communist values they thought had been lost in the progressive deideologization of IU. In 2004 the organization left the coalition. Initially, its members were free to belong to other political parties, part of its membership being until June 2005 affiliated to the Communist Party of Spain (PCE). The most representative figure during this period was the ex-MP \u00c1ngeles Maestro.Left in 2011. Currently the organization is part of the International Workers' League - Fourth International (IWL). The majority of those members of the PCE were expelled from the party in 2005 for supporting the Communist Party of the Basque Homelands (PCTV-EHAK) in the Basque elections of that year, and not the Ezker Batua-Berdeak, the Basque affiliate of the PCE and the IU. In May 2007 the organization suffered a split in Madrid, that formed Comunistas 3. Comunistas 3 accused the Revolutionary Workers Party - Revolutionary Left (PRT-IR) of trying to control Corriente Roja. In the 2009 European elections CR supported and participated in Iniciativa Internacionalista (II-SP), a coalition of the Basque Abertzale Left, Izquierda Castellana, Galician People's Front and different anticapitalist parties and organizations of all Spain led by the writer and playwright Alfonso Sastre. II-SP obtained 178 121 votes (1.15% of the total vote) and no seats in the European Parliament. In the Catalan elections of 2010 CR supported and joined Des de Baix (From Below in Catalan language). Des de Baix was also supported by Anticapitalist Left, In Struggle and Internationalist Struggle. The coalition gained 7 169 votes (0.23% of the total), failing to obtain any seats in the Parliament of Catalonia.Candidatura contra el \"soberanismo de derechas\", e-noticies, 9 de septiembre de 2010.
