Roncalli is now on the site, and most of the buildings are remnants from the days of the single sex schools. St Patrick's was the local high school for Catholic boys, run by the Marist order, and Mercy College was the local Catholic school for girls, run by the Mercy sisters, from their convent, which was situated on what is now the rugby field also known as the thunder dome. The schools were separated by the \"Iron Curtain\" or \"Brown Curtain\", a corrugated iron fence which ran the length of the boundary between the two schools, which kept the boys and girls separated. The penalties for being on the wrong side of the fence were rather severe, any boy caught on the wrong side of the fence without a valid reason was invariably caned. In the last days of St Pats and Mercy, the pupils from St Pats were instructed by the Rector to tear down the fence as a prelude to amalgamation. The event was photographed and featured in the Timaru Herald newspaper. In October 2007, Roncalli College celebrated its 25th Jubilee. == Notable ex-pupils == * Deborah Geels - international diplomat == Notes == == External links== * Roncalli College Website Category:Educational institutions established in 1982 Category:Timaru Category:Secondary schools in Canterbury, New Zealand Category:Catholic secondary schools in New Zealand Category:1982 establishments in New Zealand ",
