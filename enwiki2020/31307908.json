(Reprinted from the Philadelphia Inquirer, February 10, 2008) ==History== The Atlantic City and Shore Railroad, also known as the Shore Fast Line opened in 1906, connecting Atlantic City to Somers Point. In 1907, the line extended into Ocean City, and continued operations until 1946, when the bridge across the Great Egg Harbor Bay burned. On January 18, 1948, service along the Shore Fast Line was discontinued and replaced by a bus line. In the 1970s, cities along the former railroad line began removing the track in the 1970s, and converting into a walking path by adding street lights and stop signs. The portion in Linwood was named after George K. Francis, the city's mayor from 1952 to 1971. The bike path originally existed from Somers Point to southern Linwood. After planning for 10 years, the city of Northfield constructed its bike path in 2000 after receiving a $391,930 grant from the state of New Jersey. On the northern end, the path connects with U.S. Route 30 along local roads in Pleasantville, although the city applied for a grant to build an extension. Pleasantville built portion of its bike path in 2001 at the cost of $178,182 from various grants. The bike path is planned to connect with the newly built bridge along New Jersey Route 52 via Central Avenue, adjacent to Somers Mansion. The state of New Jersey provided a $200,000 grant to extend the path along Central Avenue, with the city of Somers Point covering the remaining $50,000 of the cost. The city applied for another $200,000 grant to finish the project.Landau, J. (n.d.). Bike Paths Lead to Communities Finding Themselves.
