The aircraft is supplied as a complete ready-to-fly-aircraft.Bertrand, Noel; Rene Coulon; et al: World Directory of Leisure Aviation 2003-04, page 66. Pagefast Ltd, Lancaster UK, 2003. ISSN 1368-485X The manufacturer's website is non-functional and has been so since about 2008, so it is not clear if the company is still in business. ==Design and development== The aircraft was designed to comply with the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules. It features a paraglider-style wing, single- place accommodation and a single Radne Raket 120 engine in pusher configuration, or optionally a Bilsam TNA 200 powerplant, intended for heavier pilots. As is the case with all paramotors, take-off and landing is accomplished by foot. The aircraft is built predominantly from welded steel tubing, with different sized propeller cages available to accommodate different engine and propeller combinations. Inflight steering is accomplished via handles that actuate the canopy brakes, creating roll and yaw. ==Specifications (Sky Walker) == ==References== ==External links== * Sky Walker Category:2000s Polish ultralight aircraft Category:Single-engined pusher aircraft Category:Paramotors ",
