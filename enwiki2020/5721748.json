In mathematics, 81% of the 3rd and 4th graders achieved on grade level skills, while 57% were advanced. In science 76% were on grade level which was a sharp decline from 2011's 97%. In 2011, Washington Elementary School had 92% of the third and fourth grades reading on grade level. Ninety seven percent were on grade level in mathematics. In 4th grade, 97% of the students were on grade level in science.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Washington Elementary School Academic Achievement report Card 2011, September 29, 2011 ==Special education== In December 2010, Hanover Public School District Administration reported that 232 pupils or 13.9% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 46% of identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the District administration reported that 264 pupils or 16.6% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Department of Special Education.Hanover Public School District \u2013 Special Education Department \u2013 Annual Public Notice of Special Education Services The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 Hanover Public School District received a $830,617 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011\u201312 and 2012\u201313 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010\u201311. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The District must apply for this added funding. For the 2009\u201310 school year, Hanover Public School District was identified by the Pennsylvania Department of Education for Least Restrictive Environment monitoring. Thirty public school districts were identified in 2009\u201310. The district received an alert letter from the PDE \u2013 Bureau of Special Education. School districts were placed in one of three categories: Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3. The district was placed in Tier 2 due to students spending less than 40% of the school day, in a regular education classroom. The monitoring is a product of the PDE addressing its voluntary settlement in Gaskin V. Pennsylvania which ordered that special education students spend most of their school day (80%) in regular education classrooms with supplementary aids and services to assist funded by the taxpayers.

One hundred ninety six schools districts were selected in 2008\u201309. The District received an alert letter from the PDE \u2013 Bureau of Special Education. School districts were placed in one of three categories: Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3. The District was placed in Tier 3 due to students spending more than 60% of the school day, outside regular education. The monitoring is a product of the PDE addressing its voluntary settlement in Gaskin V. Pennsylvania which ordered that special education students spend most of their school day (80%) in regular education classrooms with supplementary aids and services to assist funded by the taxpayers. In 2010, the District was assigned to the Tier 2 monitoring list, due to students spending less than 40% of their day in a regular education classroom.

The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. ==Bullying policy school safety== In 2012, Hanover Public School District Administration reported there were 24 incidents of bullying in the district.

No reprisals or retaliation shall occur as a result of good faith reports of bullying. The board expects staff members to be responsible to maintain an educational environment free from all forms of bullying. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students.Regular Session 2007\u20132008 House Bill 1067, Act 61 Section 6 page 8 The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives.

Tuition Students who live in the Hanover Public School District's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to Hanover Public School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the Hanover Public School District's schools. The 2012 tuition rates are Elementary School -$10,299.17, High School \u2013 $11,098.39.

This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement.

In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. The District was one of six York County public school districts did apply to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. ===Common Cents state initiative=== The Hanover Public School Board decided to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars.Common Cents program \u2013 Making Every Dollar Count After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. ===Real estate taxes=== Hanover Public School Board levied a real estate tax of 19.4500 mills in 2012\u201313. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate \u2013 land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. On the local level, Pennsylvania district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75\u201385%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2011\u201312 \u2013 19.0700 mills *2010\u201311 \u2013 19.0700 mills *2009\u201310 \u2013 18.6900 millsPennsylvania School District Finances_Real Estate Tax Rates_0910 *2008\u201309 \u2013 18.4900 mills *2007\u201308 \u2013 17.7200 mills. *2006\u201307 \u2013 16.9200 mills. *2005\u201306 \u2013 19.0500 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 The average yearly property tax paid by York County residents amounts to about 4.01% of their yearly income. York County ranked 232nd of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax- rates.org., County Property Taxes 2012, 2012 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008\u201309 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances \u2013 Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010\u201311, 2011 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%).New Census Data on Property Taxes on Homeowners, Tax Foundation, September 22, 2009. ====Act 1 Adjusted index==== The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011\u20132012 school year is 1.4 percent. But the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, costs due to a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increased health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010\u201311 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012\u20132013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011\u201312 school year, Hanover Public School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the Hanover Public School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011\u20132012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index.
