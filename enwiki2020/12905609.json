Martin Korda of IGN gave it 6.9 out of 10 and said that \"despite its bold proclamations of reinventing the tried and tested Diablo template, Dawn of Magic remains an RPG with more than a whiff of the past hanging around it.\" while Emily Balistrieri of the same site gave it 5.4 and criticized its multiplayer, which according to her, lacked variety. In 2011 the game came out for iPhone, but it too got mediocre review of 5 out of 10. ==References== ==External links== *Dawn of Magic (official Deep Silver website) *Blood Magic (official website) *Dawn of Magic (official Atari website) Category:Role- playing video games Category:Action role-playing video games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Video games developed in Russia Category:Windows-only games Category:Windows games Category:2005 video games Category:2007 video games ",
