    "text": "Loud and Clear is the third studio album by the American rock band Autograph, released in 1987. It would be the final Autograph album to feature new material recorded by all five of the original members. The band would not issue another album until 1997. Two of the tracks featured on this album, \"Dance all Night\" and \"She Never Looked that Good For Me\" appeared (along with the band themselves) in the film Like Father Like Son, released the same year. The original album, issued by RCA Records is long out of print. The title song \"Loud and Clear\" featured a music video with Ozzy Osbourne and Vince Neil as extras. == Track listing == == Personnel == *Steve Plunkett - lead vocals, rhythm guitar *Steve Lynch - lead guitar, backing vocals *Randy Rand - bass, backing vocals *Steven Isham - keyboards, backing vocals *Keni Richards - drums ==References== Category:1987 albums Category:Autograph (American band) albums Category:Albums produced by Andy Johns Category:RCA Records albums ",
