Everyone liked the idea, I got to play all the characters and I had a lot of fun making it.\" In an interview with Cameron Adams from news.com.au Lilley said he's been offered cameo's in various commercials. \"certainly if I was smart and wanted a lot more money there\u2019s a lot of money than there is in the music video industry which is extremely low budget. I just do it for fun, this video was so much fun.\u201d ==Track listing== ; 1-track # \"When You Feel This\" 3:24 ; Remixes EP # \"When You Feel This\" [J-Trick Remix] 4:57 # \"When You Feel This\" [MORTEN Remix] 3:06 # \"When You Feel This\" [9Lives Remix] 4:57 # \"When You Feel This\" [Montano & Pizzitola Vs GODLOV Remix] 4:56 # \"When You Feel This\" [Sikdope Remix] 3:43 ==Weekly charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
