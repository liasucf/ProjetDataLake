Retrieved: July 26, 2019. ==Reception== Contemporary reviews of The Sky Spider noted that as a \"bottom of the bill\" B-film, there were many improbable scenes and \"deficiencies in dialogue and acting\". The incredible feat of \"dropping a stick of dynamite from an aircraft, thousands of feet above, was one of the questionable feats.\"Wynne 1987, p. 114. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * Farmer, James H.
