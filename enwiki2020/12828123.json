Some tracks from the album were translated into Spanish and inserted on the version released in Spain and South America for the album Laura Pausini, released in 1994. The same tracks were released in Italian on the English version of the same album, released in 1995. The song Ragazze che, much like the entire album, is dedicated to Silvia Pausini, sister of the singer. ==Promotion== Since Pausini was not known outside Europe at the time the album was released, no tour was yielded to support the album.
