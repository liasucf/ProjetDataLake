It is operated by West Japan Railway Company and Hiroshima Rapid Transit. ==Lines== Shin-Hakushima Station is served by the following lines: * 20px JR West :* Sanyo Main Line :* Kabe Line * Hiroshima Rapid Transit :* 20px Astram Line ==Station layout== ===JR West=== The westbound station building in March 2017 The JR West station consists of two staggered side platforms serving two tracks. Each platform is accessed through a separate station building. A convenience store is located in the westbound ticket hall. Outside the ticket barriers, there is an underpass connecting the two buildings. A dedicated walkway connects the JR West and Astram Line stations. ====Platforms==== ====Adjacent stations==== ===Astram Line=== The Astram Line station has 1 island platform serving two tracks. The platform forms a triangular shape, with the station exit at the wide end of the platform. There is an emergency exit at the other end. To the north of the station, the track immediately leaves the tunnel, and becomes elevated track after passing under the JR West station. ====Platforms==== ====Adjacent stations==== ==History== The station was built to allow a direct connection between the Astram Line and the Sanyo Main Line. Initial plans were to have a circular shell cover the entire passageway connecting the Astram Line and JR West stations. The contract for design was awarded to C+A Coelacanth and Associates in 2012, with a planned opening sometime in 2014. However, structural concerns caused the opening to be delayed by one year, and caused the circular shell to be cut back so it no longer covered the passageway. The station opened on March 14, 2015. A green roof was later installed in the passageway sometime during 2015. ==References== Category:Railway stations in Hiroshima Prefecture Category:Astram Line stations Category:Railway stations in Japan opened in 2015 ",
