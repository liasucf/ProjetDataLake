Long a huntsman of King Louis XV of France with whom he hunted regularly, Vinfrais wrote the article V\u00e9nerie for the 16th volume of the Encyclop\u00e9die, comprehensive on the organization and history of Royal Hunts, informative, but poorly organized, absolutely devoid of any critical spirit and silent on the social costs of hunting on the peasantry of his time. == Bibliography == * Eug\u00e8ne Chapus, Les Chasses princi\u00e8res en France de 1589 \u00e0 1841, Hunting, 1853 * Jules Henri D. de Tardy, Le Particule nobiliaire, * Annie Becq, L'Encyclop\u00e9disme - Actes Du Colloque de Caen, 12\u201316 January 1987 == External links == * Article V\u00e9nerie in the Encyclop\u00e9die * Charles Gautier de Vinfrais on Wikisource * G\u00e9n\u00e9alogie de la famille Gautier de Vinfrais * Certificate marriage of Vinfray Category:People of the Ancien R\u00e9gime Category:People from Saint-Germain-en-Laye Category:Contributors to the Encyclop\u00e9die (1751\u20131772) Category:1704 births Category:1797 deaths ",
