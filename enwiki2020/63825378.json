    "text": "The Calchaqu\u00ed Wars () were a series of military conflicts between the Diaguita Confederation and the Spanish Empire in the 1560\u20131667 period. The wars raged in the Argentine Northwest, in what are now the provinces of Jujuy, Salta, Tucum\u00e1n, Catamarca and La Rioja. ==First War== In 1559, the gobernador Juan P\u00e9rez de Zurita founded the city of C\u00f3rdoba de Calchaqu\u00ed; he then expected local tribes to submit to the encomienda system of servitude, but these tribes resisted this attempt. Spanish Captain Juli\u00e1n Cede\u00f1o captured a curaca known as Chumbicha, and Zurita used him to negotiate with his brother who was the curaca del of the town of Tolomb\u00f3n. This last curaca accepted baptism as part of the negotiations, becoming then known under the Christian name of Juan Calchaqu\u00ed. However, once Juan Calchaqu\u00ed understood the unequal nature of the encomienda he rebelled and led attacks against the Spanish, evicting them of the three cities founded by Zurita: C\u00f3rdoba de Calchaqu\u00ed, Londres in present- day Catamarca Province and Ca\u00f1ete.Hern\u00e1ndez (1995): 147. After the Omaguacas also revolted and destroyed ciudad de Nieva, now known as San Salvador de Jujuy, the whole Spanish population of Tucum\u00e1n was forced to concentrate in its, Santiago del Estero. This was a serious setback for the Spanish conquistadors and in historiography favourable to Spain the war has been labelled \"one of the worst tragedies of our history\".Jornada hist\u00f3rico- geneal\u00f3gica del Tucum\u00e1n y Cuyo, 2002 ==References== Category:Captaincy General of Chile Category:Diaguita Category:Governorate of the R\u00edo de la Plata Category:Indigenous rebellions against the Spanish Empire Category:Spanish conquests in the Americas Category:16th century in the Captaincy General of Chile Category:17th century in the Captaincy General of Chile Category:History of South America Category:Wars involving Argentina Category:Wars involving Chile Category:Wars involving Spain Category:Viceroyalty of Peru ",
