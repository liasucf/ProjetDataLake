(2002). \"Gakush\u016b-in\" in Japan Encyclopedia, p. 230. Gakushuin is composed of Kindergarten, Elementary School, Middle School, High School, and Gakushuin University. ==History== The Peers' School was founded in 1847 by Emperor Nink\u014d in Kyoto.\"History of Gakushuin\" at Gakushuin Women's College; retrieved 2013-2-27. Its purpose was to educate the children of the Imperial aristocracy (kuge).Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1915). The Imperial Family of Japan, p. 26. Prior to the disestablishment of the Peerage in 1947, commoners had restricted access to Gakushuin, with limited slots only to the Elementary School and Middle School. In 1947, with the US mandated disestablishment of the Kazoku system, enrollment in Gakushuin was fully opened up to the general public. The Administration of the School was transferred to the Ministry of Education at this time. Prior to 1947, Gakushuin was administered by the Imperial Household Agency. ===Precepts=== Emperor Ninko had four maxims inscribed on the walls of the Gakush\u016bin building,Brinkley, Frank. (1915). A History of the Japanese People, p. 664. including # Walk in the paths trodden by the feet of the great sages. # Revere the righteous canons of the empire. # He that has not learned the sacred doctrines, how can he govern himself? # He that is ignorant of the classics, how can he regulate his own conduct? The school was moved to Tokyo in 1877. Its new purpose was to educate the children of the modern aristocracy. Members of the Imperial Family continue to study at Gakush\u016bin. ===Timeline=== * 1847: founded as Peers' School * 1877: the school was established in Tokyo * 1884: Gakush\u016bin became an Imperial institution. * 1885: Peeresses' School was created * 1947: Gakush\u016bin became a private institution. ==Presidents== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |- !No.!!Name!!Year!!Title!!Military rank!!Note |- ! 1 | Tachibana Taneyuki | 1877-1884 | Viscount |align=\"center\"| - | Last lord of Miike Domain. |- ! 2 | Tani Tateki | 1884-1885 | Viscount | Lieutenant General (IJA) | Former president of Imperial Japanese Army Academy |- ! 3 | \u014ctori Keisuke | 1885-1887 | Baron |align=\"center\"| - | Member of Privy council. |- ! 4 | Miura Gor\u014d | 1887-1891 | Viscount | Lieutenant General (IJA) | |- ! 5 | Iwakura Tomosada | 1891 | Duke |align=\"center\"| - | |- ! 6 | Tanaka Mitsuaki | 1891-1894 | Viscount | Major General (IJA) | |- ! 7 | Konoe Atsumaro | 1894-1903 | Duke |align=\"center\"| - | The heir of Konoe family.
