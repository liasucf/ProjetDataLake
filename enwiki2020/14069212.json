    "text": "In Flight is the first solo album by singer and producer Linda Perry. The album was released in 1996 and was produced by Bill Bottrell, Sheryl Crow and Michael Jackson. Perry re-released the album in 2005 on her own record label, Custard Records. It was released on CD and vinyl and re-released on streaming platforms. The release contains original videos for the singles \"Freeway\" and \"Fill Me Up\". ==Track listing== ===Music videos=== #\"Fill Me Up\" (Music Video) \u2013 4:44 #\"Freeway\" (Music Video) \u2013 4:35 #\"Don't Do It\" (Music video) \u2013 4:59 ==Songs== \"In Flight\" was described by Perry as a \"an audio diary\" inspired by Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon She said she would have made it during her time as a member of 4 Non Blondes, but she \"didn't have enough influence in the band\". Songs such as \"In My Dreams\" and \"Too Deep\" were written during her time in the band, but not recorded. The album was intended to create an \"atmosphere for visualization in the mind.\" \"Knock Me Out\" was featured on the soundtrack of the film The Crow: City of Angels. Its melody was used by Ukrainian singer Alyosha for her entry in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2010, leading to allegations that her song \"To Be Free\" was plagiarized. == Reviews == Vincent Jeffrey, from All Music, proclaimed the album as, \"Both subtle and bombastic, sweet and aggressive, and intellectually and sonically challenging.\" He also said \"There are a couple overly personal moments within the In Flight playlist, like the opener 'In My Dreams,' but Perry leans on her expressive vocals to keep the dangerously sincere material interesting.\" Larry Cook from AllMusic said, \"She does not show off with powerhouse vocals as much as her earlier album with 4 Non-Blondes, but rather displays a softer tone on many of these songs while maintaining the unique sound of her voice. In Flight is a bit moody and somewhat creepy, which isn't a bad thing at all.\" ==Personnel== * Linda Perry \u2013 vocals, guitars, piano, bass * Bill Bottrell \u2013 guitars, bass, drums * Kevin Gilbert \u2013 keyboards, guitars * Dan Schwartz \u2013 bass, steel guitar * Brian MacLeod \u2013 drums, percussion * Lisa Germano \u2013 violin (appears courtesy of 4AD Records) ===Additional Personnel=== * Grace Slick \u2013 vocals on \"Knock Me Out\" ===Production=== *Bill Bottrell \u2013 producer *Linda Perry \u2013 co-producer * Blair Lamb and Mark Cross \u2013 engineers * Recorded at Toad Hall * Mastered by Joe Gastwirt * Tom Whalley \u2013 A&R; direction * Jill Rose \u2013 project coordination ==References== Category:1996 debut albums Category:Albums produced by Bill Bottrell Category:Albums produced by Linda Perry Category:Interscope Records albums ==External Links== * ",
