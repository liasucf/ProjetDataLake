    "text": "The Great Western Railway (GWR) 7200 Class is a class of 2-8-2T steam locomotive. They were the only 2-8-2Ts built and used by a British railway, and the largest tank engines to run on the Great Western Railway. ==Rebuild and operation== Originally the 4200 class and 5205 class 2-8-0T were introduced for short-haul Welsh coal traffic, but the Stock Market Crash of 1929 saw coal traffic dramatically fall. Built specifically for the short runs of heavy trains in the South Wales Coalfield, Charles Collett took the agreed decision to rebuild some of them with an extended coal carrying capacity and thus greater range and usefulness by adding to the frames, requiring the addition of a trailing wheel set, making them 2-8-2T. With the work carried out at Swindon Works, the first to be converted was 5275 (lot 266), which returned to traffic numbered 7200 in August 1934. An official photograph of the prototype was taken on 27 July 1934 at the usual site outside 'A Shop' for engine pictures. Nos. 5276\u201394 were similarly rebuilt between August and November 1934, becoming 7201\u201319, and nos. 7220\u201339 were rebuilt from 5255\u201374 between August 1935 and February 1936; with both batches, the rebuilding was not in numerical order, but the new numbers were in the same sequence as the old. Nos. 7240\u201353, rebuilt August 1937\u2013December 1939, were selected at random from locomotives numbered in the 4200 series. {| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\" |- ! Class !! Original !!

These bunkers consisted of a higher rivet line increasing the water capacity up to a total of 2,700 gallons allowing the locos to travel longer distances. The bunker was also designed to facilitate the movement of the coal towards the hatch in the cab, however \u2018scuttle bunkers\u2019 would only carry 5 tonnes of coal instead of 6. No.7200 is the only surviving loco of the class to carry one of these unique bunkers. The 54 rebuilt locos found work in most parts of the GWR system, where their great weight was allowed, although the rebuilt chassis length did get them banned from certain goods yards. Many found work in the home counties, deployed on iron ore and stone trains from Banbury. On 17 May 1941 no. 7238 ran into a bomb crater. == Withdrawal == The first member of the class to be withdrawn was number 7241 in November 1962, whilst the last four engines in traffic served until June 1965. Four of the class were bought by Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, and no. 7226 was scrapped there in 1965. No. 7221, a converted 5205 == Preservation == Three locomotives survive, all recovered from Woodham Brothers, though none have yet been returned to operational condition: {| class=\"wikitable\" !|Current Number !|Year Built !|Withdrawn !|Location !|Status !|Photograph !|Notes |- |align=center|7200 |align=center|Jul 1926 |align=center|Jul 1963 |align=center|Buckinghamshire Railway Centre |align=center|Under Restoration |align=center|140px |align=left|Left Woodham Brothers, Barry Island in September 1981. 7200 is unique in that it is the only surviving locomotive of the class fitted with the 'coal scuttle' bunker which enabled it to have a greater water carrying capacity than the rest of the class with 'converted' bunkers. On 12 December 2006, the restored rolling chassis of 7200 left the former iron foundry (J Shop) which made the loco the last Great Western locomotive to receive attention at the historic Swindon Works. Restoration is slow and ongoing but has made good progress in recent years. |- |align=center|7202 |align=center|Aug 1926 |align=center|Jun 1964 |align=center|Didcot Railway Centre |align=center|Under Restoration |align=center|140px |align=left|Left Barry Island in April 1974. |- |align=center|7229 |align=center|Mar 1926 |align=center|Aug 1964 |align=center|East Lancashire Railway |align=center|Under Restoration |align=center| |align=left|Left Barry Island in October 1984. |} ==Models== In 2012, Hornby released models of the 7200 class in both the original GWR green and BR black. 7203, a converted 5275 ==References== == External links == * Great Western Archive \u2013 7200 Class * The 7200 Trust - Restoring 7200 Category:2-8-2T locomotives 7200 Class Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1934 Category:Freight locomotives Category:Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain Category:1\u2032D1\u2032 h2t locomotives ",
