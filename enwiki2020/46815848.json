    "text": "Zariqum was a Sumerian governor (ens\u00ed) during the Ur-III era. Beginning in the 40th year of Shulgi, he was ensi of Susa in Elam. In the reign of Shulgi's successor, Amar-Sin, he became ensi of Ashur. In Amar-Sin's 5th year, Zariqum was again transferred to become governor of Susa; he remained there until Shu- Sin's 4th year. The Assyrian king list does not include his name. It is thought that he is to be placed somewhere before Puzur-Ashur I, and possibly following Akiya. == References== Category:Ancient Assyrians Category:20th- century BC people ",
