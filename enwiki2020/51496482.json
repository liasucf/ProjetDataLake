    "text": "\"Beibs in the Trap\" (stylized in all lowercase) is a song recorded by American rapper Travis Scott featuring Canadian rapper Nav. The track appeared on Scott's second studio album, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, which was released on September 2, 2016. \"Beibs in the Trap\" is a reference to the Canadian singer Justin Bieber, who Scott has collaborated with on \"Maria I'm Drunk\", which also had Young Thug on it from Scott's debut studio album Rodeo (2015). Scott has also collaborated with Bieber on \"No Sense\" from Bieber's fourth studio album Purpose (2015). Scott and Bieber later collaborated on \"Second Emotion\" from Bieber's fifth studio album Changes (2020). \"Beibs in the Trap\" could be a possible reference to American rapper Nicki Minaj's \"Beez in the Trap\" featuring American rapper 2 Chainz, but is clearly a reference to Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight. ==Music video== The music video for \"Beibs in the Trap\", directed by RJ Sanchez, premiered on December 28, 2016, via Scott's Vevo channel. It features Scott and Nav performing the song at a hangar filled with flashing lights and models. A metallic silver Lamborghini is showcased throughout the entire video. Peter A. Berry from XXL wrote; \"The lights and the models' wardrobes make this visual seem like something ripped directly from the upcoming Ghost in the Shell movie, and it looks more than a little cool.\" Eric Skelton of Pigeons & Planes wrote that all that is missing is \"[Justin] Bieber sitting in the corner wearing metallic Hammer pants\". ==Commercial performance== After the release of the music video, \"Beibs in the Trap\" debuted at number 93 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and later reached at number 90 on the chart. The song was eventually certified 2\u00d7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over a million digital copies in the United States. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016\u201317) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 2921 |} ==Certifications== ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2016 songs Category:Nav (rapper) songs Category:Songs written by Travis Scott Category:Travis Scott songs Category:Songs written by Nav (rapper) Category:Songs written by Amir Esmailian ",
