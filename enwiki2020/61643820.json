The not- for-profit shelter operated from 1931 to around 1985. == Mission == By 1931, when the shelter opened, the city of Ponce already offered facilities for the blind (\"Asilo de Ciegos de Ponce\"Carmelo Rosario Natal. Ponce En Su Historia Moderna: 1945-2002. Published by Secretar\u00eda de Cultura y Turismo of the Government of the Autonomous Municipality of Ponce.

Verdadera y Autentica Historia de la Ciudad de Ponce. 1913. p. 115.) and the homeless (\"Asilo de Hu\u00e9rfanos de Ponce\"Eduardo Newmann Gandia. Verdadera y Autentica Historia de la Ciudad de Ponce. 1913. p. 113.). In addition, it also had a shelter for the mentally-incapacitated (\"Asilo de Locos\"Eduardo Newmann Gandia. Verdadera y Autentica Historia de la Ciudad de Ponce. 1913. p. 108.). However, it had no shelter for orphan boys. Albergue de Ni\u00f1os de Ponce filled this need. The shelter's mission was to provide shelter for homeless orphan children. == History == Juan Luis Boscio (1896 - 1980), a local businessman and later mayor of Ponce (1961 - 1964), was one of the founders of the Albergue de Ni\u00f1os de Ponce. The shelter was founded in 1931 on the north side of Calle Villa in Barrio Canas, between Calle Cementerio Civil and Calle Central.Ciudad de Ponce y Playa.
