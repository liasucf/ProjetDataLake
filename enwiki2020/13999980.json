    "text": "Pat Lorje (pronounced \"lor ee eh\") is a Canadian politician. She was a city councillor for Ward 2 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. But in the recent municipal election of Oct 26 2016, she was defeated by Hilary Gough. She previously held the same position from 1979 to 1991, when she resigned to stand as the New Democratic candidate in Saskatoon Wildwood in the 1991 provincial election. She was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in 1991 and served until 2003, including work as cabinet posts in the area of Aboriginal Affairs and Provincial Secretary (February 2001 \u2013 October 2001), Post Secondary Education and Skills Training (Sept. 2001 \u2013 March 2002) and the Environment (March 2002 \u2013 June 2002). She was briefly out of cabinet following an incident involving one of her aides, to whom an investigation determined Lorje had given an \"affectionate slap\". She retired from the legislature and briefly moved to San Francisco with her husband, playwright and theatre director Tom Bentley-Fisher. She later returned to Saskatoon and was reelected to Saskatoon City Council in the 2006 municipal election. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1947 births Category:Women municipal councillors in Canada Category:Living people Category:Saskatchewan New Democratic Party MLAs Category:Saskatoon city councillors Category:Women MLAs in Saskatchewan Category:21st-century Canadian politicians Category:21st-century Canadian women politicians ",
