It lies north of Moordenaar's Karoo and forms part of an escarpment between the Roggeveld Mountains and the Nuweveld Mountains; at 45 km long, the Komsberg stretches from Verlatenkloof Pass to near the Dwyka River gorge. A tributary of the Gourits River, the Dwyka originates in the Komsberg. Komsberg Pass goes over the range, and its highest point is 1,742 m above sea level. == Sources == * Cape West: 2nd edition.
