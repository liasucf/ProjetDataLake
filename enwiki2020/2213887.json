    "text": "\"Sincerely\" is a popular song written by Harvey Fuqua and Alan Freed and published in 1954. It was originally recorded by The Moonglows, the group of which Fuqua was a member and Freed was the manager. The Moonglows' version reached number 1 on the Billboard R&B; chart and number 20 on the Billboard Juke Box chart. After it became known that Freed often insisted on songwriter credits for songs by bands he promoted (which partially led to his downfall in a payola investigation years later), Fuqua noted that Freed had in fact contributed to the songwriting for \"Sincerely,\" and thus his claim to a songwriting credit in this case was legitimate. The best-selling version was a pop cover recorded by the McGuire Sisters, which entered the charts in 1954 and reached number one the next year. It was eventually certified as a gold record. In 1988, a cover of the song by the country quartet Forester Sisters reached number 8 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. ==References== Category:Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs number-one singles Category:1954 songs Category:1954 singles Category:1955 singles Category:The McGuire Sisters songs Category:The Forester Sisters songs Category:Songs written by Harvey Fuqua Category:Chess Records singles ",
