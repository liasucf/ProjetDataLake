Book II, note 1, page 100. Tuttle Publishing. Tra edition (July 2005). First edition published 1972. were a people of ancient Japan who lived in the Satsuma and \u014csumi regions of southern Kyushu during the Nara period. They frequently resisted Yamato rule. After their subjugation they became subjects of the government under Ritsury\u014d, and the Ministry of the Military had an office known as the in charge of their governance. The name also came into use by samurai as a title, . In modern times, Hayato is a Japanese male given name. == History and culture == The Hayato might have been the same as the Kumaso group of around the same time,One theory holds that the Hayato were descendants of the Kumaso. In recent years, though, the theory has taken root that because the \"kuma\" and \"so\" in \"Kumaso\" and the names of the Ata Hayato and \u014csumi Hayato all refer to regions of southern Kyushu, these may have been general names applied to several distinct cultural groups of rebellious local people by the Yamato court. but while the Kumaso are mentioned in the more legendary portions of the Nihon Shoki, the Hayato are recorded in various historical texts until the beginning of the Heian period. Though the Kumaso are generally portrayed as rebellious, the Hayato are listed among the attendants of emperors and princes from as early as Emperor Nintoku's reign.After the death of Emperor Nintoku one individual, named Sobakari in the Kojiki and Sashihire in the Nihon Shoki, assassinated the prince he served on the orders of another prince. However, he was then given sake and assassinated by the prince he had betrayed his master for. The story illustrates the use of Hayato as unofficial military forces. This, along with a mention of Hayato crying before the grave of Emperor Y\u016bryaku after his death, suggests that the Hayato were naturalized as personal servants by the late 7th century. Even after pledging allegiance to the Japanese court, the Hayato continued to resist its rule. After the establishment of \u014csumi Province in 713, the \u014csumi Hayato fought back in 720 with the Hayato Rebellion, but were defeated in 721 by an army led by \u014ctomo no Tabito. The Handen-Sh\u016bju system was implemented in their lands in 800. The population of Yamato immigrants in Kagoshima prefecture in the early 8th century has been estimated at around 9,000 people and one-seventh of the total population. By this estimate, the Hayato population of the time can be calculated as consisting of around 54,000 people (not including Hayato emigrants to Honsh\u016b).Koyama Sh\u016bz\u014d of the National Museum of Ethnology has mathematically estimated that the population of the Japanese islands during the Kofun period was approximately 5,400,000 people. Since the population even in the Nara period remained less than 6,000,000, the Hayato population may be assumed to be around one-hundredth of the total population of the islands. The Hayato were made to emigrate to the Kinai region, and were active in the protection of the court, the arts, sumo, and bamboo work.The Nihon Shoki records that in the court of Emperor Tenmu, in the late 7th century, the Hayato performed sumo in the court, but it is not described as different from the sumo of the Yamato themselves. In 682, the \u014csumi Hayato and Ata Hayato competed in sumo and the \u014csumi side won, and in 695 a bout of sumo between Hayato on the grounds of Asuka-dera drew a crowd of spectators. Many lived in Yamashiro Province, in the south of modern Kyoto. There remains an area called in Ky\u014dtanabe, Kyoto, where many \u014csumi Hayato lived. These were the Hayato governed by the Hayato-shi. The language spoken by the Hayato is not known, except for two words and several personal names documented in contemporary sources. Based on this material, it has been proposed that the Hayato may have been of Austronesian origin.Kakubayashi, Fumio. 1998. \u96bc\u4eba : \u30aa\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8\u30ed\u30cd\u30b7\u30a2\u7cfb\u306e\u53e4\u4ee3\u65e5\u672c\u90e8\u65cf' Hayato : An Austronesian speaking tribe in southern Japan.'. The bulletin of the Institute for Japanese Culture, Kyoto Sangyo University, 3, pp.15-31 . Their culture is also believed to be unique from those of other regions of Japan. In particular, their folk song and dance became famous in the Kinai region as the .The Hayato dance appears repeatedly in the Kojiki, Nihon Shoki, and Shoku Nihongi, performed on the occasion of paying tribute to the court and for the benefit of foreign visitors. An excavation of Heij\u014d Palace discovered wooden shields with a distinctive reverse-S-shaped marking. These shields match those described in the Engishiki, which the Hayato used in court ceremonial functions. The Hayato had roles in various state ceremonies, including those for the new year, imperial enthronement, and visiting foreign officials. According to the ancient records of Hizen province, the Got\u014d Islands were also inhabited by a people resembling the Hayato. The New Book of Tang describes a minor king of , and this Haya has also been interpreted as referring to the Hayato. There are three types of graves archaeologically associated with the Hayato: the widely distributed around the border of Kagoshima and Miyazaki prefectures,These tunnel tombs are focused around Hy\u016bga, \u014csumi, and Satsuma, but the underground stone-slab graves are found mainly in the Satsuma region. Therefore, it is theoried that the former were widely used by various Hayato, while the latter were used specifically by the Ata Hayato. the of the southern Satsuma peninsula, and the found north of the Satsuma peninsula. Another large group of tunnel tombs is located near the \u014csumi area of Kyotanabe. Because of the proximity and because the gravelly soil of the area is not suited to such tombs, these may also be associated with the Hayato. In Japanese mythology, the deity Umisachihiko is considered the ancestor of the ruler of the Ata Hayato. The Hayato Dance may be intended to portray Umisachihiko's pain at being outdone by his younger brother Yamasachihiko. == Regional distribution == ;, or Satsuma Hayato :A Hayato tribe who lived on the Satsuma Peninsula. Before the establishment of Satsuma Province, the area was known as Ata. The Nihon Shoki's section on 682 calls them the Ata Hayato, while the section of the Shoku Nihongi on the year 709 refers to them as the Satsuma Hayato. ; :A Hayato tribe who lived in the northern \u014csumi Peninsula, or by another theory the Kimotsuki plain region.The latter theory is seen in volume 1 of the 1967 They are mentioned in Nihon Shoki article on 682. ; :A Hayato tribe who lived in Tane Province. In 702, the court dispatched an army and conquered the region. ; :A Hayato tribe who lived on the Koshikijima Islands. They are mentioned in the Shoku Nihongi's section on 769. ; :A Hayato tribe who lived in Hy\u016bga Province. The Shoku Nihongi records that in 710, their leader submitted to the court and was awarded the rank of . However, this was before the separation of \u014csumi province from Hy\u016bga Province in 713. The history of Usa Shrine records that later, in 719, the \u014csumi and Hy\u016bga Hayato attacked Japan, perhaps a precursor to the rebellion of 720. == Skeletal findings == Anthropological research on human skeletons of the Kofun period on southern Kyushu has shown that male skeletons found inland differ from those on the Miyazaki plain. Inland skeletons resembled those of J\u014dmon people and northwestern Kyushu Yayoi people,The Yayoi people of northwestern Kyushu are thought to be the descendants of the J\u014dmon people of the region, who adopted and naturalized into the Yayoi culture. The mention in the Hizen ancient records of Hayato- like people in the Got\u014d islands can also be explained if we consider that they too were descended from northwestern Kyushuan Yayoi people. and some groups on the plain also resembled northern Kyushu Yayoi people. Additionally, skeletons excavated from late Yayoi-period ruins on Tanegashima are smaller than those found on Kyushu, and show signs of artificial cranial deformation. == Notes == == References == * Category:Nara period Category:Tribes of ancient Japan ",
