David Nyhan's column was syndicated to more than 16 newspapers and magazines by Creators Syndicate, and after working for The Boston Globe for 32 years, he retired in 2001. A tall man at 6'4\", Nyhan's writing was often characterized as bringing a \"voice to the voiceless.\" He covered national politics and was a frequent source for commentary on presidential races and on the New Hampshire primary in particular. In his last column, he wrote: \"The thing I'll miss most is the chance to shine a little flashlight on a dark corner, where a wrong was done to a powerless peon, where a scarred politician maybe deserved a better fate, where the process went awry, or the mob needed to be calmed down and herded in another direction.\" He died suddenly on January 23, 2005, suffering a heart attack after shoveling snow.Brian C.
