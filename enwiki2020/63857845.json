    "text": "The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in New England (also known as the New England Company or Company for Propagation of the Gospel in New England and the parts adjacent in America) was a British organization to promote missionary activity across the Atlantic in New England and Canada from 1649 until 1786. The Society supported the early efforts of John Eliot in Massachusetts which culminated in the first Bible translation of a Native American language, known as the Eliot Indian Bible. The Society also played a critical role in funding and founding many notable institutions in the United States, which provided outreach to Native Americans, including Harvard Indian College and Dartmouth College. ==References== Category:Religion in New England Category:Religious organisations based in London Category:Christian missions Category:Christian missionary societies Category:Christian organizations established in the 17th century Category:1649 establishments in England Category:Congregationalism in England ",
