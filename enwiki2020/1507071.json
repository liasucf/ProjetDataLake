He became a member of the PGA Tour after a tie for 35th in the 1999 Qualifying School earned him his tour card for the 2000 season. At age 35 in 2002, Perks unexpectedly won The Players Championship, one of the most prestigious tournaments on the PGA Tour. In the final pairing, he played the final three holes in only nine shots, three under par, with only one putt. Perks chipped in for eagle, sank a birdie putt on the Island Green, then chipped in for par to win by two strokes. He was even par 72 for the final round, but only had two pars in the last fourteen Starting the year at 256 in the world rankings, Perks climbed from 203 to 64 with the win, and was named the New Zealand Sportsman of the Year for 2002. It granted a five-year exemption on tour, but was his only win in 202 starts. After making only one cut on the PGA Tour during 2006 and 2007, he announced his retirement in November 2007, and became a commentator on the Golf Channel. ==Professional wins (1)== ===PGA Tour wins (1)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Legend |- style=\"background:#f2ecce;\" | Players Championships (1) |- | Other PGA Tour (0) |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !To par !Margin of victory !Runner-up |- style=\"background:#f2ecce;\" |align=center|1 |24 Mar 2002 |The Players Championship |71-68-69-72=280 |align=center|\u22128 |2 strokes | Stephen Ames |} ==Playoff record== PGA Tour of Australasia playoff record (0\u20131) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No.!!Year!!Tournament!!Opponent!!Result |-style=\"background:#F2C1D1;\" |align=center|1 |2000 |Crown Lager New Zealand Open | Michael Campbell |Lost to eagle on second extra hole |} Nike Tour playoff record (0\u20131) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No.!!Year!!Tournament!!Opponent!!Result |-style=\"background:#F08080;\" |align=center|1 |1996 |Nike Carolina Classic | Glen Hnatiuk |Lost to birdie on first extra hole |} ==Results in major championships== {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !2002 !2003 !2004 |- |align=left|Masters Tournament |CUT |CUT |CUT |- |align=left|U.S. Open |CUT |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=left|The Open Championship |T50 |CUT |CUT |- |align=left|PGA Championship |T29 |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |} CUT = missed the half-way cut \"T\" = tied ==The Players Championship== ===Wins (1)=== {|class=\"wikitable\" !Year!!Championship!!54 holes!!Winning score!!Margin!!Runner-up |- style=\"background:#f2ecce;\" | 2002 || The Players Championship || 1 shot deficit || \u22128 (71-68-69-72=280) || 2 strokes || Stephen Ames |} ===Results timeline=== {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !2002 !2003 !2004 !2005 !2006 !2007 |- |align=left|The Players Championship |style=\"background:lime;\"|1 |T17 |CUT |CUT |CUT |CUT |} CUT = missed the halfway cut \"T\" indicates a tie for a place. ==Results in World Golf Championships== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !Tournament!!2002 |- |align=\"left\"|Match Play |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=\"left\"|Championship |61 |- |align=\"left\"|Invitational |T42 |} \"T\" = Tied ==Team appearances== *World Cup (representing New Zealand): 2002, 2004 ==See also== *1999 PGA Tour Qualifying School graduates *2000 PGA Tour Qualifying School graduates ==References== ==External links== * * Category:New Zealand male golfers Category:Oklahoma Sooners men's golfers Category:Louisiana Ragin' Cajuns men's golfers Category:PGA Tour golfers Category:Sportspeople from Palmerston North Category:1967 births Category:Living people ",
