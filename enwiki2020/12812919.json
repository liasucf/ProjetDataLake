    "text": "Ecosystem Marketplace, an initiative of Forest Trends, is a non-profit organization based in Washington, DC that focuses on increasing transparency and providing reliable information for ecosystem services and payment schemes. The idea of launching Ecosystem Marketplace was borne out of meeting by members of The Katoomba Group, an international working group composed of leading experts from forest and energy industries, research institutions, the financial world, and environmental NGOs dedicated to advancing markets for some of the ecosystem services provided by forests \u2013 such as watershed protection, biodiversity habitat, and carbon capture and storage. Both Ecosystem Marketplace and The Katoomba Group are initiatives under Forest Trends. Ecosystem Marketplace specializes in market-based approaches to environmental protection\u2014in the public and private spheres\u2014regarding greenhouse gases, water, biodiversity, and conservation. Ecosystem Marketplace's website states: \"We believe that by providing solid and trust- worthy information on prices, regulation, science, and other market-relevant issues, markets for ecosystem services will one day become a fundamental part of our economic and environmental system, helping give value to environmental services that have, for too long, been taken for granted.\" Ecosystem Marketplace, \"About Us.\" ==Market Coverage== Ecosystem Marketplace has covered information on a number of areas, including the following: Carbon Relevant material can be accessed via the main Ecosystem Marketplace website, the carbon markets landing page, and the Forest Carbon Portal. * Kyoto-related carbon markets (EU ETS, CDM, JI) * Voluntary over-the-counter markets * North American state and regional markets * Payments for terrestrial carbon sequestration Water Relevant material can be accessed via the main Ecosystem Marketplace website and Watershed Connect. * Water quality and nutrient trading * Schemes to pay for watershed services * Nitrogen offset programs Biodiversity Relevant material can be accessed via the main Ecosystem Marketplace website and the Species Banking Portal. * Conservation banking in the U.S. * Wetland/stream mitigation banking in the U.S. * Australian biodiversity offset programs * Voluntary biodiversity offsets Communities Relevant material can be accessed via the main Ecosystem Marketplace website and the Communities Portal. * PES program design * community ecosystem management * community buyer relations * poverty equity * community as buyer * payments compensation * land tenure rights ==State Of Reports== Biodiversity * Madsen, Becca, Nathaniel Carroll, and Kelly Moore Brands. 2010 State of Biodiversity Markets.
