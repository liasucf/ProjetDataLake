    "text": "Padarn Halt was a passenger only railway station located in Llanberis, Gwynedd, Wales, on the western shore of Llyn Padarn. It opened on 21 November 1936 and closed on the outbreak of the Second World War. The line through the station remained in use for excursions until 1962 and for freight until 1964; it was lifted in 1965. The LMSR closed the Llanberis branch to regular passenger services in 1930, though frequent Summer excursions continued to run. In 1934 the company reinstated a regular Saturdays only train specifically to serve Caernarfon market. In may parts of Britain \"Market Trains\" were an established part of local commerce and social life in a way which has passed into history. Llanberis station was not in the centre of Llanberis, so the company built the halt half a mile from the terminus specifically for this market traffic. The halt opened on 21 November 1936, from which time the market trains used the halt instead of Llanberis station. The halt consisted of an unlit single wooden platform on trestles, with a very small wooden waiting shelter at its southern end. It was accessed by a gravel footpath which continued over the tracks to the lakeside by a foot crossing. The 1939 Working timetable shows that some excursions made unadvertised stops at the halt.The station and line's Summer 1939 Working Timetable, via Rail Chronology The track bed from Llanberis through the site of the halt as far as is now occupied by the improved A4086, which by-passes the centre of Llanberis. No trace of the station remains. ==References== ===Sources=== * * * * ==External links== * The station on a navigable OS Map, via National Library of Scotland * The station and line, via Rail Map Online * The station and line CLS with mileages, via Railway Codes * Images of the station, via Yahoo * The station and line, via Rail Chronology * The station and line, via Signalling Record Society * 1957 railtour including the line, via Manchester Railway Society * 5 May 1957 railtour record, via Six Bells Junction Category:Former London, Midland and Scottish Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1936 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1939 Category:Disused railway stations in Gwynedd Category:Llanberis ",
