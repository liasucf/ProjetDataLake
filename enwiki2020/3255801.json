    "text": "By the Tree was a contemporary Christian rock group. ==Overview== Ben Davis, Kevin Rhoads, Chuck Dennie, and Aaron Blanton, backstage at the 2001 Dove Awards.By the Tree was founded in Weatherford, Texas in 1997 by Chuck Dennie and Bala Boyd. By the Tree got their start playing a series of small venues -- predominantly churches -- throughout the southern and southwestern United States. In 1999 they released two independent, self-produced CDs, which they sold at their concerts. By 2001, these two CDs had sold a combined 30,000 units, which more than recouped their production costs, and additionally brought them to the attention of the Christian music industry. The band eventually signed with Fervent Records, part of the BMG music publishing company. Their first national U.S. commercial recording was Invade My Soul. The album charted on the Billboard Christian Albums chart and Independent chart. The album eventually went on to win two Dove Awards: The album itself won Best Modern Rock/Alternative Album, and the album's title track won Best Recorded Song. By the Tree achieved a number-one hit single with a cover of Jeremy Camp's song \"Beautiful One\" in 2004. The song reached the number-one position on the Billboard Hot Christian Songs chart on October 30, 2004, and stayed in the top spot for four weeks. By the Tree released four albums under the Fervent label. == Members == Current * Chuck Dennie - vocals *Aaron Blanton - drums * Ben Davis - bass Former *K.S.
