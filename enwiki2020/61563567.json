    "text": "The Jougne-Ecl\u00e9pens Railway (Chemin de fer de Jougne \u00e0 Ecl\u00e9pens, JE) was a railway company in Switzerland and existed from 1870 to 1876. == History== Le Day Viaduct near Vallorbe The Jougne\u2013Ecl\u00e9pens opened a railway from a junction with the Jura Foot Railway of the West Switzerland Company (Compagnie de l'Ouest Suisse) at Daillens (near Ecl\u00e9pens) to Vallorbe on the Swiss border on 1 July 1870 and its extension from Vallorbe to Jougne in France on 1 July 1875. The continuation of the line to Pontarlier was owned by the Chemins de fer de Paris \u00e0 Lyon et \u00e0 la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e (PLM). The route of the JE, together with the Simplon Railway, which then ended in the Valais, is the shortest transit route from Paris to Italy. Until the Simplon Tunnel was built, it offered no advantage over the Paris\u2013Lyon\u2013Geneva and Pontarlier\u2013Les Verrieres\u2013Neuch\u00e2tel lines. The regional traffic in the sparsely populated area was low and the JE collected too little income. In 1872, the Western Switzerland Railways (Chemins de fer de la Suisse Occidentale, SO) acquired a significant stake in JE to prevent it from being taken over by its competitors as a result of its continuing financial problems. The SO took over the bankrupt company completely on 20 December 1876. The section from Vallorbe to Jougne was closed on 19 April 1939 and it was dismantled in 1942 because the tunnel at Jougne had been blown up in the Second World War. == Rolling stock == The following is a list of locomotives used by the JE: {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !
