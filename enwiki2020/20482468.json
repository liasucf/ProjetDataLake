In the second year of middle school, Oh followed a group of friends to an audition for SM Entertainment, held in Daegu, but was rejected. However, another company contacted her saying that she had qualified and she moved to Seoul, debuting four months later at the age of 15. Oh was accepted into Anyang Arts High School after her band's disbandment and went on to become an actress. She changed her name from Haet- nim to Yeon-seo after consulting a shaman with her mother. Oh then entered Dongguk University, joining the theater and film department. ==Career== ===Beginnings=== Oh Yeon-seo made her entertainment debut in 2002 when she was 15-years-old under her birth name Oh Haet-nim, with the band LUV. They released their first album, Story, with the singles \"Orange Girl\" and \"I Still Believe in You\". The band was short-lived and disbanded six months later due to their low popularity. Oh then shifted to acting and made her debut appearance in the 2003 drama Sharp, but remained unknown for a long period of time. ===2012\u20132013: Rising popularity=== Though she had a major role in the 2009 film A Blood Pledge, it wasn't until she was cast in the family drama My Husband Got a Family (2012) that she gained minor attention.
