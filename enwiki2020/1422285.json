One of these was against Celtic in the quarter-finals of the 1979\u201380 European Cup, with Real losing 2\u20130 in the first match in Glasgow: in the second leg the team managed to come from behind after scoring three times without response (the third by him), thus reaching the last four; other comebacks in this period included the downings of Inter Milan and R.S.C. Anderlecht.Memorable UEFA Cup comebacks; UEFA, 18 February 2013 Since his death, Juanito continued to be remembered in the seventh minute of every home game, as the Ultras chanted \"Illa illa illa, Juanito maravilla\".
