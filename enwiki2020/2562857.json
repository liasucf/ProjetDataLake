    "text": "Top lista nadrealista (\"The Top List of the Surrealists\", sometimes \"The Surrealists' Top Chart\"), also known as Nadrealisti (\"Surrealists\"), was a variety television show, including a satire, sketch, surreal and black comedy elements. The TV show was produced and aired by TV Sarajevo in three separate installments, from 1984 until 1991. It originated from a 15-minute radio comedy segment, broadcast as part of the Primus program on Radio Sarajevo's channel Two during the early 1980s. After establishing a core radio audience locally in the city of Sarajevo, Top lista nadrealista got spun off into a television sketch series. Two more series of shows on television followed, making household names of its protagonists all over SFR Yugoslavia and helping launch successful television, film, and music careers for some of them (most notably Nele Karajli\u0107 and Branko \"\u0110uro\" \u0110uri\u0107). The show initially stayed away from politics entirely, mostly relying on youthful improvisation for laughs. Towards the late 1980s and early 1990s, in the second and third series, respectively, during which it created some of its most effective and memorable sketches, Top lista nadrealista incorporated political satire along with cogent depictions of mentality of the peoples of SFR Yugoslavia. The show became so popular that even some of the language and phrasing used in sketches entered public vernacular (see Hrklju\u0161). In the late 1980s and early 1990s, many sketches dealt with current political situation which was a prelude to Yugoslav Wars. Certain sketches proved to be prophetic, as they portrayed things like the city of Sarajevo being divided between different states, a single family split into two clans and warring over control of rooms in their apartment, UN peacekeeping force's adding fuel to the conflict, etc. In the context of the Yugoslav Wars that already began during the show's third series, Nadrealisti held a clear pacifist posture, often using absurdity and dark hyperbole when portraying rising ethnic tensions imminent war in SR Bosnia and Herzegovina (e.g. warning that \"peace may break out and ruin Bosnian harmonious war\" or giving alarming instructions on \"how the public should act in case of peace\"). ==Radio segment (1981\u20131985)== ===Background=== In late 1979 on Radio Sarajevo's Channel Two, Boro Konti\u0107 took over the hosting duties of Primus, a radio show that had been on the air since 6 January 1979. Konti\u0107 thus inherited the weekly Saturday morning 8-11am show from the previous host Jovo Do\u0161lo who decided to leave the radio business altogether and move back to Mostar. A young man in his mid-twenties, Konti\u0107 introduced two new segments \u2014 \u0160ta je pisac htio da ka\u017ee involving translations of the English language music hits into Serbo-Croatian and the other named Top lista nadrealista, a 15-minute free format envisioned as a showcase for talented local youngsters. On 10 November 1979, the Top lista nadrealista segment aired for the first time on Primus featuring a group of protagonists that didn't stick around past one or two weeks. Over the following year and a half, the segment functioned as somewhat of a revolving door featuring a multitude of participants none of whom would keep showing up long enough to develop any continuity. Always on the lookout for fresh talent to bring on the show for the Top lista nadrealista segment, by early 1981, through his younger budding musician brother Sa\u0161a Konti\u0107Nele Karajlic @ Vece sa Ivanom Ivanovi\u0107em;Prva TV, 21 December 2012 as well as Sa\u0161a's classmate and Ozbiljno Pitanje bandmate Zlatko \"Zlaja\" Arslanagi\u0107,Boro Konti\u0107;Gracija.ba Boro Konti\u0107 became aware of a group of kids in their late teens from Sarajevo's Ko\u0161evo neighborhood, each one involved with music as well as other forms of artistic expression. Sa\u0161a Konti\u0107 and Arslanagi\u0107 approached Zenit \u0110ozi\u0107 and Nele Karajli\u0107, two of the members of the recently formed garage punk rock band Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje, who after some initial trepidation on Nele's part accepted the offer of taking over the Top lista nadrealista segment, which had been airing on Primus for some eighteen months already.KAD JE \u017dIVOT BIO \u010cUDO;aplauz.netKAD JE \u017dIVOT BIO \u010cUDO;aplauz.net ===Debut=== Their debut fifteen-minute segment took place on Saturday, 9 May 1981 and was conceptualized as a faux terrorist takeover of the radio station with the terrorists reading out their manifesto along with a list of demands. These included: more young bands on radio and television, Dom mladih (Youth Center) being returned to those it nominally belongs to \u2014 the youth, removal of older radio executives from the station, more punk on the daily radio playlists, etc. Unbridled, raw, and unscripted, the debut segment done by Nele Karajli\u0107, Zenit \u0110ozi\u0107, Roki, Rizo Petranovi\u0107, Zlaja Arslanagi\u0107, and Sa\u0161a Konti\u0107 set the tone for what was to come: juvenile behaviour, infantile jokes, raucous street energy, with occasional cogent observation hinting at deeper social issues \u2014 all seldom heard prior on the buttoned-up state-run radio in communist Yugoslavia. The only adults in the mix were the Primus host and editor Boro Konti\u0107 and his sound engineer Husein Vladavi\u0107, both of whom were present behind the scenes during the segment tapings, but did not take part in them on the microphone. Right after the debut show, Boro Konti\u0107 asked his younger brother Sa\u0161a not to come any longer. Karajli\u0107 would later speculate in his memoir Konti\u0107 did so realizing right away the amount of scrutiny segment would be under from the radio higher-ups thus not wanting the added pressure of having a close family member there. Roki also stopped coming after the debut show. In turn, Karajli\u0107 brought along Boris \u0160iber, a neighbourhood buddy from Ko\u0161evo, while Zenit brought in Dra\u017een \"Para\" Ri\u010dl, another Ko\u0161evo lad. Though the attendance was spotty throughout the segment's run, five guys \u2014 Nele Karajli\u0107, Zenit \u0110ozi\u0107, Zlatko Arslanagi\u0107, Boris \u0160iber, and Dra\u017een Ri\u010dl \u2014 established themselves as the core of the Top lista nadrealista segment over its initial weeks and months on the air. ===Immediate local popularity in Sarajevo=== The group's creative modus operandi consisted of getting together every Thursday in \u0160etali\u0161te, a kafana located in Sutjeska Street (around the corner from the Radio Sarajevo building at 7 Danijela Ozme Street) a couple of hours before their scheduled 9pm studio taping in order to come up with bits for that week's segment. Under their command, the segment became a complete free format \u2014 sometimes a single bit for the entire fifteen minutes, other times a weekly recap through satirical commentary of recent local and global events. Since the attendance was always very unstable, the taping sometimes involved bringing random people from \u0160etali\u0161te into the studio for bits. Uncoordinated and chaotic as well as airing at an unpopular timeslot, Saturdays at 10:15am, when most of its target demographic is fast asleep, the segment nevertheless rapidly gained popularity among young listeners and soon became the staple of Primus. Getting around the early timeslot, many youngsters resorted to recording the segment on audio cassettes and sharing; scenes of young people in bars listening to segments they taped off radio were not uncommon around the city. It wasn't long before a move to television was suggested and the first steps to that end arranged by TV Sarajevo. However, following a few screen tests that essentially consisted of the group doing their radio schtick before cameras, the television executives deemed them too unpolished and sent them back to radio. As its popularity grew, 'Top lista nadrealista' segment slightly expanded from topical humour to include longer bits, played in installments. Some of the more popular sketches included \"Bata brani u Sarajevu\" (a takeoff on the famous partisan film Valter brani Sarajevo) and rock opera \"Kemmy\" (parody of The Who's Tommy). By March 1983, some of the individuals in and around this often intertwining group of budding radio personalities, musicians, and comedians came up with an idea of putting all of that activity under a single definition banner - thus giving birth to New Primitives, an entity that functioned as something between a (sub)cultural movement and a cheap public relations ploy. ===Musical synergy=== Most members of the on-air radio crew were involved with music. Since 1980, Karajli\u0107 had been fronting a garage rock group called Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje together with his buddy and neighbour Sejo Sexon while early lineups included \u0110ozi\u0107 who played drums with even Elvis J. Kurtovi\u0107 and \u0160iber spending some time in the band. Furthermore, Zlatko Arslanagi\u0107 and Dra\u017een Ri\u010dl played together in a band called Ozbiljno Pitanje and after the group disbanded, Ri\u010dl started playing alongside Elvis J. Kurtovi\u0107 and Rizo Petranovi\u0107 in a band called Elvis J. Kurtovi\u0107 & His Meteors, initially the most established group of the lot since they were the first to get a recording contract (with ZKP RTVLj).Elvis J. Kurtovic - Smoke on the water - Live 1983 The synergy of weekly radio appearances along with constant gigging around Sarajevo in student hangouts (Trasa, Kuk, Cedus, etc.) created a bit of local buzz that benefited both the radio and the music side of things. By early 1984, Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje finally got the record deal it was after (with Jugoton no less) while Top lista nadrealista developed enough of a following among the Sarajevo youth that it got a second shot on television in June 1984. ===Expansion to television=== The weekly radio segment continued in parallel with the television episodes and the success of Pu\u0161enje's debut album. Good sales of the album combined with the satisfactory reception of the television episodes prompted the release of Top lista nadrealista radio material on audio cassette tape by Diskoton. Produced by Boro Konti\u0107, it consisted of the troupe's best radio sketches. However, the so-called 'Marshal affair' that Nele Karajli\u0107 and Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje got themselves into put a damper on many activities. First, the 11-episode Top lista nadrealista run on television ended in late December 1984. Then, the Top lista nadrealista audio cassette tape's promotional cycle got blocked on administrative orders from above \u2014 becoming unavailable for sale in general circulation, only through traveling salesmen. Nevertheless, it still managed to sell 10,000 copies.Cenzura na radiju 80-ih, media.ba, 6 December 2012 Finally, during March 1985, the Top lista nadrealista segment got taken off radiowaves for good. ==First television series (1984)== Top lista nadrealista's switch to television came about through Erna Peri\u0107, TV Sarajevo executive in charge of folk music programming, who came up with an idea for a prime time show of folk music numbers with comedy sketches in- between each song. Though not at all fitting into the folk music milieu, the group accepted the offer of being the comedy filler on a folk music show as it meant exposure to a whole new audience they would normally never reach on the radio. They started shooting sketches in April 1984, a few months following the Sarajevo Winter Olympics. In addition to the radio five of Nele, Zenit, Para, \u0160iber, and Zlaja, the group was now joined by soon to be twenty-two- year-old Branko \u0110uri\u0107, local journalism student, musician, and aspiring actor, whom they had befriended at the Dedan kafana in Sarajevo where he had a knack for spontaneously entertaining the crowd by doing impressions. The show debuted on 2 June 1984, airing Tuesdays at 8:00pm on TVSa2 (TV Sarajevo's channel 2) while also shown in the rest of SFR Yugoslavia through JRT system. Directed by Davor Marjanovi\u0107 who got joined by Vuk Jani\u0107 after a few episodes, and with Nele Karajli\u0107, Branko \u0110uri\u0107, Zenit \u0110ozi\u0107, Boris \u0160iber, and Dra\u017een Ri\u010dl as main on-camera protagonists (Zlatko Arslanagi\u0107 participated in several sketches in later episodes), their sketches retained the same structure and form they had on radio. Around 45 minutes long, episodes featured between five and eight folk music numbers performed by popular folk singers of the day like Halid Be\u0161li\u0107, Ferid Avdi\u0107, \u0160aban \u0160auli\u0107, Hanka Paldum, Zehra Deovi\u0107, Himzo Polovina, Zaim Imamovi\u0107, etc. with sketches in-between mostly tied together by a common theme presented in installments over multiple episodes. A number of sketches revolved around parodying a fictional TV station \u2014 usually as the opening bit of each episode \u2014 with recurring characters: news anchor Mitrije Crnica (played by Karajli\u0107) and the station's security doorman played by \u0110uro whose catchphrase \"\u0106ega, ba\" caught on quickly. Another running parody based on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet featured young lovers Sejo and Seada falling in love despite their respective families supporting bitter cross-town football rivals FK Sarajevo and FK \u017deljezni\u010dar. They also lampooned Star Trek with a running multiple-installment bit called \"Burek u svemiru\" that portrays a space crew on a mission to find the best burek in universe. Another running bit featured Fu-Do (played by \u0110ozi\u0107), righteous vigilante well-versed in martial arts who protects the citizens of several Sarajevo local communities from various ills \u2014 from ruthless smugglers selling counterfeit clothing to open market re-sellers offering food at marked-up prices. Furthermore, actual events taking place as the series was shot \u2013 such as Yugoslavia's preparation for Euro 1984 or Rajko Janjanin's European Cup hat-trick versus Benfica \u2013 provided fodder for the sketches. Allusions to political figures and events were off-limits on the show. By closely sifting through sketch ideas and their implementation, applying censorship as needed, the state-owned and party- controlled TV Sarajevo made sure the show stays away from overt political commentary and direct social criticism.Dr Nele Karajli\u0107: Strahovao sam od Haga!;Kurir, 12 December 2012 It didn't take too long for the show to start getting a bit of a wider following though at first it proved a challenge. Its core demographic - Sarajevo youth - was on board all along, but getting viewership in other demographics and other parts of the country took some time. Once obtained, this newly found popularity was in large part based on the abundance of colloquialisms and local Sarajevo street parlance - none of which could be seen up to that point on the very buttoned-up Yugoslav TV. In total, eleven episodes were aired during the first season. Considering each one of the six protagonists was in their early twenties, the sketches expectedly centered around exuberance and improvisation, which dominated over the written material. ===Reception=== According to Karajli\u0107, speaking in 2010, the first instalment of Nadrealisti was \"the result of our youthful hysteria and it relied more on raw energy than brains\".Na\u0161i ljudi;Televizija Isto\u010dno Sarajevo, November 2010 Elvis J. Kurtovi\u0107, a friend of the crew who was involved with the show in limited creative capacity, said in 2005: \"Back when we were kids those Top lista nadrealista episodes were done by people who didn't know jack-squat about television and who shot everything in a single take and on first try. When you watch those episodes today you can see that many of them are badly directed and produced. Not all of them, there're some good ones, but the first series is particularly horrible in this regard\".Interview Elivisa J.Kurtovica;5 December 2005Specijalni Interview Elivisa J.Kurtovica, za K-R-U-G Bar TREMA;5 December 2005 ===Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje takes off as result of Top lista nadrealista on television=== As mentioned, in parallel with Top lista nadrealista, Karajli\u0107 also fronted a punk rock band called Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje that released its debut album barely two months before the show's premiere on television. Released by Jugoton, the record was out in limited circulation of 3,000 copies, a number clearly indicative of the label's modest expectations, especially after the poor sales of Elvis J. Kurtovi\u0107 & His Meteors' debut album barely a few months earlier.Rockovnik - Anarhija All Over Bascarsija (Jugoslovenska rock scena 1983. - 1985.);RTS, 2006 However, following Top lista nadrealista's television debut, the Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje album started selling surprisingly well, crossing the mark of 100,000 copies sold in the end. Though none of the other five Top lista nadrealista performers were official Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje members at this point, the two projects frequently overlapped, creating synergy that ultimately helped the popularity of both. By early summer 1984, Top lista nadrealista started getting bit of a wider audience, which in turn helped the sales of the Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje album. By late September, the band sold enough records for a Yugoslavia-wide tour to take place. Karajli\u0107 thus devoted more time to the band's tour than to the TV show whose production was now scheduled around his band obligations. The band's success on the road was rapid, and by November they were selling out sports arenas. During a concert in Rijeka in late November 1984, Karajli\u0107 made a pun after the Marshall amplifier broke down, jokingly announcing to the crowd: \"The Marshall has croaked! .... I mean the amplifier\", indirectly alluding to the late Yugoslav lifetime leader Josip Broz Tito who held the military rank of Marshal and who had died four years earlier. The seemingly innocuous statement delivered in jest in-between two songs at a rock concert soon created a firestorm of controversy as various state and communist party bodies went after the band, targeting Karajli\u0107 specifically. For weeks and months during late 1984 and early 1985, the print media was full of articles condemning the band over the statement while its gigs were being cancelled. In order to cope with the new situation, the band opted to stay out of the public eye for the time being, which also meant putting the show on hiatus indefinitely. ==Second television series (1989)== ===Background=== It would be more than five years before Top lista nadrealista returned for the second installment in fall 1989. In the meantime, some of its protagonists achieved a lot of success in other arenas. Nele Karajli\u0107 had become a veritable country-wide celebrity and a sought-after media personality with an eye-catching stage persona as the vocalist of Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje that had put out two more successful albums since its breakout debut one and was about to release its fourth. His TV profile had further been raised via starring in Timothy John Byford's 1988 kids show Tragom ptice Dodo on TV Sarajevo. A couple of years earlier, Karajli\u0107 had overcome the potentially career-ending 'Marshal affair' with the initially bombastic verbal offense court case against him eventually quietly concluded with a symbolic monetary fine. Branko \u0110uri\u0107 was in the process of also becoming quite well-known courtesy of his budding acting career with memorable roles in Audicija comedy show as well as films like Ovo malo du\u0161e, Dom za vje\u0161anje, Kuduz, and Kako je propao rokenrol while also maintaining a bit of a musical career with Bombaj \u0160tampa. Finally, after its commercially disappointing debut, Dra\u017een Ri\u010dl made one more album with Elvis J. Kurtovich & His Meteors, but left right after in spring 1985 as the group effectively disbanded anyway. At the time of their breakup, Ri\u010dl had already been in the process of reuniting with old Ozbiljno Pitanje bandmate Zlatko Arslanagi\u0107 to establish a new band with a softer, pop- rock sound and the two soon unveiled Crvena Jabuka, a group that immediately started taking off commercially on the scene. However, he died on 1 October 1986 from the injuries sustained in a car accident two weeks earlier near Jablanica en route to a Mostar gig in support of their debut album. Zlatko Arslanagi\u0107 was also in the same car but survived the crash, and after getting over severe depression decided to continue Crvena Jabuka, but did not return for Top lista nadrealista's second series. ===Preparation and shooting=== Nadrealisti thus reconvened in August 1989 without Ri\u010dl and Arslangi\u0107, but with new protagonists Darko Ostoji\u0107, Dado D\u017eihan, and Dra\u017een Jankovi\u0107, as well as Srki Velimirovi\u0107 who kept behind the camera but contributed with sketch ideas and scriptwriting. Their getting together this time was organized and coordinated by Slobodan Terzi\u0107, TV Sarajevo executive in charge of culture and arts programming. Noticeably more mature and structured, the 8-member group was now directed by thirty-four-year-old Miroslav \"\u0106iro\" Mandi\u0107 who had already accumulated a bit of a cinematic CV behind him, having directed a feature film \u017divot radnika two years earlier and having been one of Emir Kusturica's ADs on the Palme d'Or-winning When Father Was Away on Business in 1985. The written material courtesy of Karajli\u0107 and Velimirovi\u0107 became tighter and more polished compared to the 1984 series as sketches now started hinting at deeper social issues and trends. The upgrade in production and organizational matters was noticeable from the start of the second series. Implemented in practice, it meant that rather than having sketch excerpts that revolve around a theme over an entire episode, the show incorporated different sketches of varied structure and the music numbers got reduced. Just like the first series from 1984, the core of the second series also included a parody of television programming cliches with various TV characters \u2014 an unnamed news anchor played by Karajli\u0107 and his newscast director played by \u00d0uri\u0107 as well as a plethora of roving reporters played by all cast members \u2014 framing the sketches. Predicting future political and social events, both in Yugoslavia and abroad, became another staple of the second series \u2014 with Murphy's law governing these forecasts where the worst outcome is usually the one that ends up occurring. Finally, many, including Karajli\u0107 and Nadrealisti executive producer Terzi\u0107, talked about the second series sketches being infused with satirical techniques from the works of Radoje Domanovi\u0107 such as Vo\u0111a and Kraljevi\u0107 Marko po drugi put me\u0111u Srbima. The shooting dragged on for months throughout late summer and fall 1989. It was not without issues, including director Mandi\u0107 essentially quitting early on due to creative differences with the guys before he got persuaded to continue on via intervention by executive producer Terzi\u0107 who even enlisted Emir Kusturica's help in this regard. Mandi\u0107's relationship with the main on-camera performers Nele and \u0110uro was apparently so fraught initially that \u0110uro at one point even began lobbying for Mandi\u0107 to be replaced with Goran Gaji\u0107, an old friend of the New Primitivism guys whom \u0110uro had shot The Fall of Rock and Roll with earlier that year. Mandi\u0107 came back into the fold soon after quitting as the two sides found a modicum of common ground creatively. ===Airing=== Once it started airing in late fall 1989, the series achieved critical praise though it took several episodes for the general public to catch on. Once that happened, the series exploded all over SFR Yugoslavia with risque sketches that relied on absurdity as the starting point becoming widely quoted classics. Most also provided many thinly-veiled hints and winks in reference to the current political and social situation. A very popular sketch featuring \"Swedish workers escaping their politically unstable homeland and seeking refuge in Yugoslavia only to find low-skill jobs for local ruthless small-business bosses\", in addition to providing uproarious laughs through well-crafted dialogues, parodied the decades-long drain of Yugoslav nationals to Western Europe in search of better employment opportunities. Another classic sketch, featuring Rade Pendrek, an exemplary and obedient forty-year-old street cop, having a nightmare about waking up in a country where uniformed intellectuals round up disobedient cops to university halls in order to forcibly correct their misbehaviour by having professors aggressively read Nietzsche and play Mozart to them as worker riot- squads armed with shovels roam the streets outside breaking up police protest rallies, humorously hinted and winked at a wide range of actual events: from the \u017duta Greda incident during the Anti-bureaucratic revolution to the party- initiated media and institutional campaigns against dissenting University of Sarajevo professors and lecturers Nenad Kecmanovi\u0107, Vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj, and Esad \u0106imi\u0107. On occasion, because of the content's political sensitivity, trickery had to be used by the show's network-assigned executive producer Slobodan Terzi\u0107 in front of his TV Sarajevo superiors in order to ensure the intended material makes it to air. This was particularly true when the material featured overt mockery of Yugoslav political figures such as the now-famous 14th Yugoslav Communist League Congress dubbing sequence (framed by Nele and \u0110uro as \"closing time at the Kod dva bela goluba kafana\"), which was recorded on a Wednesday night in January 1990 \u2014 less than a day before the scheduled airtime for that episode on Thursday in prime time \u2014 while the Congress itself had been held days earlier and its political fallout was still huge. Nele and \u0110uro stayed up all night riffing and dubbing their voices over the politicians' speeches. In the morning Terzi\u0107 reportedly signed off on the sketch, prepared it for airing later that night, and then went home where he unplugged his home telephone in anticipation of the calls he knew he would be getting from his superiors during airtime. The sketch aired that night, causing a political stir, but it also got a great reaction from the viewers. Seven episodes were shot and aired during the season. An additional New Year's special episode was aired on 31 December 1989. A year later, another New Year's episode was shot and aired. ===1990 Yugoslavia-wide tour=== The highly- rated television series led to a surge of popularity for all things Top lista nadrealista and New Primitivism throughout SFR Yugoslavia. The group decided to cash in immediately by releasing a 3-tape VHS box-set as well as by going on a country-wide arena tour, which had a commercial tie-in with one of Yugoslavia's most prominent tourist operators Unis Tours. The tour featured a unique business arrangement in that Unis Tours purchased it outright for a fixed price before it even started thus acquiring its entire eventual gate revenue, an indication of the popularity of Top lista nadrealista in Yugoslavia at the time and the company's certainty that the tour would generate profit. Booked and organized by Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje manager Dragan \"Kiki\" Zurovac, the joint Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje, Bombaj \u0160tampa, and Top lista nadrealista show featuring a live mixture of music and sketch comedy on stage played to sold out sports arenas across the country throughout the first part of 1990. The tour started in Belgrade on January 11 and 12, continuing in Novi Sad on the 14th, followed by Zagreb on the 19th and Split on the 21st, Ljubljana the 29th, and Sarajevo on February 1 and 2, Skopje the 13th, and Pri\u0161tina the 14th. Due to its popularity, many dates were added after the initial ones. However, relationships within the group already deteriorated to the point of guys barely tolerating one another. Main issue was revenue sharing and through it an unspoken recognition of who the main protagonist(s) is/are as stated by Karajli\u0107 in his autobiography: ==Third television series (1991)== ==Members== * Nele Karajli\u0107 (radio segment, TV seasons 1, 2, and 3) * Zenit \u0110ozi\u0107 (radio segment, TV seasons 1, 2, and 3) * Branko \u0110uri\u0107 (TV seasons 1, 2, and 3) * Boris \u0160iber (radio segment, TV seasons 1 and 2) * Darko Ostoji\u0107 (TV season 2 and 3) * Dra\u017een Ri\u010dl (radio segment and TV season 1) * Zlatko Arslanagi\u0107 (radio segment and TV season 1) * Dra\u017een Jankovi\u0107 (TV seasons 2 and 3) * Dado D\u017eihan (TV season 2) * Sr\u0111an \"Srki\" Velimirovi\u0107 (TV seasons 2 and 3) * Davor Dujmovi\u0107 (TV season 3) * Davorin \u0160egulja (TV season 3) * Elvis J.

On 9 May 1992 against the backdrop of rapidly deteriorating security situation in the city of Sarajevo as well as the rest of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Radio Sarajevo got restructured by merging its channels one, two, and three as well as its channel 202 into a single channel that officially got renamed Radio BiH.Ratni De\u017eurni mikrofon;MediaCentar.ba, 23 May 1992 Boro Konti\u0107 who performed editor-in-chief duties at Radio Sarajevo's channel two since 1990 now continued as one of the more influential executives at Radio BiH. Right away, he decided to bring back De\u017eurni mikrofon, an hour-long political magazine that for years aired on old Radio Sarajevo's channel one. The new timeslot was Sundays at 9am and its first broadcast in renewed form aired on 24 May 1992. In late June 1992, several months into the Bosnian War with the city already firmly divided between the neighbourhoods and surrounding areas held by the Bosnian Serb Army (VRS) and the central neighbourhoods controlled by the Bosnian Muslim-dominated Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH), Konti\u0107 decided to re-assemble the group that made Top lista nadrealista by giving them a 15-minute segment on De\u017eurni mikrofon. For the very first gathering, he managed to find many of the individuals previously involved with the show or New Primitives who were still in the city at the time: \u0110uro, Zenit \u0110ozi\u0107, \u0160iber, Srki Velimirovi\u0107, Elvis J. Kurtovi\u0107, Zlatko Arslangi\u0107, Sejo Sexon, and Sa\u0161a Petrovi\u0107, as well as new faces Haris \"Gigo\" Aljevi\u0107, Haris Memija, and Almir \"Batko\" \u010cehaji\u0107. \u0110uro and Zlatko Arslanagi\u0107 fled Sarajevo soon afterwards so that the remaining protagonists did the 15-minute weekly radio shows in the second part of 1992 and into 1993.\u0160tafeta ratosti;media.ba, 29 May 2012 Made in irregular circumstances in a besieged town with war raging all around, the primary objective of the short weekly segment was boosting citizen morale though very few could even hear it due to electrical power being in scarce supply so that the show would open with lines such as \"good evening to all three of you who still have generators\".Sarajevo Journal; This Can't Be Bosnia, There's Too Much Laughing;The New York Times, 6 July 1993 The radio segment ran until July 1993. In August 1993, after 50 odd shows on radio, the group shot and aired four television episodes. One war- time sketch showed Serbs arresting obviously innocent Czech tourists who got lost on their way to seaside as Muslim extremists and terrorists. Other sketch shows how a Bosniak \"Super Imam\" heals a child of Chetnik spirit. ===Nadreality Show=== Nadreality Show was made in 2007 as a partial reunion of some of the old crew from Top lista nadrealista. Of the returning protagonists Zenit \u0110ozi\u0107, Elvis J. Kurtovi\u0107, and Darko Ostoji\u0107 were present, along with a slew of new actors. Radio Televizija Bosne I Hercegovine alongside RTL Televizija and B92 broadcast Nadreality Show in 2007 with few sketches. The main person in the sketches was Zenit \u0110ozi\u0107. ===Nadrealna televizija=== In fall of 2012, Nele Karajli\u0107 began preparations for a sketch comedy series, marking his return to the format after more than twenty years. On 12 December 2012, the pilot episode of Nadrealna televizija appeared on 1Prva, drawing high viewership rates. Directed by Milorad Milinkovi\u0107, the series got picked up and 10 episodes were shot throughout spring and summer 2013. The episodes aired from 3 September 2013 until 15 November 2013. ===Nadreality Show 2=== During 2017, sketches of Nadreality Show 2 were shot and broadcast on Federalna televizija as the continuation to the original first series of Nadreality Show. ==See also== * New Primitivism * Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje * Comedy in Bosnia and Herzegovina ==References== * ==External links== * * Videos of Skits on Youtube * Sarajevo version of Monty Python's Flying Circus Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina culture Category:Television sketch shows Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina television series Category:1980s Yugoslav television series Category:1990s Yugoslav television series Category:1990s Bosnia and Herzegovina television series Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina satirical television programmes Category:Surreal comedy television series Category:Metafictional television series ",
