Formed in 1917, it fought in the Polish\u2013Soviet War and the Invasion of Poland. In the interbellum period, the regiment was garrisoned in Ostrog, Volhynia. Wo\u0142y\u0144ska BK w 1938 The origins of the regiment date back to April 1917, when Polish Assault Hussar Squadron was formed in the Ukraine, by Colonel Feliks Jaworski. This unit was part of Polish Rifle Division, Imperial Russian Army. In early June 1917, the squadron was transported to Eastern Galicia, where it fought against German and Austro-Hungarian forces. After the October Revolution, it was transferred to Ploskirow, where it fought against Bolshevik units and demoralized soldiers of the Russian Army. On December 24, it was merged into Polish Army in Ukraine, and in January 1918, the 2nd Uhlan Regiment was formed, based on Polish Assault Hussar Squadron. On February 22, 1918, the regiment was annexed into III Polish Corps in Russia, as part of Light Brigade of Colonel Juliusz R\u00f3mmel. By June 1918, the regiment had 26 officers and 684 soldiers. During the 1939 Invasion of Poland, the regiment, as part of Volhynian Cavalry Brigade, fought in the Battle of Mokra, Battle of Wola Cyrusowa and other battles. By mid-September 1939, it ceased to exist, and its elements, after crossing the Wieprz river, joined Kresowa Cavalry Brigade, to surrender to the Red Army in late September. The 19th Volhynian Uhlan Regiment was recreated in early 1944, as part of 27th Home Army Infantry Division. == Commandants == * Major Feliks Jaworski (1917\u20131921) * Colonel Michal Cienski (27 II 1921 \u2013 10 VI 1922) * Colonel Mscislaw Butkiewicz (VI \u2013 VIII 1922) * Colonel Zbigniew Brochwicz-Lewinski (20 VIII 1922 \u2013 6 X 1927) * Colonel Wkodzimierz Kazimierz Bogusz-Roland (1 IX 1927 \u2013 12 III 1929) * Colonel Aleksander Piotraszewski (III 1929 \u2013 1937) * Colonel Dezyderiusz Zawistowski (1937\u20131938) * Colonel Jozef Petkowski (1938 \u2013 IX 1939) == Symbols and Traditions == Regimental flag, funded by the residents of Volhynia, was handed to the unit by Marshal J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, on August 6, 1924 in Ostrog.
