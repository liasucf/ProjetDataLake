He was born on 21 January 1895, in Fagrisk\u00f3gur, Eyjafj\u00f6rdur, Iceland and he died on 1 March 1964, Akureyri Iceland. Dav\u00ed\u00f0 Stef\u00e1nsson came of a cultured yeoman family and was brought up with a love for his homeland, its literature, and its folklore. He frequently journeyed abroad but lived most of his life in the town of Akureyri, where he was a librarian (1925\u201352). ==Novels and plays== In 1926, he wrote Munkarnir \u00e1 M\u00f6\u00f0ruv\u00f6llum (\"The Monks of M\u00f6\u00f0ruvellir\") and in 1941, the powerful novel S\u00f3lon Islandus (I - II), a novel about S\u00f6lvi Helgason, a daydreaming 19th-century vagabond whose intellectual ambitions are smothered by society. In 1941, he wrote the successful play, Gullna hli\u00f0i\u00f0 (\"The Golden Gate\") and in 1944, Vopn gu\u00f0anna (\"Weapons of the Gods\") and in 1953, his play Landi\u00f0 gleymda (\"The Forgotten Country\"). ==Poetry== Stef\u00e1nsson's early poetry, including most of his folk themes and love lyrics, appeared in: *1919: Svartar fja\u00f0rir (\"Black Feathers\") *1922: Kv\u00e6\u00f0i (\"Poems\") *1924: Kve\u00f0jur (\"Greetings\") *1929: N\u00fd Kv\u00e6\u00f0i (\"New Poems\") They were combined and published as a collected volume in 1930. His later poetry\u2014darkening in social satire, reformatory zeal against capitalism and organized religion, and despair over the war\u2014was published as: *1933: \u00cd bygg\u00f0um (\"Among Human Habitations\") *1936: A\u00f0 nor\u00f0an (\"From the North\") *1947: N\u00fd kv\u00e6\u00f0ab\u00f3k (\"A New Book of Poems\") *1966: S\u00ed\u00f0ustu lj\u00f3\u00f0 (\"Last Poems\") (posthumously) His lyrics often have the delicacy of a cradle song; yet his heroic verse shows the virility of an epic poet. == See also == * List of Icelandic writers * Icelandic literature Category:1895 births Category:1964 deaths David Stefansson David Stefansson David Stefansson ",
