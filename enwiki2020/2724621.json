    "text": "\"Kiss on My List\" is a song by the American duo Hall & Oates. It was written by Daryl Hall and Janna Allen, and produced by the duo. It was the third single release from their ninth studio album, Voices (1980), and became their second US Billboard Hot 100 number-one single (after \"Rich Girl\" in 1977). It spent three weeks at the top spot. The song was written with the intention of Janna Allen, sister of Hall's longtime girlfriend Sara Allen, singing it, as she was interested in starting a music career. Hall cut a demo version as a guide for her, but later when his manager found the tape lying around the studio, he insisted that Hall and Oates cut the song themselves. In fact, the production team liked the demo so much that they did not do a second take, instead adding background vocals and instrumentation to the demo and mixing them together. Hall recalled that is why the drums sounded so \"dinky\" - the \"drums\" in fact being the early Roland CR-78 drum machine mixed in with a live drumming overdub. Hall calls it an anti-love song, with the song title being tongue-in-cheek sarcasm in that the kiss is not that important, in that it is on a list of other things that are just as important. The song was one of the music videos that aired on MTV's first day of broadcast. The 45 rpm version of the song appears on the compilation albums Rock 'n Soul Part 1 (1983) and Playlist: The Very Best of Daryl Hall & John Oates (2008). ==Personnel== *Daryl Hall \u2013 lead vocals, keyboards, synthesizers *John Oates \u2013 backing vocals, 6 and 12-string guitars, drum machine *John Siegler \u2013 bass guitar *Jerry Marotta \u2013 drums ;Additional musicians *Jeff Southworth \u2013 lead guitar *Mike Klvana \u2013 equipment technician ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1981) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|13 |- |Canada Top Singles (RPM) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|7 |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1981) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank |- |Canada Top Singles (RPM) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|32 |- |US Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|7 |} ==See also== * List of Hot 100 number-one singles of 1981 (U.S.) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1979 songs Category:1981 singles Category:Hall & Oates songs Category:Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles Category:Songs written by Daryl Hall Category:Songs written by Janna Allen Category:RCA Records singles ",
