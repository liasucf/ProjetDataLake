    "text": "No\u00ebl Emmanuel Limage (died January 20, 2007) was a Haitian senator with the Lespwa party. In the 2006 election, he won a seat representing Artibonite in the senate, but was killed in a car accident near Gona\u00efves less than a year after taking office. He was driving his car on a rural road when he swerved to avoid a cow and crashed into a ravine. He was taken to a hospital, where he died of head injuries. Two passengers in the car survived the accident; Limage's secretary suffered a broken leg and his cousin escaped uninjured. The Constitution of Haiti stipulated that a special election should have been held within thirty days of Limage's death to fill his senate seat. Because Haiti lacks a permanent electoral commission, the special election did not take place and his seat remains empty. The position will be contested in the upcoming 2008 elections. == Notes == Category:1953 births Category:2007 deaths Category:Members of the Senate (Haiti) Category:Road incident deaths in Haiti Category:Lespwa politicians ",
