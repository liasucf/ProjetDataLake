Also included are some images of Biosphere 2 which is located in Oracle. ==Brief history== The first known inhabitants of the area were the Hohokam who settled the banks of the nearby San Pedro River in splinter groups. The disappearance of the Hohokam in the late 15th century remains a mystery. Later the region was settled by the O\u2019odham (Sobapiris) and the Apache tribes. The Sobaipuris and Apache fought each other over the ownership of the land. The Sobapiris gave up the struggle and relocated to the San Xavier Mission, home to the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation to the south.Area History The area came under Spanish rule in what Spain claimed was New Spain. The first Europeans arrived in the region in 1583, when a group of Spanish explorers came in search of gold and silver. They were searching for the Seven Cities of Cibola, whose streets were supposed to be paved with gold. The region was known as \"Apacher\u00eda\" by the SpaniardsSedona Facts In 1821, the Mexican War of Independence between Mexico and Spain came to an end and the territory of New Spain, which included Arizona, was ceded to Mexico.accessed Jan 11, 2019 Mexican Independence Facts In 1846, the United States declared war against Mexico in what became known as the Mexican\u2013American War. The conflict with Mexico ended in 1848. In 1854, the United States purchased the region from Mexico in what is known as the Gadsden Purchase. In 1870, a Group of vigilantes from Tucson massacred 200 Apache women, children and elders at Aravaipa Creek. Those who survived the massacre moved to the San Carlos Reservation. The early Mexican settlers used the land for agricultural purposes and for cattle ranching. As such, the economy of the area depended on cattle ranching and later mining. Albert Weldon and Isaac Lorraine were among the first Anglo's from the eastern coast of the United States to claim mining rights in the area. Lorraine founded a mine which he named the \"American Flag Mine\". He also established the American Flag cattle ranch. Weldon was a prospector who established a mine in the Catalina Mountains which he named \"The Oracle\", in honor of his uncle's ship. The small town was named Oracle in 1878. In the 1870s word of the mining successes in the area spread and prospectors from other places came with their families to the area. In 1880, two post offices were established, one in Oracle and one 5 miles west of Oracle which was called the American Flag Post Office. The American Flag Post Office service was discontinued in 1890. Currently it is the oldest existing Territorial post office in the state that is still standing. The climate of Oracle was another factor that attracted people for health reasons. Oracle was mentioned in a medical journal as an ideal place where the fresh air would restore the health of those suffering from \"consumption\" the name given to tuberculosis. In the 1880s the Dodge family built the Arcadia Ranch as a sheep ranch and boarding house to accommodate those who were suffering from lung diseases. In 1895, the Neal family built the Mountain View Hotel on what is now the American Way Road. The building was made with a thousand adobe bricks which were made on site. It took six months to build. The hotel attracted visitors from different parts of the world.ANNIE BOX AND WILLIAM CURLY NEAL: RACE IN EARLY ARIZONA A celebrity who resided in Oracle was William Cody known as \"Buffalo Bill Cody\".
