    "text": "The Ray Society is a scientific text publication society that publishes works devoted principally to British flora and fauna. As of 2019, it had published 181 volumes. Its publications are predominantly academic works of interest to naturalists, zoologists, botanists and collectors. The society was founded in 1844, largely on the initiative of George Johnston. It is named after the naturalist John Ray (1627\u20131705). It is based at the Natural History Museum, London, and is a registered charity under English law. ==Publications== The Ray Society's publications are concerned with natural history, and have special but not exclusive reference to British flora and fauna. They include original monographs on particular groups and topics, facsimiles of historically important volumes and translations of existing works. During Charles Darwin's lifetime, the Ray Society published not only Darwin's two volumes on living barnacles (1851 and 1854) but also the work of many of the foremost British naturalists: Thomas Henry Huxley, William Crawford Williamson, John Blackwall, Albert G\u00fcnther, James Scott Bowerbank, etc.List of the Annual Volumes of the Ray Society, from their Commencement, in 1844, to August, 1880 Recent publications have included: * * * * * * * * * * * * (in 2 volumes) * ==References== ==External links== * *The Old Ray Society website Category:Biology societies Category:Text publication societies Category:1844 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Scientific organizations established in 1844 Category:Scientific organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Charities based in England ",
