Stamford House housed a \"series of local vicars\", and later became a school. From 1926 to 1940, there was a theosophical community living at Stamford House, led by Edward Lewis Gardner (1869-1969), who was a leading member of the Theosophical Society in England, and its general secretary from 1924 to 1928. Soldiers were billeted here during the Second World War, after which it was converted into nine flats. ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in the London Borough of Merton Category:Houses completed in 1720 Category:Houses in the London Borough of Merton Category:1720 establishments in England Category:Grade II listed houses in London ",
