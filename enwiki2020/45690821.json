    "text": "Gerard Valck (30 September 1652 \u2013 21 October 1726) was a Dutch engraver, publisher and cartographer. ==Biography== Valck was born in Amsterdam on 30 September 1652 to an Amsterdam silversmith. He was a student of Abraham Blooteling and later married Blooteling's sister. He went to London with Blooteling in 1672 and may have remained there until 1680. Valck engraved many portraits of English nobility and worked frequently with Blooteling. His earliest dated mezzotint is titled Sleeping Cupid and was published in 1677. He based many of his engravings and mezzotints after designs by other artists like Peter Lely, G\u00e9rard de Lairesse and Philip Tideman. He published most of his works himself. In Amsterdam, he had a close partnership with his son Leonardus Valck and Peter Schenk the Elder, who married Gerard's sister in 1687. Valck also published atlases, maps, printed globes and prints of other things. He died in Amsterdam on 21 October 1726. ==Gallery== File:King William III when Prince of Orange by Gerard Valck, after Sir Peter Lely.jpg File:1672 95 Novus Planiglobii Valck'.jpg File:Ortensia Mancini, Duchess of Mazarin by Gerard Valck, after Sir Peter Lely.jpg File:AMH-7675-NA Map of the Gold Coast.jpg File:King Henry VIII by Gerard Valck, after Adriaen van der Werff.jpg File:Map italy monferrato CG 52 montiferrati ducatus post 1684.jpg ==References== ==External links== Category:1652 births Category:1726 deaths Category:17th-century engravers Category:18th-century engravers Category:Dutch engravers Category:Dutch publishers (people) Category:Dutch cartographers Category:Artists from Amsterdam ",
