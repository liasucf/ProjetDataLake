    "text": "Aertirrena S.p.A was a regional airline of Italy, operating in the 1970s. It was one of the few Italian airlines to operate Soviet aircraft. ==History== Fiorenza de Bernardi, first female commercial pilot from Italy, in the cockpit of an Aertirrena Yakovlev Yak-40 (I-JAKA) Aertirrena was founded in 1966 by the Italian employer Fiorenza de Bernardi and former Aeroflot worker Piotr Ivanov. The airline was planned on operating services between Genoa, Rome, Milan, Athens and Florence, but with Soviet capital and investment of Aeroflot, holding a 30% stake, with the remaining 70% in the hands of de Bernardi. The first flight of the airline took off in June 1970 between Genoa and Florence, with a Yakovlev Yak-40 aircraft.Info The airline grew considerably and incorporated another 2 Yak-40 (although both aircraft operated for Olympic Airways for a time) and increased their flight frequency considerably. Aertirrena finally consolidated as an important company and grew, with his passengers increasing year by year. However, the strong pressure and competition by Alitalia in the regional routes finally forced Aertirrena to cancel its service in 1975. In the aftermath of Aertirrena's bankruptcy di Bernardi and Ivanov founded Avioligure and obtained a contract with Aeroflot to lease to Avioligure the 3 Yak-40 that had been leased to Aertirrena. ==Destinations== ===National=== * Florence * Genoa * Milan * Pisa ===International=== * Athens ==Fleet== * 3 Yakovlev Yak-40 (I-JAKA, I-JAKE, I-JAKI, leased from Aeroflot) ==See also== * List of defunct airlines of Italy ==References== ==External links== * Yak 40 operators * Italian operators of the Yak-40 (in italian) Category:1975 disestablishments in Italy Category:Defunct airlines of Italy Category:Airlines established in 1966 Category:Airlines disestablished in 1975 Category:Italian companies established in 1966 ",
