    "text": "Booklist is a publication of the American Library Association that provides critical reviews of books and audiovisual materials for all ages. Booklists primary audience consists of libraries, educators, and booksellers. The magazine is available to subscribers in print and online. Booklist is published 22 times per year, and reviews over 7,500 titles annually. The Booklist brand also offers a blog, various newsletters, and monthly webinars. The Booklist offices are located in the American Library Association headquarters in Chicago\u2019s Gold Coast neighborhood. ==History== Booklist, as an introduction from the American Library Association publishing board notes, began publication in January 1905 to \"meet an evident need by issuing a current buying list of recent books with brief notes designed to assist librarians in selection.\" With an annual subscription fee of 50 cents, Booklist was initially subsidized by a $100,000 grant from the Carnegie Foundation, known for its public and university library endowments, and at first mainly contained the briefest 25- to 50-word summaries. In 1913, the Booklist offices were moved from Boston to the ALA headquarters in Chicago's McCormick mansion. By the 1930s the reviews had become more in-depth, and the journal began to include some articles. In October 1939, just a few weeks after the start of World War II, Booklist published an article entitled \"Books for the 'Long and Calm View': On the Crisis, Its Background and Implications to the United States\", intended to address \"the demand for impartial books without the emotionalism of propaganda.\" Amidst a world crisis, the editor helped library patrons to have their questions answered while presenting various viewpoints. From the 1950s to the 1960s, Booklist reviews were limited to 150 words, generally three long sentences. Reviews were handwritten in pencil on yellow legal paper, edited and typed up for the printer. Artistic design choices for the magazine were minimal, with the only visual change between issues being the plain cover's solid colour. The 1970s saw a great deal of change in the Booklist offices. As adolescent literature gained popularity, a Young Adult books editor was hired. The publication of such books as Judy Blume\u2019s Forever, Phyllis Reynolds Naylor's Alice series, and S.E. Hinton's The Outsiders marked a need to evaluate books not meant strictly for either children or adults. In 1973, new editor-publisher Paul Brawley was the first to print editions of the magazine with recreated book jackets on the cover. Some Booklist subscribers protested the flashy new covers, supposedly claiming they liked the plain covers and the space they afforded for listing potential book orders. Under Brawley\u2019s editorship, beginning with 16mm film strips and spoken-word recordings, Booklist began to accept submissions and print reviews of audiovisual products. During the 1980s and 1990s, Booklist began its Editors\u2019 Choice reviews and its first feature column, \u201cManley Arts\u201d, by Will Manley. The 1990s issues of Booklist were the first to be composed on in-office computers. The June 2005 issue of Booklist marked the magazine\u2019s 100th anniversary. To celebrate the centennial, the acting editors published a feature article entitled \u201cThe Booklist Century\u201d, wherein they chose a book from each year of the preceding hundred to highlight its social impact \u2014 ranging from Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth (1905) to the 9/11 Commission Report. Currently, the magazine can be found online and in print. The Booklist editorial team also creates supplemental products, such as Book Links, webinars and the Booklist Reader. Booklist offices are located in the 50 E. Huron building at the ALA headquarters. ==Current masthead== * George Kendall- Editor & Publisher * Donna Seaman - Editor, Adult Books * Sarah Hunter - Editor, Books for Youth * Susan Maguire - Senior Editor, Collection Management and Library Outreach * Heather Booth - Editor, Audio ==Reviews and reviewers== Booklist Reviews Booklist reviews are said to be \"the haiku of book reviewing.\" Reviews include a brief synopsis, plus mention of the most successful elements of style. Most reviews fall between 175 and 225 words. Starred Reviews The Booklist star indicates an outstanding title of a particular genre. All starred reviews are approved by the appropriate editor. High-Demand Booklist recognizes that libraries wish to purchase new materials as soon as they become available, and therefore works to review titles as early as possible. The \u201cHigh-Demand Backstory\u201d symbol indicates titles likely to be surrounded by media coverage and patron popularity. Adult Books with YA Appeal As an additional source for librarians, Booklist reviews certain adult titles and labels them for YA appeal. These materials tend to have young protagonists or themes relevant to teenage readers. Recommendation-only system Since its founding in 1905, Booklist has followed a recommendation-only system. This means that every title reviewed would make a quality addition to library collections. Booklist Selection Policy The editors of Booklist magazine adhere to a selection policy consistent with the Library Bill of Rights. The process of choosing titles for reviews aims to promote readership, never censorship. Booklist Reviewers Titles are reviewed by a corps of librarians, freelancers, journalists, and educators, as well as Booklist editors and staff. ==Other products== Website Booklist Online is the website and archive of the Booklist print magazine.
