    "text": "\"We Drink Your Blood\" is a song by the German power metal group Powerwolf released on 5 July 2011. It was a second single released from the album Blood of the Saints. The title of the song is an allusion to the consecration in the Christian liturgy: \"Take this, all of you, and drink from it, for this is the chalice of my Blood, the Blood of the new and eternal covenant, which will be poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this in memory of me.\" In 2018 the song got covered by Saltatio Mortis. It was available on the Deluxe Edition of Powerwolf's album The Sacrament of Sin. == Music video == \"We Drink Your Blood\" was the first Powerwolf song to receive a music video. The music video was released on YouTube. It gathered over 20 million views, making it the most viewed Powerwolf music video. The video was recorded in an ancient monastery church. Group's keyboardist Falk Maria Schlegel commented that \"Shooting the video in such a special and atmospheric place was incredible. The combination of the sacral interior of the church, including altar, confessional box and a church organ with a lot of fire, fog and metal insanity was the perfect set for a Powerwolf video.\" == Personnel == * Attila Dorn \u2013 vocals * Matthew Greywolf \u2013 lead and rhythm guitar * Charles Greywolf \u2013 lead and rhythm guitar * Tom Diener \u2013 drums, percussion * Falk Maria Schlegel \u2013 organ, keyboards == References == == External links == * Category:Powerwolf songs Category:2011 singles Category:2011 songs ",
