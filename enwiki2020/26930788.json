After the town site was surveyed, the provincial superintendent, James Alexander Robertson Menzies, named the site for his friend, the Governor of New Zealand, Thomas Gore Browne. The original name of the township, Long Ford or Longford, remained for some time, but when the railway reached the town, the shorter name became common and was also applied to the wider district. The township of Gore was incorporated and became a borough council in 1885. In the local government reform in 1989, the Gore and Mataura borough councils and parts of Southland County Council were amalgamated to form Gore District. ==Governance== The district council is headed by a mayor who is elected at large and complemented by eleven councillors from various wards. Five councillors represent the Gore ward, one councillor each represents the Mataura, Kaiwera-Waimumu, and Waikaka wards, and there is one further district-wide ward that is represented by three councillors. The current mayor, Tracy Hicks, was first elected in the 2004 local elections. He replaced Owen O'Connor who retired in 2004. ==Current body== As of 2019, the current council members are:- {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | Mayor | Tracy Hicks JP |- | Councillors \u2013 Gore District Council | Bronwyn Reid Nicky Davis Dough Grant Bret Highsted Cliff Bolger Glenys Dickson Nick Grant Neville Phillips John Gardyne Richard McPhail Stewart MacDonell |} ==References== ==External links== * Gore District Council website Category:1989 establishments in New Zealand ",
