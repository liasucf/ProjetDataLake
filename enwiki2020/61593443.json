    "text": "The Valley Flyer is a train service run by Amtrak between New Haven, Connecticut and Greenfield, Massachusetts along Amtrak's New Haven\u2013Springfield Line and the Connecticut River Line, owned by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. South of Springfield, it complements the Hartford Line commuter rail service operated by the Connecticut Department of Transportation. ==History== On June 12, 2018, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker announced that two daily round trip trains (then called New Haven\u2013Springfield Shuttle) would be extended to in 2019 as a pilot program. By February 2019, the two-year pilot was expected to begin in June 2019; however, by that May it was delayed to later in the year. On August 30, 2019, the Valley Flyer program began. ==Service== Two New Haven-Greenfield round-trips are offered on weekdays, with southbound trains in the morning and northbound in the evening. On weekends, one similarly scheduled New Haven-Greenfield round-trip is offered, in addition to a reverse round trip between Springfield and Greenfield. ==References== ==External links== *Valley Flyer | Trains In The Valley Category:New Haven\u2013Springfield Line Category:Amtrak routes Category:Passenger rail transportation in Connecticut Category:Passenger rail transportation in Massachusetts ",
