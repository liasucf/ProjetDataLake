    "text": "The 1888 Chicago University club football team was an American football team that represented a club within the University of Chicago, composed of University Alumni who were still living in the area, in the 1888 college football season. Most of the team were businessmen who had played football on the Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia football teams. Chicago had yet to form an official collegiate football team, not doing so until the 1892 season. ==Schedule== The contest against Harvard Prep on November 21 was seen as a practice game, and so the Harvard team doesn't recognize it ==Roster== The roster for the Thanksgiving Day contest against Michigan consisted of: * A. Farwell, right end * Harry Hamlin, right tackle * B. B. Lamb, right guard (captain) * Peters, center * Burke, left guard * A. S. Bickham, left tackle * Lockwood, left end * P.
