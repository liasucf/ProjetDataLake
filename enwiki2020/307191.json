Sabharathnam Douglas Brooks. Meditation Revolution: A History and Theology of the Siddha Yoga Lineage. Agama Press, 1997. He wrote a number of books on the subjects of Kundalini Shakti, Vedanta, and Kashmir Shaivism, including a spiritual autobiography entitled The Play of Consciousness. In honorific style, he is often referred to as Swami Muktananda. == Biography == Muktananda was born in 1908 near Mangalore in Karnataka State, India, to a well-off family. His birth name was Krishna Rai. At age 15 he encountered Bhagavan Nityananda, a wandering avadhoot who profoundly changed his life. After this encounter, Krishna left home and began his search for the experience of God.Douglas Brooks, Swami Durgananda, Paul E. Muller-Ortega, Constantina Rhodes Bailly, S.P. Sabharathnam. Meditation Revolution: a History and Theology of the Siddha Yoga lineage. (Agama Press) 1997, p.32 He studied under Siddharudha Swami at Hubli, where he learned Sanskrit, Vedanta, all branches of yoga, and took the initiation of sannyasa in the Sarasvati order of the Dashanami Sampradaya,John Paul Healy (2010), Yearning to Belong: Discovering a New Religious Movement, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., p.9 taking the name of Swami Muktananda. After Siddharudha's death, Muktananda then left to study with a disciple of Siddharudha called Muppinarya Swami at his Sri Airani Holematt in Ranebennur Haveri District after studying there Swami Muktananda began wandering India on foot, studying with many different saints and gurus. In 1947 Muktananda went to Ganeshpuri to receive the darshan of Bhagavan Nityananda, the saint who had originally inspired Muktananda's search for God. He received shaktipat initiation from him at 15 August of that year. Muktananda often said that his spiritual journey didn't truly begin until he received shaktipat from the holy man Bhagavan Nityananda. According to his description, it was a profound and sublime experience. Muktananda spent the next nine years living and meditating in a little hut in Yeola. He wrote about his sadhana and kundalini-related meditation experiences, in his autobiography. In 1956, Bhagawan Nityananda acknowledged the culmination of Muktananda's spiritual journey, and gave him a small piece of land at Ganeshpuri, near Bombay, instructing Muktananda to create an ashram there. The same year he started teaching his \"Siddha Yoga\" path. Between 1970 and 1981, Muktananda went on three world tours, establishing Siddha Yoga ashrams and meditation centers in many countries. In 1975, he founded the Siddha Yoga Ashram in Oakland, in the California Bay area, and in 1979 he established Shree Nityananda Ashram (now Shree Muktananda Ashram) in the Catskills Mountains, northwest of New York City.Brooks, Douglas; Durgananda, Swami; Muller-Ortega, Paul; Mahony, William; Rhodes-Bailly, Constantina; Sabharathnam, S.P. (1997). Meditation Revolution: A History and Theology of the Siddha Yoga Lineage; Agama Press; . Muktananda established Gurudev Siddha Peeth as a public trust in India to administer the work there, and founded the SYDA Foundation in the United States to administer the global work of Siddha Yoga meditation. He wrote many books; sixteen are still kept in print by the SYDA Foundation. In May 1982, Muktananda appointed two successors as joint leaders of the Siddha Yoga path, Swami Chidvilasananda and her younger brother, Swami Nityananda who later resigned and formed his own group. Muktananda died in October 1982 and is buried at Ganeshpuri, where the Gurudev Siddha Peeth ashram houses his sam\u0101dhi shrine. In 1983, after Muktananda's death, William Rodarmor printed several accusations of physical and sexual abuse, in CoEvolution Quarterly, from anonymous female devotees that Muktananda regularly had sex with them. He also charged that Muktananda had engaged in other behaviour at odds with wider societal norms.Lola Williamson (2010), Transcendent in America: Hindu-inspired Meditation Movements as New Religion, NYU Press, p.115John Philip (2009), Yoga, Inc.: A Journey Through the Big Business of Yoga, Penguin Group (Canada) (), p.179 These allegations were confirmed by other CoEvolution Quarterly journalists, while Lis Harris repeated and extended Rodarmor's allegations in an article in The New Yorker (1994).Lis Harris, The New Yorker, O Guru, Guru, Guru, 14 November 1994 Sarah Caldwell argued that Muktananda was both an enlightened spiritual teacher and a practitioner of Shakta Tantrism, but also \"engaged in actions that were not ethical, legal or liberatory with many disciples.\" ==Teaching and practice== Central to his teachings were to \"See God in each other,\" and \"Honor your Self. Worship your Self. Meditate on your Self. God dwells within you as you.\" Muktananda often gave a shorter version of this teaching: \"God dwells within you as you.\"Reverend Eugene S. Callender, Nobody is a Nobody, (Amazon) 2010, p.290 According to Lola Williamson, Muktananda was known as a \"shaktipat guru because kundalini awakening occurred so readily in his presence\".Homegrown Gurus, edited by Ann Gleig and Lola Williamson, chapter 4, Swamis, Scholars and Gurus by Lola Williamson, page 87 Through Shaktipat Intensives participants were said to receive shaktipat initiation, the awakening of Kundalini Shakti that is said to reside within a person, and to deepen their practice of Siddha Yoga meditation.Brooks, Douglas; Durgananda, Swami; Muller- Ortega, Paul; Mahony, William; Rhodes-Bailly, Constantina; Sabharathnam, S.P. (1997). Meditation Revolution: A History and Theology of the Siddha Yoga Lineage; Agama Press; pp 135-152. . Historically, Shaktipat initiation had been reserved for the few who had done many years of spiritual service and practices; Muktananda offered this initiation to newcomers and yogis alike.Brooks, Douglas; Durgananda, Swami; Muller-Ortega, Paul; Mahony, William; Rhodes-Bailly, Constantina; Sabharathnam, S.P. (1997). Meditation Revolution: A History and Theology of the Siddha Yoga Lineage; Agama Press; p 93. . There are several published accounts that describe the reception of shaktipat from Muktananda. Paul Zweig wrote one such account of receiving shaktipat from Muktananda.Paul Zweig, in John White (editor), Kundalini, Evolution, and Enlightenment () In Gurus of Modern Yoga, Andrea Jain, in her chapter on Muktananda, quotes an anonymous source, who describes his moment of shaktipat, when he was 19 years old, conferred by Muktananda with a wand of peacock feathers in 1975: == Bibliography == * Light on the Path (1972), Siddha Yoga Publications, * Mukteshwari: The Way of Muktananda (1972), SYDA Foundation * Getting Rid of What You Haven't Got (1974), Wordpress * Ashram Dharma (1975), SYDA Foundation, * I Love You (1975), SYDA Foundation * Selected Essays (1976), Siddha Yoga Publications, * God is With You (1978), Siddha Yoga Publications * I Am that: The Science of Hamsa from the Vijnana Bhairava (1978), Siddha Yoga Publications, * I Welcome You All With Love (1978), Siddha Yoga Publications, * In the Company of a Siddha: Interviews and Conversations With Swami Muktananda (1978), Siddha Yoga Publications * The Nectar of Chanting: Sacred Texts and Mantras Sung in the Ashrams of Swami Muktananda (1978), SYDA Foundation, * Play of Consciousness: A Spiritual Autobiography (1978), Siddha Yoga Publications, * Satsang with Baba : questions and answers between Swami Muktananda and his devotees (1978), Volumes 1 \u2013 5, SYDA, * Kundalini: The Secret of Life (1979), Siddha Yoga Publications, * To Know the Knower (1979), Siddha Yoga Publications, * Meditate (1980), State University of New York Press, * Kundalini Stavah (1980), SYDA Foundation, * The Perfect Relationship: The Guru and the Disciple (1980), SYDA Foundation, * Reflections of the Self (1980), Siddha Yoga Publications, * Secret of the Siddhas (1980), Siddha Yoga Publications, * A Book for the Mind (1981), SYDA Foundation * Does Death Really Exist?
