    "text": "The Alexander McClew Farm House is a single-family home located at 7115 Farrand Road in Millington, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ==History== Alexander McClew moved to this area in the 1870s, along with his wife, Mary. The couple settled into a wood house, but in 1880 McClew constructed this brick house. The size and style of the home was suited to the McClews' status as wealthy farmers. ==Description== The McClew Farm House is a two-story yellow brick Italianate structure, with a truncated hip roof supported by brackets. A 1-1/2 story rectangular gable- roofed wing is attached. The main section has a front facade divided into three recessed bays. The entryway is in the center bay, and contains an etched ruby glass transom and an overhang with elaborate bracketry. The window openings are symmetrically placed in the facade on both the first and second stories, and contain unusual projecting brick archways. This main section of the house has brick corbeling underneath the eaves. The wing is fronted by an open porch containing a central doorway with a window on each side. Brick corbeling ruins along the corner and eavesline. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Genesee County, Michigan Category:Italianate architecture in Michigan Category:Houses completed in 1880 ",
