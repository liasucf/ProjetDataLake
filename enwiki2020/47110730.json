    "text": "A sailor sandwich is a hot meat and cheese sandwich popular in Richmond, Virginia, area restaurants. Its core ingredients are hot pastrami, grilled knackwurst, melted Swiss cheese and hot mustard on rye bread. ==Origins== The New York Deli, founded in 1929, claims to be the originator of the sailor sandwich. The eatery moved to its current location in Carytown in 1934. According to local legend, during World War II, Navy seamen from the University of Richmond Navy V-12 program would frequent the New York Deli and order this then-nameless sandwich. It eventually became known as a sailor sandwich, although it is uncertain who officially named the sandwich. ==Variations== The marine sandwich is popular around some Marine bases like MCB Quantico. It is usually served on Italian bread with knackwurst, pastrami or salami and uses German-style mustard and comes with peppers. The West Coast version often includes sliced tomatoes on the side. ==In popular culture== * Patricia Cornwell, whose Kay Scarpetta novels often take place in the Richmond area, included characters ordering and eating sailor sandwiches in Cause of Death and Cruel and Unusual. * In Guy Fieri's book, Diners, Drive-ins and Dives: An All-American Road Trip, the chapter on Virginia features Dot's Back Inn in Richmond as a place to get a sailor sandwich. Dot's Back Inn and the sailor sandwich were featured in an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives filmed in 2007. ==See also== * List of American sandwiches * List of sandwiches ==References== Category:American sandwiches Category:Cheese sandwiches Category:Richmond, Virginia Category:V-12 Navy College Training Program ",
