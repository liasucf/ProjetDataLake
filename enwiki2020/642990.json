    "text": "Blackwater River is the name of three rivers in the northwestern South Island of New Zealand, one flowing into the Mangles River, one into the Buller River between Westport and Inangahua Junction (named due to the dark coloured waters the M\u0101ori discovered), and one into the M\u0101wheraiti (Little Grey) River. All three rivers are within a few kilometres of each other, to the south and east of Westport. ==Blackwater River, Tasman== The easternmost of the three Blackwater Rivers flows due north along a long straight valley, parallel to and equidistant from, the Matakitaki and Tutaki Rivers, reaching the Mangles River just to the east of the town of Murchison. It is some in length. () ==Blackwater River, West Coast (Buller River tributary)== The Blackwater River flows north-northwest for from the northern slopes of Mount Copernicus in the Paparoa Ranges, reaching the Buller River west of Inangahua in the lower Buller Gorge. () ==Blackwater River, West Coast (M\u0101wheraiti River tributary)== The southernmost Blackwater River is the name given to the lower reaches of the Big River, from its junction with the Blackwater Creek to its outflow into the M\u0101wheraiti (Little Grey) River. It flows generally westwards for before turning southwards immediately prior to its junction with the M\u0101wheraiti 2500 metres north of the township of Ikamatua. It joins with the similar-sized Snowy River 100 metres before its junction with the M\u0101wheraiti.
