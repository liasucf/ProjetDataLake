It was then renamed in time for the 1974 State Election. Tanjong Bungah was one of the first state seats in Penang to be captured by the then fledgling DAP in 1969. Koh Tsu Koon, a Gerakan politician, first won the Tanjong Bunga constituency in 1990 and was subsequently appointed as the Chief Minister of Penang. Koh held the seat until 2008, when he announced his intention to step down from his position as the Chief Minister. During the State Election later that year, the constituency was wrested from the Barisan Nasional (BN) federal ruling coalition by Teh Yee Cheu, then a DAP politician. Teh held Tanjong Bunga until the 2018 State Election, when DAP's Zairil Khir Johari, who was selected to replace the former, won the constituency. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"4\" |Penang State Legislative Assemblyman for Tanjong Bunga |- !Assembly !Years !Member !Party |- ! colspan=\"4\" align=\"center\" |Constituency created |- |1st |1959 \u2013 1964 | rowspan=\"2\" |Cheah Seng Khim | rowspan=\"2\" |Alliance (MCA) |- |2nd |1964 \u2013 1969 |- |3rd |1969 \u2013 1974 |Khoo Soo Giap |DAP |- |4th |1974 \u2013 1978 | rowspan=\"3\" |Khor Gark Kim | rowspan=\"8\" |BN (Gerakan) |- |5th |1978 \u2013 1982 |- |6th |1982 \u2013 1986 |- |7th |1986 \u2013 1990 |Khoo Boo Yeang |- |8th |1990 \u2013 1995 | rowspan=\"4\" |Koh Tsu Koon |- |9th |1995 \u2013 1999 |- |10th |1999 \u2013 2004 |- |11th |2004 \u2013 2008 |- |12th |2008 \u2013 2013 | rowspan=\"2\" |Teh Yee Cheu | rowspan=\"2\" |PR (DAP) |- |13th |2013 \u2013 2018 |- |14th |2018 \u2013 |Zairil Khir Johari |PH (DAP) |} == Election results == The electoral results for the Tanjong Bunga state constituency in 2008, 2013 and 2018 are as follows. == See also == * Constituencies of Penang == References == * __INDEX__ Category:Penang state constituencies ",
