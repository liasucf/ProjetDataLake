    "text": "Dalit Muslim refers to Hindu Untouchables, also called Dalits, who have converted to Islam. ==Background== Dr. Aftab Alam, a political scientist, states: > \"But caste and untouchability is a lived reality for Muslims living in India > and South Asia, and untouchability is the community's worst-kept secret.\" Even though Islam is egalitarian in its social ethics, Indian Muslim society is characterised by cast- like features, consisting of several caste- like groups (jatis,biraderis). Despite the conversion to Islam, the social and economic conditions of the Muslims in each caste hardly changed, and they remained tied down to their traditional occupations. ==Reservation== Muslim and Christian Dalit converts lose Reservation which is only available to Dalits who follow Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism under the Indian Government Reservation policy. National Commission for Minorities has suggested extending reservation to Dalit Muslims and Dalit Christians. == See also == * Pasmanda Muslim Mahaz, the political movement involving Dalit Muslims ==References== == External links == * Dalit Muslims of India, Al Jazeera Documentary ",
