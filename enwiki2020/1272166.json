Castrol was the title sponsor of Team Bray, owned by Australian drag car legend, Victor Bray for 17 years. Castrol was the main sponsor of the Castrol International Rally in Canberra for more than 10 years between 1976 and 1986. The same was true for an International Rally held in South Africa, ending annually in neighbouring Swaziland. It was the most prestigious event on the South African rally calendar at the time, until Castrol ended its sponsorship of this event. Later only some competitors' cars were carrying the bright green and red colours of Castrol sponsorship in national rally events, notably the S.A. Toyota dealer team. In 2019, Castrol extended their sponsorship activities by re-forming a partnership with Jaguar, this time supporting them in Formula E and also NASCAR Cup Series giants Roush Fenway Racing-Ford since 2020 season. ===American football=== Castrol advertising has been a part of telecasts of the National Football League for years. In 2011, Castrol's Edge brand became the official motor oil sponsor for the league, along with Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson endorsing the product; it has since been renewed until the 2017 season. The endorsement deal with Peterson was terminated on 16 September 2014, due to ongoing child abuse allegations. === Cricket === The Castrol Cricket Index for a team is a dynamic indicator of the overall performance of the cricket team. It is calculated by taking into consideration the batting momentum, the bowling efficiency, the performance of the teams in the quick start overs and the extreme performance overs and many other factors. Castrol Cricket also ranks cricketers based on their overall performance. India centric initiatives being undertaken like Castrol World Cup ka Hero was created during the 2011 Cricket World Cup. === Rugby Union === In 2011, Castrol signed a four-year sponsorship deal for the Australian national rugby union team and as the naming rights sponsor of The Rugby Championship. ==Advertising== It's More Than Just Oil. It's Liquid Engineering is the advertising slogan or punchline of Castrol, used mainly for branding its engine oil products. Castrol products are still marketed under the red, white and green colour scheme that dates from the launch of Castrol motor oil in 1909. Advertisements for Castrol oil historically featured the slogan \"Castrol \u2013 liquid engineering\"; this was more recently refreshed and reintroduced as \"It's more than just oil. It's liquid engineering.\" In 2008, this slogan was also being featured as the name for a new rewards club called the \"Castrol Liquid Engineering Crew\" in which members get the chance to win prizes. For many years, the opening notes of the second Nachtmusik movement of Mahler's Seventh Symphony were used as the signature theme of Castrol TV commercials. Wakefield vehicles advertised the company and Castrol on their sides; models of them were made by Dinky Toys, and in later times became sought-after collectors' items. One example from 1934 to 1935, in very good to excellent condition, was estimated to fetch \u00a31,000-\u00a31,500 at auction in 2016. ==References== ==External links== *Official Site \u2013 Castrol Motor Oil Category:Automotive companies of the United States Category:BP subsidiaries * Category:Chemical companies of the United States Category:Motor oils Category:British companies established in 1899 Category:Energy companies established in 1899 Category:Multinational companies Category:Oil companies of the United States Category:Petroleum products Category:British brands Category:1899 establishments in England ",
