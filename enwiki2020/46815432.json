    "text": "M-11 highway () (previously known as M-2.1) is a Montenegrin roadway. The M-11 highway serves as an extension of the M-1 highway, serving Tivat and Tivat Airport. When used with Ferryboat to Kamenari it also serves as a shortcut for M-1 highway bypassing much of bay of Kotor. It is the shortest highway in Montenegro. ==History== Before Vrmac Tunnel was built, M-11 highway was part of M-2 highway, which itself was part of Adriatic highway also serving as part of International E-roads. On 27 March 2014, the Ministry of Transport and Maritime Affairs realigned the M-2 highway. Regional road R-22 was declared defunct and its route integrated into the M-2. As a result of the realignment, the M-2 no longer served the Tivat Municipality. Instead, the Vrmac Peninsula (and thus the Tivat Municipality) was bypassed via the Vrmac Tunnel, connecting Radanovi\u0107i to Kotor. The pre-realignment route from Radanovi\u0107i and Lepetane (Ferryboat) was reassigned as the M-2.1 highway, while the remaining route between Lepetane and \u0160kaljari was downgraded to a municipal road. In January 2016, the Ministry of Transport and Maritime Affairs published bylaw on categorisation of state roads. With new categorisation, M-11 highway was created from previous M-2.1 highway. ==Major intersections== ==References== M-11 ",
