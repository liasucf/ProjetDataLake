    "text": "\"Retrato Em Branco E Preto\" (aka \"Portrait in Black and White\" and \"Zingaro\") is a Brazilian song composed by Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim, with lyrics in Portuguese by Chico Buarque. Jobim wrote the song in 1965 as an instrumental piece entitled \"Zingaro,\" which means \"gypsy.\" In a later interview, Jobim said, \"It was the story of a musician who eventually has to pawn his violin, has no place to work, is left without his music, totally empty- handed.\"Jobim, Paulo, Cancioneiro Jobim: Antonio Carlos Jobim: biografia, Jobim Music, Rio de Janeiro, 2002. . He released the instrumental version on his 1967 album A Certain Mr. Jobim. Soon after, he approached Chico Buarque about writing lyrics for the song. Biographer Helena Jobim says that \"Tom repeated the theme of 'Zingaro' over and over again, and loads of images, words, sounds, and harmonies came to both musicians.... Buarque recorded the melody on tape to elaborate on the verses at home. It was the first time they ever cowrote a song.... In this case, his verses were ready in just a few days.\u201d Jobim, Helena, Antonio Carlos Jobim: An Illuminated Man, Hal Leonard, Montclair, NJ, 2011. > The new piece was re-titled \"Retrato Em Branco E Preto,\" which translates into English as \"Portrait in White and Black.\" Jobim asked Buarque why he reversed the usual word order of \"black and white\". Buarque responded that if he had written \"preto e branco\" (black and white), the only word that would have rhymed was \"tamanco,\" a kind of clog.Homem, Wagner, Hist\u00f3rias de can\u00e7\u00f5es: Chico Buarque, Leya, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, 2009.
