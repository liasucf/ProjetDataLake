Ila is bordered by the river Nidelva in the south, Skansen in the north, and Steinberget, Bymarka, and Ilsvik\u00f8ra in the west. The area is mostly residential, with some industry and commerce. The Gr\u00e5kallbanen tram line runs through Ila and the area is served by the Skansen Train Station on the Tr\u00f8nderbanen commuter train line. Nordre Avlastningsvei, which was completed during 2010, connects Ila via Bratt\u00f8ra to Lademoen. Ilen Church ==History== The first settlement at Ila was in the second half of the 18th century. During the 19th century, the area developed as the entertainment centre of Trondheim, with dance saloons, pubs, and liquor stores. In 1826, it was the site for the first Norwegian Constitution Day parade. During the late 19th century the area started being redeveloped into dense labour-class housing, with a school opening in 1877. Ilen Church (Ila kirke) was opened in 1889 and in 1893 Ilalinjen, a horsecar line, was built with Ila Station as the terminus and rebuilt to a tramway in 1901. ==Notable residents== * J\u00f8rn Goldstein (born 1953), Olympic ice hockey goalie ==References== ==Other sources== * Category:Neighbourhoods of Trondheim ",
