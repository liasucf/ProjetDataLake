    "text": "Ooooooweeee!!! was the third album by the singer Dusty Springfield to be released in the USA, issued on the Philips Records label in 1965 and including the hit single \"Losing You\". Even more so than Springfield's first two US albums, Ooooooweeee!!! can be considered as a compilation since it comprises tracks both from her first British album, A Girl Called Dusty, as well as recordings originally issued on various A- and B-side singles and EPs - recorded and released in the UK over a period of some eighteen months. Ooooooweeee!!! also has tracks from Springfield's September 1964 sessions in New York, produced by Shelby Singleton Jr, some of which remain unreleased in Britain until 1998 and the CD re-issue of the 1965 album, Ev'rything's Coming Up Dusty.
