    "text": "Etosha R. Cave is an American mechanical engineer based in Berkeley, California. She is the Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer of Opus 12, a startup that recycles carbon dioxide. == Early life and education == Cave grew up in Houston, where she became interested in recycling oil and gas. During high school she joined the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE). She studied at Olin College, and was in the first graduating year in 2006. She held a NSBE Scholarship. After graduating, she worked at the McMurdo Station, where she serviced HVAC systems and built the laser diode for future NASA missions. Eventually Cave returned to her studies, and started a doctoral program at Stanford University working under the supervision of Thomas F. Jaramillo. During her PhD she worked on electrochemical approaches that could be used to convert carbon dioxide and water into useful plastics and household cleaners. She built a gas analysis system that could determine the composition of electrochemical reactions in realtime and earned her PhD in 2015. == Research and career == Whilst at Stanford University, Cave co-founded Opus 12. Opus 12 are a start-up which uses metal catalysts to recycle carbon dioxide. At first, Opus 12 struggled to raise money from the venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. Today Opus 12 is based at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and has secured several academic partnerships including funding from the National Science Foundation and I-Corps program. Cave hopes that they will be able to make diesel fuel from recycled carbon dioxide and water. Cave discussed the idea at TEDx Stanford, where she explained the recycled carbon dioxide could reduce our carbon footprint as well as supporting future space travel. Opus 12's first product will be the size of a dishwasher. Opus 12 was awarded the Forbes magazine Change the World Award and was selected for the Advanced Manufacturing Office Cyclotron Road program in 2016. She was a finalist for the Carbon Xprize in 2018. === Awards and honours === Her awards and honours include; * 2016 Echoing Green Fellow * 2017 7x7's Hot 20 Perennial Bay Area Innovators * 2017 Smithsonian Institution Innovators to Watch * 2018 Grist Top 508 * 2018 Vanity Fair 26 Women of Color Diversifying Entrepreneurship in Silicon Valley, Media, and Beyond She has spoken at the Aspen Ideas Festival and been part of Science Foo Camp. She is a member of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers. Cave is a member of the Advisory board of the Berkeley Startup Cluster. == References == Category:African- American inventors Category:Stanford University alumni Category:American chemical engineers Category:American women engineers Category:21st-century American inventors Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ",
