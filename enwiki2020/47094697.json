    "text": "Ramla Left Battery (), also known as Belancourt Battery () or Xag\u0127ra Battery (), was an artillery battery in Ramla Bay, limits of Xag\u0127ra on the island of Gozo, Malta. It was built by the Order of Saint John in 1715\u20131716 as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands. The battery now lies in ruins. ==History== Cittadella Ramla Left Battery was built in 1715\u20131716 as part of the first building programme of coastal batteries in Malta. It was one of several fortifications in Ramla Bay that also included Ramla Right Battery on the opposite side of the bay and Ramla Redoubt in the centre. These were all linked together by an entrenchment wall. Ramla Bay was further defended by Marsalforn Tower on the plateau above the bay, and an underwater barrier to prevent enemy ships from landing within the bay. The battery originally had an irregularly shaped gun platform with a parapet having six embrasures. A small blockhouse was located at the rear of the battery. Construction cost around 295 scudi. The battery saw use during the French invasion of Malta in 1798, when it fired on the approaching French fleet. ==Present day== Today, all that remains of the battery are some ruins. These ruins, along with the rest of Ramla Bay, are managed by the Gaia Foundation. At least one iron cannon from the battery is now located at the Cittadella. ==References== ==External links== *National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands Category:Batteries in Malta Category:Castles and fortifications of the Knights Hospitaller Category:Military installations established in 1715 Category:Ruins in Malta Category:Xag\u0127ra Category:Limestone buildings in Malta Category:National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands Category:18th- century fortifications Category:1715 establishments in Malta ",
