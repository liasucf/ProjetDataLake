The film's reception was mixed. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian singled out Redgrave's portrayal of Elizabeth Lowry as \"shrewd and amusingly bleak\" and gave it 3 out of 5 stars, but praised the two leads for an \"entertaining showcase\". Ian Freer of Empire gave Mrs Lowry & Son 2 out of 5 stars, stating that it felt \"inert and dismal, hitting the same tonal register for the majority of the running time, never bringing the artist or the art to life.\" ==References== ==External links== * * * Mrs Lowry & Son on Facebook Category:2019 films Category:2019 biographical drama films Category:Biographical films about painters Category:British films Category:English-language films Category:British biographical drama films Category:Films set in London Category:Films scored by Craig Armstrong (composer) Category:L.
