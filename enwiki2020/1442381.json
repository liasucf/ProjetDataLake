    "text": "Elections in Nicaragua gives information on elections and election results in Nicaragua. The Republic of Nicaragua elects on national level a head of state - the president - and a legislature. The President of Nicaragua and his or her vice-president are elected on one ballot for a five-year term by the people. The National Assembly (Asamblea Nacional) has 92 members: 90 deputies elected for a five-year term by proportional representation, the outgoing president, and the runner-up in the last presidential election. Should the president be reelected (not originally planned for in the Nicaraguan constitution), the outgoing vice president takes the seat reserved for him instead. Nicaragua has a multi-party system, which means that there are more than two dominant political parties, and in past years, no other parties were able to achieve any electoral success. ==Schedule== ===Election=== {|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Position !! 2011 !! 2012 !! 2013 !! 2014 !! 2015 !! 2016 |- !Type | Presidential (November) National Congress (November) Gubernatorial (November)||colspan=4|None|| Presidential (November) National Congress (November) Gubernatorial (November) |- !President and vice president |President and vice president ||colspan=4|None ||President and vice president |- !National Congress |All seats ||colspan=4|None ||All seats |- !Provinces, cities and municipalities |All positions ||colspan=4|None ||All positions |} ===Inauguration=== {|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Position !! 2012 !! 2013 !! 2014 !! 2015 !! 2016 !! 2017 |- !Type | Presidential (January) National Congress (January) Gubernatorial (January)||colspan=4|None|| Presidential (January) National Congress (January) Gubernatorial (January) |- !President and vice president |10 January ||colspan=4|None ||10 January |- !National Congress |10 January ||colspan=4|None ||10 January |- !Provinces, cities and municipalities |10 January ||colspan=4|None ||10 January |} ==Latest elections== ; 2016 presidential election {| class=wikitable style=text- align:right !Candidate !Party !Votes !% |- |align=left|Daniel Ortega||align=left|Sandinista National Liberation Front||1,806,651||72.44 |- |align=left|Maximino Rodr\u00edguez||align=left|Constitutionalist Liberal Party||374,898||15.03 |- |align=left|Jos\u00e9 Alvarado||align=left|Independent Liberal Party||112,562||4.51 |- |align=left|Saturnino Cerrato||align=left|Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance||107,392||4.31 |- |align=left|Erick Cabezas||align=left|Conservative Party||57,437||2.30 |- |align=left|Carlos Canales||align=left|Alliance for the Republic||35,002||1.40 |- |align=left colspan=2|Invalid/blank votes||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left colspan=2|Total||2,493,942||100 |- |align=left colspan=2|Registered voters/turnout||\u2013 ||\u2013 |- |align=left colspan=4|Source: CSE, BBC |} ; 2016 legislative election {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right !rowspan=2|Party !colspan=3|National !colspan=3|Constituency !rowspan=2|Total seats !rowspan=2|+/\u2013 |- !Votes !% !Seats !Votes !% !Seats |- |align=left|Sandinista National Liberation Front||1,590,316||65.86||14||1,608,395||66.46||56||70||+7 |- |align=left|Constitutionalist Liberal Party||369,342||15.30||3||375,432||15.51||10||13||+11 |- |align=left|Independent Liberal Party||162,043||6.71||1||117,626||4.86||1||2||\u201325 |- |align=left|Nicaraguan Liberal Alliance||137,541||5.70||1||137,078||5.66||1||2||+2 |- |align=left|Conservative Party||106,027||4.39||1||110,568||4.57||0||1||+1 |- |align=left|Alliance for the Republic||49,329||2.04||0||70,939||2.93||1||1||+1 |- |align=left|YATAMA||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||30,901||1.28||1||1||\u20131 |- |align=left|Special members||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||2||0 |- |align=left|Invalid/blank votes|| ||\u2013||\u2013|| ||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left|Total||2,414,598||100||20||2,450,939||100||70||92||0 |- |align=left|Registered voters/turnout|| || ||\u2013|| || ||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left colspan=9|Source: CSE, El 19 Digital |} ;2017 municipal elections In the 2017 municipal election voters elected Municipal Councils in 153 municipalities nationwide, with around 53% turnout.

Of the 1,551,597 citizens registered in July, 1,170,142 voted (75.41%). The null votes were 6% of the total. The national averages of valid votes for president were: *Daniel Ortega, Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) - 66.97% *Clemente Guido, Democratic Conservative Party (PCD) - 14.04% *Virgilio Godoy, Independent Liberal Party (PLI) - 9.60% *Mauricio Diaz, Popular Social Christian Party (PPSC) - 5.56% *Allan Zambrana, Nicaraguan Communist Party (PCdeN) - 1.45% *Domingo S\u00e1nchez Sancho, Nicaraguan Socialist Party (PSN) - 1.31% *Isidro T\u00e9llez, Marxist-Leninist Popular Action Movement (MAP-ML) - 1.03% The pro- Sandinista magazine, Envio claimed that this election was considered to have the \"most freedom of choice\" in the nation's history and was approved by international advocates of free elections. ====1990==== The historical election of 1990 took place on February 25. The total registered voters were 1,752,088 and the abstentions 241,250 or 13.7%. The United Nicaraguan Opposition coalition of those who opposed the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front was victorious, winning 55% of the vote. Violeta Chamorro became president.

The percentages for National Assembly representatives were very similar to those the parties had received for their presidential candidate. The electoral quotient needed to win one of the 90 National Assembly seats was obtained by dividing the number of valid votes in each region by the number of representatives that had been assigned to each region, proportional to its population. Each party's \"left over\" votes\u2014those insufficient to earn it a seat in a given region\u2014were then added together and re-tallied nationally. The seats earned in this second count went to the next candidate on the party's slate in the regions where it had come closest to winning on the first round. In addition, any party getting at least 1% of the presidential vote (which all six losing parties did) was allowed a seat for its defeated presidential candidate. The final composition of the National Assembly was thus: *Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) - 61 seats *Democratic Conservative Party (PCD) - 14 seats *Independent Liberal Party (PLI) - 9 seats *Popular Social Christian Party (PPSC) - 6 seats *Nicaraguan Communist Party (PCdeN) - 2 seats *Nicaraguan Socialist Party (PSN) - 2 seats *Marxist-Leninist Popular Action Movement (MAP-ML) - 2 seats Source: ====1990==== The 1990 parliamentary election was held together with the presidential election on February 25. The final composition of the National Assembly in 1990 was: *National Opposition Union (UNO) - 51 seats *Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) - 39 seats *Democratic Conservative Party (PCD) - 3 seats *Independent Liberal Party (PLI) - 3 seats *Popular Social Christian Party (PPSC) - 3 seats *Nicaraguan Communist Party (PCdeN) - 3 seats *Nicaraguan Socialist Party (PSN) - 3 seats *Marxist- Leninist Popular Action Movement (MAP-ML) - 3 seats *Revolutionary Unity Movement (MUR) - 1 seat *Social Christian Party (PSC) - 1 seat Note: The 1990 Assembly members are joined by any presidential candidate who receives over 1% of the vote Sources: ====1996==== The 1996 elections for the National Assembly took place together with the Presidential election on October 20. The final composition of the National Assembly in 1996 was: *Liberal Alliance (AL) - 42 seats *Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) - 36 seats *Nicaraguan Party of the Christian Path (CCN) - 4 seats *Nicaraguan Conservative Party (PCN) - 3 seats *National Project (PRONAL) - 2 seats *Nicaraguan Resistance Party (PRN) - 1 seat *Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS) - 1 seat *Unity Alliance (AU) - 1 seat *Independent Liberal Party (PLI) - 1 seat *National Conservative Action (ANC) - 1 seat *UNO-96 Alliance (UNO-96) - 1 seat Source: ====2001==== ====2006==== ====2011==== ===Municipal election results 1990-2004=== ====1990==== The 1990 municipal election was held together with the presidential and the parliamentary elections on February 25.

The final results for the elections were: *National Opposition Union (UNO) - 98 municipalities controlled *Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) - 31 municipalities controlled *Central American Unionist Party (PUCA) - 2 municipalities controlled Sources: ====1996==== A great expectation in the 1996 municipal elections was the participation for the first (and last) time of what the Electoral Law terms \"popular subscription associations\". According to the Electoral Law, to be formed, an association needed, among other things, to present to the Supreme Electoral Council a \"written request signed by a minimum of 5% of the citizens on the electoral rolls corresponding to the respective electoral area\". A total of 53 associations participated in the municipal elections. One of them (the Civic Association of Potos\u00ed) won the mayor's post. Despite winning only one municipality, an important number of association candidates finished in second or third place. In the nation's capital, Managua, two independent candidates; Pedro Sol\u00f3rzano of the Viva Managua Movement association and Herty Lewites of the Sol (sun) association competed against the AL and FSLN official candidates. ALN's Roberto Cede\u00f1o got the 28% of the votes followed closely by Sol\u00f3rzano with 26%, Carlos Guadam\u00faz from the FSLN with 25.7% and Herty Lewites who became Managua's mayor four years later came in fourth place with 12.3%. The 1996 municipal election took place together with the Presidential election on October 20. Municipal Councils were elected in 145 municipalities nationwide. The final results for the elections were: *Liberal Alliance (AL) - 92 municipalities controlled *Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) - 51 municipalities controlled *Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS) - 1 municipality controlled *Civic Association of Potos\u00ed (ACP) - 1 municipality controlled Source: ====2000==== In the 2000 municipal election 1,532,816 voters elected Municipal Councils in 151 municipalities nationwide. It was the first time that the Presidential and Municipal elections were held separately. The final results for the elections were: *Constitutionalist Liberal Party (PLC) - 94 municipalities controlled *Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) - 52 municipalities controlled *Conservative Party (PC) - 5 municipalities controlled The FSLN won for the first time in ten years the municipality of Managua, Nicaragua's capital city with its candidate Herty Lewites that pulled 44% of the votes. Source: ====2004==== In the 2004 municipal election 1,664,243 voters elected Municipal Councils in 152 municipalities nationwide, with nearly a 56% abstention. The final results for the elections were: *Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN-Convergence) - 87 municipalities controlled *Constitutionalist Liberal Party (PLC) - 57 municipalities controlled *Alliance for the Republic (APRE) - 4 municipalities controlled *Yapti Tasba Masraka Nanih Aslatakanka (YATAMA) - 3 municipalities controlled *Nicaraguan Resistance Party (PRN) - 1 municipality controlled Note: Elections took place for the first time in the newly created municipality of San Jos\u00e9 de Bocay in the Jinotega department. The 2004 municipal elections represented a huge Sandinista victory. The FSLN- Convergence won 14 of the 17 departmental capitals, 87 of the 152 municipalities \u2014including 5 of the 6 that make up Managua\u2019s greater metropolitan area\u2014 and 25 of Nicaragua\u2019s 42 largest cities. In total it will govern a little over 4 million inhabitants, nearly 71% of the national population. The Sandinista victory was attributed to the success of the FSLN- Convergence alliance. Of the 87 mayors elected on the FSLN ticket, 17 come from these allies: 5 are independents, 3 are from the Resistance, 3 belong to the Sandinista Renovation Movement (MRS), 2 are Conservatives, 2 are Liberals, 1 is from the Christian Unity Movement (MUC) and 1 is a Social Christian. Of the deputy mayors who ran with an FSLN mayoral candidate, 28 are Liberals, 16 are independent, 14 are from the MUC, 9 are Conservatives, 9 are from the MRS, 3 are from the Resistance and 1 is a Social Christian. These allied candidates allowed the FSLN to win 12 municipal governments for the first time.
