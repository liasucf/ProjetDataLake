In a number of official documents the college was termed the Tsarskoe Selo Forestry Institute. * In January 1811 the Tsarskoe Selo Forestry Institute was transferred to Saint Petersburg's north-bank Vyborg Side (placing the college in the wooden buildings of an old farm). After the Orloff Forestry Institute (founded in 1808 by Director of State Woods Orloff) was added, it was renamed the Forst-Institut. * In 1813 the Forst-Institut was combined with Kozelsk Forestry Institute (founded in 1804). The joint educational establishment was styled the Saint-Petersburg State Forestry Institute. * In 1826\u20141833 the architects I. F. Lucchini (\u0418. \u0424. \u041b\u0443\u043a\u0438\u043d\u0438) and A.
