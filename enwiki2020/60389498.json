The Publishers Weekly 70 (2): 985. In 1866, as a military doctor he joined a corps of Belgian volunteers in support of Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico. He travelled in Mexico and later settled in the United States.Troelstra, Anne S. (2016). Bibliography of Natural History Travel Narratives. KNNV Publishing. p. 328. Oswald was a conservationist.Smith, Harold Frederick. (1999). American Travellers Abroad: A Bibliography of Accounts Published Before 1900. Scarecrow Press. p. 223. He was concerned about the negative effects of deforestation. He urged a legislative act to protect \"the woods of all the upper ridges in hill countries.\"Behan, Richard W. (2001). Plundered Promise: Capitalism, Politics, and the Fate of the Federal Lands. Island Press. p. 93. His writings on natural history experienced an extensive international readership.Walter, David. (1992). Today Then: America's Best Minds Look 100 Years into the Future on the Occasion of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. American & World Geographic Publishing. p. 64. He wrote many scientific articles. His articles were published in the Popular Science magazine, The Monist journal, The Open Court journal and the North American Review. Oswald lived as a hermit and traveller, cooking his meals over an open fire.Hermit, Scientist, Philosopher. The Topeka State Journal. February 10, 1896. p. 4 He was dubbed \"the monkey man\" as he had two or three pet monkeys that he allowed to move freely in his house. In 1905, his house including his monkeys were set on fire and destroyed. ==Natural hygiene== Oswald was supportive of natural hygiene, a movement which advocated fasting, vegetarian dieting, pure water, clean air and exercise.Pizzorno, Joseph E; Murray, Michael T. (2013). Textbook of Natural Medicine. Elsevier Health Sciences. In 1889, Oswald wrote a series of articles under the general title, International Health Studies for John Harvey Kellogg's Good Health journal.Good Health for 1889. Good Health 24 (1). Oswald was an anti-vaccinationist and associated with Bernarr Macfadden. In 1901, Macfadden's publishing company released Oswald's book Vaccination a Crime.Colgrove, James. (2005). \u201cScience in a Democracy\u201d: The Contested Status of Vaccination in the Progressive Era and the 1920s. Isis 96 (2): 167\u2013191.

March 21, 1909. p. 2 Oswald has been described as an outspoken freethinker and one of the greatest advocates of the American freethought world. He authored the book The Secret of the East in 1883 and an article in 1891 that argued Christianity was of Buddhist origin.Oswald, Felix. (1891). Was Christ a Buddhist?. The Arena 3 (1): 193\u2013201. Lewis G. Janes suggested that this idea was \"discredited at the outset by the totally different conceptions of the God idea and the destiny of man after death in the two religions.\"Janes, Lewis G. (1899). The Comparative Study of Religions: Its Pitfalls and Its Promise. The Sewanee Review 7 (1): 1\u201320. James Thompson Bixby wrote a rebuttal to Oswald's article. He argued that \"the resemblances alleged by Dr. Oswald, even if granted, would be insufficient to prove his case... the differences between the Gospel and Buddhism run deeper and are more positive than the like-nesses.\"Bixby, James T. (1891). Buddhism in the New Testament. The Arena 3 (2): 555\u2013566. Edwin Arnold wrote that Oswald rejected the myths of Buddha and Christ for secular humanism, and that writers such as Oswald who wanted to \"prove that Christianity was derived from Buddhism was a way of undermining its authority.\"Arnold, Edwin. (1957). Interpreter of Buddhism to the West. New York: Bookman Associates. p. 101 Biblical scholars have rejected the theory that Christianity originated from Buddhism.Aiken, Charles Francis. (1900). The Dhamma of Gotama the Buddha and the Gospel of Jesus the Christ. Boston: Marlier and Company.Houlden, Leslie. (2006). Jesus: The Complete Guide. Bloomsbury Academic. p. 140. Felix was influenced by the research of Rudolf Seydel. Orientalist Friedrich Max M\u00fcller rejected Oswald's thesis but respected his dedication to the subject. M\u00fcller commented that Felix was \"one of the more conscientious and fair-minded students of Buddhism.\"M\u00fcller, Friedrich Max. (1999 edition, originally published in 1888). Studies in Buddhism. Asian Educational Services. pp. 79\u201381. ==Death== Oswald died from a train crash at Syracuse, New York on September 27, 1906.Scientific Notes and News. (1906).
