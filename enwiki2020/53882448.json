    "text": "The Argentine presidential election of 1874 was held on 12 April to choose the president of Argentina. Nicol\u00e1s Avellaneda was elected president. ==Background== President Sarmiento's pragmatic approach to Buenos Aires demands and his successful control of separatist revolts in the north paved the way to high office for his vice president, Autonomist Party leader Adolfo Alsina. Alsina gained the support of a sizable facion of Mitre's Nationalist Party, resulting in the formation of the paramount political group in Argentina for the next 42 years: The National Autonomist Party (PAN). Mitre himself did not support Alsina, however, whom he viewed as a veiled Buenos Aires separatist. The elder statesman ran for the presidency again, though the seasoned Alsina outmaneuvered him by fielding Nicol\u00e1s Avellaneda, a moderate lawyer from remote Tucum\u00e1n Province. The electoral college met on 12 April 1874, and awarded Mitre only three provinces, including Buenos Aires. As he had repeatedly up to 1861, Mitre took up arms again. Hoping to prevent Avellaneda's 12 October inaugural, he mutineered a gunboat; he was defeated, however, and only President Avellaneda's commutation spared his life.Todo Argentina: 1874 ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=19% ! colspan=2| Argentine Republic |- | Population | align=right| 2,154,000 |- | Voters | align=right| 25,800 |- | Turnout | align=right| 1.2% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"45%\" |- !width=\"50%\"| Presidential Candidates !width=\"30%\"| Party !width=\"20%\"| Electoral Votes |-style=\"background:#cfc;\" | Nicol\u00e1s Avellaneda | National | 145 |- | Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre | Nacionalist | 79 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total voters | 224 |- | colspan=2| Did not vote | 4 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total | 228 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"45%\" |- !width=\"50%\"| Vice Presidential Candidates !width=\"30%\"| Party !width=\"20%\"| Electoral Votes |-style=\"background:#cfc;\" | Mariano Acosta | National | 145 |- | Juan Eusebio Torrent | Nacionalist | 79 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total voters | 224 |- | colspan=2| Did not vote | 4 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total | 228 |} === Results by Province === {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"45%\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=2| Province ! colspan=2| President ! rowspan=2 width=\"1%\"| ! colspan=2| Vice President |- !
