The municipality consists of two non-contiguous areas, both along the shores of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The larger main part stretches from the Natashquan River to the Gros M\u00e9catina River and includes all populated places. The eastern part is a small section between Middle Bay and Brador. ==History== The Municipality of C\u00f4te-Nord-du-Golfe- Saint-Laurent was incorporated in 1963 and originally extended along the shores of the Saint Lawrence from the Natashquan River to the Newfoundland and Labrador provincial border, some roughly corresponding to the Basse-C\u00f4te-Nord territory. However, with an isolated population scattered over a large area devoid of roads, the municipality did not have an elected municipal council and was managed by an appointed administrator headquartered in Chevery. Starting in 1990, a restructuring plan was enacted that would carve up C\u00f4te- Nord-du-Golfe-Saint-Laurent into several additional municipalities. That year, the municipalities of Bonne-Esp\u00e9rance and Blanc-Sablon were formed, followed by the Municipality of Saint-Augustin on December 30, 1992, and finally the municipality of Gros-M\u00e9catina on December 22, 1993. On May 8, 1996, the municipality's name was officially adjusted to C\u00f4te-Nord-du-Golfe-du-Saint- Laurent. ==Communities== The municipality includes the communities of Chevery, Harrington Harbour, Kegaska, and T\u00eate-\u00e0-la-Baleine. It also includes the following abandoned settlements and ghost towns, in order from west to east: Musquaro, Wolf Bay, Aylmer Sound, Ettamiau, Pointe Amouri, Barachois, Chez Menneau, and Boulet's (also known as Bully's). ===Chevery=== Chevery () is the administrative centre of the municipality, located at the mouth of the N\u00e9tagamiou River. Its population in the Canada 2011 Census was 251. ===Harrington Harbour=== Harrington Harbour () was founded near the end of the 19th century by fishermen from Newfoundland.Tourism Lower North Shore: Harrington Harbour The primary activity is commercial fishing for crabs, lobster, turbot, halibut, cod, and lumpfish. Its population in the Canada 2011 Census was 261. ===Kegaska=== Kegaska () is the westernmost community in the municipality. Its population in the Canada 2011 Census was 138, mostly anglophone settlers from Anticosti Island. ===T\u00eate-\u00e0-la-Baleine=== T\u00eate-\u00e0-la- Baleine (), occasionally known as Whale Head in English, was settled in the 19th century after Michael Kenty bought the local trading post from the Labrador Company. Its population in the Canada 2011 Census was 129. ===Musquaro=== The ghost town of Musquaro () is at the mouth of the Musquaro River, between Kegaska and La Romaine. Identified as Masco\u00fcarou on Louis Jolliet's map of 1694, the name went through numerous spelling changes, such as Nasquirou, Maskouaro, and Mahkuanu. Its root meaning is \"black bear tail\" and may refer to the foothills of Mount Masco\u00fcarou as shown Jolliet's map. It was the site of a fortified trading post, established in 1710, and a catholic mission. In 1780, the post was on the territory granted to the Labrador Company of Quebec. 23 years later, the franchise went to the North West Company which in turn was sold to the Hudson's Bay Company in 1821. Closed for a brief time in 1859, the post remained occupied until 1925 after which it closed permanently. ==Demographics== ===Population=== ===Language=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !colspan=\"19\"|Canada Census Mother Tongue - C\u00f4te-Nord-du- Golfe-du-Saint-Laurent, Quebec |- !
