    "text": "The An Innocent Man Tour was a 1984 concert tour by singer-songwriter Billy Joel. The tour began on January 18 in Providence, Rhode Island (which went on despite a snow storm) and ended on July 5 with the last of seven shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The tour was Joel's first large world tour since a 1982 motorcycle accident.Bordowitz, Hank. Billy Joel: The Life and Times of an Angry Young Man (Revised ed. 2011), p. 217 The tour was very popular, with a contemporaneous report stating that finding tickets except through scalpers was \"virtually impossible.\" A report on the February 1, 1984 Toledo show stated that his band included Frank Simms, Peter Huwlett and Bob Duncan on backing vocals, a three-piece brass section of Larry Etkin, Bob Livingood on trumpets, Glenn Stulpin on saxophones as well as Joel's touring/recording band of Liberty DeVitto (drums, percussion), Doug Stegmeyer (bass), Russell Javors (rhythm guitar), David LeBolt (keyboards), David Brown (lead guitar), and Mark Rivera (saxophones, percussion). ==Tour dates== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! style=\"width:150px;\"|Date !
