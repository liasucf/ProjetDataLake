    "text": "Cecil\u00edu saga is an Old Norse-Icelandic saints' saga that recounts the legend of St Cecilia. It is preserved in three manuscripts, but is only complete in Kirkjub\u00e6jarb\u00f3k. The version of the saga preserved in Stock. Perg. fol no. 2 includes two Icelandic miracles of St Cecilia. These are notable for being one of the very few examples of miracles performed by non-native saints, and as an example of early hagiographic composition in Iceland rather than translations from Latin exemplars. Cormack notes that while these miracles may be late compositions, \"they give the impression of being genuine records of an early cultus\". Cecilia's feast day November 22 was adopted as Holy Day of Obligation in Iceland in 1179 under \u00deorl\u00e1kr \u00de\u00f3rhallsson. The saga also includes an account of the passions of Sts Tiburtius and Valerian. Catherine appears in three Old Norse-Icelandic poems: V\u00edsur Cecil\u00edu (ca. 1300-1500); Cecil\u00edudiktur (ca. 1400-1550); and the fourteenth-century Heilagra meyja dr\u00e1pa (stanzas 18-21). == Bibliography == A comprehensive bibliography can be found in Wolf's The Legends of the Saints in Old Norse-Icelandic Prose. === Manuscripts === * AM 235 fol. * AM 429 12mo (Kirkjub\u00e6jarb\u00f3k) * Stock.
