    "text": "Engraving showing the murder of San Vitores by Mata'pang (right) and Hurao (left). Mat\u00e5'pang (died 1680) was a Chamorro maga'l\u00e5hi or chief of the ancient Chamorro village of Tomhom on the island of Guahan. His name meant \"to be made pure by cleansing,\" in Chamorro. Mat\u00e5'pang is best known for resisting the Spanish invasion of his country and for his conflict with a Spanish priest Diego de San Vitores, an early missionary of the colonial Spanish empire on Guam, and his Filipino associate, Pedro Calungsod, resulting in the deaths of the foreigners at the hands of Mat\u00e5'pang and his companion Hurao. Today Mat\u00e5'pang has become iconic among many activists for Chamorro self- determination. == Biography == Early in his life, Mat\u00e5'pang converted to Christianity, but later renounced the faith after seeing the Spaniards use it to suppress Chamorro culture. However, in an attempt to draw Mat\u00e5'pang back to the church, Diego de San Vitores covertly baptized Mat\u00e5'pang's infant daughter in 1672. This action infuriated Mat\u00e5'pang, not just because of the baptism but also because it violated a taboo against entering a chief's home; after learning of his daughter's baptism, Mat\u00e5'pang immediately tracked down and killed San Vitores. The death of San Vitores caused the Christianizing mission on Guam to deteriorate into open conflict, and Mat\u00e5'pang began acting as a key military leader among the Chamorro. However, he was eventually injured in battle, and retreated to the nearby island of Rota to recuperate. A Spanish fleet was subsequently sent to Rota to track down Mat\u00e5'pang, and fearing that they would draw the Spaniards' ire, the island's population turned on him. The people of Rota attacked Mat\u00e5'pang and cast him out on a boat; Mat\u00e5'pang would succumb to his injuries while sailing back to Guam. ==Cultural references== Mat\u00e5'pang today has been reclaimed as a celebrated figure by many in the younger generation of Chamorro activists, who view him as a moving figure of resistance against imperial domination and cultural erasure. Jay Baza Pascua's spoken-word poem \"A Descendant of Mat\u00e5'pang\" is a good example of this movement to rehabilitate Mat\u00e5'pang as a Chamorro icon. In that poem, Pascua states: > \"You see, Father Luis de San Vitores was determined to bring God to the > \u201cIndios\u201d of the Pacific. \"Determined enough he disobeyed Mat\u00e5pang\u2019s order > not to baptize his ailing child ... Mat\u00e5pang retaliated by killing the > missionary priest. \"It was not that Mat\u00e5pang defied the missionary\u2019s > spiritual relief but that San Vitores defied Mat\u00e5pang\u2019s cultural belief. \"In > so doing \u2026 this legendary chief ignited the flames that started a 30-year > war between the Chamorros and the Spanish ... the embers of that fire > continue to burn within the hearts of those who want Guam to be free from > colonial rule.\" ==Academic critiques== Professor Vince Diaz has critically examined the legacy of Maga'l\u00e5hi Mat\u00e5'pang in his presentation and later article \"In the Wake of Mat\u00e5'pang's Canoe.\" His talks deconstruct the varying accounts of Mat\u00e5\u2019pang from both indigenous and colonial views. In doing so, he utilizes the metaphor of the canoe \u2014 the literal and symbolic seafaring vessel of the Chamorros \u2014 and delves into the linguistic variations of the word mat\u00e5\u2019pang between Chamorro and Tagalog. \u201cThe first step is to displace momentarily San Vitores as the principle sign in favor of Native perspective and reality, so that the new protagonist is Mat\u00e5\u2019pang,\u201d said Diaz. \u201cThe second step would be to appreciate Mat\u00e5\u2019pang in native discourse, that is, in terms of how it has and how it can be understood and comprehended in indigenous ways.\u201d ==See also== *Hurao *Gadao ==References== *Bevacqua, Michael Lujan. \"Mat\u00e5'pang: Evolution of the Term.\" Guampedia. *Diaz, Vicente M. \"In the Wake of Mata'pang's Canoe: The Cultural and Political Possibilities of Indigenous Discursive Flourish.\" Critical Indigenous Studies.
