    "text": "Lionel Tarassenko, (born 17 April 1957) is a British engineer and academic, who is a leading expert in the application of signal processing and machine learning to healthcare. He was previously Head of Department of Engineering Science (Dean of Engineering) at the University of Oxford, succeeded by Ronald A. Roy. He has been a Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Oxford since 1997The Brick: the newsletter for Keble alumni; Hilary term 2012, p. 3 and is a Professorial Fellow of St John's College, Oxford.St John's College, Oxford He has been invited by the Vice-Chancellor Louise Richardson to oversee the development of Reuben College, a new graduate society in the University, as founding president. Tarassenko is the author of over 230 journal papers, 200 conference papers, 3 books and over 30 granted patents.Google Scholar He has supervised 65 doctoral students. He has been a founder director of four University spin-out companies, the latest being Oxehealth in September 2012.Oxehealth He is also the R&D; Director and Chair of the Strategic Advisory Board of Sensyne Health, a digital health company which floated on AIM in August 2018.Sensyne Health He is a director of the University\u2019s wholly owned Technology Transfer company, Oxford University Innovation.At Oxford University Innovation Profile He was the editor-in-chief of the 2018 Topol Review of NHS Technology and its impact on the workforce.Article in NHS Health Education England Tarassenko was the driving force behind the creation of the Institute of Biomedical Engineering (IBME) at the University of Oxford, which he directed from its opening in April, 2008 to October, 2012. He established an \u00a38m Centre of Excellence in Medical Engineering within the IBME,Centre of Excellence in Medical Engineering, Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Oxford and he has led the Technology & Digital Health theme in the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre since its inception in 2007.NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre Under his leadership, the IBME grew from 110 to 220 academic researchers and it was awarded a Queen\u2019s Anniversary Prize for Higher Education in 2015 for \u201cnew collaborations between engineering and medicine delivering benefit to patients\u201d.Queen's Anniversary Prize == Education == Tarassenko completed his BA in Engineering Science in 1978 at Keble College, University of Oxford. Later obtained his DPhil in 1985, also at the University of Oxford for his work on the early identification of brain haemorrhages in pre-term infants. == Career and Research == Together with Professor Alan Murray of University of Edinburgh, Tarassenko is the inventor of pulse-stream technique for analogue implementation of massively parallel neural networks.Murray, A.F. and Tarassenko, L., 1994. Analogue neural VLSI: a pulse stream approach. Chapman & Hall, Ltd. He gradually moved away from designing neural network hardware to developing new machine learning algorithms and applying them to problems as diverse as the automated re-heating of food and drinks in a microwave oven (implemented in the Sharp LogiCook oven) and the analysis of sleep disorders. This body of work was recognised in 1996 by the award of the IEE Mather Premium for innovation using neural networks. Tarassenko then went on to develop methods for learning how to characterise normality in safety-critical systems. With his research team, he designed the QUICK system, which was at the core of Rolls-Royce\u2019s engine health monitoring strategy in the 1990s and the early 2000s.Nairac, A., Townsend, N., Carr, R., King, S., Cowley, P., and Tarassenko, L. A System for the Analysis of Jet Engine Vibration Data. Integr. Comput.-Aided Eng. 6, 1 (January 1999), 53-66.Tarassenko, L., Clifton, D.A., Bannister, P.R., King, S., and King, D.: Novelty Detection. In: Worden, K., et al. (eds): Encyclopaedia of Structural Health Monitoring, Wiley, 2009 As a result, he and his Rolls-Royce collaborators were awarded the Chairman\u2019s Team Award for Technical Innovation in 2001 and the Sir Henry Royce High Value Patent Award in 2008. When he became the first Director of the Oxford Institute of Biomedical Engineering in 2008, Tarassenko focused his research on patient monitoring, both in and out of hospital. His work has had a major impact on the identification of deterioration in acute care and on the management of long-term conditions. He has been a pioneer in developing early warning systems for acutely ill patients. The machine-learning system (Visensia) which he designed for patient monitoring in critical care was the first such system to gain FDA approval (in 2008).OBS Medical In the last decade Tarassenko has led the engineering development of several digital health products including: (a) GDm-Health, a digital therapeutic for the management of gestational diabetes;GDm-Health on NHS Apps Library (b) SEND, a system for monitoring in-hospital patient vital signs and identifying deterioration early;SEND on NIHR Oxford BRC Wong D, Bonnici T, Knight J, Morgan L, Coombes P, Watkinson P. SEND: a system for electronic notification and documentation of vital sign observations. BMC medical informatics and decision making. 2015 Dec;15(1):68.(c) EDGE-COPD, a digital therapeutic for the self-monitoring and self-management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and (d) Support-HF, a system for heart failure management in the community. == Awards and Honours == Tarassenko was elected to a Fellowship of the Institute of Electrical Engineers in 1996, when he was also awarded the IEE Mather Premium for his work on neural networks, to a Fellowship of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2000, and to a Fellowship of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 2013. He received a British Computer Society Medal in 1996 for his work on neural network analysis of sleep disorders. His research on jet engine health monitoring was awarded the Rolls-Royce Chairman's Award for Technical Innovation in 2001 and the Sir Henry Royce High Value Patent Award in 2008. His work on mobile phones for healthcare was awarded the E-health 2005 Innovation Award for \u201cbest device to empower patients\u201d. He received the 2006 Silver Medal of the Royal Academy of Engineering for his contribution to British engineering leading to market exploitation and he won the Institute of Engineering & Technology IT Award, also in 2006. In 2010, he gave the prestigious Vodafone lecture on mobile health at the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Centenary Lecture on Biomedical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore. He received the 2015 Martin Black Prize from the Institute of Physics for the best paper in Physiological Measurement He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to engineering. ==Personal life== Tarassenko is married to Dr Anne Tarassenko. He has 3 children and 3 step- children. He is a Lay Canon of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. ==References== ==External links== * Oxford BioSignals Ltd (founding director) * An Engineering Biography - Lionel Tarassenko FREng Ingenia, Issue 30, Mar 2007 * IdeasLab 2014 - Lionel Tarassenko - Self Monitoring Digital Health World Economic Forum, Davos, 2014 Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:British electrical engineers Category:Fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering Category:Fellows of the Institution of Engineering and Technology Category:People from Paris Category:Alumni of Keble College, Oxford Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Fellows of St John's College, Oxford Category:Heads of colleges of the University of Oxford Category:Reuben College, Oxford ",
