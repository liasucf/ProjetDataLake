    "text": "The Smith & Wesson Model 586, is a six- or seven-shot double-action revolver chambered for the .357 Magnum cartridge; it will also chamber and fire .38 Special cartridges. The Model 586 has a carbon steel construction and is available in a blued or nickel finish; it is essentially the same firearm as the Model 686, which has stainless steel construction. It is also known as the Distinguished Combat Magnum. Smith & Wesson 586-1 with 6 inch barrel ==Description== In addition to being able to chamber and fire .357 Magnum cartridges, the 586 will chamber and fire .38 Special cartridges as well as .38 Special +P (overpressure ammunition). The 586 has been available with 2\u00bd in, 3 in, 4 in, 6 in, and 8\u215c in (64, 76, 102, 153, and 214 mm) barrel lengths as standard models and other barrel lengths either by special order from S&W;'s Performance Center custom shop, or acquired from or built by after- market gunsmiths. The barrel has a twist rate of 1/18.75 for the 158 grain bullet. The Model 586 uses S&W;'s L (medium) revolver frame, with a K-frame- sized grip mated to a larger diameter cylinder. During the 1980s, Smith & Wesson developed its L-frame line of .357 Magnums: the Model 581, Model 586, Model 681, and Model 686. The Model 581 had a fixed notch type rear sight, whereas the 586 used a target style adjustable rear sight. These handguns had a major effect on both law enforcement and sporting markets. The 586 was introduced in 1980, while the 581 was discontinued in 1988. The K-frame guns, though popular with police departments, were felt to be too light for full- power .357 ammunition, and a heavier and more durable gun was desired, in the same frame size. (This would avoid the complaints attaching to the larger, heavier N-frame Model 29 and Model 58.\"Smith & Wesson's .41 Magnum\", Free Patriot Web site. Accessed August 6, 2008.) Designed with input from official S&W; historian Roy Jinks, the L-frame was the result, and it quickly gained praise from policemen and hunters.Standard Catalog of Smith & Wesson; 3rd Edition (Gun Digest Books, 2006) The 586 was discontinued in 1999. After a 13-year absence, it was reintroduced in 2012 with the aforementioned safety modifications, plus an improved yoke, as the 586-8 variant. These are produced with 4- and 6-inch barrel lengths, as part of Smith & Wesson's Classic line of revolvers. ==Recall== For L-frame revolvers manufactured before August 1987 (seven years after the release of the Model 586), there were limited reports of cylinder binding occurring with .357 Magnum ammunition using a lighter weight bullet (versus the standard weight 158 grain bullet) and loaded to a high velocity. S&W; put out a product warning and authorized a no-charge upgrade to make modifications to all 586, 586-1, 686, 686-1, and 686CS-1 revolvers.Product Warning, Popular Mechanics, January 1988, p. 11. ==Engineering and production changes== *586 (no dash), 1980 Introduction model *586-1, 1986 radius stud package, floating hand *586-2, 1987 changed hammer nose, bushing and associated parts *586-M, 1987 Product warning by S&W;: M over stamped to signify a modification by factory or warranty station for 586 and 586-1 *586-3, 1988 new yoke retention system *586-4, 1993 change rear sight leaf, drill and tap frame, change extractor, Hogue grips *586-5, 1997 delete 8 3/8\" barrel/change to MIM thumbpiece/Ship with Master trigger locks *586-6, 1997 change frame design to eliminate cylinder stop stud, eliminate serrated tangs, MIM hammer and trigger, change to internal lock. *586-7, 2004 Performance Center .38 Super, 6-Shot unfluted cylinder, 4\" barrel, Stainless Steel, 250 Made, seven shot with internal lock *586-8, 2012 Reintroduction as a Classic Series with internal lock 6-shot 4\" and 6\" RR, WO TS SB ==Recall== In 1987, seven years after the release of the Model 686, there were reports of cylinder binding with some types of standard .357 Magnum ammunition for L-frame revolvers manufactured before August 1987.
