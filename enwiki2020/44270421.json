    "text": "The Redemption is a 1936 novel by F. J. Thwaites. It was his ninth novel. ==Plot== Terry Gordon, second officer on a mail steamer, loses his job due to the influence of a beautiful girl. He hits rock bottom but finds redemption through the help of another woman. ==Reception== According to one critic: > Speed is not impairing the work of this young Australian author, neither is > he skimping words in order to get each book finished. This one has more than > 300 pages, and in spite of a rather obvious ending holds the interest all > the way. 'The Redemption' has many passages reminiscent of 'Broken Wings' > and 'The Mad Doctor,' and the general theme, too, is not original. But the > setting is different and the treatment more mature, showing a keener > understanding of human beings. ==References== ==External links== *The Redemption at AustLit Category:1936 Australian novels ",
