This former U.S. Navy sailor and bodybuilder was a member of the Mae West \"Muscleman Revue\" in the late 1950s. He was a brawny, handsome durable 6'4\" man with curly brown hair, bluish green eyes and an affable demeanor. He was probably one of the most memorable actors in the Roman epic movies created in the 1960s and early '70s to portray Hercules - the most famous Greek warrior. He was also one of many bodybuilders to take a stab at fame and fortune with the Italian peplum films of the 1960s. Noted film critic Raymond Durgnat famously asked if he was \"the brother of Quo?\".p.71 Frayling, Christopher Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone\" 1981 Routledge Dan's most notable role was The Triumph of Hercules (1964), in which he portrayed Hercules battling golden giants and trying to save his princess love from her evil relative. The film was quickly followed by Hercules the Invincible retitled Son of Hercules in the Land of Darkness, in The Sons of Hercules television package by Embassy Pictures. What made Vadis stand out from other athletes and bodybuilders in these films was the obvious speed, dexterity, agility and all around durability that he brought to his films, bringing much needed energy to what otherwise may have been average fight scenes. After the sword and sandal films faded he moved into spaghetti westerns, then became a recurring face in Clint Eastwood movies such as High Plains Drifter, The Gauntlet, Every Which Way But Loose, Any Which Way You Can and Bronco Billy. He died 11 June 1987 in Lancaster, California, United States, in a car in the desert, his death was declared an accidental drug overdose with acute ethanol and heroin-morphine intoxication. He was survived by his wife Sharon Jessup and his son Nick Vadis, known as \"Nick V\". ==Partial filmography== *Colossus of the Arena (1962) - Sidon *The Rebel Gladiators (1962) - Ursus *The Pirates of the Mississippi (1963) - Blackfoot *The Ten Gladiators (1963) - Roccia / The Rock *Hercules the Invincible (1964) - Hercules *Zorikan lo sterminatore (1964) - Zorikan *The Triumph of Hercules (1964) - Ercole *Triumph of the Ten Gladiators (1964) - Roccia *Spartacus and the Ten Gladiators (1964) - Gladiator Roccia *The Sucker (1965) - (uncredited) *Deguejo (1966) - Ramon *Kommissar X \u2013 Drei gelbe Katzen (1966) - King *For a Few Extra Dollars (1966) - Nelson Riggs *The Stranger Returns (1967) - En Plein *The Scalphunters (1968) - Yuma *Dio perdoni la mia pistola (1969) - Martin *High Plains Drifter (1973) - Dan Carlin, outlaw *Cahill U.S. Marshal (1973) - Brownie *The White Buffalo (1977) - Tall Man (uncredited) *The Gauntlet (1977) - Biker *Every Which Way But Loose (1978) - Frank (Black Widow) *Bronco Billy (1980) - Chief Big Eagle *Any Which Way You Can (1980) - Frank (Black Widow) *I sette magnifici gladiatori (1982) - Nicerote (final film role) ==Notes== ==External links== * Category:1938 births Category:1987 deaths Category:American male film actors Category:American bodybuilders Category:American expatriates in Italy Category:Male Spaghetti Western actors Category:20th-century American male actors Category:Accidental deaths in California Category:American expatriates in China Category:American people of Greek descent Category:Drug- related deaths in California Category:Male actors of Greek descent Category:People associated with physical culture ",
