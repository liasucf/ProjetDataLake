At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 74 based on 4 reviews. In a positive review, Kitty Richardson of The Line of Best Fit concluded 6lack \"trumped his opponents and influences with a fragile grace and solid talent for songwriting, echoing that of our most decorated balladeers. It's a hope that the album's use of an undeniably fashionable sound doesn't hinder its potential for timelessness; there is so much here to fall for.\" Luke Fox of Exclaim! described East Atlanta Love Letter as \"impeccably cohesive\", praising the minimalist production and adding the album is \"a record that captures the trap-soul zeitgeist that will best catch you in your feelings.\" Online hip hop publication HipHopDX praised the album, stating: \"In an era where artists hype up projects that turn out to be nothing but half-baked playlists, 6LACK\u2019s thoughtful embrace of the album format is refreshing. East Atlanta Love Letter is a moody masterpiece that may very well take the artist\u2019s career to new heights.\" In a mixed review, Dean Van Nguyen of Pitchfork criticised the album's lyrical content, commenting that 6lack \"traps listeners within the four walls of his drab hotel room, exposing us to his joyless, low-energy meditations that don\u2019t capture relationships or the human experience in any kind of meaningful way.\" ===Year-end lists=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
