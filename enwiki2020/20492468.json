The geographic coordinates of Firstview are roughly the antipodes of the coordinates of \u00cele Saint-Paul, a French island in the Indian Ocean. This island is one of only three land areas with antipodes in the contiguous United States. The town was laid out in 1911. It was named for the spot where travelers got their first glimpse of Pikes Peak, to the west. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Cheyenne County, Colorado Category:Unincorporated communities in Colorado ",
