    "text": "S\u00e1ndor We\u00f6res (; 22 June 1913 \u2013 22 January 1989) was a Hungarian poet and author. Born in Szombathely, We\u00f6res was brought up in the nearby village of Cs\u00f6nge. His first poems appeared when he was fourteen, being published in the influential journal Nyugat (\"West\") through the acceptance of its editor, the poet Mih\u00e1ly Babits. We\u00f6res attended the University of P\u00e9cs, studying law first before moving on to geography and history. He ultimately received a doctorate in philosophy and aesthetics. His doctoral dissertation The Birth of the Poem was published in 1939. It was in 1937 that he made the first of his travels abroad, going first to Manila for a Eucharistic Congress and then visiting Vietnam and India. During World War II We\u00f6res was drafted for compulsory labor, but was not sent to the front. After the end of the war, he returned to Cs\u00f6nge and briefly lived as a farmer. In 1948 We\u00f6res again travelled abroad, residing in Italy until 1949. In 1951 he settled in Budapest where he would reside for the rest of his life. The imposition of Stalinism in Hungary after 1948 silenced We\u00f6res and until 1964 little could be published. == Work == We\u00f6res' translations into Hungarian were wide and varied, including the works of Ukrainian national poet Taras Shevchenko, the Georgian poet Rustaveli, the Slovenian poets Oton \u017dupan\u010di\u010d and Josip Murn Aleksandrov. He translated Indian poet Jai dev's poetry Gita Govinda from Sanskrit. He also translated Shakespeare's Venus and Adonis and Henry VIII, T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land, the nonsense poems by Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll, the complete poetry of St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9,. His translation of the Tao Te Ching continues to be the most widely read in Hungary. == Legacy == Many of We\u00f6res' poems have been set to music. Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly composed a choral piece to the text of the 14-year-old poet's poem \u00d6regek (Old People). Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti, a friend of the poet, set several poems from Rongysz\u0151nyeg and other books in the composition S\u00edppal, dobbal, n\u00e1diheged\u00fcvel. Composer Peter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s has composed two pieces, Atlantis and Ima with texts from We\u00f6res' poem N\u00e9ma zene (\"Silent Music\"), and in 2013 he composed Speaking Drums (Four Poems for Percussion Solo and Orchestra) based on the poems by S\u00e1ndor We\u00f6res. In 1980 the Hungarian filmmaker G\u00e1bor B\u00f3dy adapted the poem Psych\u00e9 to make the epic feature N\u00e1rcisz \u00e9s Psych\u00e9. == Works == === Poetry === * Hideg van, 1934 * A k\u0151 \u00e9s az ember, 1935 * A teremt\u00e9s dics\u00e9rete, 1938 * Meduza, 1944 * A szerelem \u00e1b\u00e9c\u00e9je, 1946 * Elysium, 1946 * Gy\u00fcm\u00f6lcskos\u00e1r, 1946 * A fogok torn\u00e1ca, 1947 * B\u00f3bita, 1955 * A hallgat\u00e1s tornya, 1956 * Tarka forg\u00f3, 1958 * T\u0171zk\u00fat, 1964 * Gyermekj\u00e1t\u00e9kok, 1965 * Mer\u00fcl\u0151 Saturnus, 1968 * Zimzizim, 1969 * Psyche, 1972 * T\u00e9lorsz\u00e1g, 1972 * Priapos, written in 1950, published posthumously in 2001 Category:1913 births Category:1989 deaths Category:People from Szombathely Category:20th- century Hungarian poets Category:Hungarian male poets Category:University of P\u00e9cs alumni Category:Hungarian children's writers Category:20th-century Hungarian male writers Category:Burials at Farkasr\u00e9ti Cemetery Category:Baumgarten Prize winners ",
