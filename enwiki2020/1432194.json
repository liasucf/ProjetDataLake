To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Golden Raspberry Awards, four special categories\u2014Worst Razzie Loser of Our First 25 Years, Worst \"Comedy\" of Our First 25 Years, Worst \"Drama\" of Our First 25 Years, and Worst \"Musical\" of Our First 25 Years\u2014were created. This edition of the Razzies was the first to give nominations to a movie that was neither a critical nor a box-office bomb: the Palme d'Or winner Fahrenheit 9/11. It received nominations not because the movie itself was of poor quality, but because the film depicted political figures' mishandling of the September 11 attacks and the Iraq War. The Razzies, which had previously steered clear of politics, received criticism from some quarters for nominating the performances of George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, and Condoleezza Rice. (The former two won their awards while Britney Spears won the Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress over Rice; her role in Fahrenheit 9/11 is just fifteen seconds long.) Leading the pack was a tie between the late summer film Catwoman and Fahrenheit 9/11, each of which won four Razzies, even though the latter was not nominated for Worst Picture. Catwoman received the greatest number of nominations (seven), followed by Alexander with six nominations. The Ivar Theatre was rented using proceeds from an auction of Ben Affleck's broken trophy from the previous year, which Affleck smashed during an appearance on Larry King Live. Halle Berry collected her award in person. She was the first to do so since 2001, when Tom Green arrived to receive his five Razzies for Freddy Got Fingered. Berry was quoted as saying \"If you aren't able to be a good loser you're not able to be a good winner.\" Berry mocked her 2002 Oscar acceptance speech, acting tearful and saying, \"I never thought this would happen to me.\" She then responded to some critics by holding up her Oscar and saying, \"They can't take it away, my name's on it!\" Screenwriter Michael Ferris also appeared to pick his Worst Screenplay award. ==Winners and nominees== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"centre\" |- !
