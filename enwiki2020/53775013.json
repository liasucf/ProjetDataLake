In 2009, Adamson formed the band ahab with Dave Burn. Following a number of months of recording, Adamson released the self-recorded album titled, a.h.a.b.. The album gave the duo much-needed publicity, which led them to be approached for a residency at Tootsie's Orchid Lounge in Nashville, Tennessee. They decided they didn't want to move to the United States as a duo, so invited Seebs Llewellyn (Bass & Vocals) and Luke Price (Mandolin & Vocals) to join them to form a four-piece band. They returned to the UK, where they began to busk. They became well known locally and following a video of their busking going viral on YouTube, Adamson and the band were invited to play at Fairport's Cropredy Convention. While performing to a crowd of 15,000 people, Adamson and fellow band members were unaware that BBC Radio 2 presenter, Bob Harris was in the crowd. This led to Adamson receiving coverage on BBC Radio 2, with Harris referring to his band as, \"blistering live \u2013 alt-country edge and sheer class.\" Ahab released their first purchasable content in 2010, when they released the extended play album, No King. This was shortly followed by their second EP, \"KMVT.\" The second EP was released under Navigator Records and produced by John Leckie. BBC Radio 2 played \"Wish You\" regularly, which was written by Adamson. The track also received positive reviews in Denmark, after Denmark's national radio station, NPR4 had the track on their playlists. During this period they also spent a lot of time touring. In 2012, Adamson was recognised at the Spiral Earth Awards, when Ahab won the award for best group. In an interview, Adamson stated in 2012 that the five-piece band were living together in a house in East London. Many at the time had been touting them as the alternative country version of Mumford & Sons. Adamson returned to Fairport's Cropredy Convention in July 2015 as part of ahab. ===Business=== While performing as a musician, Adamson worked for a number of agencies. His career began at Four Marketing in London. He remained at Four Marketing for just over 4 years, before moving to the Reading Room as a Senior Project Manager.

At the time of Stuart's death, it was rumoured in the media that both Adamson and his sister wouldn't see anything from their father's fortune. Instead, it was expected to go to his second wife, Melanie Shelley. Following the death of his father, Adamson featured in the book, How's Your Dad? Growing up in the shadow of a rock star parent. The book was written by Zoe Howe and interviewed Adamson regarding his relationship with his father. During Adamson's youth, he recalled how Stuart Adamson had nearly missed the opportunity to play with Elton John, because he wanted to spend time with his family. As Adamson grew older, his relationship with his father deteriorated following the divorce of his parents. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:British folk guitarists Category:British male guitarists Category:British songwriters Category:British company founders Category:British people of Scottish descent ",
