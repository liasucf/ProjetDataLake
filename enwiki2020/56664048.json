    "text": "Dzhokhar Dudayev Battalion () is a Chechen volunteer battalion named after the first President of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, Dzhokhar Dudayev. The battalion is made up mostly of Chechen volunteers, many of whom fought in the First Chechen War and Second Chechen War on the side of the Republic of Ichkeria. The battalion has been under the command of the British-educated Chechen national Adam Osmayev since 1 February 2015, after Munayev was killed in action at the Battle of Debaltseve in Eastern Ukraine. ==Overview== ===History=== The creation of the battalion began in early March 2014 in Denmark. This is where a large number of chechens, opposition to Russia and forced to emigrate after the Second Russian-Chechen War, are located. It was initiated by the Free Caucasus Organization, which was created in 2006 in Denmark by political emigrants from Caucasus countries in Europe. The battalion's founder and first leader Isa Munayev was appointed a military commander in charge of the defense of the Chechen capital by Ichkeria's President Aslan Maskhadov during the Battle of Grozny (1999\u20132000) where he used various urban warfare tactics including ambushes, car bombs, and mines during the defense of the city. Colonel Isa Sadigov became the chief of staff of the battalion. Some fighters in the battalion were recruited due to their interest in fighting in Syria but were convinced to go to Ukraine instead. === Battalion composition === Desire to participate in the fight against Russian aggression in Ukraine was immediately revealed by more than 300 volunteers. The battalion includes Chechens, Georgians, Ingush, Azerbaijanis, Ukrainians and volunteers from European countries. === Participation in warfare === Chechen specialists take part in battles in the East of Ukraine and work as instructors, training young commanders. == See also == * Ukrainian volunteer battalions (since 2014) == References == Category:Battalions of Ukraine Category:Chechen diaspora Category:Military units and formations established in 2014 Category:2014 establishments in Ukraine ",
