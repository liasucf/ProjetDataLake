Regarding his membership in the Society of Jesus, he joined September 7, 1964. Hollenbach was ordained into priesthood on June 5, 1971. He acts as the Higher Education Secretary within the society, he is also the advisor on global collaboration of Jesuit universities on human rights. Hollenbach draws from many theologians, including Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, and Jacques Maritain. Hollenbach is considered by many experts in Christian ethics to be the principal contributor to Economic Justice for All: Pastoral Letter on Catholic Social Teaching and the U.S. Economy. ==Works== === The Common Good and Christian Ethics === Written in 2002, this book has become one of Hollenbach's most famous works as an author. While in this book Hollenbach does look to his major influences such as Aquinas for inspiration, it mainly focuses on Hollenbach's attempt to define the \"common good\" and find what contrasts this good. Building on his earlier writings, Hollenbach emphasizes relationships as being the source of the common good. There are certain goods that Hollenbach states are essential for modern day democracies to be successful. These goods include mutual respect, self-determination, and individual agency. Hollenbach points out that these essential goods are completely social and depend solely on human interaction. Ultimately this book is a study on how we as humans relate with one another and what we need to do to better our relationships with one another. Some points of interest that Hollenbach discusses are racism and marginalization. ==Partial bibliography == * Claims in Conflict: Retrieving and Renewing the Catholic Human Rights Tradition.
