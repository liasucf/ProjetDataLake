    "text": "Benjamin Jeremy Stein (born November 25, 1944) is an American writer, lawyer, actor, comedian, and commentator on political and economic issues. He began his career as a speechwriter for U.S. presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford before entering the entertainment field as an actor, comedian, and game show host. He is best known on screen as the economics teacher in Ferris Bueller's Day Off, as the host of Win Ben Stein's Money, and as Dr. Arthur Neuman in The Mask and Son of the Mask. Stein co-wrote and starred in the 2008 documentary Expelled, which posits intelligent design creationism as a scientifically valid alternative to Darwinian evolution and alleges a scientific conspiracy against those promoting intelligent design in laboratories and classrooms. Stein is the son of economist and writer Herbert Stein, who worked at the White House under President Nixon. As a character actor he is well known for his droning, monotonous delivery. In comedy, he is known for his deadpan delivery. Stein has made many controversial comments over the years such as claiming that President Obama was \"the most racist president there has ever been in America\". ==Early life== Stein was born in Washington, D.C., the son of Mildred (n\u00e9e Fishman), a homemaker, and Herbert Stein, a writer, economist, and presidential adviser. He is Jewish and grew up in the Woodside Forest neighborhood of Silver Spring, Maryland. Stein graduated from Montgomery Blair High School in 1962 along with classmate journalist Carl Bernstein (class of 1960); actress Goldie Hawn (class of 1963) was one year behind. Actor Sylvester Stallone was a schoolmate at Montgomery Hills Junior High School.Ben Stein Also Sings \u2013 Time magazine He went on to major in economics at Columbia University's Columbia College, where he was a member of Alpha Delta Phi and the Philolexian Society. After graduating with honors from Columbia in 1966, Stein went to Yale Law School, graduating as valedictorian in June 1970. ==Career== ===Legal and academic career=== Stein speaking at Miami University in 2003 He was first a poverty lawyer in New Haven, Connecticut, and Washington, D.C. before becoming a trial lawyer for the Federal Trade Commission. Stein's first teaching stint was as an adjunct professor, teaching about the political and social content of mass culture at American University in Washington, D.C. He subsequently taught classes at the University of California, Santa Cruz on political and civil rights under the United States Constitution. At Pepperdine University Stein taught libel law and United States securities law and its ethical aspects. He was a professor of law at Pepperdine University Law School from about 1990 to 1997.Ben Stein's official biography ===Writing career=== Stein writes a regular column in the conservative magazines The American Spectator and Newsmax. He has also written for numerous publications, including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, New York Magazine, Penthouse, Los Angeles Magazine, and Barron's Magazine. He wrote a regular biweekly column for Yahoo! Finance online, with his last article dated August 7, 2009. His bestselling books (with investment advisor Phil DeMuth) include Yes, You Can Retire Comfortably; Can America Survive?; and Yes, You Can Time the Market. In 2009, he published a collection of essays, The Real Stars. Stein was fired from his position as a Sunday Business columnist at The New York Times in August 2009 owing to a policy prohibiting writers from making product endorsements or advertising. Stein had recently become an advertising spokesman for credit information company Freescore.com and, according to a Times statement, had assumed there would be no conflict provided that he did not discuss credit scoring in general or FreeScore.com itself in his column. However, the publication felt that it would be inappropriate for him to write for them while he was involved in advertising and terminated his contract. Writing in The Spectator, Stein states his belief that the real reasons for his firing were budget cuts at the Times, his criticism of President Obama, and pressure from those critical of Expelled, who \"bamboozled some of the high pooh-bahs at the Times into thinking there was a conflict of interest\". ===Political career=== Stein began his political career as a speechwriter and lawyer for President Richard Nixon, and later for President Gerald Ford. On May 3, 1976, Time magazine speculated on the possibility of Stein having actually been Deep Throat. Stein responded over the years not only by denying he was Deep Throat but by going further and accusing journalist Bob Woodward of falsifying the famous secret source. In the May 14\u201321, 1998, edition of the Philadelphia City Paper, Stein is quoted as saying, \"Oh, I don't think there was a Deep Throat. That was a fake. I think there were several different sources and some they just made up.\"Interview by Brian Howard: \"20 Questions: Ben Stein\" Philadelphia City Paper May 1998 After Mark Felt's identity as Deep Throat was revealed, Stein stated that Richard Nixon would have prevented the rise to power of the Khmer Rouge if he had not been forced to resign. For his actions leading to that resignation, Stein said: In 2005, Stein said in the American Spectator: ===Career in the media=== Stein acted as the monotonous economics teacher in the 1986 movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off. In one scene, he lectures on the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930 and the then-current debate over supply-side economics. Stein played similarly bland and unemotional characters. He had a recurring role in the TV series The Wonder Years (as science teacher Mr. Cantwell, who would narrate 16mm films in monotone) and played himself in Dave. He appeared in several television advertisements, such as for the product \"Clear Eyes\" throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Godfather's Pizza in 1987, a bland science teacher in 1990 for Sprinkled Chips Ahoy! cookies, and in 2013 for small business accounting service firm 1-800Accountant.

The show won five Daytime Emmy Awards before ending its run in 2003. In 1999, Stein also hosted the Comedy Central talk show Turn Ben Stein On. One of the mainstays of the show was Stein's dog, Puppy Wuppy, who had free run of the set. In 2001, Stein appeared on a celebrity episode of The Weakest Link entitled \"TV Hosts Edition\" alongside other television hosts and was voted off in round 6 despite being that round's Strongest Link.

The show aimed to find the smartest among fourteen models through a series of challenges. On May 14, 2006, during an appearance on the Fox News program Your World with Neil Cavuto, Stein called for a tax increase of 3.5% for wealthy Americans, to be earmarked for soldiers and military initiatives. Stein wrote an editorial for The New York Times critical of those who would rather make money in the world of finance than fight terrorism.Stein, Ben: \"Looking for the Will Beyond the Battlefield\", The New York Times, August 20, 2006 On December 28, 2009, Stein appeared on CNN's Larry King Live with Ron Paul to discuss the attempted bombing of an American plane on Christmas Day 2009. Stein said that Paul's stance that the United States were \"occupiers\" in Iraq and Afghanistan \"is the same anti-Semitic argument we've heard over and over again.\"Ben Stein says Ron Paul uses anti-semitic arguments The New American, December 29, 2009 The comment started a shouting match between the two men and prompted anger from Paul supporters and those who believe Stein went too far in calling Paul's argument anti-Semitic.Win Ben Stein's Apology Young Americans for Liberty, December 29, 2009 Stein issued an apology on December 30, 2009.A Ron Paul Moment \"The American Spectator\" December 30, 2009 Stein's political and economics commentary has appeared on CNBC's The Kudlow Report and CNN.Stein on Trump's economic plan CNN Money 2016/07/11 Retrieved 2016/09/17 ===Commentary in the lead-up to and during the Great Recession=== In the period preceding the late-2000s recession, Stein made frequent and vehement claims that the economy was not in recession, and that the issues in the housing market would not affect the broader economy. On March 18, 2007, in a column for CBS News' online version of CBS News Sunday Morning, Stein famously proclaimed in the beginning of the subprime mortgage crisis that the foreclosure problem would \"blow over and the people who buy now, in due time, will be glad they did,\" the economy was \"still very strong,\" and the \"smart money\" was \"now trying to buy\u2014not sell\u2014as much distressed merchandise\" in mortgages as possible.Stein, Ben > Ben Stein Says Economy Is Fine, Says Don't Worry About Foreclosure Blues, > The Mortgage Market Is Robust\",CBS News, March 18, 2007 In an August 12, > 2007 column in The New York Times, titled \"Chicken Little's Brethren, on the > Trading Floor\", Stein, while acknowledging \"I don't know where the bottom is > on subprime.
