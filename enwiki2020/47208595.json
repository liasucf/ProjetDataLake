    "text": "Ioane Ioane (born 1962 in Christchurch) is a New Zealand artist of Samoan descent. His work is informed by his Samoan heritage and includes performance, film, painting, installation and sculpture. In conversation about his work Fale S\u0101 with art historian Caroline Vercoe, Ioane states, Sacred places are not necessarily a church, but it's a place where one likes to be in, a place of affirmation. Curator Ron Brownson writes, Ioane's attitude to sculptural process is cosmological \u2013 his carvings bind present reality with a representation of the past. In 2005 Ioane won the Creative New Zealand Pacific Innovation and Excellence Art Award. His work is held in both private and public collections, including the Auckland Art Gallery; the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa; University of Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, England; the National University of Samoa; the Tjibaou Cultural Centre, Noum\u00e9a, New Caledonia; the Wallace Arts Trust, Auckland; and the University of Auckland Art Collection. ==Education== In 1985 Ioane received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Elam School of Fine Arts at Auckland University.
