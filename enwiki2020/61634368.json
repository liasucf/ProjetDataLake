This was the 12th season of Division III college ice hockey. After the collapse of the entire second-tier division in 1984, most programs downgraded to Division III. As a result the size of the third division rose dramatically. Despite the SUNYAC conference not sponsoring ice hockey, the member schools began holding an informal conference tournament that took place just prior to the ECAC West Men's Tournament.
