    "text": "1930 Football ticket stub depicting the former Stanford Indian mascot The use of terms and images referring to Native Americans/First Nations as the name or mascot for a sports team is a topic of public controversy in the United States and in Canada. The documents most often cited to justify the trend for change are an advisory opinion by the United States Commission on Civil Rights in 2001 and a resolution by the American Psychological Association in 2005. Both support the views of Native American organizations and individuals that such mascots maintain harmful stereotypes that are discriminatory and cause harm by distorting the past and preventing understanding of Native American/First Nations peoples in the present. Such practices are seen as particularly harmful in schools and universities, which have the a stated purpose of promoting ethnic diversity and inclusion. This view lead to the NCAA adopting a policy to eliminate \"hostile and abusive\" names and mascots. However some changes began in the 1970s in response to the Native American civil rights movement, lead by the National Congress of American Indians. Defenders of the current usage often state their intention to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits, such as fighting spirit and being aggressive, brave, stoic, dedicated, and proud; while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native Americans as savages. Supporters also claim that the issue is not important, being only about sports, and that the opposition is nothing more than \"political correctness\", which change advocates argue ignores the extensive evidence of harmful effects of stereotypes and bias. ==Canada== The Department of Educational Foundations at the University of Saskatchewan passed a resolution calling for the retirement of all school mascots and logos that depict First Nations people. There is an ongoing debate regarding the McGill University \"Redmen\", which alumni say originated as a reference to the school colors and the Celtic heritage of its founder, only later to be associated with First Nation's names and imagery which have been removed since the 1990s. Others, including indigenous students and Washington State University professor C. Richard King, argue that the name itself is generally used as a disparaging term for indigenous peoples which reinforces stereotypes and white settler culture. McGill principal and vice chancellor Suzanne Fortier announced that the university will refer to its men's teams as \"the McGill teams\" during the 2019-20 academic year while deciding on a new name. Seneca College in Toronto, Ontario changed from the Braves to \"The Sting\" in 2000. ==United States== ===NCAA policy=== In 2005 the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) distributed a \"self evaluation\" to 31 colleges for teams to examine the use of potentially offensive imagery with their mascot choice. Subsequently, 19 teams were cited as having potentially \"hostile or abusive\" names, mascots, or images, that would be banned from displaying them during post-season play, and prohibited from hosting tournaments. Schools that removed all references to Native American culture or were deemed not to have references to Native American culture as part of their athletics programs: * Alcorn State University \u2013 Lorman, Mississippi (Braves) - Logo is a large A, mascot is the \"Bravehawk\". * Lycoming College (Warriors) * Winona State University (Warriors) * Eastern Connecticut State University (Warriors) * East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania (Warriors) * Merrimack College (Warriors) * University of North Carolina at Pembroke (Braves) \u2013 originally created to educate American Indians, and since its creation has had close ties to the local Lumbee tribe * University of Hawaii at Manoa \u2013 (Hawaii Rainbow Warriors and Rainbow Wahine) From 2000 through 2013, each team was allowed to select its own nickname; most notably, the football team was simply known as \"The Warriors\". In 2013, the school adopted the identity of \"Rainbow Warriors\" for all men's teams, while women's teams remain \"Rainbow Wahine\". * Wisconsin Lutheran College (Warriors) Schools granted waivers to retain their nicknames after gaining support from those respective tribes: * Catawba College - Salisbury, North Carolina (Catawba Indians) * Central Michigan University \u2013 Mount Pleasant, Michigan (Chippewas) * Florida State University \u2013 Tallahassee, Florida (Seminoles) - the mascot is Osceola and Renegade and FSU originated the Tomahawk chop performed by fans at games. * Mississippi College \u2013 Clinton, Mississippi (Choctaws) * University of Utah \u2013 Salt Lake City, Utah (Utes) Prior to 1972, the Utah teams had informally been known as the Redskins as well as the Utes. The NCAA did not cite San Diego State University, San Diego, California as \"hostile and abusive\" due to the Aztec people having no modern representatives. However the Aztec Warrior mascot, whose performance including human sacrifice, has drawn criticism. A SDSU professor of American Indian Studies states that the mascot teaches the mistaken idea that Aztecs were a local tribe rather than living in Mexico 1,000 miles from San Diego. In April, 2017 the university's Associated Students council rejected a resolution to retire the mascot introduced by the Native American Student Association. ===Other current usage (non-NCAA)=== * Bacone College \u2013 Muskogee, Oklahoma (Warriors) was founded as a Cherokee Baptist Mission school and retains a connection to several tribes. * Cochise College, Douglas, Arizona (Apaches) - Community College * Lewis\u2013Clark State College, Lewiston, Idaho (Warriors) - Logo features Lewis and Clark, use of Warriors nickname deemed respectful by Tribal leaders. * Ottawa University \u2013 Ottawa, Kansas (Braves) * Tyler Junior College, Tyler, Texas (Apache) ===Prior usage=== * Carlisle Indians, a school for American Indians that was a college football power in the early 1900s * Chowan University \u2013 Murfreesboro, North Carolina (Braves) * University of Oklahoma mascot: Little Red {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" |- !
