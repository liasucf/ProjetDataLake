Forty-four All-Star Games have been held since the Blues entered the league in 1967, with at least one player chosen to represent the Blues in each year. The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005, and 2013 as a result of labor stoppages, and 2006, 2010, and 2014 because of the Winter Olympic Games. St. Louis has hosted two of the games. The 23rd and 39th took place at St. Louis Arena. * Selected by fan vote * Selected as one of four \"last men in\" by fan vote * Selected by Commissioner * All-Star Game Most Valuable Player2014\u201315 NHL Official Guide & Record Book, p. 234 {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+St. Louis Blues players and coaches selected to the All-Star GameSt. Louis Blues 2014\u201315 Media Guide, p.255 |- !scope=\"col\" | Game !scope=\"col\" | Year !scope=\"col\" | Name !scope=\"col\" | Position !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References |- !
