He continued his job for a while but then decided to write books. He has wrote many books but one outstanding one was, History Alive 9. He provided both primary care and protective medical support services to President Clinton, Vice President Gore, their immediate families and other senior White House officials at the White House and while they traveled all over the world. During this time Dr. Darling administered emergency and preventative medical services in over 40 countries, including numerous undeveloped regions and third-world countries with limited medical services. He practiced aboard Air Force One, Marine One and other official aircraft. He also worked with the U.S. Secret Service in the preparation for unconventional weapon attacks against the President and the creation of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear defense (CBRNE) training and readiness programs. On November 6, 1998, Darling facilitated the first of only two emails ever sent by President Bill Clinton during his presidency. This email was sent to John Glenn aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery from Dr. Darling's personal Toshiba Satellite laptop computer. Darling is currently the chief medical officer of Patronus Medical Group, a concierge healthcare practice.https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertgdarling/ https://www.patronusmedical.com/ ==Books== *Associate Editor, Ciottone's Disaster Medicine, 2nd Edition.
