Vol 3, Nash, T.H., Ryan, B.D., Gries, C., Bugartz, F., (eds.) 2001, It mostly grows on rock. It is unique among California members of its genus in that it can sometimes be found on growing on bark or wood, especially incense cedar and sometimes on white fir or giant sequoias in the central Sierra Nevada range and southern California mountains. It has a black or bluish or greenish prothallus. The prothallus is usually absent when growing on rock. Each areole commonly has 1-7 roundish to angular apothecia that are .1 - 1.3 mm in diameter. Apothecia have black to blue-black, concave to flat discs, without pruina.
