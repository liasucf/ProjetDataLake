    "text": "A municipal bus company is an operator of bus services owned by the local government authority. This article lists all current municipal bus companies in the United Kingdom. Most municipal bus companies disappeared between 1968 and 1974 before (or with) the formation of PTE bus operations. Of the remaining municipal operators, post-1986 many were sold off or collapsed in the process of bus deregulation, which required their separation into stand- alone arms-length companies. A few remaining companies have accepted minority- stake holdings in their companies by private bus operating companies, as a method of securing investment. {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"100%\" |- !
