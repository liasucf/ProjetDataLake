She made six cruises against British merchant shipping until the British Royal Navy captured her in 1813. ==Career== For her first cruise Sp\u00e9culateur was under the command of Captain Joseph Pard\u00e8re-Niquet, who commanded her between 1806 and 1 February 1807, when he took her out of commission. Under his command she captured three prizes: Elisabeth, Ariel, and Falmouth.BASE DE DONNEES CORSAITRES:LES BATEAUX - BOATS/ Lloyd's List reported that the lugger privateer Speculaton had taken Alert, Foresban, master, as Alert was sailing from Mogador to London. The privateer Active, of Guernsey, had recaptured Alert, which then sailed to Baltimore, Ireland.Lloyd's List \u21164118. Between 1808 and 1809, Sp\u00e9culateur was under the command of Captain Jean Gaillebeau. On her second cruise she captured Todos los y animals. For her third cruise she was under the command of Captain Alexandre-William Black, with 64 men and 6 guns. This took place after her commissioning in October 1809 and ended in April 1810. Captain Pierre-Claude Martin sailed Sp\u00e9culateur on her fourth cruise from September 1810 to February 1811. She was armed with four guns and had a crew of 63 men. She captured several prizes: Deux amis, Grinder, Falmouth, Belle Cancella, and Leander. On 1 November 1810 Sp\u00e9culateur encountered Leander. An engagement of about a half-hour followed during which men from Sp\u00e9culateur boarded Leander. On Leander, Captain Main, two mates, and a seaman were killed, and six men were wounded. On Sp\u00e9culateur of her crew of 55 men, one was killed and two wounded. Leander was reportedly taken into Figuerra.Lloyd's List \u21164512. A report a week later stated that Leander had been lost on her way into Tr\u00e9guier, C\u00f4tes du Nord.Lloyd's List \u21164514. A third report about a month later confirmed that it was Leander that had been captured and lost near Lorient.Lloyd's List \u21164529.

He captured three prizes: Falmouth, Sidbourg, and Sedbury. ==Fate== Capture cut Sp\u00e9culateurs sixth cruise short. On 22 November 1813 captured the French 14-gun privateer lugger Sp\u00e9culation in the Channel. She was 5 days out of St Malo but had taken nothing.
