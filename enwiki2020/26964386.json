Additional localised disruption continued into May 2010. The eruption was declared officially over in October 2010, when snow on the glacier did not melt. From 14\u201320 April, ash from the volcanic eruption covered large areas of Northern Europe. About 20 countries closed their airspace to commercial jet traffic and it affected approximately 10 million travellers. Seismic activity started at the end of 2009 and gradually increased in intensity until on 20 March 2010, a small eruption began, rated as a 1 on the volcanic explosivity index. Beginning on 14 April 2010, the eruption entered a second phase and created an ash cloud that led to the closure of most of the European IFR airspace from 15 until 20 April 2010. Consequently, a very high proportion of flights within, to, and from Europe were cancelled, creating the highest level of air travel disruption since the Second World War. The second phase resulted in an estimated (0.25 km3) of ejected tephra and an ash plume that rose to a height around , which rates the explosive power of the eruption as a 4 on the volcanic explosivity index.Erica R. Hendry \"What We Know From the Icelandic Volcano,\" Smithsonian, 22 April 2010. Retrieved April 2010. By 21 May 2010, the second eruption phase had subsided to the point that no further lava or ash was being produced. By the evening of 6 June 2010, a small, new crater had opened up on the west side of the main crater. Explosive activity from this new crater was observed with emission of small quantities of ash. Seismic data showed that the frequency and intensity of earth tremors still exceeded the levels observed before the eruption, therefore scientists at the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) and the Institute of Earth Sciences, University of Iceland (IES) continued to monitor the volcano. In October 2010, \u00c1rmann H\u00f6skuldsson, a scientist at the University of Iceland Institute of Earth Sciences, stated that the eruption was officially over, although the area was still geothermally active and might erupt again. ==Background== Dust particles that get suspended in the atmosphere scatter light from the setting sun, generating 'volcanic lavenders' like this one over the flight path of Leeds- Bradford Airport in England during the aviation shutdown Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull () is one of Iceland's smaller ice caps located in the far south of the island. Situated to the north of Sk\u00f3gar and to the west of the larger ice cap M\u00fdrdalsj\u00f6kull, Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull covers the caldera of a volcano high, which has erupted relatively frequently since the last ice age. The most recent major eruptions occurred in 920, 1612, and from 1821 to 1823. Previous eruptions of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull have been followed by eruptions at its larger neighbour, Katla. On 20 April 2010 Icelandic President \u00d3lafur Gr\u00edmsson said, \"the time for Katla to erupt is coming close ... we [Iceland] have prepared ... it is high time for European governments and airline authorities all over the world to start planning for the eventual Katla eruption.\" The volcanic events starting in March 2010 were considered to be a single eruption divided into phases. The first eruption phase ejected olivine basaltic andesite lava several hundred metres into the air in what is known as an effusive eruption. Ash ejection from this phase of the eruption was small, rising to no more than into the atmosphere. On 14 April 2010, however, the eruption entered an explosive phase and ejected fine glass-rich ash to over into the atmosphere. The second phase was estimated to be a VEI 4 eruption, which was large, but not nearly the most powerful eruption possible by volcanic standards. By way of comparison, the Mount St. Helens eruption of 1980 was rated as 5 on the VEI, and the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo was rated as a 6. This second phase erupted trachyandesite. This volcanic activity so disruptive to air travel because of a combination of factors: # The volcano was directly under the jet stream. # The direction of the jet stream was unusually stable at the time of the eruption's second phase, continuously southeast. # The second eruptive phase happened under of glacial ice. The resulting meltwater flowed back into the erupting volcano, which created two specific phenomena: ## The rapidly vaporising water significantly increased the eruption's explosive power. ## The erupting lava cooled very fast, which created a cloud of highly abrasive, glass-rich ash. # The volcano's explosive power was enough to inject ash directly into the jet stream. ==Public observations== People observing the first fissure at Fimmv\u00f6r\u00f0uh\u00e1ls \"Volcano tourism\" quickly sprang up in the wake of the eruption, with local tour companies offering day trips to see the volcano. The Civil Protection Department of the Icelandic Police produced regular reports about access to the area, including a map of the restricted area around Eyjafjallajokull, from which the public was forbidden. Teams from the Icelandic Association for Search and Rescue were stationed at the eruption site as part of standard safety measures and to assist in enforcing access restrictions. Vodafone and the Icelandic telecommunications company M\u00edla installed webcams, giving views of the eruption from Valahn\u00fakur, Hvolsv\u00f6llur, and \u00de\u00f3r\u00f3lfsfell. The view of the eruption from \u00de\u00f3r\u00f3lfsfel also includes a thermal imaging camera. ==Scientific observations== The London Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC), part of the UK Met Office, was responsible for forecasting the presence of volcanic ash in the north-east Atlantic. All ash dispersion models for this geographic region were produced by the VAAC in London. A study by the Icelandic Meteorological Office published on December 2009 indicated an increase in seismic activity around the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull area during the years 2006\u20132009. The study reported increased activity that occurred between June and August 2009 (200 events), compared to a total of about 250 earthquakes recorded between September 2006 and August 2009. It further indicated that the locations of most of the earthquakes in 2009 occurred between depth east of the volcano's top crater. At the end of December 2009, seismic activity began around the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano area, with thousands of small earthquakes (mostly of magnitude 1\u20132 Mw), beneath the volcano.Ve\u00f0urstofa \u00cdslands (5 March 2010) The radar stations of the Meteorological Institute of Iceland did not detect any appreciable amount of volcanic ashfall during the first 24 hours of the eruption. However, during the night of 22 March, they reported some volcanic ash fall reaching the Flj\u00f3tshl\u00ed\u00f0 area ( north-west of the eruption's location) and Hvolsv\u00f6llur town ( north-west of the eruption location) leaving vehicles with a fine, grey layer of volcanic ash. At around 07:00 on 22 March, an explosion launched eruption columns as far as straight up into the air. This was the highest plume since the eruption started. On 23 March, a small vapour explosion took place, when hot magma came into contact with nearby snowdrifts, emitting a vapour plume which reached an altitude of , and was detected on radar from the Meteorological Institute of Iceland. After that, many further vapour explosions occurred.R\u00edkis\u00fatvarpi\u00f0 fr\u00e9ttavefur By 26 February 2010, the global positioning system (GPS) equipment used by the Iceland Meteorological Office at \u00deorvaldseyri farm in the Eyjafj\u00f6ll area (around south-east of the location of the recent eruption)Measurements made by using maps and measurement tools from Fasteignaskr\u00e1 \u00cdslandskort had shown 3 cm of displacement of the local crust in a southward direction, of which a 1-cm displacement had taken place within four days. (See the GPS Time Series page of the Nordic Volcanological Center's website for detailed information on the degree of movement detected in the Earth's crust in the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull locality.) This unusual seismic activity, along with the rapid movement of the Earth's crust in the area, gave geophysicists evidence that magma was flowing from underneath the crust into Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull's magma chamber and that pressure stemming from the process caused (in geophysical terms) the huge crustal displacement at \u00deorvaldseyri farm.Morgubla\u00f0i\u00f0 (26 February 2010) The seismic activity continued to increase, and from 3 to 5 March, close to 3,000 earthquakes were measured having their epicentre at the volcano. Most of these were too small (magnitude 2) to be interpreted as precursors to an eruption, but some could be detected in nearby towns. The grounding of European flights avoided about 3.44 kg of CO2 emissions per day, while the volcano emitted about 1.5 kg of CO2 per day.UNEP Year Book2011, An Overview of Our Changing Environment, United Nations Environment Programme 2011 page 2. Accessed 30 June 2013. Archived 5 July 2013. ==Phase 1: Effusive eruption== The first phase of the eruption lasted from 20 March to 12 April 2010 and was characterised by olivine basaltic andesite lava flowing from various eruptive vents on the flanks of the mountain. ===Evacuations=== About 500 farmers and their families had to escape from the areas of Flj\u00f3tshl\u00ed\u00f0, Eyjafj\u00f6ll, and Landeyjar were evacuated overnight (including a group of 30 schoolchildren and their three teachers from Caistor Grammar School in England), and flights to and from Reykjav\u00edk and Keflav\u00edk International Airport were postponed, but on the evening of 21 March, domestic and international air traffic was allowed again.

Inhabitants of the risk zone of Flj\u00f3tshl\u00ed\u00f0, Eyjafj\u00f6ll, and Landeyjar area were allowed to return to their farms and homes after an evening meeting with the Civil Protection Department on 22 March and the evacuation plan was temporarily dismissed. Instead, the police closed the road to \u00de\u00f3rsm\u00f6rk and the four-wheel-drive trail from Sk\u00f3gar village to the Fimmv\u00f6r\u00f0uh\u00e1ls mountain pass, but these roads and trails were reopened on 29 March, though only for suitable four-wheel drive vehicles. When the second fissure appeared, the road was closed again because of the danger of flash floods, which could have developed if the fissure had opened near big ice caps or other snow reservoirs, but the road was again opened at around noon on 1 April.Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0 1. April Eyjan 1. April Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0 22. Mars 2010 ===Effects on the river=== On 22 March, a flow meter device in the Kross\u00e1 glacial river (which drains Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull and M\u00fdrdalsj\u00f6kull glaciers) in the \u00de\u00f3rsm\u00f6rk area (a few kilometres north-west of the erupting location) started to record a sudden rise in water level and water temperature \u2013 the total water temperature rose by over a two-hour period, which had never happened so quickly in the Kross\u00e1 river since measurements began. Shortly afterward, the water level returned to normal and water temperature decreased.Meteorological Institute of Iceland: Eruption in Fimmv\u00f6r\u00f0uh\u00e1ls mountain pass This rise in water temperature was thought to be related to the eruption nearby and was affecting part of the Kross\u00e1 drainage basin. The temperature of Hrun\u00e1 river, which flows through the narrow Hrun\u00e1rgil canyon, into which part of the lava stream was flowing, was recently recorded by geologists to be between , indicating that the river was cooling the lava in that canyon.Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0 29. Mars ===Fissure=== Second fissure, viewed from the north, on 2 April 2010 The first phase of the 2010 eruption began late on the evening of 20 March at the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull. The initial visual report of the eruption was at 23:52 GMT, when a red cloud was seen at the north slopes of Fimmv\u00f6r\u00f0uh\u00e1ls mountain pass, lighting up the sky above the eruptive site. The eruption was preceded by intense seismicity and high rates of deformation in the weeks before the eruption, in association with magma recharging of the volcano. Immediately before the eruption, the depth of the seismicity had become shallow, but was not significantly enhanced from what it had been in the previous weeks. Deformation was occurring at rates up to a centimetre a day since 4 March at various GPS sites installed within from the eruptive site. A fissure opened up about in length running in a north-east to south- west direction, with 10 to 12 erupting lava craters ejecting lava at a temperature around up to into the air. The lava was alkali olivine basalt and was relatively viscous, causing the motion of the lava stream to the west and east of the fissure to be slow. The molten lava flowed more than to the north- east of the fissure and into Hrunagil canyon, forming a lava fall more than long and slowly approaching \u00de\u00f3rsm\u00f6rk, but had not reached the flood plains of Kross\u00e1.Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0 22. March 2010 (13:11 GMT) R\u00edkis\u00fatvarpi\u00f0 fr\u00e9ttavefur On 25 March 2010, while studying the eruption, scientists witnessed, for the first time in history, the formation of a pseudocrater during a steam explosion.Kv\u00f6ldfr\u00e9ttir St\u00f6\u00f0var Tv\u00f6 \"Vi\u00f0tal vi\u00f0 \u00c1rmann H\u00f6skuldsson eldfjallafr\u00e6\u00f0ing\" Fr\u00e9ttastofa St\u00f6\u00f0var Tv\u00f6 Crustal expansion continued at \u00deorvaldseyri for two days after the eruption began, but was slowly decreasing whilst the volcanic activity was increasing. This indicates that the rate at which magma was flowing into the magma chamber roughly equaled the rate at which it was being lost due to the eruption, giving evidence that this phase of volcanic activity reached equilibrium.Ve\u00f0urstofa \u00cdslands (24 March 2010) A new fissure opened on 31 March, around north-west of the original fissure. Many witnesses were present while the new fissure opened. It was a bit smaller, around long according to witnesses, and lava coming from it started to flow into Hvann\u00e1rgil canyon. These two erupting fissures shared the same magma chamber, according to geophysicists. No unusual seismic activity was detected at the time the new fissure appeared, nor any crustal expansion according to many seismometers and GPS recorders situated in nearby areas.Ve\u00f0urstofa \u00cdslands Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0 1. April Geophysicist Magn\u00fas Tumi Einarsson said (at a press meeting in Hvolsv\u00f6llur on 21 March) that this eruption was small compared to, for example, the eruption of Hekla in 2000. The eruption, rather than taking place under the ice cap of the glacier, occurred in the mountain pass between the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull and M\u00fdrdalsj\u00f6kull glaciers. As long as the fissure was not near the glacier, the risk of flooding was minimal; however, the fissure could extend into the ice cap, thereby greatly increasing the risk of flooding. ==Phase 2: Explosive eruption== Aqua showing the ash plume over North Atlantic at 13:30 GMT on 15 April The estimated ash cloud at 18:00 GMT on 15 April. After a short hiatus in eruptive activity, and a large increase in seismic activity 23:00 on 13 April and 1:00 on 14 April, a new set of craters opened early in the morning of 14 April 2010 under the volcano's ice-covered central summit caldera. The earthquake swarm was followed by the onset of a seismic eruption tremor. Meltwater started to emanate from the ice cap around 07:00 on 14 April and an eruption plume was observed in the early morning. Visual observations were greatly restricted due to cloud cover over the volcano, but an aeroplane of the Icelandic Coast Guard imaged eruptive craters with radar instruments. A series of vents along a 2-km-long north\u2013south-oriented fissure was active, with meltwater flowing mostly down the northern slopes of the volcano, but also to the south. An ash-loaded eruption plume rose to more than , deflected to the east by westerly winds. ===Ash analysis=== Upper: Ash covers the Th\u00f3rsm\u00f6rk valley in early June 2010, immediately after the eruption Lower: The same area, in September 2011 Samples of volcanic ash collected near the eruption showed a silica concentration of 58%\u2014much higher than in the lava flows.name=\"earthice1\" The concentration of water-soluble fluoride was one- third of the concentration typical in Hekla eruptions, with a mean value of 104 mg of fluoride per kg of ash. Agriculture is important in this region of Iceland,A report in Icelandic: Landb\u00fana\u00f0ur skiptir m\u00e1li (transl. \"Agriculture matters\") says that 28% of the total workforce in agriculture are scattered throughout southern Iceland. and farmers near the volcano have been warned not to let their livestock drink from contaminated streams and water sources,Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0 23. March 2010 as high concentrations of fluoride can have deadly renal and hepatic effects, particularly in sheep. ===Impact on farming=== The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority released an announcement on 18 April 2010, asking that all horse owners who keep their herds outside be on the alert for ash fall. Where ash fall was significant, all horses had to be sheltered indoors. The thick layer of ash that had fallen on some Icelandic pastures and farms at Raufarfell had become wet and compact, making it very difficult to continue farming, harvesting, or grazing livestock. ===Timeline of the second eruption phase=== Unlike the earlier eruption phase, the second phase occurred beneath glacial ice. Cold water from melted ice quickly chilled the lava, causing it to fragment into highly abrasive glass particles that were then carried into the eruption plume. This, together with the magnitude of the eruption (estimated to be VEI 4) and being 10 to 20 times larger than the eruption of Fimmv\u00f6r\u00f0uh\u00e1ls on 20 March, injected a glass-rich ash plume into the jet stream. In addition to volcanic ash being very hazardous to aircraft, the location of this eruption directly under the jet stream ensured that the ash was carried into the heavily used airspace over northern and central Europe. ==Phase 3: Return to dormancy== A necklace made from the ash of the 2010 eruption: Jewellery and similar memorabilia of the eruption are now sold in Iceland. By the morning of 24 May 2010, the view from the web camera installed on \u00de\u00f3r\u00f3lfsfell showed only a plume of water vapour surrounded by a bluish haze caused by emission of sulphurous gases. Due to the large quantities of dry volcanic ash lying on the ground, surface winds frequently lifted up an \"ash mist\" that significantly reduced visibility and made web camera observation of the volcano impossible. On 21 June 2010, data from seismic recorders in the area indicated that the frequency and strength of earth tremors had diminished, but were continuing. In October 2010, \u00c1rmann H\u00f6skuldsson, a scientist at the University of Iceland Institute of Earth Sciences, stated that the eruption was officially over, although the area was still geothermally active and might erupt again. During the eruption, the BBC television news announcers did not try to pronounce the name \"Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull,\" but called it \"the Iceland volcano.\" ==Volume of erupted material and magma discharge== The Institute of Earth Sciences made a preliminary estimate of erupted material in the first three days of the eruption on 14 April 2010 at Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull. The erupted products were fragmented material, the majority fine-grained airborne tephra. Eruptive products can be split into three categories along with preliminary estimated erupted volumes: # Material (tephra) in the ice cauldrons around the volcanic vents: # Tephra filling the glacial lagoon of G\u00edgj\u00f6kulsl\u00f3n, carried by floods down the outlet glacier G\u00edgj\u00f6kull: # Airborne tephra that was carried to the east and south of the volcano, uncompacted tephra fallout from eruption plume: Total: which corresponds to some of magma. The magma discharge rate was about or 750 t/s. This was 10\u201320 times the average discharge rate in the preceding flank eruption at Fimmv\u00f6r\u00f0uh\u00e1ls. (First eruption on 20 March 2010). The IES updated the eruption flow rate on 21 April 2010 to an estimation less than of magma, or 75 tonnes/s, with a large uncertainty. IES also noted that the eruption continue with less explosive activity. ==Health effects== No human fatalities were reported from the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull. The people who lived near the volcano had high levels of irritation symptoms, though their lung function was not lower than expected. Six months later, the population living in the area had more respiratory symptoms than a control group from North Iceland, with no ashfall. In Scotland, the number of phone calls to health services for respiratory and eye irritation did not rise significantly. ==Effects of the ash plume on air travel== Volcanic ash is a major hazard to aircraft.C. M. Riley, \"Tephra\" Michigan Technological University Geological & Mining, Engineering & Sciences, Retrieved on 23 January 2008. Smoke and ash from eruptions reduce visibility for visual navigation, and microscopic debris in the ash can sandblast windscreens and melt in the heat of aircraft turbine engines, damaging engines and making them shut down. Many flights within, to, and from Europe were cancelled following 14 April 2010 eruption, and although no commercial aircraft were damaged, the engines of some military aircraft were harmed. The presence and location of the plume depends upon the state of the eruption and the winds. While some ash fell on uninhabited areas in Iceland, most had been carried by westerly winds resulting in the shutdown of large air space over Europe. The shutdown had a knock on impact on the economy and cultural events across Europe. The Icelandic flag carrier airline, Icelandair, seemed at first especially vulnerable, but managed to deal effectively with the eruption and subsequently published a detailed report about its actions and conclusions. ==Short- and long-term weather and environmental effects== Possible ash fallout from Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull on a car, Manchester, England, 21 April 2010 At the mouth of the crater, the gases, ejecta, and volcanic plume have created a rare weather phenomenon known as volcanic lightning (or a \"dirty thunderstorm\"). When rocks and other ejecta collide with one another, they create static electricity. This, with the abundant water-ice at the summit, aids in making lightning. High-fluoride Hekla eruptions pose a threat to foraging livestock, especially sheep. Fluoride poisoning can start in sheep at a diet with fluorine content of 25 ppm. At 250 ppm, death can occur within a few days. In 1783, 79% of the Icelandic sheep stock were killed, probably as a result of fluorosis caused by the eruption of Laki.Thorarinsson, Hekla, A Notorious Volcano, p. 39\u201358 The effect also spread beyond Iceland.Tom de Castella (16 April 2010) \"The eruption that changed Iceland forever,\" BBC News. Retrieved 18 April 2010. Ash from the current Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruption contains one-third the concentration typical in Hekla eruptions, with a mean value of 104 mg of fluoride per kg of ash. Large-scale release of sulphur dioxide into the troposphere also poses a potential health risk, especially to people with pre- existing breathing disorders. As of 15 April, the eruption was not large enough to have an effect on global temperatures like that of Mount Pinatubo and other major past volcanic eruptions.Sara Phillips \"Icelandic volcano won't affect the world's climate\" ABC, 16 April 2010. One previous related sequence of eruptions of this volcano, beginning in 1821 is recorded as having lasted for over two years, but no single set of major eruptions is known to have lasted more than 'several days'. ==Comparison to other recent eruptions== The recent eruptions of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull and the largest ash plume associated with the second eruption phase were not unparalleled in either volume or abundance; however, the location was the critical factor because it affected air travel across Europe. Neither phase of the eruption was unusually powerful. Other notable volcanic eruptions in recent years include the eruption of Mount Pinatubo of 1991 of VEI 6. This eruption lasted eight days, from 7 \u2013 15 June of that year, with an ash cloud that would have required additional days to dissipate, and resulted in worldwide abnormal weather and decrease in global temperature over the next few years. However, the second phase of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull's eruption lasted longer than that of Mount Pinatubo. ==See also== * 2010 eruptions of Mount Merapi * 2014\u20132015 eruption of B\u00e1r\u00f0arbunga * Air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruption * British Airways Flight 9 * Effects of the April 2010 Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruption * KLM Flight 867 * Laki * List of volcanoes in Iceland * North Atlantic oscillation * Timeline of volcanism on Earth * Tuya ==References== ==External links== * Frequently Asked Questions on the Eruption in Iceland \u2013 from the Icelandic Met Office * BBC webpage with film of the volcano, taken from 500m from the crater's edge, by Chris Weber on 13 May 2010 * Volcanic Ash and Aviation Safety \u2013 SKYbrary guidance to pilots and controllers concerning the effects of volcanic ash. * Collection of Scientific Earth Observations and Models * NASA Observes the Icelandic Volcano * NASA Earth Observatory satellite imagery * Satellite evidence of hot lava flows from an Icelandic volcano (CIMSS Satellite Blog) (March 2010) * Description of beginning of current eruption, (March 2010), Icelandic Met Office * Volcanoes in European history \u2013 Podcast placing the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruption in a historical perspective. * Webpages and -links related to 2010 Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruptions, Icelandic Met Office ===Photography=== * Photos from Icelanders and by visitors (Flickr Group) * A short time-lapse from 17 April 2010.
