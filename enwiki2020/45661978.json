    "text": "The Ohio Society of New York is an historical, social, and patriotic organization established in 1885 and based in New York City. It is the oldest state society in New York. ==History== The Ohio Society of New York was founded by Civil War General Thomas Ewing, Jr., when he and several other prominent gentlemen of Ohio roots living in New York City met on November 10, 1885, and made the first entry into the society's first minute book. They met 10 days later, on November 20, 1885, and adopted a constitution. Initially a dining society, it later leased private rooms at the Waldorf Astoria (then located on Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street) until 1929, the Hotel Pennsylvania until 1962, and the Biltmore until 1977. The society is perhaps best known for its extravagant annual banquets which, during the 1800s and 1900s, were often oversubscribed and frequently reported on by the media. It continues to hold meetings and events today. ==Membership== Candidates must be invited to join by a member who will act as proposer and facilitate the introduction of another member willing to second the nomination. Candidates must then meet with and be approved by the board of governors. Eligibility may be established by Ohio ancestral lineage, residence, or education. The Governor of Ohio and Bishop of Ohio are customarily admitted to membership. ==Notable members== Public officials * William B. Allison, U.S. Senator * Calvin S.
