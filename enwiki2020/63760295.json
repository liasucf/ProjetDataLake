    "text": "Potential maximum Zone area The Mini Schengen Zone is an Economic Zone between Serbia, Albania, North Macedonia and Kosovo. It was declared on 10 October 2019 in Novi Sad. Two more meetings were held, one in Ohrid on 11 November 2019 and the other in Durr\u00ebs on 12 December 2019. The four countries declared that they will form a unified market of 14 million people by the end of 2020. With this Union, goods and capital between these four countries will flow quicker, people from these countries will be able to cross the border with ID only, and more than 30 million hours will be saved crossing the borders of these four countries every year. On 4 September 2020 Kosovo agreed to join the Mini Schengen Zone as part of the 2020 Kosovo\u2013Serbia agreement. The World Bank says that this project would save 3.2 billion USD, of which, the Serbian president said, Serbia gets at least 1.5 billion. This economic zone is preparing the countries to become members of the European Union. ==Members== * * * * ==Economy and Cities== The GDP of these countries combined would be $79.613 bilion, GDP PPP would be $211.971 bilion. GDP per capita would be $6,694, GDP PPP per capita would be $17,700. Albania, Kosovo and North Macedonia would have higher GDP per capita and GDP PPP per capita, and Serbia's GDP/GDP PPP per capita would decrease somewhat. The current currencies are the Serbian Dinar, Albanian Lek, Macedonian Denar and the Euro. The official languages are Serbian, Albanian and Macedonian. The capital cities are Belgrade, Tirana, Pristina and Skopje. Some other big cities are Novi Sad, Nis, Durr\u00ebs, Shkodra, and Kragujevac. Serbia is the largest country in this Union. Serbia also has the largest economy, highest Human Development Index, and largest population. The largest city in this Economic Zone is Belgrade, with about 1.7 milion people. ==What the Mini Schengen Zone Does== The Mini Schengen Zone's intentions are to provide greater opportunities for trade, student exchanges, and encourage EU integration in the member states, inter alia. Citizens of member states will need only a ID card to visit other member states, saving time at border crossings. ==When the Mini Schengen Zone will be established== On 10 October 2019 the Mini Schengen Zone was declared by Serbia, Albania and North Macedonia. The next meeting was projected to be in Belgrade, in late spring or summer 2020. The first meeting was due to be held in January or February 2020 in Belgrade. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, no meeting was held and a potential date for new meeting in Belgrade was tentatively scheduled for spring or summer 2020. At that meeting the leaders of the four countries will give further details on the Zone. In the joint declaration of October 2019, Serbia, Albania, and North Macedonia guaranteed that, by the end of 2020, they will create the Mini Schengen Zone, ensure the free flow of goods and capital, and ensure unified border crossing procedures. ==Potential Members== Two potential members are Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The President of Montenegro said that he supports the Durr\u00ebs summit, but Montenegro is focused on joining the European Union. A representative of Bosnia and Herzegovina said during the Ohrid summit that Bosnia and Herzegovina is likewise currently focused on joining the European Union. * * ==Economy of Member States== Belgrade, Serbia * * GDP:$51.533 bilion * GDP PPP:$137.126 bilion * GDP per capita:$7.398 * GDP PPP per capita:$19.767 *GDP growth:-1.8%(2020),7.5%(2021) *Inflation:1.4%(2020) * * GDP:$15.418 bilion * GDP PPP:$40.151 bilion * GDP per capita:$5.373 * GDP PPP per capita:$13.991 *GDP Growth:-5%(2020),8.0%(2021) *Inflation:2.0%(2020) * * GDP:$12.672 bilion * GDP PPP:$34.694 * GDP per capita:$6.096 * GDP PPP per capita:$16.486 *GDP growth:-4%(2020),7.0%(2021) *Inflation:-0.9%(2020) * * GDP:$7.996 bilion * GDP PPP:$22.128 * GDP per capita:$4.442 * GDP PPP per capita:$12.432 *GDP growth:-5%(2020),7.5%(2021) *Inflation:1.3%(2020) ==Population of Member States== * * 6,945,235(2019) * * 2,862,427(2019) * * 2,077,132(2019) * * 1,782,115(2019) ==First challenges== During the COVID-19 pandemic, the economies of the involved countries were hit hard. However, Serbia, Albania and North Macedonia managed to be the least hit countries in Europe. The European Union has seen this potential for cooperation and has opened negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia. The countries of the European Union, China, Russia, and several other countries helped the countries to recover from the COVID pandemic. ==Precursor to Mini Schengen Zone== The first mentions of an economic zone between these countries came in the early 1990s. The plans were eventually abandoned due to the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, a 1999\u20132001 insurgency in southern Serbia and eastern Kosovo and a 2001 insurgency in Macedonia. The first signs of the Mini Schengen Zone emerged in 2018, but it was initially planned as a way to improve political relations. However, at the 2019 Ohrid summit, the presidents of Serbia, Albania and North Macedonia agreed to create an economic zone, which would further improve political and economic relations and strengthen cultural ties between the nations. ==See also== *Schengen Area *Central European Free Trade Agreement *Craiova Group *European Union ==Notes== == References == Category:Economy of Europe ",
