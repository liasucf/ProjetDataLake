It is part of the Northern Beaches region. It and Bilgola Plateau were gazetted as suburbs in 2012 dividing the previous suburb of Bilgola. ==Location== Bilgola Beach is located on the Tasman Sea side of the Barrenjoey Peninsula between Avalon to the north and Newport to the south. The land rises steeply behind Bilgola Beach to Bilgola Plateau and then descends to Clareville on the western side of the peninsula. ==History== The name \"Bilgola\" is derived from an Aboriginal term Belgoula meaning \"swirling waters\", or perhaps \"a pretty beach with steep slopes, studded with cabbage palms\". The word Belgoula was noted in Surveyor James Meehan's records of 1814. Robert Henderson received a grant of in 1822 which he named \"Belgoola\". The district eventually adopted the simplified name \"Bilgola\".The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 29 The area was owned by the McLurcan family from the start of the early 1900s. Mrs McLurcan was famous for her cookery book, 'Mrs McLurcan's Cookery Book'. The large family home was surrounded by cabbage tree palms, for which the area is noted. There were plans during the 1960s to build a bridge bypass of the twisting road ('Bilgola Bends') between the north and south headlands of Bilgola. The bridge was not built but a small amount of landfill was added to remove a sharp bend in the southern end of the road in preparation for construction. The bend still remains, with the landfill now providing a small grassy area, with an excellent view of Newport Beach. ==Demographics== According to the 2011 census of Population, there were 3,863 residents in Bilgola (now the suburbs of Bilgola Beach and Bilgola Plateau). 71.7% of people were born in Australia.
