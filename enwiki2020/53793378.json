    "text": "Butternut Creek flows for 37 miles before converging with the Unadilla River just downstream of Mount Upton, New York. The creek has many fish for fishing dominated by largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, wall-eye, chain pickerel, rock bass, and yellow perch. The Mohawk called the creek the Tienuderrah river. General Jacob Morris visited the area in 1787, and described Butternut Creek as \"the handsomest navigable creek I ever lay my eyes upon.\" ==References== Category:Geography of New York (state) Category:Rivers of New York (state) Category:Rivers of Otsego County, New York ",
