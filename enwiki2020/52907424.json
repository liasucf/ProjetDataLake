He was nicknamed Axlar-Bj\u00f6rn, which translates as \"Shoulder-Bear\" in Icelandic. ==Early life== Axlar-Bj\u00f6rn was the youngest of three children born to an Icelandic farmer couple. He lived at \u00d6xl west of B\u00fa\u00f0ir in Sn\u00e6fellsnes. ==Murders== Abandoned farms in Sn\u00e6fellsnes. When he was 15-years old, Axlar- Bj\u00f6rn began to help in the farm of a rich neighbor named Ormur in exchange for room and board. Ormur died some years later from natural causes and left his estates to his son, Gu\u00f0mundur. Gu\u00f0mundur had become friends with Axlar-Bj\u00f6rn during his employment, and gifted him a farm called \u00d6xl in the Stadarsveit region of Sn\u00e6fellsnes. Axlar-Bj\u00f6rn took residence there with his wife, \u00de\u00f3rd\u00eds \u00d3lafsd\u00f3ttir. Many legends have been written about Bj\u00f6rn and his malice, however these were recorded 250-300 years after the time of the execution. His story is interwoven with legends and full of folkloric motifs. The accounts differ on the motives, modus, number of victims, and events that led to the arrest of Axlar-Bj\u00f6rn. Two numbers of victims, nine and eighteen, are the most common claims. The victims were travellers and farmhands that came to \u00d6xl looking for work; some versions say that he hacked them with the axe and others that he drowned them. Local suspicions about Axlar-Bj\u00f6rn grew as people disappeared in the area while his horses and other possessions increased, but he was safe because of the protection given to him by Gu\u00f0mundur. ==Arrest and execution== A contemporary depiction of a breaking wheel Axlar-Bj\u00f6rn was arrested and confessed to nine murders, but authorities found more bodies when they searched his farm. Asked about them, Axlar-Bj\u00f6rn claimed that he had found the remains buried in his land and decided to rebury them in another place without notifying authorities or bringing them to a cemetery. The authorities did not believe this explanation. A \u00feing sentenced Axlar-Bj\u00f6rn to die by hanging followed by breaking on the wheel. After his death, his body was dismembered and each piece put on a stake. \u00de\u00f3rd\u00eds, who was pregnant at the time, was forced to watch the execution. ==Family aftermath== \u00de\u00f3rd\u00eds was accused of assisting her husband in the murders and even of committing some of the murders herself. She was also sentenced to death, but the execution was not carried out. The son she was carrying, Sveinn \"Skotti\" Bj\u00f6rnsson, grew up to be a vagrant and a criminal, and was hanged for rape in 1648. After Sveinn's own son, G\u00edsli \"Hrokur\" Sveinsson, also became a criminal and was executed. ==Modern references== \u00dalfar \u00deorm\u00f3\u00f0sson wrote about him in a historical novel, \u00derj\u00e1r s\u00f3lir svartar (Reykjav\u00edk: H\u00f6fundur. 1988). Magn\u00fas \u00de\u00f3r J\u00f3nsson included him in his book Bj\u00f6rn og Sveinn: e\u00f0a Makleg m\u00e1lagj\u00f6ld (Reykjav\u00edk: M\u00e1l og menning. 1994). And in 2012, the Icelandic theatre group Vesturport set up the play Axlar-Bj\u00f6rn which is based on the legends about Bj\u00f6rn and his wife. ==References== ==Other sources== * Alda Sigmundsdottir (2019) Icelandic Folk Legends: Tales of apparitions, outlaws and things unseen (Little Books Publishing) ==External links== *Axlar-Bj\u00f6rn, the only Icelandic serial killer, terrorized travellers on Snaefellsness peninsula.
