It is his second release in the 12 album series initiated by Ipecac Recordings. The song \"Sea is Rising\" made its first studio appearance on 2013's Unicorn Skeleton Mask, while the song was actually debuted instrumentally on the Omar Rodriguez Lopez Group 2010 tour. \"Running Away\" was uploaded in advance as the album's single. The first two songs were then re-recorded by Omar in 2018 and released on July 24, 2020 as part of The Clouds Hill Tapes Parts I, II & III. On August 1, 2016, Pitchfork released a music video for the song \"Running Away\" directed by Violeta Felix which features John Frusciante, former Mars Volta bassist Eva Gardner, Teri Gender Bender (of Le Butcherettes and Bosnian Rainbows), photographer Robin Laananen, actress Tatiana Velazquez, visual artist Aura T-09 and Buzz Osborne (of The Melvins) all punching Omar in the face. ==Background== Described as \"mournful folk-pop\", Corazones features songs originally intended to be used for a film (which eventually failed to materialize). The studio wanted Omar's vocal delivery and music for the film to be as \"straight-ahead\" as possible and the result he compared to \"childlike nursery rhymes.\" His main inspiration for the songs was his mother, who was terminally ill at the time. Omar stated, \"when working with the director and producer, all the themes that were in the film itself were exactly what I was going through: loss, loss of identity because of such an extreme loss.\" After his mother died, Omar decided to hire his friend Sam Margolis to help him finish the production. ==Track listing== Tracks 3 & 4 form a single piece. ==Personnel== *Musicians: ** Omar Rodr\u00edguez- L\u00f3pez \u2013 vocals, guitars, piano ** Luke Reynolds \u2013 guitars, synthesizers, pedal steel guitar, noise ** Marco Giovino \u2013 drums, percussion ** Viktor Krauss \u2013 bass ** Sam Margolis \u2013 harmonica, ukulele ** Teri Gender Bender \u2013 backing vocals (2, 3, 8-10) *Technical: ** Omar Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez \u2013 production ** Sam Margolis \u2013 production, engineering ** Eric Masse \u2013 engineering ** Jon Debaun \u2013 engineering ** Chris Common \u2013 engineering, mixing, mastering ** Angel Marcelo Rodriguez \u2013 cover photo ** Mackie \u2013 layout ==Release history== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !
