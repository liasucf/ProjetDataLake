    "text": "Into the Stars is a space simulator video game developed by Fugitive Games, a development team made up of former EA DICE and Spark Unlimited developers, and published by Iceberg Interactive. Following a successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, the game was greenlit and went into the Steam Early Access program. The goal of the Into the Stars is to reach the planet of Titus Nova, with one large \"capital\" spaceship and a limited amount of supplies. In order to achieve this the player must visit other planets to gather resources, negotiate with alien species, and attempt to escape the pursuit of an enemy threat known as the Skorn. Fugitive Games cited The Oregon Trail and FTL: Faster Than Light among their inspirations for the game. == References == ==External links== *Into the Stars at Fugitive Games Category:Crowdfunded video games Category:Kickstarter-funded video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Space flight simulator games Category:Unreal Engine games Category:2016 video games Category:Video games scored by Jack Wall Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ",
