The first campus library was a reading room on the third floor of Fairmount Hall, the first building constructed on campus.Rydjord, John. A History of Fairmount College. Lawrence, KS: The Regents Press of Kansas, 1977. Paul Roulet, who was hired as a professor of mathematics and French served as the campus' first librarian until his death in 1903. By the end of the first decade of the 20th Century, library collections had exceeded 20,000 volumes and had massively outgrown the original reading room in Fairmount Hall. The university opened its first library building, the Morrison Library, (named for the first President of Fairmount College, Nathan J. Morrison) in 1909, with the assistance of a $40,000 grant provided by Andrew Carnegie. The first Morrison Library had a neo-classical design, characterized by the doric-style columns on its fa\u00e7ade. Sadly these columns are all that remain of this building, which was tragically destroyed by fire in 1964.Carmody, Michael. \u201cA Fundamental Dream.\u201d The Shocker. Accessed October 28, 2014. http://wsu.wichita.edu/the- shocker/story.php?eid=34&id;=1008#.VE_TgRa4P08 By the late 1930s library collections had exceeded the space in the original Morrison Library. A grant from the Federal Government during the New Deal provided the funds for a new library building, named the University of Wichita Library, opened in 1939.Miner, Craig. Uncloistered Halls: The Centennial History of Wichita State University. Wichita, KS: Wichita State University Endowment Association, 1995., 125. Petitioning by students and faculty caused the University to rename the Library the Morrison Library (present day Morrison Hall). A post- war economic boom led to a vast expansion of programs at the University of Wichita, increasing yet again the size of library collections, and placing demands for space that exceeded the size of the Morrison Library. A donation of property by Frank and Harvey Ablah, a pair of successful Wichita entrepreneurs made possible the financing of the construction of a new library facility. Ablah Library opened its doors in 1962. ==Current library facilities== University libraries currently consist of three facilities located on the main campus of WSU: Ablah Library, McKinley Chemistry Library and Thurlow Lieurance Memorial Music Library. ===Ablah Library=== The Ablah Library, opened in 1962, remains the main library on the WSU Campus.
