This may have been their family home, in which their father Joseph died two years earlier. In February 1884 the McMinn sisters moved their school to another property on nearby Buxton Street, which they dubbed \"Tormore\" for their birthplace in Ireland. :Residents of Tormore, Ireland included one Mary Rutherdale (c. 1764 \u2013 3 January 1849) - from Parish Headstones Donaghmore, Down, Ireland \"Here lie the remains of Robert McMinn, of Tormore, who departed this life the 12th October, 1808, aged 70 years. Also the remains of his brother Gilbert McMinn of Tormore, who departed this life on the 12th of April, 1823, aged 77 years. Also the remains of their niece Mary Rutherdale, of Tormore, who departed this life on the 3rd of January, 1849, Aged 84 years. Robert McMinn, of Castle Ennigan, died 15th December, 1879, Aged 80 years.\" It had been John Whinham's North Adelaide Grammar School, which he relinquished to move to larger premises at the corner of Ward and Jeffcott Streets.Wall, Barbara Our Own Matilda: Matilda Jane Evans, 1827-1886 Wakefield Press, Adelaide South Australia The school was taken over by Ann and Caroline Jacob towards the end of 1897, and the McMinn sisters left Adelaide on 15 December, retiring to Ealing Common, England. The school moved to new premises at 211 Childers Street in January 1899, with a house for boarders alongside. In 1907 Caroline Jacob took over the Unley Park Grammar School and ran the two institutions concurrently. Around this time substantial improvements were made: separate facilities for the younger (8\u201312 y.o.) students and additional premises for boarders, art studies and a kindergarten. Caroline Jacob's father financed the construction of a gymnasium, which also served as a large meeting-hall. School enrolments declined alarmingly during World War I; negotiations with (Anglican) Bishop Nutter Thomas for incorporation into the Church education system came to nothing,Helen Jones, 'Jacob, Caroline (1861\u20131940)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/jacob-caroline-6816/text11795, published first in hardcopy 1983, accessed online 25 July 2016. and in 1918 the school moved to smaller premises in Barton Tce. and the Childers Street premises became the \"Andover\" residential flats; the School closed in 1920. \"Andover\" later became the site of the Kindergarten Teachers College, then the Kingston College of Advanced Education in 1974. A Tormore Old Scholars' Association was active from at least 1906 to 1954, and a reunion held in 1936 exclusively of the McMinn sisters' students, attracted over 60 old scholars. ==Notable students== *Esther Gwendolyn \"Stella\" Bowen (1893\u20131947) one of three women appointed official war artists WWII (the others being Sybil Craig and Nora Heysen) *Phyllis Dorothy Cilento n\u00e9e McGlew (1894\u20131987) *Francisca Adriana \"Paquita\" Delprat, daughter of G.
