    "text": "Frost/Nixon, and four other Broadway theatres in 45th street, 2007 The Royale Theatre, showing Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, 2003 The Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre, formerly called the Royale Theatre and the John Golden Theatre, is a Broadway theatre located at 242 West 45th Street (George Abbott Way) in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. ==History== Designed by architect Herbert J. Krapp, and built by the Chanin Construction Company, it opened as the Royale Theatre on January 11, 1927, with a musical entitled Piggy. Produced by William B. Friedlander, Piggy had a weak script, but the popular comedian Sam Bernard played the starring role and carried the show for 79 performances. Bernard died soon after the show closed. Built as part of a three theater complex, alongside the 800-seat Theatre Masque, the 1,600-seat Majestic, and the Lincoln Hotel (now the RowNYC Hotel and previously the Milford Plaza Hotel), the theater features an ornate stone facade, with vaulted large windows above the street frontage. The landmarked interior features murals by Willy Pogany and one balcony level all under an expansive vaulted plasterwork ceiling. With a seating capacity just over 1,100, the theater has been home to both plays and musical productions in its ninety-year history. Producer John Golden leased the theatre and renamed it for himself from 1932 to 1937 (when he moved to the Theatre Masque next door). The Shubert Organization then assumed ownership and initially leased the theatre to CBS Radio. In 1940, the Royale was restored to use as a legitimate theatre under its original name. On May 9, 2005, it was renamed for longtime Shubert Organization president Bernard B. Jacobs. The theatre has been closed as of March 12, 2020 due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. It does not plan on opening until January 3, 2021. ==Notable productions== * 1927: Piggy (opened January 11, 1927, closed March 19, 1927) * 1927: Rang Tang * 1928: Diamond Lil * 1933: Both Your Houses * 1934: Small Miracle * 1940: Du Barry Was a Lady * 1941: The Corn Is Green * 1946: The Glass Menagerie * 1947: Our Lan' * 1949: The Madwoman of Chaillot * 1952: New Faces of 1952 * 1954: The Immoralist * 1954: The Boy Friend * 1955: The Matchmaker * 1957: The Tunnel of Love * 1958: The Entertainer * 1958: Gigi * 1960: Becket * 1961: The Night of the Iguana * 1964: The Subject Was Roses * 1965: The Owl and the Pussycat; Cactus Flower * 1971: The Incomparable Max * 1972: Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris; Moonchildren; Grease * 1980: Whose Life is it Anyway?; A Day in Hollywood / A Night in the Ukraine * 1982: Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat * 1984: The Human Comedy * 1985: Pack of Lies; Song and Dance * 1988: Speed-the-Plow * 1989: Lend Me a Tenor * 1992: Conversations with My Father * 1994: An Inspector Calls * 1997: Triumph of Love * 1998: Art * 2000: Copenhagen * 2003: Anna in the Tropics, Ma Rainey's Black Bottom * 2004: A Raisin in the Sun * 2005: Glengarry Glen Ross * 2006: Three Days of Rain; Martin Short: Fame Becomes Me * 2007: Frost/Nixon; Rock 'n' Roll * 2008: The Country Girl; 13 * 2009: God of Carnage * 2010: Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson * 2011: That Championship Season; The Mountaintop * 2012: Once * 2015: It's Only a Play; The Color Purple * 2017: Bandstand * 2018: The Iceman Cometh; The Ferryman * 2019: Betrayal * 2020: Company ==Box office record== Once achieved the box office record for the Bernard B.
