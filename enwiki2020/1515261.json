    "text": "The Muppets at Walt Disney World is a television special starring Jim Henson's Muppets at Walt Disney World in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. The special aired on NBC as part of The Magical World of Disney on May 6, 1990, and turned out to be the last Muppets special that Henson would work on (he would die 10 days following its airing, on May 16). ==Prelude== At the start of The Magical World of Disney, former Disney CEO Michael Eisner talks about this special while in the presence of Fozzie Bear and his mother Emily. ==Plot== In the television special, the Muppets are visiting Kermit's family for their annual reunion where they meet up with Kermit's aunts and uncles. When the others learn that the swamp is right next to Walt Disney World, they sneak in, and are pursued by a security guard named Quentin Fitzwaller (played by Charles Grodin). Attractions and areas featured include Big Thunder Mountain, the Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!, Star Tours, the Mad Tea Party, World Showcase, the Walt Disney World Monorail System and the utilidors. The special depicts the three parks (Magic Kingdom, Epcot and Disney-MGM Studios) as one connected area, despite the parks actually being apart from each other. The story ends with the Muppets having a friendly meeting at Mickey Mouse's office where Mickey and Kermit compare their company's theme songs, \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" and \"The Rainbow Connection\" and the ideals behind them. After that, the Muppets return to the swamp, but find out about Miss Piggy remaining stuck in front of The Great Movie Ride with her feet in the cement. They return to Walt Disney World for her afterwards to free her. While stuck in the cement, Miss Piggy shouts for help as the credits roll. ==Cast== * Charles Grodin as Quentin Fitzwaller * Raven-Symon\u00e9 as Little Girl * Wayne Allwine as Mickey Mouse (voice) * Michael Eisner as Himself ===Muppet performers=== * Jim Henson as Kermit the Frog, Rowlf the Dog, Dr. Teeth, Link Hogthrob, the Swedish Chef, Waldorf * Frank Oz as Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Animal * Jerry Nelson as Robin the Frog, Camilla the Chicken, Floyd Pepper, Emily Bear, Frog * Richard Hunt as Scooter, Janice, Beaker, Statler, Frog * Dave Goelz as Gonzo, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, Beauregard, Zoot, Frog * Steve Whitmire as Rizzo the Rat, Bean Bunny, Frog * Kevin Clash as Clifford, Alligator, Frog * Camille Bonora as Frog, Additional Muppets * David Rudman as Frog, Additional Muppets * Additional Muppets performed by Rickey Boyd and Rick Lyon ==Other characters' appearances== During the song \"Rockin' All Around the World\" (in melody of Status Quo's \"Rockin' All Over the World\"), Muppets inspired by the Audio-Animatronic children characters from the \"It's a Small World\" attraction appear.
