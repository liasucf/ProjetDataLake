An underpass for pedestrians link the beginning of the street with Rosenborg Castle Gardens on the other side of S\u00f8lvgade.

According to the plan, the streets in the area were to be named after Danish territorial possessions, royalty and the upper classes. The shape of the Nyboder development indicates that the original intension was to create a street parallel to Adelgade and Borgergade at the site. Rigensgade in c. 1910 At the far end of the street was an open area, Gr\u00f8nland (Greenland), which was used as a military drill ground. It was also known as Rigens Marskalks Plads but by 1679 the name had already passed out of use. The so- called Gold House, am alchemist laboratory was located at the beginning of the street. It was converted into a military hospital in 1673 and later into a royal textile factory which moved to Usser\u00f8d in 1815. The site was then taken over by the Garrison Hospital. In 1683, Christian V purchased the buildings and used them as a textile factory. ==Notable buildings== Jerusalem's Church The former Garrison Hospital has been converted into residences for officers of the Royal Danish Army. The 48-bay, Neoclassical building dates from 1760 and an extension in 1779. No. 36; Caroline Amalies Asyl No. 13 is part of a complex fronting \u00d8ster Voldgade which was originally built for the College of Advanced Technology. It now houses GEUS and Gefion Gymnasium.
