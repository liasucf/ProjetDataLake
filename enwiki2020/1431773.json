    "text": "The Funeral of the Anarchist Galli (Il Funerale dell\u2019anarchico Galli) is a painting by Italian painter Carlo Carr\u00e0. It was finished in 1911, during the artist's futurist phase. It currently resides in New York City's Museum of Modern Art. The subject of the work is the funeral of Italian anarchist Angelo Galli, killed by police during a general strike in 1904.Heard Hamilton, George. (1993) Painting and Sculpture in Europe 1880-1940. 6th edition. New Haven: Yale University Press, p. 282. The Italian State feared that the funeral would become a de facto political demonstration and refused the mourning anarchists entrance into the cemetery itself. When anarchists resisted, the police responded with force and a violent scuffle ensued. Carlo Carr\u00e0 was present. His work embodies the tension and chaos of the scene: the movement of the bodies, the clashing of anarchists and police, the black flags flying in the air. He reflects in a later memoir: The Hungarian poet, Lajos Kass\u00e1k wrotea dramatic prose account of the picture, \"Carlo D. Carra anarkhistatemet\u00e9s c\u00edm\u0171 k\u00e9pe al\u00e1\" in A Tett, No.2 November 1915. ==References== ==External links== *The Funeral of the Anarchist Galli in the MoMA Online Collection Category:Paintings by Carlo Carr\u00e0 Category:Futurist paintings Category:1911 paintings Category:History of anarchism Category:Paintings of the Museum of Modern Art (New York City) ",
