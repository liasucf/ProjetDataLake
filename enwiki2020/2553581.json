In 2004 she co-created The L Word, inspired largely by her own experiences as a lesbian woman. In 2007, Chaiken, and a group of women in the entertainment and tech industries, launched a social networking site called OurChart for lesbians and their friends. OurChart was online until 2008, when it was shutdown. In 2008, a spin-off show of The L Word entitled The Farm was in development and two pilots were being written by Chaiken, although Showtime never bought the series.
