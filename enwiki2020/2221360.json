    "text": "It Takes a Family is a 2005 book by then Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum. The title is a response to the 1996 book It Takes a Village by then-First Lady Hillary Clinton. In the book, Santorum states that the family structure is necessary. He argues that liberal social policies have devastated the family structure and that prevailing socially liberal attitudes have systematically devalued families across the board. He argues that government should take a proactive role in promoting strong families. ==Summary== Santorum criticizes alike laissez-faire conservatives and liberal proponents of social welfare for promoting a radical view of autonomy. In particular, he criticizes the \"bigs\" -- \"big government, big media, big entertainment, big universities.\" He also says that radical feminists are responsible for undermining the traditional family.Faces Questions on Women in the Work Force He explained his views in an interview with National Public Radio: > They have this idea that people should be left alone, be able to do whatever > they want to do.

The book was praised by conservative Christian media leaders James Dobson and Pat Robertson and promoted through their organizations, as well as by the conservative magazine National Review, which printed a series of excerpts from the book. The magazine's book service called the book's ideas \"innovative\" and \"based on sound values -- including the centrality of the family to all social and political life.\" National Review Book Service products page A review by Keith Fournier in Catholic Online likewise praises the book, saying, \"The author's discussion of how to create a family friendly public policy which promotes fidelity and encourages motherhood, fatherhood and intact families is well thought out and practical.\"http://www.catholic.org/featured/headline.php?ID=2398 Review of It Takes a Family,Catholic Online, July 25, 2005 Many reviews were critical of Santorum's work. Claiming that Santorum's social vision was anything but innovative or refreshing, one reviewer for The Philadelphia Inquirer referred to Santorum as \"one of the finest minds of the Thirteenth Century\". Writing for American Prospect Online, reviewer Mark Schmitt argues that the book fails to present a unified case for how social conservatism is served by laissez- faire economic policies, yet urges readers to commit to both; he also asserts that the author offers several solutions already proposed by his opposition, while criticizing the opposition's failure to provide solutions.http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&name;=ViewWeb&articleId;=10054 \"It Takes a Democrat\" (review of It Takes a Family), American Prospect Online, July 29, 2005 Ruth Conniff, reviewing the book for The Progressive, comments that certain arguments and examples in the book are seemingly at odds. As an example, the reviewer points out that a success story cited by Santorum as an example of a single mother getting off welfare actually showcases a number of strategies the senator opposes -- leaving the children's father, use of public shelters, and use of welfare to support the family while getting an education, rather than leaving school to take a job.http://www.progressive.org/mag_conniff1005 \"Rick Santorum's America,\" The Progressive, October 2005 Passages from It Takes a Family generated controversy during Santorum's 2006 reelection campaign, as well as during his 2012 presidential campaign. In 2005, when Santorum was on Capitol Hill, then- Senator Hillary Clinton teased him, \"Remember, Rick, it takes a village!\" Santorum took it in stride, telling Christian Science Monitor, \"She was joking - but in every joke there's something,\" he says. \"So was it a little dig? Yeah, it was both. But it was nicer. ... I took it in good spirit.\" ==References== ==External links== * Official site of It Takes a Family *After Words interview with Santorum on It Takes a Family, July 31, 2005 Category:2005 non-fiction books Category:Books about politics of the United States Category:Books critical of modern liberalism in the United States Category:English-language books Category:Rick Santorum ",
