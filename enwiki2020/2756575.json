    "text": "Elginshire and Nairnshire was a county constituency in Scotland. From 1832 to 1918, it returned one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, elected by the first-past-the-post voting system. == Boundaries == The constituency was created in 1832 by the Scottish Reform Act 1832 by a merger of two former constituencies: Elginshire and Nairnshire. It extended to the counties of Elginshire and Nairnshire, with the exception of the burghs of Elgin, Nairn and Forres which were instead part of Inverness Burghs and Elgin Burghs. It was replaced in 1918 by the new Moray and Nairn constituency, which included all of Elginshire and Nairnshire, including the burghs of Elgin, Nairn and Forres. == Members of Parliament == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\" | Election !!

The Grants dominated Elginshire which had around 30 voters; both constituencies objected to the merger but without result. The Act increased the electorate to about 650-700; after 1832, the seat was contested only once in 1841, returning a Conservative until the Liberals took the seat in 1874. ==Elections== ===Elections in the 1830s=== ===Elections in the 1840s=== Ogilvy-Grant resigned by accepting the office of Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds, causing a by-election. ===Elections in the 1850s=== ===Elections in the 1860s=== ===Elections in the 1870s=== Duff succeeded to the peerage, becoming Earl of Fife. === Elections in the 1880s === Anderson's death caused a by-election. === Elections in the 1890s === Sir William Gull === Elections in the 1900s === A.
