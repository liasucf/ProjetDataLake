She was armed on completion with 90 guns, comprising twenty-six 36-pounder guns on the lower deck, twenty-eight 18-pounder guns on the middle deck, and twenty-six 8-pounder guns on the upper deck, with ten 6-pounder guns on the quarterdeck. In 1706 an extra pair of 36-pounders was added on the lower deck, and an extra pair of 8-pounders on the upper deck, giving her 94 guns in total, Designed and constructed by Honor\u00e9 Malet and Pierre Masson jointly, she was begun at Rochefort in 1693 and launched on 1694, thus becoming the last three-decker to join Louis XIV's Navy. She took part in the Battle of V\u00e9lez-M\u00e1laga on 13 August 1704. In July 1707 she was sunk in shallow water at Toulon to avoid the fire from bomb vessels, but was refloated in October. She was condemned at Toulon in March 1713, and was sold to be broken up in November 1715. ==References== * *Nomenclature des Vaisseaux du Roi- Soleil de 1661 a 1715.
