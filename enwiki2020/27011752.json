    "text": "Amaravella (; from Sanskrit amaravella), or the Cosmists (\u041a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b), was a group of young Soviet artists active between 1923 and 1928. Its members included Aleksandr Sardan (Barabanov) (1901\u20131974), Boris Smirnov-Rusetsky (1905\u20131993), (1891\u20131971), (1895\u20131942?), (1900\u20131972) and (1879\u20131945/46). In 1922, the artists group was founded by Fateyev, a painter who was then 32 years old. The name Amaravella, however, was introduced in 1928 when Sardan coined it based from a Sanskrit word that means \"bearing light\" or \"creative energy\". Ideologically the group belonged to the Russian cosmism movement. It embraced a range of ideas and artistic approaches that explored cosmic harmony. The artists, who lived in a commune, were heavily influenced by the ancient East's works, as well as those of Helena Blavatsky, Nicholas Roerich, Mikalojus Konstantinas \u010ciurlionis, and Victor Borisov-Musatov. Like the M. Sokolov and V. Komarovskiy, members of the Amaravella were persecuted because their work did not conform to the \"socialist realism\" style prescribed for Soviet art. Particularly, their works were categorized as \"formalism\" through the 1932 decree On Restructuring Literary and Artistic Organizations, which repressed creative freedom. Several paintings of the Amaravella artists were collected by Iury Linnik, who claimed to be a cosmist poet and philosopher, and I.V. Savitsky. ==References== Category:1923 establishments in Russia Category:1928 disestablishments in Russia Category:Arts organizations disestablished in the 20th century Category:Arts organizations established in 1923 Category:Cosmism Category:Russian artist groups and collectives Category:Russian avant-garde Category:Soviet artists ",
