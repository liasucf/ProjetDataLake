Columbina Rural Service Center, Zhombe People from outside Zhombe usually mistake Columbina RSC for Empress Mine Township because this is where commuters from different places debus on their way to Empress Mine Township. After the closure of Empress Nickel Mine in 1985, Columbina then known as Machipisa Township became the main shopping center for the local people and for travellers to and from Kadoma and Gokwe Center. It was known as Machipisa Township because in the days of Empress the national famous Machipisa Brothers ran a very big shop here. Other stake holders way back then were Rumwe, Gwanzura, Mashingaidze, Mataruse, Mugadza, Chiwawu, Jabulani, Mundoza, Parehwa, Nakutepa and Majuzi.

Empress Mine Township a former Empress Nickel Mine Residential area has turned into a Growth point, and has been ear-marked for Zimbabwe's newest town. Empress Nickel Mine closed in 1985 after 17 years in operation.http://www.onemine.org/search/summary.cfm/Hydraulic-Sandfilling-to- Improve-Stability-at-Empress-Nickel-Mine d=4439814DC278253380F1379BF6AD6D4879D148908F66C739910D4911850F407929453 Columbina (Colombina) Township has come to be known as Empress because of its proximity to Empress and because Empress Residents preferred shopping at Columbina than in-gates at Empress proper. Empress Mine was established in an area formerly known as Salakuhle (Salagushle), and Commoner School was initially Salakuhle School when it was established. Sidakeni Business Center is about 3 km east of Columbina RSC. Sidakeni boasts of being the former and historical center of all activities in Zhombe-east. It is the home of COTCO which is a collection depot of the Cotton Company of Zimbabwe, formerly the Cotton Marketing Board. A Rural Health Center, Cattle Sale Pens and a primary and secondary schools are part of Sidakeni's pride in Zhombe Ngondoma Irrigation Scheme Small-Scale Irrigation \u2014A Foundation for Rural Growth in Zimbabwe\u2014Report of the Zimbabwe Joint Field Workshop\u2014 Water Management Synthesis Project\u2014WMS Report 66 page 120\u2014Ngondoma Scheme\u2014 http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PNAAZ715.pdf is about 4 km to the North-west of Columbina RSC. The irrigation scheme supplies the locals with vegetables and other horticultural products. Ngondoma Irrigation Scheme was established in 1968 by the Government. It is 72 km by road from Kadoma. The initial area of the scheme was 10ha with 12 active farmers, but was extended to 50 ha in the early 1970s. Then in 1979 the area was reduced to 22.5 ha due to water shortages caused by the increasing demand of water at the then Empress Nickel Mine. Nowadays the scheme has over a 100 farmers with quotas ranging between 0.1 and 0.6 ha and the hactarage has since been increased to +44 ha since the closure of Empress Mine. The Scheme is administered by AGRITEX, a Government extension for Agricultural Supervision and technical assistance. An additional 6ha of land has been put under irrigation about 2 km upstream as Ngondoma Irrigation Scheme extension. This came into effect because Empress Nickel Mine closed in 1985 and the water demand reduced reasonably. Water for the scheme comes from Ngondoma Damhttp://aroundguides.com/27135334 on the Ngondoma River. The dam has an estimated capacity of 7.5 million cubic metres of water. The dam is under the Zimbabwe National Water Authority. Water from the dam is conveyed to the irrigation scheme by a free running carnal propelled by gradient because the irrigation is down-stream. The canal is 4.8 km long and delivers to an overnight storage dam inside the irrigation scheme. Unless Empress Nickel Mine reopens, which is very unlikely, the water supply to the irrigation scheme is adequate in all seasons. Ngondoma Irrigation Scheme is very productive, and it is one of the cheapest schemes to run in Southern Africa because water supply does not need engines to bring it all the way from almost 5 km away.
