He was a representative to the Congress of Tucum\u00e1n of 9 July 1816 which declared the Independence of the provinces of the River Plate and presided over the assembly that declared the independence of Bolivia.

He left for Tucum\u00e1n due to persecution, and was elected to represent Charcas (Sucre) in the 1813 Assembly and in the 1816 Congress in Tucum\u00e1n, in which he acted as Secretary. He was a minister in the administrations of Ar\u00e1oz and Gonz\u00e1lez, governors of the then much larger Tucum\u00e1n Province and had represented Buenos Aires in the 1815 Observation Junta.
