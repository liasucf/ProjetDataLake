When it appears, fierce winds blow. It may also simply use its tail to capsize boats, or strike the beach with its tail and kill people there. ==Notes== ==References== * * ==External links== * Isonade at the Kaii-Y\u014dkai Densh\u014d Database Category:Y\u014dkai Category:Sea monsters Category:Legendary fish ",
