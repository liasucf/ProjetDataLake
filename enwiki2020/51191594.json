Unlike many other conventions, the board game halls are open 24 hours for attendees to play all night long. The event continues to grow in popularity, in large part due to its friendly atmosphere, and volunteer nature. The event had over 1100 attendees in 2016, and continues to grow every year. In 2019 they had over 1900 attendees. ==Events== SaltCON hosts the Ion Award game design competition, the largest board game design competition in the United States. Each year Publishers are asked to judge the competition, based on specific criteria. Notes are collected from judges, tallied, and winners are announced in each category. Games that win the Ion Award are published by game companies every year. Notable winners include Nika, Hold Your Breathe, and Pizza Theory. Along with the Ion Award competition there are other draws for game designers as well. There are events where game designers can show off their games that are still in development, such as a \"Prototype Alley\" where attendees are invited to meet the designers and try out these new games. The events are not only for game designers. Attendees can find many other events to enjoy at the convention: *Board Game Library (over 1000 games) *Board Game Publisher Exhibitors *Tournaments *Flea market *Math trade *Prizes *Play-to-win *Party games *Card games *Dexterity games *War games *Miniature games *RPGs *Figure Painting *Panel discussions *Artemis The event has also features charities, such as the Extra Life organization. Occasionally there are a few video games featured at the event. ==History== The convention began in 2009, as a follow up to the Gathering of Strangers board game days that were held at the University of Utah. The first few years were held also at the U of U campus Officer's Club, but as attendance grew, they moved to the Royal Garden Inn, then to the Sheraton, and finally to the Davis Conference Center, where it has been held since 2014. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Dates !Location !Event |- |2009 |February |University of Utah Officers Club |Main Event |- |2010 |February 26\u201328 |University of Utah Officers Club |Main Event |- |2011 |February 18\u201319 |University of Utah Officers Club |Main Event |- |2012 |February 17\u201318 |Royal Garden Inn |Main Event |- |2013 |February 15\u201317 |Sheraton |Main Event |- |2014 |March 28\u201330 |Davis Conference Center |Main Event |- |2015 |March 12\u201314 |Davis Conference Center |Main Event |- |2016 |March 3\u20135 |Davis Conference Center |Main Event |- |2017 |March 2\u20135 |Davis Conference Center |Main Event |- |2018 |March 1- 4 |Davis Conference Center |Spring |- |2018 |August 31 - September 1 |Davis Conference Center |End of Summer |- |2019 |February 28 - March 3 |Davis Conference Center |Spring |- |2019 |May 31 - June 1 |Davis Conference Center |Summer |- |2019 |August 30-31 |Davis Conference Center |End of Summer |- |2020 |March 5 - 8 |Davis Conference Center |Spring |} ==Support for Other Events== SaltCON supports other events and conventions all over Utah.
