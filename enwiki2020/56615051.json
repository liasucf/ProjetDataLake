It was founded in the Am Gries suburb of the city in 1243 before moving into the city centre eight years later. It was dissolved in 1802 and the nuns vacated the monastery in 1807. In 1834 some of the convent buildings were re-used to house the K\u00f6nigliche Polytechnische Schule and a trade school. In 1835 the former convent church was converted into the Staatsgalerie Altdeutscher Meister, a branch of the Bavarian State Painting Collections, which is still there today Hans P\u00f6rnbacher: Maria K\u00f6nigin der Engel.
