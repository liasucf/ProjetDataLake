The Overlake Village neighborhood was originally built in the 1960s and '70s and in recent years was zoned for higher density development as part of the City of Redmond's vision for the Overlake Urban Center. A master plan submitted to the city by Group Health for the redevelopment of the site, known as the Group Health-Overlake Village (Zone 4) Master Plan, was completed in December 2011. The Esterra Park project is \"the first major redevelopment of Overlake Village.\" Capstone Partners purchased the property from Group Health in March 2013 and during the same season began demolition of existing buildings on the site. Construction of the first building began around June 2014 and began on two further buildings as part of the first phase by the end of 2014. The entire project is expected to take several years to complete. In 2017, it was reported that 500 residential units were already completed with an additional 1,000 units under construction and up to 1,400 more units planned in lieu of office space due to a simultaneous reduction in office demand and an increase in housing demand locally. The additional housing units would bring the community to a total of 2,900 homes. ==References== ==External links== * *City of Redmond: Esterra Park Development Master Plan Category:Parks in Redmond, Washington Category:Transit-oriented developments in the United States Category:Buildings and structures under construction in the United States ",
