Duchon, La Manufacture de Porcelaine de Mennecy Villeroy, 1988. The history of the factory remains somewhat unclear, but it is typically regarded as producing between about 1738 and 1765.Dawson, 199 ==History== The arcanist in charge was Fran\u00e7ois Barbin (1691-1765Died at Mennecy, 27 August 1765, aged 74. Xavier R.M. de Chavagnac and Gaston Antoine de Grollier, Histoire des manufactures fran\u00e7aises de porcelaine, 1906:100).), who was already established as a maker of faience under Villeroy's protection when the parish registers commence in 1737. Barbin was identified in an action at law of August 1748 as having already spent fourteen years as a maker of porcelain in a house in the rue de Charonne, faubourg Saint-Antoine, Paris, where he and his wares had recently been seized and the porcelain sold, as impinging upon the prerogatives of the monopoly for exclusive manufacture of porcelains \"in the manner of Saxony\" (that is, Meissen porcelain) granted to the manufacture of porcelain at Vincennes in 1745; he sought protection away from Paris, with his protector the well- connected duc de Villeroy,Fran\u00e7ois Barbin was already a member of the duke's household, and a manufacturer of porcelain in December 1737 (Chavagnac and Golier 1906:98). combining his porcelain manufacture with the already established faience industry at the ch\u00e2teau de Villeroy and Mennecy.Chavagnac and Grollier 1906:95f. None of these early \"rue de Charennes\" porcelains made in 1734-48 have been identified, but a piece of faience at the Mus\u00e9e de S\u00e8vres bears the date 1748 and the mark D.V..Noted by Chavagnac and Grolier 1906:99. Alternatively, the rue de Charonne house had only ever housed the decorating section, using fired blanks brought up from Mennecy.Battie, 107 Management of the factory was assumed by Barbin's son, Jean-Baptiste, who bought out his father and his brother-in-law; after the younger Barbin's death shortly after his father, 14 September 1765,Chavagnac and Grolier 1906: the lease was bought from his widow by partners of the porcelain manufactory at Sceaux, the sculptor Charles-Symphorien Jacques and the painter Joseph Jullien, who shifted the factory to Bourg-la-Reine,Jacques and Jullien belatedly registered their factory marks in July 1773, both DV and BR for Bourg-la-Reine (Chavagnac and Grollier 1906; Harriet Wynter, An Introduction to European Porcelain, s.v. Mennecy (Ile-de-France), pp 103ff. close to the main market, Paris\u2014 where Barbin had not received a permit to construct a kiln in 1748. There they had the protection of Louis-Charles de Bourbon, comte d'Eu.Chavagnac and Grolier 1906:101 ==Products== The duke's DV and D.V. incised or in underglaze blue were used as the factory mark.William Chaffers, Marks and Monograms on Pottery & Porcelain, s.v. \"Menecy porcelain\". The elite wares of Mennecy were intended to compete with Chantilly porcelain and other small manufactures, which were joined in 1745 by Vincennes porcelain. Besides table wares, Mennecy-Villeroy specialized in small figures, representing the Seasons, commedia dell'arte characters,E.g. a Pantalone at the Cleveland Museum of Art, noted in Helen S. Foote, \"Mennecy-Villeroy Italian Comedy Figure: 'Pantalone'\", The Bulletin of the Cleveland Museum of Art 35.9 (November 1948):209-210) and other galanteries. The early wares were similar to those of Saint-Cloud, with the body having a \"creamy tone with a greenish surface\". Pieces were mostly small, figures or various types of pots and jars rather than dinner services. As with other French factories, this may have been partly an inhibition created by the monopoly granted to Vincennes in 1745. There is no use of gilding, with rims painted in pink or blue. From 1753 the head modeller was Nicolas Gauron, who later worked at Tournai and Derby.Battie, 107 ==Gallery== File:Harlequin Family MET DP260944 (cropped).jpg|Harlequin Family, 1740-1745, based on a Meissen group, one of the \"factory's finest achievements\".Dawson, 206 File:Villeroy Mennecy broc 1740 1750.jpg|Villeroy-Mennecy soft-paste porcelain ewer, 1740-1750.
