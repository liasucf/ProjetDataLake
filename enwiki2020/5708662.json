It is featured on their DVD The Video Show. ==Reception== In Billboard magazine's Critics' Choice at the end of 1986, Kim Freeman chose the song as No. 7 in his top ten countdown, describing it as \"a rare ballad that isn't too sappy to enjoy\".Billboard. 27 December 1986. Stevie Chick, writing for The Guardian in 2014, called the song a \"genuinely affecting ballad\" but observed its similarity to Collins' solo work, stating it \"could have easily fitted on his solo albums\". In his assessment of the song for AllMusic, Fran\u00e7ois Couture claimed: \"This love song featured heartfelt vocals, a simple piano accompaniment, and Mike Rutherford's trademark rhythm guitar, plus a very catchy chorus. Nothing striking, but all the elements came together nicely and adult contemporary radio stations played it extensively.\" == Track listing == === 7\": Virgin / GENS 5 (UK) === # \"Throwing It All Away\" \u2013 3:41 # \"I'd Rather Be You\" \u2013 3:57 === 7\": Atlantic / 7-89372 (US) === # \"Throwing It All Away\" \u2013 3:41 # \"Do The Neurotic\" (Edit) \u2013 5:21 === 12\": Virgin / GENS 5\u201312 (UK) === # \"Throwing It All Away\" (live) # \"I'd Rather Be You\" # \"Invisible Touch\" (live) * Also released on MC (GENSC5) * Live tracks recorded at The Forum, Los Angeles, 1986 ==Personnel== * Phil Collins \u2013 vocals, drums, percussion * Tony Banks \u2013 keyboards * Mike Rutherford \u2013 electric guitars, bass guitar ==Release history== {|class=\"wikitable\" !
