Their devoted father vowed not to marry again and struggled to raise them but was killed in a car accident while already suffering from leukemia. The girls were left to fend for themselves but a series of events caused by gangsters separated the sisters for fifteen years. Yoon-hee grew up as Sun-woo and was abused by the Lee family (Seung-hee especially), who had been forced to adopt her because she was knocked down by their truck. Meanwhile, Tae-hee spent fifteen years with her grandfather and became a successful entrepreneur. Another male character, Chul-woong, frequently stood up for Sun-woo, and once ransacked the Lee household when Sun-woo was being abused. Seung-hee later pretended to be Yoon-hee when a letter from Tae-hee enquiring after her sister arrived. At this point, Sun-woo took refuge at Chul-woong's house. Internal strife develops when a man called Jae-hyuk decides to take revenge on the sister's grandfather, who had indirectly caused his grandfather's death as a child. Shortly before the sisters are reunited, their grandfather is killed in a car accident. Chul-woong is then stabbed to death by gangsters after a reunion with Yoon-hee, who is herself kidnapped by gangsters on their wedding day. At the beginning of the drama, both sisters harbor feelings for Jae-hyuk, while he and Chul-woong both have desires on Yoon-hee, even though Jae-hyuk is engaged to Tae-hee. Seung-hee meanwhile, is keen on Chul-woong, which makes her jealous of Yoon-hee. She becomes even more jealous and spiteful when she realizes that Yoon-hee is the sister Tae-hee was looking for as she grew up in what she believed was a poor household. In the end, Yoon-hee agrees to marry Chul-woong before realizing how great his affection was for her in sacrificing his life to protect her. ==Cast== * Kim Hyun-joo as Kim Yoon-hee/Lee Sun-woo **Ha Seung-ri as young Yoon-hee * Kim Ji-ho as Kim Tae-hee **Yoo Hae Won as young Tae-hee * Han Jae-suk as Jang Jae-hyuk **Choi Woo-hyuk as young Jae-hyuk * So Ji-sub as Park Chul-woong * Kim Min-sun as Woo Seung-hee **Park Eun-bin as young Seung-hee * Kim Jung-hwa as Park Yeon-woong * Baek Il-seob as Chairman Kim Pil-joong (Tae-hee's grandfather) * Ha Jae-young as Kim Hyun Ho (Yun Hee & Tae Hee's father) * Kim Chung-ryeol as Yeon Seo-jeon (Yoon-hee & Tae-hee's cousin) **Shin Tae-hoon as young Seo-joon * Lee Hee-do as Hwang Kuk- do (Seung-hee's stepfather) * Song Ok-sook as Oh Kim-sun (Seung-hee's mother) * Kim Chung as Suh Joon's mother * Hyun Suk as Park Kwi Joong (Chairman Kim's chauffeur) * Son Young-joon as Oh Han Young (Jae Hyuk's assistant) * Lee Ki- young as Lee In Soo (Gangster leader) * Sung Dong-il as Mr. Can (Gangster leader's assistant) * Kim Hyung Jong as Soo Tak * Seo Hyun Ki ==Original soundtrack== CD 1: # Nuh Eh Ge Ro Ga Neun Gil \u2013 Kim Ji-woo # Go Baek Hal Gge \u2013 Jia # Nuh Reul Ji Kyuh Jool Gguh Ya \u2013 Lee Jong-won (CAN) # For Your Love \u2013 Jang Hye-jin # Help Me Love \u2013 Park Wan-kyu # Bi Sang Ji Ah \u2013 Park Wan-kyu # Gloomy Sunday \u2013 Jeon Seung-woo & Park Chae-won # Suh Toon Go Baek \u2013 Kim Jin- woo # Je Bal.. \u2013 Kim Jin-woo # Nuh Reul Ji Kyuh Jool Gguh Ya (Piano Version) # Mun Gil (Guitar Version) # Tears (Piano Version) # Bin Deul Eh Suh (Piano Version) # Nuh Reul Bo Naen Sae Byuk (Chorus Version) # Byul He Neun Bam (Harmonica Version) CD 2: # Nuh Wa Ham Gge (Piano Version) # Yak Sok (Piano & Guitar Version) # Pa Ran Mi So (Guitar Version) # Nae Ahn Eh Nuh (Guitar Version) # Do Shi Eh Ah Chim (Piano Version) # Uh Rin Shi Jul (Piano Version) # Mun Gil (Piano Version) # Tears (Guitar Version) # Nuh Reul Ji Kyuh Jool Gguh Ya (Violin Version) # Nuh Wa Ham Gge (Guitar Version) # Yak Sok (Piano Version) # Byul He Neun Bam (Piano Version) # Bin Deul Eh Suh (Guitar Version) # Uh Rin Shi Jul (Piano Version) # Sae Ro Oon Shi Jak (Guitar Version) # Tears (Guitar Version) # Pa Ran Mi So (Harmonica Version) # Sae Ro Oon Shi Jak (E.Guitar Version) # Uh Rin Shi Jul (Guitar Version) ==International broadcast== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
