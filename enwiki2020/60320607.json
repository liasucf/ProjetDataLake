Rennie John Thomson Rennie (1824-1878) was a Scottish ship-owner who played an important role in the South African shipping business from the mid- nineteenth century, carrying mail, cattle, and passengers. Two of his steamers were sunk in accidents not long after he received them but he continued in business with other ships. ==Early life and family== John Rennie was born in Aberdeen in 1824, the son of George Rennie who owned a shipping business.\"Rennie's Steamer Service: Natal and Cape Colonies\", R.

Rennie was destined for a maritime career from an early age, becoming joint owner with his father of the sailing vessel Sampson which was registered in his sole name when he was 21. He established his own business of John T. Rennie in Aberdeen in 1849 but subsequently moved it first to London and then to South Africa. There he transported cattle and had a contract from the Natal government to carry mail. He recognised the advantages of steam power and that coal from Natal's coal fields was cheaper than British coal. He had two steamers built by Scott & Company on the Clyde, the Madagascar, and the Waldensian. In 1858 the steamer Madagascar was lost after hitting a reef near East London.\"Loss of the Steamer Madagascar\", The Hobart Town Daily Mercury, 3 February 1859, p. 2.
