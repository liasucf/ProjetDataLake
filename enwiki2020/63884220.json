As a young man he fought against the rising Sikh power led by Maharaja Ranjit Singh. Later on, as an old man in his 70s, when the rebellion broke out against the British, he also raised a force to fight against them. ==Martyrdom== Ahmed Khan Kharal was quite successful in helping the local people and keeping them safe from British troops, keeping up a guerilla warfare against British Raj for some months. On 26 July 1857, Amo Kharal went with a force to attack the Gogera Jail (now in Sahiwal District) to release some of his companions arrested by the enemy, but was ambushed by assistant commissioner of Gogera Leopold Oliver Fitzhardinge Berkeley and their local allies. Ahmed Khan Kharal and his assistant, Sarang, were both embraced shahdat, fighting bravely. The deeds of this brave and noble warrior are still remembered and sung by Punjabi poets in dholas and vars, types of poems. ==See also== * Mai Bakhtawar * Nizam Lohar *Hemu Kalani *Kadu Makrani *Ajab Khan Afridi *Bhagat Singh *Udham Singh *Kartar Singh Sarabha ==References== Category:1785 births Category:1857 deaths Category:Punjabi people Category:Folklore Category:History of Pakistan Category:People from Faisalabad Category:Faisalabad Category:Faisalabad-related lists Faisalabad * Category:British East India Company Category:Military of British India Category:Mutinies Category:Conflicts in 1857 1857 Indian Rebellion Category:1857 in India Category:Resistance to the British Empire Category:Indian rebels ",
