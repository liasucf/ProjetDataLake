Haeundae became a division of Busan Metropolitan City in 1976 and attained the status of district in 1980. Haeundae is an affluent coastal community best known for Haeundae Beach, one of the most famous and popular beaches in South Korea, and attracts tens of thousands of tourists during summer. Haeundae is one of the wealthiest districts in South Korea, and has been subject to considerable commercial development in recent decades, including the Marine City and Centum City areas with their distinctive skyscrapers and high rise buildings. Haeundae is linked to Busan Subway Line 2 and train stations on the Donghae Nambu railway line. ==History== APEC House and Gwang-an Bridge Haeundae takes its name from the ninth century Silla scholar and poet Choi Chi-won (literary name Haeun, or \"Sea and Clouds\"), who, according to a historical account, admired the view from the beach and built a pavilion nearby. A piece of Choi's calligraphy, which he engraved on a rock at Haeundae, still exists. Haeundae used to be isolated from the large communities in Busan and Busanjin. It remained undeveloped until the late 1970s and early 1980s. A small number of luxury hotels were constructed after the 1988 Seoul Olympics.\"Famous Haeundae Beach of Busan\" Retrieved October 11, 2019 More hotels and other tourist facilities have been constructed on the beach-front area since the mid-1990s, and shopping malls and movie theatre complexes have been built in the 'centre' of Haeundae: an area between Haeundae Station and the beach. The area has continued to grow, apart from during the Asian financial crisis of 1997. Haeundae has been a regular host of the annual Busan International Film Festival (BIFF). Haeundae's Dongbaek Island was the location for the 2005 APEC Conference.

Another development project, Centum City, has been ongoing since early 2000 and is now a major feature of Busan. Its BEXCO (Busan Exhibition and Convention Center) has become a popular venue for international conventions and exhibitions. Marine City, located nearby, is constructed on land reclaimed from the sea, and has several huge, high-rise apartment blocks. Additional apartment blocks are under construction, with water resorts and related facilities, for use by the public, also planned for Marine City. ==Geography== Logo of Haeundae on the beach Haeundae Beach ===Haeundae Dalmaji Hill=== Haeundae's Dalmaji Hill is touted as one of the eight attractions of Busan, and is noted for its scenic view of the moon.\"Dalmaji-gil Road (\ud574\uc6b4\ub300 \ub2ec\ub9de\uc774\uae38)\" Retrieved October 11, 2019 Choe Chi-won (857-10th century), an official and poet from the late Unified Silla Dynasty (668-935), was so struck by its beauty that he decided to extend his stay there.

The district was the setting of the movie Haeundae, a South Korean disaster movie based on the relatively unlikely scenario of an immense tsunami hitting the city of Busan. Haeundae has been featured in numerous K-Dramas, with the beach and Dongbaekseom Island being used as a filming location for Seoul Broadcasting System's 2008 drama Star's Lover. The island was the location for the scene where Lee Ma-ri, played by Choi Ji-woo confesses her love for Kim Chul Soo, played by Yoo Ji-tae; and the couple takes a walk on the beach. In 2012, KBS2 broadcast a drama, Haeundae Lovers, using Busan and the district as a backdrop. Much of the story takes place in Cheongsapo, a coastal community in the district east of Haeundae Beach. Hauendae is home to the Busan Cinema Center, the location of the annual Busan International Film Festival, which features 5 inside theaters and 1 outside theater. == Food of Haeundae == Haeundae is also a popular culinary destination, boasting both traditional and foreign cuisines. Many restaurants sell dwaejigukbab (pork rice soup), one of Busan's signature dishes. The market has a wide array of seafood available, notably eel. Gumsu-Bukkuk, South Korea's most famous puffer fish stew restaurant, has its original location in Haeundae. Additionally, visitors can buy seafood from food trucks that line the beachfront. Haeundae has a relatively large expatriate population (in Busan) and foreign cuisines are relatively popular, including Indian, Brazilian, and American.
