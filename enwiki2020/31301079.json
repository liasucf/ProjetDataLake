It is bisected by the Lateral Road, and contains the Thrumshing La pass. ==Flora and fauna== File:Blood Pheasant Phrumsingla National Park Bhutan.jpg|flock of Blood Pheasant File:Spotted Nutcracker Phrumsengla NP Bhutan.jpg|Spotted Nutcracker Phrumsengla is a temperate park with large tracts of old-growth fir forests, its altitudes ranging from to . Phrumsengla is home to six species of threatened birds: the rufous-necked hornbill (Aceros nipalensis), rufous-throated wren-babbler (Spelaeornis caudatus), satyr tragopan (Tragopan satyra), beautiful nuthatch (Sitta formosa), Ward's trogon (Harpactes wardi) and Chestnut-breasted partridge (Arborophila mandellii), as well as the near-threatened wedge billed wren babbler (Sphenocichla humei). Phrumsengla has scenic views, including forests ranging with elevations from alpine to sub-tropical. Because the soil of Phrumsengla's biomes is particularly fragile, the land is unsuitable for logging or other development. ==Tourism== The Bhutanese Trust Fund identifies excellent tourism potential for Phrumsengla, as it is bisected by Bhutan's highest motorable road, the Lateral Road. Nearly 11,000 people live within the Phrumsengla area demonstrating, in the Trust Fund's opinion, the kingdom's \"closest success to a harmonious balance between man and nature.\" The World Wildlife Fund also maintains operations in the park. ==See also== * List of protected areas of Bhutan * Thrumshing La ==References== Category:Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests Category:National parks of Bhutan Category:Protected areas established in 1998 Category:Bumthang District Category:Lhuntse District Category:Mongar District Category:Zhemgang District Category:1998 establishments in Bhutan ",
