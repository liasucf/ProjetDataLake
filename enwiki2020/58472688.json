    "text": "Emanuel Hall (born May 21, 1997) is an American football wide receiver for the Washington Football Team of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Missouri and was signed by the Chicago Bears as an undrafted free agent in 2019. ==High School career== An extremely athletic wide out with great hands and a great vertical, his potential as a game- breaking playmaker is what caught the eye of the Missouri coaching staff. Dubbed as one of the top recruits in the state of Tennessee by Rivals, Emanuel was a Tennessee All-State selection after an outstanding senior season which included 47 receptions for 889 yards and 12 touchdowns, going for a healthy 18.9 yards per catch. He chose Missouri over offers from Louisville, Ole Miss, Mississippi State, Vanderbilt, Kentucky and Cincinnati among others. Emanuel was also an incredible track and field athlete as well, leaping has high as 6-8 in the high jump while winning the Tennessee state championship. Additionally, he won two AAU Junior Olympic track gold medals in 2011, taking first nationally in both the pentathlon and high jump. ==College career== In his first season, Hall was one of eight true freshman to see playing time. He finished the season with eight receptions for 64 yards on the season, including a long of 14 yards against Mississippi State. In 2016, he finished his sophomore season with 19 catches for 307 yards and a pair of touchdowns. He began the season grabbing his first catch in Mizzou's season opener against West Virginia. In Mizzou's home opener against Eastern Michigan, he went on to grab three more passes for 90 yards including a career long 49-yard TD reception. In career day against Delaware State, he hauled in seven receptions for 122 yards and a highlight reel touchdown during Mizzou's win over Delaware State. He finished the season catching three passes for 40 yards against Middle Tennessee, and one pass each against Kentucky and Tennessee on the road. In 2017, Hall emerged as a big-play wideout, becoming one of the nation's elite deep ball threats. He finished the season with 33 receptions for 817 yards and eight touchdowns, with six of them coming from 50 yards out or longer. His eight scores went for an average length of 49.5 yards, including scores of 20, 31, 50, 55, 56, 58, 63 and 63 yards, and his per-catch average on the year of 24.8 ranked as the best in the SEC and was second nationally among all receivers. Despite battling a hamstring injury early in the season that limited him to just five total receptions in Mizzou's first four games, but when he got healthy, he quickly made an impact, as he had consecutive highly-productive road games at Kentucky (four catches, 129 yards, one touchdown) and at Georgia (four catches, 141 yards, two touchdowns) to give the Mizzou offense a big spark. He finished the season with five games of 100 yards receiving or more, including 113 (five receptions) against Florida, 111 yards and two scores (on just two catches) at Arkansas and 102 yards and two scores (five catches) versus Tennessee. Led all SEC players in league games only with his seven touchdowns, while his 82.8 yards per game in receiving yards during league play ranked as second-best. In his final season with Mizzou, Hall faced the most adversity of his career, losing his father unexpectedly early in the season and battling a lingering groin injury. He started the season posting back-to-back games of 170+ receiving yards to open the season, becoming the first Tiger to do so since Danario Alexander in 2009. Hall had 171 yards on just four catches with a season-high two touchdowns in the season-opener vs. UT Martin, and hauled in 10 more catches against Wyoming, totaling another 171 yards and a touchdown. Battled through a groin injury to catch four passes for 88 yards at Purdue, including a 26-yard strike in the fourth quarter that set up the game-winning score. Hall finished his career at Mizzou in the Liberty Bowl where he had 72 yards on two catches, putting him over 2,000 receiving yards in his career. He became the 10th Mizzou pass catcher to haul in more than 2,000 career yards. ===Statistics=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Year !! Games !! Rec !! Yards !! Avg. !!
