    "text": "alt=Desmond Haynes A cricketer scoring a century (100 runs or more) on their One Day International (ODIs) debut is regarded by critics as a significant achievement. As of March 2019, 15 players from 9 different international teams have accomplished this feat. Players representing eight of the twelve teams that have full member status have scored an ODI century on debut. England's Dennis Amiss was the first debutant to score a century in ODIs; he scored 103 runs off 134 balls against Australia during the first match of the Prudential Trophy in 1972. His total was surpassed by Desmond Haynes of West Indies when he made 148 against Australia in 1978. As of 2019, this remains the highest individual score by a debutant in ODIs. In a 1992 World Cup game against Sri Lanka, Andy Flower made 115 not out while making his first ODI appearance, representing Zimbabwe. It remains the only World Cup century by a debutant as of the 2015 tournament. In September 1995, Pakistan's Saleem Elahi set a record for becoming the youngest player to achieve the feat; aged 18, he was yet to play first-class cricket then. Between 1972 and 1995 only four players had scored a century on their ODI debut. However, since 2009, eleven players have achieved the feat. South African Reeza Hendricks holds the record of fastest century by a batsman on ODI debut (88 balls). Of the 15 occasions a cricketer has scored a century on ODI debut, their team has lost only 3 times. ==Key== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |+ Key for the centuries table |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:75px\" | Symbol ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:500px\" | Meaning |- ! scope=\"row\" | Runs | Number of runs scored |- ! scope=\"row\" | * | Batsman remained not out |- ! scope=\"row\" | | Batsman was awarded the man of the match title |- ! scope=\"row\" | S/R | Strike rate of the batsman (runs scored per 100 balls) |- ! scope=\"row\"| Inn. | Innings of the match in which the batsman scored his century |- ! scope=\"row\" | No result | The match had no result |} ==One Day International centuries on debut== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |+ One Day International centuries on debut |- ! scope=\"col\" | \u2116 ! scope=\"col\" | Batsman ! scope=\"col\" | Runs ! scope=\"col\" | S/R ! scope=\"col\" | Inn. ! scope=\"col\" | For ! scope=\"col\" | Against ! scope=\"col\" | Venue ! scope=\"col\" | Date ! scope=\"col\" | Result |-Abid Ali Pakistan || 1 ! scope=\"row\" | || || 76.86 || 2 || || || Old Trafford, Manchester, England || || Won |- || 2 ! scope=\"row\" | || || 108.82 || 2 || || || Antigua Recreation Ground, St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda || || Won |- || 3 ! scope=\"row\" | || || 75.65 || 1 || || || Pukekura Park, New Plymouth, New Zealand || || Lost |- || 4 ! scope=\"row\" | || || 76.69 || 2 || || || Jinnah Stadium, Gujranwala, Pakistan || || Won |- || 5 ! scope=\"row\" | || || 90.37 || 1 || || || Eden Park, Auckland, New Zealand || || |- || 6 ! scope=\"row\" | || || 98.41 || 1 || || || Chevrolet Park, Bloemfontein, South Africa || || Won |- || 7 ! scope=\"row\" | || || 82.44 || 2 || || || Harare Sports Club, Harare, Zimbabwe || || Won |- || 8 ! scope=\"row\" | || || 86.82 || 1 || || || Melbourne Cricket Ground, Melbourne, Australia || || Won |- || 9 ! scope=\"row\" | || || 90.59 || 2 || || || Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, North Sound, Antigua and Barbuda || || Lost |- || 10 ! scope=\"row\" | || || 106.89 || 1 || || || ICC Academy Ground, Dubai, UAE || || Won |- || 11 ! scope=\"row\" | || || 86.95 || 2 || || || Harare Sports Club, Harare, Zimbabwe || || Won |- || 12 ! scope=\"row\" | || || 91.86 || 1 || || || Willowmoore Park, Benoni, South Africa || || Won |- || 13 ! scope=\"row\" | || || 80.00 || 2 || || || Sheikh Zayed Cricket Stadium, Abu Dhabi, UAE || || Won |- || 14 ! scope=\"row\" | || || 114.60 || 1 || || || Pallekele International Cricket Stadium, Kandy, Sri Lanka || || Won |- || 15 ! scope=\"row\" | || || 94.11 || 2 || || || Dubai Cricket Stadium, Dubai, UAE || || Lost |} ==Footnotes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * One Day International debut * ",
