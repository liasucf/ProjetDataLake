She joined the team at the Bland-Sutton Institute of Pathology in 1963. Barr graduated from the University of London in 1966 with a Ph.D. She then moved to Melbourne, Australia to continue her career and begin a family.

Barr was instrumental in the discovery of the Epstein-Barr virus, also called human herpesvirus 4, by preparing the samples used for experimentation. == Personal life == Upon moving to Melbourne, she met and married Stuart Balding and had two children. Barr died in Melbourne, Australia at the age of 83. == External links == * Yvonne Barr's video greeting at the EBV 50th anniversary conference in 2014 == References == Category:1932 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Alumni of the University of London Category:British virologists Category:Women virologists Category:20th-century British women scientists Category:British women biologists Category:20th-century British biologists Category:British emigrants to Australia Category:Australian virologists ",
