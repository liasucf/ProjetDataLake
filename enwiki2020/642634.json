The Urban Redevelopment Authority envisaged the introduction of more homes of various types to the area, particularly in the Downtown Core which has been overwhelmingly commercial for the past decades. Supporting institutions and transport networks were upgraded or introduced to cater to the rising resident population in the area. In terms of business, the New Downtown@Marina Bay was developed into an extension of the existing central business district. To encourage greater land-use flexibility, new business zones and white zones were also introduced. Business and research activities were promoted at the new one-north and medical park within the grounds of the Singapore General Hospital at Outram Park. For recreation, plans were made to further extend the park connectors to new and existing parks in the region. New sporting facilities were also introduced, such as the redevelopment of the Kallang Sports Hub. ==Geography== With a land area of , the Central Region is situated on the southern part of Singapore Island, constituting a total of 21 planning areas.
