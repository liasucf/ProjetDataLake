    "text": "Pringle v Government of Ireland (2012) C\u2011370/12 is an EU law case, which held the European Stability Mechanism was lawful. ==Facts== Thomas Pringle, an anti-austerity Independent MP (Teachta D\u00e1la) in Ireland, claimed that the European Stability Mechanism was unlawful, because it exceeded the EU\u2019s exclusive competence for monetary policy, and went beyond the TFEU powers. The ESM was created by Commission Decision 2011/199, adopted under TEU art 48(6) in a simplified Treaty revision procedure. It added TFEU art 136(3), to allow member states to safeguard the Euro\u2019s stability. On 27 September 2012, member states created a \u20ac500bn fund to lend to Eurozone member countries (replacing the European Financial Stability Facility and European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism). Member states could get money if they signed a \u2018Memorandum of Understanding\u2019. ==Judgment== ===Irish Supreme Court=== The Irish Supreme Court made a reference for preliminary ruling to the CJEU. It asked whether the simplified revision procedure could be used, if the principles of effective judicial protection and legal certainty prevented the ESM Treaty. ===European Court of Justice=== The CJEU held that the European Stability Mechanism was lawful. ==See also== *United Kingdom enterprise law ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== *Case summary Category:United Kingdom enterprise case law Category:Court of Justice of the European Union case law ",
