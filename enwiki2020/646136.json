Re-elected to Congress, Carri\u00f3 earned growing publicity as the chair of the Congressional Committee on Corruption and Money Laundering after 1999, particularly during a series of exchanged accusations in 2001 between herself and Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo.Parlamentario: Sigue el contrapunto Carri\u00f3-Cavallo After the rupture in 2000 of the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education (which the UCR had formed in 1997 with Socialists and the Front for a Country in Solidarity), Carri\u00f3 turned to the Democratic Socialist Party and other politicians with leftist leanings who were discontented in their parties, and formed an informal front, initially called \"Argentinians for a Republic of Equals\" (Argentinos por una Rep\u00fablica de Iguales), ARI. After dissensions, the socialists left, and so did Carri\u00f3 and other figures from their original parties. Together, they formed a new party, called Alternative for a Republic of Equals (also Civic Coalition ARI), in 2002. In the 2003 elections, Carri\u00f3 ran for president with Mendoza deputy Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez as the candidate for the Civic Coalition ARI party. Prior to running together, she had worked with him in the 2001 Money Laundering Investigation Commission (Spanish: Comisi\u00f3n investigadora de lavado de dinero). They ended up in the forth place with about 16% of the votes, behind former president Carlos Menem, would-be president N\u00e9stor Kirchner, and minister of economy Ricardo L\u00f3pez Murphy. After losing the election, she worked on securing the Civic Coalition ARI, which went through a major crisis during the 2003-07 Kirchner presidency, with members unable to settle their differences and several deputies leaving for the National Government. She returned to the Lower House of Congress in 2005, after winning a seat as a National Deputy for the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires with just over 20% of votes. Carri\u00f3 ran again for the Presidency on the 2007 elections, representing a front called the Civic Coalition.Coalici\u00f3n C\u00edvica (official website).

Together with her running mate Rub\u00e9n Giustiniani (chairman of the Socialist Party), Carri\u00f3 obtained about 23% of the vote, coming in a distant second after first lady Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner. She won a majority in two of the three largest cities of Argentina (Buenos Aires and Rosario), but she suffered a larger defeat in Buenos Aires Province, the most populous district. Ultimately, Carri\u00f3 lost to Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, and came up well short of forcing her into a ballotage.Clar\u00edn, 29 October 2007. Cristina Kirchner conserva casi 22 puntos de diferencia sobre Carri\u00f3. In Argentina, a presidential candidate can win an outright victory by either winning at least 45 percent of the vote, or 40 to 44 percent of the vote while finishing at least 10 points ahead of the runner- up. Following the 2007 election, Carri\u00f3 announced she would not be running for the presidency again, declaring that she would instead enhance her role as \"leader of the opposition\" and seek to become a member of or influence in a future administration following the 2011 elections.La Capital, 30 October 2007.

She was reunited ahead of the June 2009 mid-term elections with erstwhile allies, the UCR and Socialists, in the Civic and Social Agreement. This coalition yielded gains only for the UCR, however, and Carri\u00f3's reduced influence therein ended in her acrimonious departure from the group in August 2010. She later reconsidered her earlier decision to opt out of the 2011 presidential race, and on December 12, 2010, she announced her candidacy on the Civic Coalition/ARI ticket.de Prensa / Gacetillas Elisa Carri\u00f3: Se lanz\u00f3 la candidatura de Carri\u00f3-P\u00e9rez Carri\u00f3 received 1.8% of the vote in the 23 October election, placing last in a field of seven candidates. Carri\u00f3 joined the Broad Front UNEN alliance upon its formation in June 2013, and was reelected to the Lower House on their ticket in elections that October. Her desire to fold UNEN into a coalition led by the PRO party, led to her break with UNEN in November 2014. The UCR also left the coalition and joined the PRO as well.
