    "text": "Louis Christophe Auguste Allmer (8 July 1815 \u2013 27 November 1899) was a 19th- century French historian and epigrapher. He contributed with Paul Dissard to change a fledgling science by confronting archaeological evidence and providing a reference documentation. == Biography == Like his father, he became tax collector in 1835 for the Ministry of Finance, among others in Saint-Priest (Rh\u00f4ne). Then, when he retired in 1868, he devoted himself to epigraphy and archeology. He was particularly interested in Roman remains unearthed by the drilling of the PLM line in Lyon. In his time he was one of the leading specialists of Latin epigraphy, in the tradition of a L\u00e9on Renier. On 2 April 1875, he was made a chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur as author of significant work in the field of archeology. From 1876, he became correspondent member of the Acad\u00e9mie des inscriptions et belles-lettres. Two years later, the city of Lyon appointed him a curator of its museums of epigraphy, numismatics and sigillography. == Main publications == Extract from the Catalogue sommaire des mus\u00e9es de la ville de Lyon (1887), drawing by Adrien Allmer. *1858: Sur quelques inscriptions antiques, *1875: (u/dir.)
