After making his Bay Area broadcast debut as \"The All-Night Mayor\" on KGO, he moved to afternoons on KSFO in 1960. ==Game shows== Lange's network television career began in San Francisco with The Ford Show in 1962, where he was the announcer for, and sidekick to, host Tennessee Ernie Ford. Three years later he would sign on to host The Dating Game (1965-1980). While still on-air at KSFO, he commuted to Los Angeles to tape the TV program. His other game shows included Oh My Word (1965\u20131969),https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/zZ0AAOxy0QtR~vuP/s-l1600.jpg $100,000 Name That Tune (1984\u20131985), The $1,000,000 Chance of a Lifetime, Bowling for Dollars (1976-1977 Los Angeles / Orange County Version), Hollywood Connection, Bullseye (1980\u20131982) and the ABC version of The New Newlywed Game (February 13-17, 1984), as well as short-lived shows including, Spin-Off (1975), Triple Threat (1988-1989) and Give-n-Take (1975).

He appeared as a celebrity player on Scrabble during their 1988 \"Game Show Host Week\", and on Hollywood Squares for their \"Game Show Week\" in December 2002. ==Later work and death== Lange was introduced to Los Angeles local audiences on KMPC in 1970, in order to limit his commute while taping The Dating Game. He returned to Gene Autry/Golden West-owned KSFO by 1971 and remained there until the station was sold in 1983. He then returned to KMPC, where he did mornings and afternoons (at different times) until the end of the decade. In the early 1990s, Lange returned to full-time radio in the Bay Area. During that period he initially worked afternoons on 610/KFRC. He eventually accepted an offer to broadcast weekday mornings on \"Magic 61,\" by then owned by real estate magnate Peter Bedford (Bedford Broadcasting). Magic 61 was formatted as \"American pop standards\" (Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Johnny Mathis, Harry Connick, Jr., Peggy Lee, Ella Fitzgerald, et al.). After the sale of KFRC AM and FM (99.7) (the new owners decided to simulcast the FM \"oldies\" format on 610 AM), Jim and the show decamped for a run on KKSJ, San Jose. In 1997, Lange became morning host of The Lange Gang on KABL in San Francisco. Lange retired in 2005 after KABL went off the air. He also appeared as himself in the critically acclaimed 2002 film Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. In later years, he lived in Marin County, California, with his wife, Michigan native Nancy Fleming, former Miss America 1961, whom he married in 1978.\"Jim and Nancy Lange\", Marin Magazine, February 2008. Lange died of a heart attack at their home in Mill Valley, California on February 25, 2014. He was 81. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1932 births Category:2014 deaths Category:American game show hosts Category:American radio personalities Category:Disease-related deaths in California Category:People from Mill Valley, California Category:People from Saint Paul, Minnesota Category:University of Minnesota alumni ",
