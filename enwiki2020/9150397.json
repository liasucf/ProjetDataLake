    "text": "Ingjaldr HelgasonIn some sources his father's name is given as Olaf. In Laxd\u00e6la saga his father's name is given as \"King Frodi the Valiant, who was slain by Jarl Sverting and his sons.\" was a Hiberno-Norse chieftain of the 9th Century. According to the Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k Ingjald was the son of Helgi, the son of Olaf, the son of Gudrod, the son of Halfdan Hvitbeinn; he was thus distantly related to the Yngling kings of Vestfold and later Norway. According to Eyrbyggja saga, Ingjald's mother was Thora, a daughter of Sigurd Snake-in-the- Eye, who was a son of Ragnar Lodbrok. However, this connection is dubious, as Ingjald appears to have been born in the early 9th Century \u2013 either before or at around the same time as Ragnar. Ingjald had at least one son, Olaf the White, who became King of Dublin. ==Notes== ==References== Forte, Angelo, Richard Oram and Frederik Pedersen. Viking Empires.
