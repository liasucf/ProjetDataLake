    "text": "The Texas lyre snake (Trimorphodon vilkinsonii) is a species of mildly venomous rear-fanged snake in the family Colubridae. The species is endemic to the southwestern United States and adjacent northern Mexico. ==Etymology== The epithet vilkinsonii is in honor of amateur American naturalist Edward Wilkinson, who collected the first specimen near the city of Chihuahua.Beltz, Ellin (2006). Scientific and Common Names of the Reptiles and Amphibians of North America \u2013 Explained.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Trimorphodon vilkinsonii, p. 286). ==Geographic range== T. vilkinsonii is found in the United States in the Big Bend region of Texas and southern New Mexico, and in Mexico in northeastern Chihuahua. ==Description== The Texas lyre snake is a medium-sized snake, attaining a total length (including tail) of approximately 1 meter (39 inches) at adult size.Wright, A.H., and A.A. Wright (1957). Handbook of Snakes of the United States and Canada. Ithaca and London: Comstock. 1,105 pp. (in 2 volumes). (Trimorphodon vilkinsoni, pp. 876-879, Figure 251 + Map 61 on p. 869). It is brown, tan or gray with 17-24 dark brown blotches down the back. It has large eyes with vertical pupils. The common name, \"lyre snake\", refers to a distinctive V-shaped pattern on the head which resembles the shape of a lyre. However, this particular subspecies (T. b. vilkinsonii ) has no V mark on the head.Smith, H.M., and E.D. Brodie, Jr. (1982). Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification. New York: Golden Press. 240 pp. (paperback), (hardcover). (Trimorphodon biscutatus vilkinsoni, pp. 176-177). ==Behavior== Lyre snakes are nocturnal, spending most of their time hiding in rock crevices, emerging to feed mainly on lizards,Schmidt, K.P., and D.D. Davis (1941). Field Book of Snakes of the United States and Canada. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons. 365 pp. (Trimorphodon vilkinsonii, pp. 264-265). and also on small rodents, frogs, bats and birds.Conant, Roger (1975). A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. xviii + 429 pp. + Plates 1-48. (hardcover), (paperback). (Trimorphodon biscutatus vilkinsoni, pp. 218-219 + Plate 32 + Map 171). Their venom is not considered to be harmful to humans. Also, if their venom is not fatal to their prey, they may kill by constriction.Rodman, G.B. (1939). \"Habits of Trimorphodon vandenburghi in Captivity\". Copeia 1939: 50. ==Conservation== The Texas lyre snake was formerly listed as Threatened in Texas, but was removed from the list in 2020. This species is secretive and often difficult to find, but is seemingly common throughout its habitat, much of which is in protected or private land. ==Reproduction== Lyre snakes are oviparous, laying about a dozen eggs per clutch. ==References== ==External links== * *NatureServe Explorer Comprehensive Species Report: Trimorphodon biscutatus ==Further reading== *Cope, E.D.
