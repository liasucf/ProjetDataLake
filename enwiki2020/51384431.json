    "text": "In organic chemistry, octatetraene is a linear hydrocarbon consisting of a chain of eight carbon atoms linked by an alternating double-bond/single-bond pattern. The central two of the four alkene units can exhibit cis\u2013trans isomerism, resulting in a total of three different isomers. The compounds are not in general of much commercial significance, but the octatetraene group has been studied in contexts in the physical chemistry of bonds, some aspect of which have relevance to cell membranes and some to the retinal chemistry of vision. The high degrees of symmetries and conjugation of bonds offer unusual aspects for study. Related structures occur in some molecules of biological importance, for example \u03b1-parinaric acid and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Derivatives include cyclic octatetraenes, such as cyclooctatetraene and 1,8-diphenyl-1,3,5,7-octatraene, some of which are of interest in special contexts. ==References== Category:Polyenes ",
