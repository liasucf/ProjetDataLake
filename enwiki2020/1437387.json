    "text": "Stephen Clarke (born 29 August 1963) is a Scottish professional football manager and former player who is the manager of the Scotland national team. Clarke played for St Mirren, Chelsea and the Scotland national team, winning three major trophies with Chelsea towards the end of his career. After retiring as a player, he moved into coaching and worked at Newcastle United, Chelsea, West Ham United and Liverpool. Clarke has since managed West Bromwich Albion and Reading. After a spell coaching at Aston Villa, Clarke was appointed Kilmarnock manager in October 2017. In May 2019, he was appointed manager of the Scottish national team. ==Playing career== ===St Mirren=== Clarke was born in Saltcoats in Ayrshire. His older brother Paul was a footballer, who played in more than 350 games for Kilmarnock. Spotted while playing for Beith Juniors, Steve began his professional career with St Mirren. Clarke was initially on a part-time contract with St Mirren, while he completed an apprenticeship as an instrument engineer. ===Chelsea=== Clarke was transferred to Chelsea for \u00a3422,000 in February 1987. He stayed at Chelsea until 1998, making 421 appearances. He was a part of the Chelsea sides which won the 1997 FA Cup Final, 1998 Football League Cup Final and 1998 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final. The latter match, against VfB Stuttgart in Stockholm, was Clarke's final appearance for the club. In 2005, he was voted into Chelsea's centenary XI, occupying the right-back berth. Speaking in February 2019, Clarke said he was thankful that Chelsea had signed him as it meant that he and his family no longer had to live with religious sectarianism in the west of Scotland. ===Scotland=== Clarke made six appearances for the Scotland national team. His debut was a 2\u20130 friendly win over Hungary at Hampden Park on 9 September 1987, and his final game was a 3\u20131 friendly loss away to the Netherlands in Utrecht six years later on 27 May 1994. ==Coaching career== ===Newcastle United=== In 1998, Clarke joined Newcastle United as assistant manager to Ruud Gullit, his former manager at Chelsea. Clarke was part of the coaching team with Gullit, which helped Newcastle reach the 1999 FA Cup Final on 22 May 1999, where Newcastle finished runners up to Manchester United after goals from Teddy Sheringham and Paul Scholes in a 2\u20130 defeat. Clarke was caretaker manager following Gullit's resignation, taking charge of one match, a 5\u20131 defeat against Manchester United. For that match, Clarke reinstated Alan Shearer and Rob Lee to the team. ===Chelsea=== Clarke as assistant manager of Chelsea in 2007 After a stint in charge of the youth teams at Chelsea, Clarke was promoted to the position of assistant manager when Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was appointed manager in the summer of 2004. Clarke was a part of the coaching set-up which saw Chelsea win two FA Premier League titles, an FA Cup and two League Cups over three seasons under Mourinho. During this period, Clarke completed his UEFA Pro Licence in 2006. When Mourinho left Chelsea in September 2007, Clarke's services were retained by Avram Grant, although Henk ten Cate was brought in as another assistant coach. Both Grant and ten Cate left the club at the end of the 2007\u201308 season. BBC Sport and The Times both reported then that although Clarke remained on the Chelsea coaching staff, he would be looking to pursue opportunities to become a manager in his own right. Chelsea assured Clarke of his status, citing his loyalty, popularity amongst the club's supporters and work in the aftermath of Mourinho's departure. ===West Ham United=== On 12 September 2008, Clarke handed in his resignation to Chelsea, hoping to move to West Ham United to be assistant to former Chelsea teammate Gianfranco Zola. Chelsea initially rejected his resignation, demanding compensation worth two years of Clarke's salary. After a deal was agreed between the clubs, Clarke became West Ham's first-team coach on 15 September. West Ham finished ninth in the Premier League in the 2008\u201309 season, earning Clarke and Zola extended contracts that made Clarke the highest paid assistant manager in the league. The club struggled during the next season, however, narrowly avoiding relegation. In June 2010, not long after the dismissal of Zola as manager, Clarke left the club by mutual consent. ===Liverpool=== On 10 January 2011, Clarke was appointed first-team coach at Liverpool by Kenny Dalglish, after Dalglish had replaced the dismissed Roy Hodgson two days before. Clarke was credited (alongside Dalglish) for turning Liverpool's season around, having a points average of around two points per match from his arrival, coupled with an improved defensive record. On 12 May 2011, Clarke, as well as manager Dalglish, signed a three-year contract to remain in his current role as first team coach. On 14 May 2012, Clarke offered his resignation to Liverpool following the sacking of manager Dalglish and Liverpool's eighth-place finish in the 2011\u201312 Premier League. The club declined the offer, but on 6 June 2012, following the appointment of new manager Brendan Rodgers, Clarke left the club. Clarke himself said that Liverpool sacked him. ===West Bromwich Albion=== On 8 June 2012, Clarke was appointed manager of West Bromwich Albion and signed a two- year contract. The job was Clarke's first permanent management role for any club, though during his time the club referred to him as \"head coach\". ====2012\u201313 season==== Albion began the Clarke era with a 3\u20130 home win against Liverpool on the opening day of the 2012\u201313 Premier League season. Clarke then followed that result up with a 1\u20131 away draw against Tottenham Hotspur, and a 2\u20130 win at home to Everton. Clarke suffered his first competitive defeat away at Fulham, but West Brom soon jumped back with 1\u20130 home victory over Reading. In November, the club won four consecutive matches in a row for the first time since 1980, defeating Southampton, Wigan Athletic, Chelsea and Sunderland. Clarke was named Premier League manager of the month for November 2012. Although the team would go on to lose their next three matches, Clarke's team would bounce back with a draw at home to West Ham and a 2\u20131 win over Norwich City. By Christmas 2012, West Brom were seventh in the table with 30 points, behind teams like Arsenal and Spurs only on goal difference. During the January transfer window, Clarke encountered some problems with want-away Nigerian Striker Peter Odemwingie, who desired a move to Queens Park Rangers, but West Brom refused to sell. Odemwingie was ultimately never sold and was later given time off following the transfer window saga. It was during this January period that the club struggled to emulate their early season form. Following a poor run of results which saw West Brom fail to win in six consecutive games, Clarke oversaw a 2\u20130 victory against Liverpool at Anfield, the club's first win since Boxing Day against QPR. West Brom won 3\u20130 at Southampton on 27 April, which was their 14th win of the season. This set club records for wins (14) and points (48) in a Premier League season. West Brom ended the season in style with a dramatic 5\u20135 draw with Manchester United, in what was Sir Alex Ferguson's final match as manager. The draw saw West Brom finish 8th in the table, their best finish since 1981. ====2013\u201314 season==== Clarke and West Brom returned for the new season with a 1\u20130 home loss to Southampton at The Hawthorns following a 90th-minute Rickie Lambert penalty. The team initially struggled to score goals, eventually recording their first league goal the fourth game of the new season when Gareth McAuley scored an injury time header in a 1\u20131 result against Fulham. 28 September 2013 saw them secure an historic 2\u20131 victory against league champions, Manchester United, their first win at Old Trafford in 35 years. Under his managership, however, they won only one further game, a 2\u20130 home defeat of Crystal Palace on 2 November 2013. On 9 November, West Brom were minutes away from securing a historic win at Stamford Bridge that would have ended Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's undefeated home record, but a controversial penalty decision ensured that the game ended 2\u20132. A further draw and four straight defeats followed and on 14 December 2013 Clarke was placed on gardening leave until May 2014, after a 1\u20130 loss at Cardiff City. This defeat had left the club two points above the relegation zone in 16th place. They had won 9 of the previous 41 Premier League matches. ===Reading=== On 16 December 2014, Clarke was appointed manager of Reading on a two-and-a-half-year deal, succeeding Nigel Adkins. On 16 March 2015, Clarke managed Reading to a 3\u20130 win against Bradford City in the FA Cup to reach their first semi-final for 88 years. In November 2015, Clarke was approached by Fulham to become their manager. Reading gave Clarke permission to speak to Fulham, but following the discussion he decided against taking the position. Clarke was sacked by Reading on 4 December 2015 after one year in charge. ===Aston Villa=== Clarke was hired by Aston Villa on 2 June 2016 to be their assistant manager, working alongside former Chelsea teammate Roberto Di Matteo. He was not retained following the appointment of Steve Bruce in October 2016. ===Kilmarnock=== After a year out of football, Clarke was appointed manager of Scottish Premiership club Kilmarnock on 14 October 2017. Kilmarnock was the club that Clarke had supported as a child. When he took over as manager, the club sat bottom of the league table. His first game as Kilmarnock manager, which was his first involvement in a Scottish club match for 30 years, ended in a 1\u20131 draw at Rangers. Three days later, Clarke's Kilmarnock side traveled to Celtic and once again gained a credible 1\u20131 draw. Following the league's winter break, Kilmarnock recorded a home victory over champions Celtic, with Youssouf Mulumbu scoring the only goal to inflict what was only the second domestic defeat on then Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers. Kilmarnock finished in fifth place, setting a new club record points tally of 59 in the process. Clarke was named the SFWA Manager of the Year for 2017\u201318. Clarke continued his impressive work the next season, culminating in a third- place finish and European qualification for Kilmarnock. He also won both manager of the year awards, from PFA Scotland and the SFWA. Clarke left Kilmarnock immediately after the league season ended to take the manager position with the Scotland national team. ===Scotland=== In May 2019, Clarke was appointed manager of the Scotland national team on a contract due to run until the end of 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification. On his debut on 8 June, the Scots won 2\u20131 at home to Cyprus in UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying. The team then suffered four consecutive defeats against Belgium and Russia, two of them by 4\u20130 margins, which ended any hope of qualifying automatically for Euro 2020. ==Career statistics== ===International=== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by national team and year |- !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"8\"|Scotland |1987||3||0 |- |1988||2||0 |- |1989||colspan=2|\u2014 |- |1990||colspan=2|\u2014 |- |1991||colspan=2|\u2014 |- |1992||colspan=2|\u2014 |- |1993||colspan=2|\u2014 |- |1994||1||0 |- !colspan=2|Total!!6!!0 |} ===Managerial record=== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Managerial record by team and tenure |- !rowspan=2|Team !rowspan=2|From !rowspan=2|To !colspan=5|Record !rowspan=2| |- !!!!!!!!! |- |align=left|Newcastle United (caretaker) |align=left|28 August 1999 |align=left|2 September 1999 | |- |align=left|West Bromwich Albion |align=left|8 June 2012 |align=left|14 December 2013 | |- |align=left|Reading |align=left|16 December 2014 |align=left|4 December 2015 | |- |align=left|Aston Villa (caretaker) |align=left|3 October 2016 |align=left|12 October 2016 | |- |align=left|Kilmarnock |align=left|14 October 2017 |align=left|20 May 2019 | |- |align=left|Scotland |align=left|20 May 2019 |align=left|Present |Managers: Steve Clarke, Soccerbase |- !colspan=3|Total ! |} ==Honours== ===Player=== Chelsea *FA Cup: 1996\u201397 *Football League Cup: 1997\u201398 *UEFA Cup Winners' Cup: 1997\u201398 Individual *Chelsea Player of the Year: 1993\u201394 *Chelsea Centenary XI: 2004\u201305 ===Manager=== Individual *SFWA Manager of the Year: 2017\u201318,https://www.footballscotland.co.uk/spfl/scottish- premiership/rangers-celtics-bosses-cant-contention-16044493 2018\u201319https://www.scottishfwa.com/manager-of-the-year *PFA Scotland Manager of the Year: 2018\u201319 *SPFL Premiership Manager of the Year: 2018\u201319 *Premier League Manager of the Month: November 2012 *Scottish Premiership Manager of the Month: December 2017, February 2018, March 2018 ==References== ==External links== * * * * (player profile) *Steve Clarke at the Scottish Football Association (manager profile) Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:People from Saltcoats Category:Sportspeople from North Ayrshire Category:Scottish footballers Category:Scotland under-21 international footballers Category:Scotland B international footballers Category:Scotland international footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Beith Juniors F.C. players Category:St Mirren F.C. players Category:Chelsea F.C. players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:Scottish football managers Category:Newcastle United F.C. managers Category:West Bromwich Albion F.C. managers Category:Reading F.C. managers Category:Aston Villa F.C. managers Category:Kilmarnock F.C. managers Category:Premier League managers Category:English Football League managers Category:Scottish Professional Football League managers Category:Newcastle United F.C. non-playing staff Category:Chelsea F.C. non-playing staff Category:West Ham United F.C. non-playing staff Category:Liverpool F.C. non- playing staff Category:Aston Villa F.C. non-playing staff Category:Scottish Junior Football Association players Category:Scotland national football team managers ",
