    "text": "Time Fades Away is a 1973 live album by Canadian / American musician Neil Young. Consisting of previously unreleased material, it was recorded with The Stray Gators on the support tour following 1972's highly successful Harvest. Due to Young's dissatisfaction with the tour, it was omitted from his catalogue and not released on CD until 2017. Nevertheless, Time Fades Away received much critical praise and was widely pirated after lapsing out of print because of the ensuing demand from fans. It was initially reissued on vinyl only as part of the Official Release Series Discs 5-8 Vinyl Box Set for Record Store Day in 2014. The album finally saw an official CD release in August 2017 as part of the CD version of the boxset. It was also made available as a digital download for purchase through the PonoMusicWorld website (closed), the iTunes store and Qobuz. In 2020 it is available on streaming platforms such as Spotify, Deezer and Apple Music. ==History== Though \"Love in Mind\" dates from a 1971 solo tour, all other songs on the album are from the Harvest tour in early 1973. The program featured an acoustic solo set followed by an electric set with The Stray Gators. Longtime collaborator and former Crazy Horse guitarist Danny Whitten had been set to join the Gators as a second guitarist before being sent home from rehearsals after it became evident that he was in no condition to embark on the rigorous tour. He succumbed to a fatal combination of Valium and alcohol on the night following his dismissal.Michael St. John. Downtown: The Danny Whitten Story. Self-published 2012. Unlike Young's previous ensembles, The Stray Gators consisted of notable Nashville and Los Angeles session musicians; keyboardist Jack Nitzsche was the only member of the group who had worked with Young prior to Harvest. During the rehearsals, drummer Kenneth Buttrey demanded a salary of $100,000 (roughly $571,000 in 2017) to compensate for lost session work, leading Nitzsche (with support from Tim Drummond) to prevail upon the singer to extend this salary to the other band members. Although Young reluctantly acquiesced, Nitzsche would later reflect that \"Neil got so pissed off ... I don't think things ever recovered after that.\" In the wake of the relatively dulcet Harvest, audiences did not always react positively to the new songs, many of which were emblematic of the Gators' raucous and heavily electrified live sound. Struggling to cope with Whitten's death, Young lambasted band members' performances following concerts and scheduled soundchecks that were often cancelled on short notice. Such behavior frustrated Buttrey, who left the band and was immediately replaced by former Turtles/Jefferson Airplane percussionist Johnny Barbata. Having previously stepped in to replace Dallas Taylor on Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's 1970 tour, Barbata ultimately performed on all of the Stray Gators selections on the album. At the instigation of Drummond, Young also developed a penchant for tequila, with the singer later remarking that \"it does something else to me than alcohol usually does.\" Other band members performed erratically: according to producer Elliot Mazer, Jack Nitzsche would often spew obscenities into his switched-off vocal microphone, while pedal steel/dobro player Ben Keith was so inebriated at one soundcheck that he could not recall the key of \"Don't Be Denied\", a song slated for the album. Following the loss of a pickup on his signature Old Black (a heavily modified 1953 Gibson Les Paul Goldtop), Young switched to a Gibson Flying V; according to Young, the guitar \"wouldn't stay in tune\" and had other problems. Biographer Jimmy McDonough has characterized Young's performances on the instrument as \"the worst guitar playing of his career.\" Alcohol abuse and strained singing would lead the singer to develop a throat infection in the final days of the tour. In a partial reunion of CSNY, Young hired David Crosby and Graham Nash to augment the harmonies and play rhythm guitar. Despite their integration, the band's repertoire remained confined to Young originals. Moreover, clashes among The Stray Gators continued, with Nitzsche complaining that he couldn't hear himself playing because Crosby's 12-string electric guitar overpowered the sound mix. Following sixty-two concerts over three months, the tour ended at the Salt Palace in Salt Lake City on April 3, 1973. ==Recording== Time Fades Away was recorded directly from the soundboard to 16-track and mixed simultaneous to LP cutting using the Quad-Eight Compumix. While no master tape was created in the traditional sense, stereo tapes were in fact created while cutting to enable future remastering. ==Release== Time Fades Away was released on October 15, 1973. The album reached #22 on the Billboard Charts, and quickly achieved gold status, selling over 1 million copies in both the US and UK. It was issued on vinyl, cassette and 8-track. The album's title track was briefly released as a single, with the B-side of \"Last Trip to Tulsa\", a live version of the song also taken from the Time Fades Away tour and unavailable anywhere else. ==Legacy== Cameron Crowe pays homage to both the album itself and the Joel Bernstein album cover photograph in his movie Almost Famous. In great detail, as the lights go down during Stillwater's first concert performance of the movie, the short scene recreates the cover, from the raised hand of the concert-goer, to the solitary rose at the edge of the stage. ==Reception== Upon its release, Time Fades Away received positive reviews from Rolling Stone,Rolling Stone article: \"1/time_fades_away Neil Young: Time Fades Away: Music Reviews.\" The New York Times, and Robert Christgau of The Village Voice.Robert Christgau's official website: \"Neil Young reviews.\" In more recent years, it has been rated highly by AllMusic,AllMusic article: \"[ Time Fades Away: Overview].\" sputnikmusic,sputnikmusic article: \"Time Fades Away review.\" and Blurt Online.Blurt Online article: \"Time Fades Away review \" R.E.M. has cited Time Fades Away as a source of inspiration for New Adventures in Hi-Fi. On December 31, 2013, Widespread Panic played the following three songs from Time Fades Away: \"Journey Through The Past\", \"Don't Be Denied\", and \"Time Fades Away\" at a concert in Atlanta. ===Young's appraisal=== Neil Young commented on Time Fades Away in the original, unreleased liner notes for his 1977 triple-album compilation Decade: In 1987, Young told an interviewer that Time Fades Away was \"the worst record I ever made \u2013 but as a documentary of what was happening to me, it was a great record. I was onstage and I was playing all these songs that nobody had heard before, recording them, and I didn't have the right band. It was just an uncomfortable tour. I felt like a product, and I had this band of all-star musicians that couldn't even look at each other.\"Thrasher's Wheat page: \"Time Fades Away by Neil Young\".Shakey by Jimmy McDonough, pp. 391. Young has rarely played songs from Time Fades Away live. \"Don't Be Denied\" was included in the 1974 CSN&Y; tour. In July 2008, he performed the record's title track at a concert in Oberhausen, Germany.Sugar Mountain page: \"Neil Young \u2013 2008 setlists .\" A 2014 documentary on Young was also named Don't Be Denied. ==Reissues== Time Fades Away long remained the only officially released Neil Young album unavailable on compact disc. Young had often cited his unfavorable memories of the tour as the main reason that the record has not been reissued. In the mid-1990s, plans were made to release the album on CD using the HDCD encoding; several test pressings were made, and a release date of November 7, 1995 was announced. However, the CD release was shelved for unknown reasons.Side Street Records page: \"Unreleased Neil Young compact discs 1988\u20131995.\" In early 2007, Young's management reiterated that there were no plans to release the album on CD. Pristine vinyl copies are still available in used stores and on eBay, often with the fold-out liner notes still intact; some CDs from the 1995 test pressings exist, and copies of these CDs are circulated as bootlegs. Additionally, some fans have made CDs from the more readily available vinyl copies. In 2014, Young released a limited edition box set of vinyl records that includes the original Time Fades Away along with On the Beach, Tonight's the Night, and Zuma. From December of 2014, Young's first 14 albums, including Time Fades Away, were released as high-resolution downloads via the Pono digital music service, HDTracks and Qobuz. The album finally saw an official CD release in August 2017 as part of the CD version of Official Release Series Discs 5-8 boxset; unlike the vinyl reissue, it's not available to buy separately. In 2020 Time Fades Away is available on streaming platforms such as Spotify, Deezer and Apple Music. It is also available for streaming and download in high resolution audio on Young's Archives website. ==Time Fades Away II and Tuscaloosa== In October 2009, Young told Guitar World that a disc titled Time Fades Away II will be included in the second volume of the Archives box set series, noting: \"It's interesting because [Time Fades Away II] has a different drummer than what was on that album. Kenny Buttrey was in there for the first half, and Johnny Barbata came in for the second. It's a completely different thing, with completely different songs.\"Guitar World interview with Neil Young. In January 2019, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Young mentioned the upcoming release of Tuscaloosa, a live album featuring the February 5th, 1973 show at Tuscaloosa, Alabama from the tour. The album was released on June 7, 2019. Young has since stated on his Archives website that Tuscaloosa is \"as close as Time Fades Away II that we'll get\". ==Track listing== ===Side one=== ===Side two=== ==Personnel== * Neil Young \u2014 vocals; guitar ; piano ; harmonica ; bass\u2020 * David Crosby \u2014 guitar ; vocal * Graham Nash \u2014 guitar, vocal ;The Stray Gators * Ben Keith \u2014 pedal steel, vocal ; slide guitar ; vocal * Jack Nitzsche \u2014 piano ; vocal * Tim Drummond \u2014 bass * Johnny Barbata \u2014 drums \u2020 Neil Young credited as \"Joe Yankee\" ==References== ==External links== *Neil Young's Time Fades Away \u2013 Analysis and Reviews *Time Fades Away (no label) \u2013 Analysis and review of Time Fades Away on Collectors Music Reviews Category:Neil Young live albums Category:1973 live albums Category:Reprise Records live albums Category:Albums produced by Neil Young Category:Albums produced by Elliot Mazer ",
