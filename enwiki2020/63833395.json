Janus played in the position of right-winger. == Football career == === Player === In 1949, Van der Gijp scored the last goal in the 3\u20130 victory over FC Eindhoven in the Zilveren Bal tournament finals, where all goals were by the Van der Gijps. The Van der Gijp machine had previously knocked Feyenoord out in the semifinals. Also in 1949, Van der Gijp missed a penalty in friendly tryout game on the Dutch National Team against Sweden. Van der Gijp had a decisive contribution in the return of SC Emma to the Eerste Klasse in 1950. In 1954, the Eerste Klasse turned professional with SC Emma and Janus van der Gijp in it. In the first round of professional football through the KNVB, SC Emma beat Roda Sport 2\u20131 with the Dordrecht goals shot by Cor and Janus van der Gijp. He also tried managing that year. For six weeks at the beginning of the 1954\u201355 season, he coached the Saturday amateur team of ASWH, then quit and concetrated again entirely on playing. In 1955\u201356, after Cor left, Janus was the top scorer of SC Emma, along with Wim van der Gaag (who played just one season in SC Emma). In 1957, when Van der Gijp was about 36, SC Emma sold Van der Gijp to DHC Delft. === Coach === From 1959, Janus van der Gijp became the manager of the amateur football clubs VV Zwaluwen (1959-1961), BEC Delft (1961\u20131963), VV BMT (1963\u20131965), NADO-Vooruitgang (1965\u201319??),SV WCR (19??\u20131973), RVV LMO (1973\u20131975?), TDC Rotterdam (1975\u20131977), and VV Piershil (1977\u20131979). ==References== == External links == *Portrait photo Category:1921 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Dutch footballers Category:Footballers from Dordrecht Category:ASWH managers Category:VV Zwaluwen managers Category:DHC Delft players Category:SC Emma players Category:Dutch football managers ",
