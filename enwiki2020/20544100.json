    "text": "Father Fran\u00e7ois Bourgoing (died maybe in 1589?) was a prior of the Dominicans in Paris. He was accused of having pushed the monk Jacques Cl\u00e9ment to assassinate Henry III of France. He certainly, at least, celebrated Jacques and his deed from the pulpit as \"the heroic action and the glorious martyr\". Taking up arms for the assault on Paris's suburbs in November 1589, he was condemned by the parlement de Tours to be dismembered as a regicide. ==Sources== Category:French Christian monks Category:16th-century French people Category:16th-century Christian monks Category:French Dominicans Category:French people of the French Wars of Religion Category:1589 deaths Category:Year of birth missing ",
