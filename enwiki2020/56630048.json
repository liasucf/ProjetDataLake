All three variants could be had with either a manual or automatic gearbox. Early models were fully imported from China. Local assembly in Malaysia started in December 2014. The locally assembled models were officially available as of January 2015. In November 2015, the \"Elite\" add-on kit became available for the Premium variant. Differences included a new design for the halogen projector headlights with LED positioning lamps, a front grille with a hexagonal mesh design, 16-inch alloy wheels with different multi-spoke design, matte black vinyl wrap for the roof and red-black colour combo finish for the leather seats.
