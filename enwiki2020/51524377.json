    "text": "Asuk\u0430 The WWE Raw Women's Championship is a women's professional wrestling world championship created and promoted by the American professional wrestling promotion WWE on the Raw brand. It was introduced as the WWE Women's Championship on April 3, 2016 at WrestleMania 32 to replace the Divas Championship and has a unique title history separate from the original WWE Women's Championship. As a result of the 2016 draft, the championship became exclusive to Raw with a subsequent rename and SmackDown created the SmackDown Women's Championship as a counterpart title. The championship is generally contested in professional wrestling matches, in which participants execute scripted finishes rather than contend in direct competition. The inaugural champion was Charlotte Flair, then known simply as Charlotte, who won the title at WrestleMania 32. The current champion is Asuka, who is in her second reign. She won the title by defeating Sasha Banks at SummerSlam on August 23, 2020. There have been 18 reigns between 8 champions. Sasha Banks has the most reigns at five. Becky Lynch's sole reign is the longest at 373 days (398 days as recognized by WWE due to tape delay), while Banks' fourth reign is the shortest at 8 days. Asuka is the oldest champion, winning the title at the age of 38, while Banks is the youngest, first winning the title at 24. == Title history == === Names === {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Name !Years |- |WWE Women's Championship |April 3, 2016 \u2013 September 4, 2016 |- |WWE Raw Women's Championship |September 5, 2016 \u2013 present |} === Reigns === ==Combined reigns== One-time and longest reigning champion Becky Lynch, who held the title for 373 days (398 days as recognized by WWE due to tape delay) Record five-time Raw Women's champion Sasha Banks As of , . {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !style=\"background-color: #ffe6bd\"|\u2020 |Indicates the current champion |} {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center\" !Rank !Wrestler !No. of reigns !Combined days !Combined days recognized by WWE |- !1 ||| 3 || 398 || 396 |- !2 ||| 1 || 373 || 398 |- !3 | || 4 || colspan=2|242 |- !4 | || 1 || 232 || 231 |- !5 |style=\"background- color: #ffe6bd\"| \u2020 || 2 || + || + |- !6 |Sasha Banks || 5 || 116 || 106 |- !7 | || 1 || 76 || 75 |- !8 | || 1 || 70 colspan=2|70 |} ==See also== * Women in WWE * Women's championships in WWE * List of current champions in WWE ==References== == External links == * Official Raw Women's Title History Category:WWE championships lists Category:WWE Raw Category:WWE women's championships Category:Women's professional wrestling championships lists ",
