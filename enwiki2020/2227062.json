    "text": "Ferdinand (24 March 1188 - 27 July 1233; Portuguese: Fernando, French and Dutch: Ferrand) reigned as jure uxoris Count of Flanders and Hainaut from his marriage to Countess Joan, celebrated in Paris in 1212, until his death. He was born in Coimbra, and he was an Infante of Portugal as the fourth son of King Sancho I of Portugal and Dulce of Aragon. While on their way to Flanders, Ferdinand and Joan were captured by Joan's first cousin Louis, eldest son of Philip II of France and Joan's aunt Isabella. Louis' aim was to acquire his dead mother's dowry, a large piece of Flemish territory including Artois, which Joan's father had taken back by force after Isabella's death. Released after this concession, Joan and Ferdinand soon joined the old allies of her father, King John of England and Emperor Otto IV, in an alliance against France. They were decisively defeated at Bouvines in July 1214, where Ferdinand was taken prisoner. Count Ferdinand imprisoned after the Battle of Bouvines Ferdinand was to remain in French hands for the next 12 years, while Joan ruled alone. He was released in 1226, by the French regent, Blanche of Castile, after the accession of her son Louis IX of France. Ferdinand died in Noyon on 27 July 1233. His and Joan's only child, a daughter named Maria, died childless, and their counties eventually passed to Joan's younger sister, Margaret II. ==Ancestry== ==Notes== ==References== * * * Category:House of Burgundy-Portugal Category:Counts of Flanders Category:Portuguese infantes Category:1188 births Category:1233 deaths Category:People from Coimbra Category:12th-century Portuguese people Category:13th-century Portuguese people Category:13th-century peers of France Category:13th-century people from the county of Flanders ",
