    "text": "Dr. Graeme Cecil Gunn AM (born 1933 in Hamilton, Victoria) is an Australian architect. ==Notable projects== Slorach Residence Construction Date: 2009 The encompassing living environment of the Hamilton Courtyard House is achieved through the union of built form, spatial sequences, landscape and scale. Winter Park Winter Park, Doncaster, Victoria Construction Date: 1971 Winter Park was Graeme's first cluster housing project. It was designed and implemented in association with Merchant Builders Pty Ltd in 1971 and has subsequently remained a seminal departure from the traditional method of suburban subdivision. Winter Park is now on the Heritage Victoria list and in 2007 was adjudged by an expert panel, consisting mostly of architects, as one of the 29 most worthy buildings produced since the inauguration of the first AIA awards. The basic tenet of the cluster housing concept is that of a comprehensively planned development in which a group of houses are sited to optimise available land in a much more efficient and environmentally sensitive manner than that provided by the normal rectangular grid lot suburban subdivision. Excess land is aggregated to provide communal open space. Houses are sited to relate sympathetically with each other, to optimise privacy, solar orientation, views and physical conditions. The Plumbers & Gasfitters Union Building Plumbers and Gasfitters building front facade. Gunn, Graeme Construction Date: 1970 Located at 52 Victoria Street Melbourne, the Plumbers & Gasfitters Union building is known as the most persisting and noticeable landmark of Brutalism. The building was completed in 1970 by Graeme Gunn and his creative collaboration with Merchant Builders and landscape architect Ellis Stones.Architect Victoria RAIA VIC awards 2007, 54 The design itself was architecturally intended to be up to date.Goad, Philip, Melbourne Architecture, Boorowa, NSW: The Watermark Press, 2009, p199 The facade is formed of concrete in bold expressionistic forms with dark smoked glazing that intensify the sculptural quality of the construction.Goad, Philip, Melbourne Architecture, Boorowa, NSW: The Watermark Press, 2009, p203 Structurally designed to receive an extra floor when needed, the building consists of a car parking and mechanical services area, one main office floor housing the clients, conference room and lobby, and one office of lettable space.Architect , volume 3 number 14, August 1971 For the internal finishes, walls, concrete block work, and stud frame sheeted with plywood are painted. The addition of signage on the building is slightly unsympathetic to the building's initial character. Baronda Residence Baronda residence under construction. Gunn, Graeme Construction Date: 1968 The design is based on a 2700 orthogonal matrix using natural tree trunks, some 10 metres long farmed from a local plantation owned by Sir Roy Grounds and Ken Myer. The vertical and horizontal grid of the matrix defines the spaces, the floors of which radiate from the central staircase, each floor raise a half level above the previous and in a location 90-degree different from the one below. Services are minimal, there being no public utilities (gas, water, electricity or sewerage). The timber theme generated by the structure is continued with infill timber studs within the pole grid and clad internally and externally with timber boarding. The floors are EX 50x100 mm tongue and grooved planks spanning 1350 mm. These, in turn form the ceilings for those rooms having a full height below. Ceilings directly below the roof consist of sisal lining over 150mm square wire mesh. Some years ago the owner of this property and some of adjacent properties along the coast deeded the contiguous properties as part of a state park to the NSW government to ensure retention of the pristine coastal environment, reserved for public use only. Townhouses - 76 Molesworth Street, Kew Molesworth Street. Gunn Graeme Construction Date: 1968 Designed for family living these six concrete block, Brutalist style townhouses, consist of three bedrooms, two living areas and a double carport (now converted to a garage) with an open private courtyard.Goad, Philip, Melbourne Architecture, Boorowa, NSW: The Watermark Press, 2009, p201 The building expresses simple construction materials of concrete for the main structure, timber for the roof structure and metal deck as the roof cladding. Off-form concrete balconies project from the concrete block building, with timber handrails.Architecture in Australia Townhouses, 76 Molesworth Street, Kew, Victoria, Volume 59, Number 5, October 1970. The Townhouses are significant as an important design progression in the re-thinking of suburban, cluster style living. The houses are included on the Schedule to the Heritage Overlay and Graded as \"A\" class. Today: This project retains many of its original features and remains structurally intact, and has only received minor upgrading of timber handrails and window frames.

In the Boroondara Municipality only 3 other residential projects have won this award. ==Selected other projects== *Biles Residence ::Location: Melbourne, Victoria ::Construction Date: 2006 *Austin Vineyard ::Location: Sutherland Creek, Victoria ::Construction Date: 2006 *Crawford River Wineries ::Location: Condah, Victoria ::Construction Date: 2002 *Portland Aerodrome ::Location: Portland, Victoria ::Construction Date: 1981 *Prahran Market ::Location: Prahran, Victoria ::Construction Date: 1979 ==Awards== *2012 Member (AM) in the General Division of the Order of Australia *2011 Australian Institute of Architects Gold Medal *2007 25 Year Award for Outstanding Architecture - Plumbers and Gas fitters *2001 President's award for Lifetime Contribution to Victorian Architecture *1996 Honorary Doctorate of Architecture, RMIT *1988 The Royal Australian Institute of Architects Merit Awards for Outstanding Architecture - Bridge Hotel Mordialloc *1988 The Royal Australian Institute of Architects Merit Awards for Outstanding Architecture - RACV Club refurbishments *1984 The Royal Australian Institute of Architects Merit Awards for Outstanding Architecture - Melbourne City Baths *1983 The Royal Australian Institute of Architects Merit Awards for Outstanding Architecture - Portland Aerodrome Terminal Building *1982 The Royal Australian Institute of Architects Merit Awards for Outstanding Architecture - Prahran Municipal Market *1980 Victorian Architecture Medal : Ararat Arts Activity Centre *1970 Bronze Medal Award, Victorian Chapter of the RAIA - Townhouses - 76 Molesworth Street, Kew *1970 Royal Australian Institute of Architects Citation - Plumbers & Gasfitters *1971 Royal Australian Institute of Architects Citation - Royal South Yarra Lawn Tennis Club *1975 Royal Australian Institute of Architects Citation - Winter Park cluster housing *1976 Royal Australian Institute of Architects Citation - AMWSU Headquarters *1976 Royal Australian Institute of Architects Citation - Chelsworth Park Pavilion *1966 Bronze Medal Award, Victorian Chapter of the RAIA - Richardson House ==Publications== 2010 \u2013 present *Sullivan, Leanne, Who\u2019s Who in Australia 2012, Crown Content Pty Ltd, Melbourne p. 958 *Bernstone, Rachel \"Pulse\" In Design;
