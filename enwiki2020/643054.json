Initially owned by the Loitz family, it was later governed by the Wejher and Sobieski noble families, including King of Poland John III Sobieski. Administratively it was part of the Malbork Voivodeship within the Polish Crown. As a result of the First Partition of Poland in 1772 it was annexed by Prussia, in 1871 it became part of Germany, and in 1920 it became part of the Free City of Danzig (Gda\u0144sk). On September 1, 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland, causing World War II, the Germans murdered the local Polish customs inspector.Maria Wardzy\u0144ska, By\u0142 rok 1939. Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpiecze\u0144stwa w Polsce. Intelligenzaktion, IPN, Warszawa, 2009, p. 84 (in Polish) The town was then annexed by Nazi Germany. During the war, a subcamp of the Stutthof concentration camp was operated by the Germans in the town. One of the places where the Germans used the forced labour of Stutthof prisoners was the train station, where there is now a memorial plaque. After the defeat of Nazi Germany in the war, in 1945, the town was finally restored to Poland. ==Notable residents== * Krzysztof Pilarz (born 1980) a professional football goalkeeper, over 250 games ==International relations== Nowy Dw\u00f3r Gda\u0144ski is twinned with: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- valign=\"top\" | * Hennef (Sieg), Germany \u2013 since 2001 * Sarny, Ukraine * Svetly, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia * Velk\u00e1 nad Veli\u010dkou, Czech Republic |} ==References== ==External links== *Official webpage Category:Cities and towns in Pomeranian Voivodeship Category:Nowy Dw\u00f3r Gda\u0144ski County Category:1570 establishments in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:Populated places established in 1570 ",
