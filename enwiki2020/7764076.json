    "text": "The Dagling or D\u00f6gling dynasty was a legendary clan of the petty kingdom Ringerike in what today is Norway. It was descended from a Dag the Great. In the Ynglinga saga, Snorri Sturluson writes that the clan was descended from Dag the Great whose daughter Dageid married the Swedish king Alrekr and was the mother of Yngvi and Alf. == Dag of the nine sons == Stanza 18 of the Hyndlulj\u00f3\u00f0 reads: {| | :Dagr \u00e1tti \u00de\u00f3ru :drengja m\u00f3\u00f0ur, :\u00f3lusk \u00ed \u00e6tt \u00fear :\u00e6\u00f0stir kappar: :Fra\u00f0marr ok Gyr\u00f0r :ok Frekar b\u00e1\u00f0ir, :\u00c1mr ok J\u00f6surmarr, :Alfr inn gamli. :Var\u00f0ar, at viti sv\u00e1. :Viltu enn lengra?Gu\u00f0ni J\u00f3nsson's edition | :The mate of Dag :was a mother of heroes, :Thora, who bore him :the bravest of fighters, :Frathmar and Gyrth :and the Frekis twain, :Am and Jofurmar, :Alf the Old; :It is much to know,-- :wilt thou hear yet more?Bellow's translation | |} In the later Hversu Noregr bygg\u00f0ist, it is reported that Dag married a woman named \u00de\u00f3ra drengjam\u00f3\u00f0ur and they had nine sons. Among them were \u00d3li, \u00c1mr, J\u00f6furr and Arngrim the berserker who married Eyfura. This makes this Dag roughly contemporary with the Dag of Ynglinga saga, Hervarar saga and Orvar- Odd's saga, as Arngrim's sons Angantyr and his brother Hj\u00f6rvard would have been the cousins of the Swedish king Yngvi, whose daughter Hj\u00f6rvard wanted to marry. This proposal would lead to both Angantyr and his brothers being killed in battle against the Swedish hero Hjalmar and his Norwegian friend Orvar-Odd. But the \"Hversu Noregr Bygg\u00f0ist\" tells that Dag's grandfather received a promise from the gods that there would be no woman among his descendants for three hundred years, which fits badly with Dag having a daughter. Another one of Dag the Great's sons according to Hversu Noregr Bygg\u00f0ist was \u00d3li, who was the father of Dag, the father of \u00d3leif the father of Hring (the old king Ring of Frithiof's Saga), the father of Olaf, the father of Helgi, the father of Sigurd Hjort, the father of Ragnhild, who was the mother of Harald Fairhair. This line partially agrees with the one found in Ragnarssona \u00fe\u00e1ttr, where it is told instead that Dag the Great and his wife \u00de\u00f3ra drengjam\u00f3\u00f0ur were the parents of Hring, the father of Ingi, the father of Ingjald, the father of Olaf, the father of Gudr\u00f6d and Helgi the Sharp. Helgi married the daughter of Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye and had the son Sigurd Hjort, the father of Ragnhild, the mother of Harald Fairhair. ==References== Category:Norwegian petty kings Category:Germanic families ",
