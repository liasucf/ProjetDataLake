He is recognized as one of the sixteen bodhisattvas of the auspicious aeon (bhadrakalpa). He also has the ability to perceive and understand all actions of cause and effect (Skt. aparu\u1e63\u0101). ==Lotus Sutra== In Chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra, Ak\u1e63ayamati asks the Buddha to elaborate on the character of the bodhisattva Avalokite\u015bvara. After receiving a detailed explanation on the Bodhisattva's wanderings throughout the world, Ak\u1e63ayamati offers Avalokite\u015bvara a pearl necklace of great value. Avalokite\u015bvara refuses at first, but Ak\u1e63ayamati entreats him to accept it for the Dharma, out of compassion. Avalokite\u015bvara finally accepts the necklace out of compassion for the fourfold assembly, devas, n\u0101gas, yakshas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kinnaras, mahoragas, humans, non-humans, etc. ==Sources== * * Category:Bodhisattvas ",
