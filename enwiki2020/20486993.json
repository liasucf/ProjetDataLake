    "text": "Campaign is a global business magazine covering advertising, media, marketing and commercial creativity. Headquartered in the UK, it also has editions in the US, Asia-Pacific, India, the Middle East and Turkey. Campaign is published by Haymarket Media Group, which owns more than 70 brands worldwide including FourFourTwo, Stuff, Autocar, What Car? and PRWeek. ==Overview== Campaign publishes a monthly print magazine in the UK as well as daily news and analysis on its websites: campaignlive.co.uk, campaignlive.com, campaignasia.com, campaignindia.in, campaignme.com, and campaigntr.com. Each spring Campaign releases its School Reports, an assessment of how the biggest advertising agencies performed over the past year. In December, as part of its Annual issue, it names the top agencies, advertising and media networks, advertisers, campaigns, media, and production companies of the year. Campaign also publishes the A-List, a directory of leading executives from the advertising and media industries, at the end of each year. In May 2016, Haymarket Business Media consolidated their marketing communications publishing portfolio under the Campaign brand, leading to the closure of Marketing Magazine, Brand Republic, and Media Week. This also saw the launch of another Haymarket specialist job board, Campaign Jobs. ==History== The magazine was originally published by the British Printing Corporation and titled World's Press News, and, in the late 1960s, was struggling to find a market, but Michael Heseltine then acquired it for Haymarket and hired Maurice Saatchi to rebrand and relaunch the magazine, with design by Roland Schenk, upon which it proved an immediate success and became known as \"the Bible of British adland\". In 2013, Campaign underwent a redesign, dropping its A3 newspaper-size format. In the same year it also launched its first paid-for app, which readers receive as part of their subscription, on the Apple Newsstand service. ==Campaign awards== The Campaign Big Awards recognize the best agencies, campaigns and creative work of the year. The Campaign Media Awards celebrate creativity in the media business, with categories for both media agencies and media owners. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Business magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Weekly magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Magazines published in London Category:Magazines about advertising Category:Magazines with year of establishment missing Category:Professional and trade magazines ",
