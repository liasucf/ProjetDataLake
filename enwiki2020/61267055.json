This is their second collaboration. The London Economic newspaper cited this movie as one of the examples of Indian thriller movies of 2019 which have the potential to gain global attention due to the absence of songs - which it considered as a staple in Indian movies irrespective of the genre.https://www.thelondoneconomics.com/film/beyond- parasite-can-bollywood-go-international/01/03/ == Cast == * Priyanka Upendra as Devaki * Kishore as Inspector * Aishwarya Upendra as Devaki's Daughter * Sanjeev Jaiswal as a kidnapper == Soundtrack == The film's score was composed by Nobin Paul. == Production== The film was first titled Howrah Bridge.

If you're looking for an experience that brings in something new, then this is for you.\" The New Indian Express paper rated the film 4/5 and wrote \"In his second outing after Mummy - Save Me, director Lohith has again displayed a shade of the mark of a genius. It is not just perfection that comes to the fore in Devaki, but the opening of new frontiers, inviting the audience to the kingdom of ingenuity. There is not a scintilla of mediocrity in his execution, which is enhanced by Kolkata\u2019s vibrant yet moody aura. A suspense thriller, Devaki is a film about love and loss, told with a lot of sensitivity. A must watch.\" The Bangalore Mirror said, \"Technically, this is one of the better films you have seen.\" Aravind Shwetha of The News Minute gave three stars out of five and said, \"Devaki manages to keep us invested all through. But for its slow pace, this is a film that deserves a watch.\" Vivek M V of The Deccan Herald gave three and a half out of five stars and noted, \"Devaki, after Bell Bottom, is another thriller that deserves a watch in the theatres.\" == References == == External links == * Category:Indian films Category:Kannada-language films Category:2010s Kannada-language films Category:2019 crime thriller films Category:Indian crime thriller films Category:2019 films Category:Films shot in Mysore Category:Films shot in Bangalore Category:Indian films without songs ",
