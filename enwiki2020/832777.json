    "text": "Michal Viewegh Michal Viewegh (born 31 March 1962 in Prague) is a contemporary Czech writer. He writes about romantic relationships of his contemporaries with humour, variously successful irony as well as attempts at deeper meaningfulness; he is sometimes compared to Nick Hornby by his fans. ==Sales== His books, since the late 1990s published every spring, usually sell about 50,000 copies each, bringing him an upper-high-class income unparalleled among Czech writers. By his own boastful admissions, his royalties from a successful book are equal to roughly 8 years of an average Czech salary. His 2004 income was CZK four million. His work has been translated into 23 languages. ==Awards== He is the recipient of the Ji\u0159\u00ed Orten Award (1993) and the Magnesia Litera Readers\u2019 award (2005). ==Political views== Viewegh is a political adversary of the former Czech president V\u00e1clav Klaus. In some of his recent novels this attitude has been strongly and pointedly manifested. ==Scandals== In his column for Lidove noviny (Czech newspaper and online news site) published on 1 October 2018, Viewegh criticised Christine Blayse Ford's allegations of sexual assault against Brett Kavanaugh on the grounds that \"putting her in an empty room, groping her, covering her mouth while trying to undress her\" was an \"innocent high-school petting\" and that he thanks God that he, as a pubescent, was free to grope his female schoolmates without endangering his future career, without any \"North-American cow\" complaining about it. . He has been criticised in turn by criminologist Pavel Houdek in a published open letter, that his views are what makes victims of sexual abuse keep it to themselves. ==Health issues== In late 2012 Viewegh suffered a traumatic aortic rupture and his health condition was serious. His difficult recovery is detailed in his \"diary-novel\" M\u016fj \u017eivot po \u017eivot\u011b (My Life After Life, 2013) == Bibliography == * 1990.
