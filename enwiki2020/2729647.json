    "text": "Caranus or Karanos () was the first king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon according to later traditions. According to Herodotus, however, the first king was Perdiccas I. Caranus is first reported by TheopompusTheopompus the Historian, Page 270 By Gordon Spencer Shrimpton and is the mythical founder of the Argead dynasty.Peter Green, Alexander of Macedon, 356\u2013323 B.C.: A Historical Biography, University of California Press, 2013, p.103According to Pausanias (Description of Greece, 9.40, 8-9), Caranus set up a trophy after the Argive fashion for a victory against Cisseus: \"The Macedonians say that Caranus, king of Macedonia, overcame a chieftain in a bordering country in the battle of Cisseus. For his victory Caranus set up a trophy after the Argive fashion, but it is said to have been upset by a lion from Olympus, which then vanished. Caranus realized that it was a mistaken policy to incur the undying hatred of the non-Greeks dwelling around, and so the rule was adopted that no king of Macedonia, neither Caranus himself nor any of his successors, should set up trophies, if they were ever to gain the good-will of their neighbors. This story is confirmed by the fact that Alexander set up no trophies, neither for his victory over Dareius nor for those he won in India.\" Caranus' way is labeled by the blue colour == Myth == According to a Greek myth, Caranus was the son of Temenus, king of Argos, who in turn was a Heraclid, a descendant of Heracles. Plutarch agrees on the Heraclid lineage of Caranus and argues that Alexander the Great is a descendant of Heracles through Caranus.Plutarch, Alexander, 2.1 Temenus, along with Cresphontes and Aristodemus were the three Doric leaders who invaded the Mycenean Peloponnese region. Then they proceeded to divide the conquered territories between them. Cresphontes was given Messenia and Sparta; Aristodemus took Laconia; and finally Temenus was given Argos. Following the death of Temenus, the princes argued about who should be king. One of them, Pheidon, defeated his brothers in battle and took over the kingship. Caranus then decided to find another kingdom of his own, where he could be king. First, however he went to the Oracle of Delphi to ask Pythia's advice. \"You should find your kingdom there, where you will find plenty of game and domestic animals, she advised.\" Thus Caranus and his entourage moved to the North, in search of suitable land to establish his new kingdom. Finally, he discovered a green valley, with a lot of game and goats, whereupon he thought that the prophecy of Pythia had been fulfilled. Thus he built a city there, which he named Aigai (), present day Vergina, a site of substantial archaeological activity, as numerous important findings have been unearthed. == View of historians == According to Justin (7.1) citing Marsyas of Pella According to Chronicon (Eusebius) According to Livy (The History of Rome, 45.9.3) ==See also== *Heracleidae ==References== *Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology Caranus Category:8th-century BC Macedonian monarchs Category:Argead kings of Macedonia Category:Mythology of Macedonia (ancient kingdom) Category:Legendary people ",
