Amazing sense of humor, sharp power of observation and unfathomed wit merged with a profound command on selection of words produced a class of humor which was equally approachable by children as well as the grown ups. Satyajit Ray, in the preface of the first edition of the compilation of Sukumar Ray's complete works in his centenary year, Sukumar Sahitya Samagra, wrote: After his father's death in 1915, Sukumar had to take over responsibility of publication of \"Sandesh\", and his creativity reached its pinnacle. The 45 limericks in Abol Tabol and many other creations published in Sandesh still amuse the readers of all ages. He created many characters in his prose and poems. Kaath Buro, Tash Goru, Huko Mukho Hangla, Kumro Potash etc. were fictitious characters, though they were very close to our known world. He himself described his works as the product of Kheyal Ros (\u09b9\u09a0\u09be\u09ce \u0987\u099a\u09cd\u099b\u09be;\u099d\u09cb\u0981\u0995/Wish; Whims; Freak; Fancy). ==Death== Sukumar Ray died on 10 September 1923 at his Garpar residence in Kolkata of severe infectious fever, leishmaniasis, for which there was no cure at the time. He left behind his widow and their only child, Satyajit, who was only two years old at that time. Satyajit Ray would later shoot a documentary on Sukumar Ray in 1987, 5 years before his own death. ==Bibliography== * Abol Tabol (The Weird and the Absurd) * Pagla Dashu (Crazy Dashu) * Khai-Khai (Eat-Eat) * Heshoram Hushiyarer Diary (The diary of Heshoram Hushiyar) (early science fiction parody)Early Bengali science fiction, Amardeep Singh, lehigh.edu * HaJaBaRaLa (Mumbo-Jumbo) * Jhalapala O Onanyo Natok (Cacophony and Other Plays) * Lakkhaner Shoktishel (The Weapon of Lakkhan) * Chalachittachanchari * Shabdakalpadrum * Bohurupi (Many personalities) * Abak Jalpan (Weird Drinking of Water 1914) * Bhasar Atyachar (Torture of Language 1915) * Desh-Bidesher Golpo (Tales from Many Lands) ==References== ==External links== * * Complete Sukumar Ray * \"Drighangchu\" by Sukumar Ray translation of short story in The Cafe Irreal Category:1887 births Category:1923 deaths Category:Bengali male poets Category:Writers from Kolkata Category:Bengali writers Category:Bengali- language writers Category:Bengali-language science fiction writers Category:Bengali zamindars Category:Culture of Kolkata Category:Indian children's writers Category:Indian illustrators Category:Indian children's book illustrators Category:Brahmos Category:19th-century Indian photographers Category:Presidency University, Kolkata alumni Category:University of Calcutta alumni Category:Deaths from leishmaniasis Category:20th-century Indian poets Category:20th-century Indian novelists Category:20th-century Indian photographers Category:Photographers from West Bengal Category:Novelists from West Bengal Category:Poets from West Bengal ",
