The Indian Express on 22 July 1960 reviewed the film during its preview and noted \"The plot unfolds itself with easy tempo and unflagging interest. The songs are natural and exceptionally homely. Photography and sound recording are superb\". Despite critical acclaim, the film did not succeed commercially; the distributors complained that L. Vijayalakshmi did not dance, to which the director replied, \"[Vijayalakshmi] knows how to dance, but the character she plays in the film does not!\" According to film historian Randor Guy, \"internal dissensions spoiled the film's release and caused it to flop.\" == References == == Bibliography == * == External links == * Category:1960 films Category:Indian films Category:Tamil-language films Category:1960s Tamil-language films ",
