    "text": "Major Lazer is an American adult animated television series based on the electronic music group of the same name, created by DJ and record producer Diplo with Ferry Gouw and Kevin Kusatsu. It premiered on FOX on April 16, 2015 as part of their Animation Domination High-Def (ADHD) block. After Stone Quackers, Major Lazer is the second ADHD original series to be aired on the channel after FOX had stopped its broadcast of the block itself. The show was renewed for a second season, but was later canceled. On September 3, 2016, it was announced that John Boyega had left the series to focus on the new Star Wars films prior to its cancellation. Major Lazer is now available to stream on Hulu. ==Plot== Set in the future, Major Lazer is a Jamaican superhero with a laser gun for a right hand who fights against the dystopian forces led by Jamaica's leader President Whitewall and his servant General Rubbish. Major Lazer is assisted in his fight by President Whitewall's daughter Penny Whitewall and hacker Blkmrkt. ==Production== Major Lazer had been in production for nearly five years before its premiere. It was originally considered for Adult Swim through a pilot episode produced in 2011 by Williams Street and Titmouse, Inc., which was never broadcast. The musical group Major Lazer, on which the show is based, previously starred animated characters, including the character of Major Lazer. Ferry Gouw, along with John Pham, served as art director for this incarnation. Other musicians such as Jay Z, and the Odd Future collective, had signed on for television shows on the network during the year; Odd Future's came out as Loiter Squad the next year. Billboard announced Major Lazer would premiere on Fox in 2014. Cat Power and Riff Raff were said to have collaborated on the soundtrack for the show. In 2015, Billboard announced the show would premiere on FXX. Diplo called the long wait of the production \"worth it to have such a succinct TV show for our music fans and cartoon fans alike\". He said that it would appeal to \"any fans of hip-hop [and] electronic music or '80s cartoons, and the culture that gave birth to [Major Lazer's] musical landscape\". Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who voices the eponymous character, described the feeling of the show as \"like being high\". J. K. Simmons voices President Whitewall, while Aziz Ansari, Ezra Koenig, Riff Raff, Andy Samberg, and Charli XCX make guest voice performances. ==Voice cast== ===Principal cast=== * Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje \u2013 Major Lazer, Evil Lazer (ep. 10) * James Adomian \u2013 General Rubbish * John Boyega \u2013 Blkmrkt * Ashante \"Taranchyla\" Reid \u2013 Old Rasta, PG Tipps, Weed Man (Episode 1) * J.K.

Erik Adams of The A.V.
