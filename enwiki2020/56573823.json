It is the sequel to the 2013 game Brave Frontier, originally released for the franchise's 5th anniversary with Eiji Takahashi returning as both director and producer for the sequel, alongside newer staff. The game is released on February 22, 2018 for iOS and Android and will be released on Q3 2018 for Windows.http://mmoculture.com/2018/02/brave-frontier-2-japan-launch-date-for- mobile-rpg-sequel-announced/http://www.siliconera.com/2018/02/12/brave- frontier-2-launches-japan-february-22-smartphones-pc/ ==Gameplay== Like the first game to the series, it follows the same gameplay format to Square Enix's Valkyrie Profile, but differentiates itself from the original such as its story-driven plot and gameplay. Players are allowed to bring up to 5 units in each stage with a \"friend\" unit in quest mode. Players make friends through friend request. Attacking units in a battle rewards the player with Brave Burst Crystals, and Heart Crystals. After an enemy is defeated, the player proceeds the next stage until the boss, which is required to go complete a level. After completing, players are rewarded with Zel and items, as well as acquiring units from each mission. When players complete the entire area, they'll be rewarded with one gem. However, if players fail a quest, they use one gem to continue. Units have the ability to execute special attacks, known as Brave Bursts and Super Brave Bursts. In departure to the original game, the game will be the first to feature a double protagonist system, allowing players to play the story of both main protagonist in the same game. a new mechanic known as Xross Brave Burst is introduced, which requires two or more units with mutual relationship to execute stronger attacks. Also, the game features an improved summoner avatar system and can be leveled up through branch evolution and be equipped with various weapons and items. Alongside the improved summoner avatar system is the ability to raise pets as companion in quests, which like units, can be evolvable to become stronger. The game's director, Eiji Takahashi also stated that standard features such as Frontier Hunter, Trials and Arena will also be included in the game's release. But unlike its predecessor, Brave Frontier 2 has no Gacha system to get new units, and relies more on buying new units using in-game currency.http://www.siliconera.com/2018/02/12/brave-frontier-2-launches-japan- february-22-smartphones-pc/ ==Story== 20 years after the defeat of Karna Masta and the restoration of summoning ability within the Akras Summoner's Hall, deep in the world of Extas, Fabulaska was arrested for copying data on a research forbidden to be accessed when two strange figures helped him in his escape.

However, the black knight commanded Shaia to attack the hero and Rin, distorting the portal as both of them were sucked away into the portal and were separated as they traversed into different worlds.
