    "text": "Didier William is a mixed-media painter originally from Port-au-Prince, Haiti. His work incorporates traditions in oil painting, acrylic, collage and printmaking to comment on intersections of identity and culture. ==Early life and education== William was born in 1983 in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. He grew up in Miami, Florida, and received his BFA in painting from The Maryland Institute College of Art. William earned his MFA in painting and printmaking from Yale University School of Art. He was an artist in residence at the Marie Walsh Sharpe Art Foundation in Brooklyn, NY and has taught at the Yale School of Art, Vassar College, Columbia University, and SUNY Purchase. In 2016 he was appointed Chair of the MFA Program at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. He vacated this position in May 2019. In the fall 2019, Didier was appointed Assistant Professor in Expanded Print at Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University, NJ. ==Career== Didier William's paintings are concerned with blackness and other identities subjected to an othering gaze and socioeconomic oppression, drawing on his experiences of immigrating to the United States from Haiti. His works embrace traditional conventions of painting in their size and planarity, but integrate collage and mixed media to reflect to layers on meaning in each piece. Didier's exploration of the gaze, Haitian Voudou, history, folklore, and identity is expressed through works that depict human figures. His Curtains, Stages, Shadows series (2017-2018) was in part inspired by events surrounding Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teenager who was shot to death in 2012. He is currently working on a large-scale project related to Curtains, Stages, Shadows for 2020. ===Exhibits=== His work has been exhibited at group shows and solo exhibitions in various institutions, including The Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach, Bronx Museum of Art, Frederick and Freiser Gallery, The Fraenkel Gallery, and Gallery Schuster in Berlin. ====Solo exhibitions==== 2010\\.
