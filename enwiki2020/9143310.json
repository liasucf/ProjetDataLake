She is the main protagonist of the Medieval Icelandic Laxd\u0153la saga, which recounts the history of the People of Lax\u00e1rdalur. It is widely thought that the saga represents some historical fact. ==Background== Gu\u00f0r\u00fan was the daughter of \u00d3sv\u00edfr Helgason and \u00de\u00f3rd\u00eds \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0\u00f3lfsd\u00f3ttir. She grew up at Laugar in S\u00e6lingsdal. Her future marriages were foretold when she relayed four dreams, each represented one of her marriages to come. There exists a thermal bath called Gu\u00f0r\u00fanarlaug reportedly at the site where the dreams were interpreted by Gestur Oddleifsson. ===First marriage=== Her first marriage to Thorvaldr Halldorsson ended in divorce. It was a brief unhappy marriage, however after the divorce she acquired half of his estate. Laxd\u0153la saga chapter XXXIV ===Second marriage=== Her second husband Thord Ingunnarsson drowned at sea. She gave birth to his son soon after, naming him Thord. Laxd\u0153la saga chapter XXXV ===Third marriage=== After her second husband's death she was courted by the two foster-brothers Kjartan \u00d3l\u00e1fsson and Bolli \u00deorleiksson. Gu\u00f0r\u00fan preferred Kjartan, but she gave herself to Bolli, because of a false rumour that Kjartan was engaged to Ingibj\u00f6rg, the sister of King \u00d3l\u00e1fr Tryggvason. The two foster- brothers engaged in hostilities which ended with Bolli killing Kjartan, and Bolli being killed by Kjartan's kinsmen. Her second son, Bolli Bollason, was born the winter after the killing of his father when her son Thord was only four. They grew up at Helgafell, after his mother Gu\u00f0r\u00fan exchanged homes with chieftain Snorre Torgrimsson (Snorri Go\u00f0i).Laxd\u0153la saga chapter LVI ===Fourth marriage=== In 1020, Gu\u00f0r\u00fan married for the fourth time, this time to Thorkell Eyjolffsson, who became a great chieftain in his own countryside and took over the running of the household at Helgafell. Thorkell was fond of both his stepsons, but Bolli was regarded as \"being the foremost in all things\".Laxd\u0153la saga chapter LXX Thorleik journeyed abroad to Norway, and stayed with King Olaf Haraldsson for several months. Gu\u00f0r\u00fan constantly argued for revenge for the killing of her former husband Bolli \u00deorleiksson, but eventually her two sons made peace with the sons of \u00d3l\u00e1fr, Kjartan's kinsmen, at the Thorness Thing; it is not known how much money was exchanged in compensation as part of the agreement, but \"both sides were thought to have gained in esteem from these affairs\".Laxd\u0153la saga chapter LXXI To get Thorgils to help her have revenge she promised to marry no other man in the country, nor to marry abroad. When he returns successful she tells him that she is to marry Thorkel since he technically meets the requirements of their promise. He was not in the country at the time, and they would not be marrying abroad. Thorgils was not very happy about this turn of events. Her father, \u00d3sv\u00edfr Helgason died soon after the marriage, and he was buried at a church Gu\u00f0r\u00fan constructed. ===Widowhood=== The day Thorkell drowned at sea, Gu\u00f0r\u00fan saw the ghost of him and his companions standing outside the church. They vanished but left a strong impression on her, she became the first Icelandic woman to learn the Psalter. Her granddaughter Herdis often accompanied her on her nightly prayer excursions. One night Herdis had a dream that led them to a discovery of a prophetess buried beneath Gu\u00f0r\u00fan's prayer spot. Her son Bolli asked permission to marry Thordis, the daughter of Snorri Go\u00f0i. Gu\u00f0r\u00fan approved of the union. In her old age Gu\u00f0r\u00fan was asked by her son Bolli which of the men in her life she loved most. She gave the cryptic response \"To him I was worst whom I loved best,\"Laxd\u0153la saga chapter LXXVIII which answer, though accepted by her son, has sparked great debate among scholars as to whom she was referring. Gu\u00f0r\u00fan died and was buried at Helgafell. ==References== ==Other sources== *Vidar Hreinsson (1997) The Complete Sagas of Icelanders (Reykjavik: Leifur Eiriksson Publishing Ltd.) ==External links== *Translation in English by Muriel Press (The Temple Classics, London, 1899) *Text with modern Icelandic spelling *Laxd\u00e6la saga in an English translation by Muriel A.
