    "text": "A Soviet poster from 1921 () Throughout Russian history famines and droughts have been a common feature, often resulting in humanitarian crises traceable to political or economic instability, poor policy, environmental issues and war. Droughts and famines in the Russian Empire tended to occur fairly regularly, with famine occurring every 10\u201313 years and droughts every five to seven years. Golubev and Dronin distinguish three types of drought according to productive areas vulnerable to droughts: Central (the Volga basin, North Caucasus and the Central Chernozem Region), Southern (Volga and Volga-Vyatka area, the Ural region, and Ukraine), and Eastern (steppe and forest-steppe belts in Western and Eastern Siberia, and Kazakhstan). == Pre-1900 droughts and famines == In the 17th century, Russia experienced the famine of 1601\u20131603, as a proportion of the population, believed to be its worst as it may have killed 2 million people (1/3 of the population). ( 5 million people estimated to have died in 1920-22 famine). Major famines include the Great Famine of 1315\u201317, which affected much of Europe including part of RussiaLucas, Henry S. \"The great European famine of 1315, 1316, and 1317.\" Speculum 5.4 (1930): 343-377. as well as the Baltic states. The Nikonian chronicle, written between 1127 and 1303, recorded no less than eleven famine years during that period. One of the most serious crises before 1900 was the famine of 1891\u201392, which killed between 375,000 and 500,000 people, mainly due to famine-related diseases. Causes included a large Autumn drought resulting in crop failures. Attempts by the government to alleviate the situation generally failed which may have contributed to a lack of faith in the Czarist regime and later political instability. == List of post-1900 droughts and famines == Starving woman, c. 1921 Three children who are dead from starvation, 1921 Starving children in 1922 The Golubev and Dronin report gives the following table of the major droughts in Russia between 1900 and 2000. * Central: 1920, 1924, 1936, 1946, 1984. * Southern: 1901, 1906, 1921, 1939, 1948, 1995. * Eastern: 1911, 1931, 1991. == 1900s == The failed Revolution of 1905 likely distorted output and restricted food availability. == 1910s == During the Russian Revolution and following civil war there was a decline in total agricultural output. Measured in millions of tons the 1920 grain harvest was only 46.1, compared to 80.1 in 1913. By 1926 it had almost returned to pre-war levels reaching 76.8. == 1920s == The early 1920s saw a series of famines. The first famine in the USSR happened in 1921\u20131923 and garnered wide international attention. The most affected area being the Southeastern areas of European Russia (including Volga region, especially national republics of Idel-Ural, see 1921\u201322 famine in Tatarstan) and Ukraine. An estimated 16 million people may have been affected and up to 5 million died. Fridtjof Nansen was honored with the 1922 Nobel Peace Prize, in part for his work as High Commissioner for Relief In Russia. Other organizations that helped to combat the Soviet famine were International Save the Children Union and the International Committee of the Red Cross. When the Russian famine of 1921 broke out, the American Relief Administration's director in Europe, Walter Lyman Brown, began negotiating with Soviet deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Maxim Litvinov, in Riga, Latvia. An agreement was reached on August 21, 1921, and an additional implementation agreement was signed by Brown and People's Commisar for Foreign Trade Leonid Krasin on December 30, 1921. The U.S. Congress appropriated $20,000,000 for relief under the Russian Famine Relief Act of late 1921. At its peak, the ARA employed 300 Americans, more than 120,000 Russians and fed 10.5 million people daily. Its Russian operations were headed by Col. William N. Haskell. The Medical Division of the ARA functioned from November 1921 to June 1923 and helped overcome the typhus epidemic then ravaging Russia. The ARA's famine relief operations ran in parallel with much smaller Mennonite, Jewish and Quaker famine relief operations in Russia.See Lance Yoder's \"Historical Sketch\" in the online Mennonite Central Committee Photograph Collection See David McFadden et al., Constructive Spirit: Quakers in Revolutionary Russia, 2004 The ARA's operations in Russia were shut down on June 15, 1923, after it was discovered that Russia renewed the export of grain.Charles M. Edmondson, \"An Inquiry into the Termination of Soviet Famine Relief Programmes and the Renewal of Grain Export, 1922\u201323\", Soviet Studies, Vol. 33, No. 3 (1981), pp. 370\u2013385 == 1930s == Areas of most disastrous Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933 marked with black === Soviet famine of 1932\u20131933 === The second major Soviet famine happened during the initial push for collectivization during the 30s. Major causes include the 1932\u201333 confiscations of grain and other food by the Soviet authorities which contributed to the famine and affected more than forty million people, especially in the south on the Don and Kuban areas and in Ukraine, where by various estimates millions starved to death or died due to famine related illness (the event known as Holodomor). The famine was perhaps most severe in Kazakhstan where the semi-nomadic pastoralists' traditional way of life was most disturbed by Soviet agricultural ambitions.Gr\u00e1da, C. \u00d3. (2010). Famine: a short history. Princeton University Press. There is still debate over whether or not Holodomor was a massive failure of policy or a deliberate act of genocide. Robert Conquest held the view that the famine was not intentionally inflicted by Stalin, but \"with resulting famine imminent, he could have prevented it, but put \u201cSoviet interest\u201d other than feeding the starving first\u2014thus consciously abetting it\". Michael Ellman's analysis of the famine found that \"there is some evidence that in 1930-33 ... Stalin also used starvation in his war against the peasants\", which he calls a \"conscious policy of starvation\", but concludes that there were several factors, primarily focusing on the leadership's culpability in continuing to prioritize collectivization and industrialization over preventing mass death , due to their Leninist stance of regarding starvation \"as a necessary cost of the progressive policies of industrialisation and the building of socialism\", and thus did not \"perceive the famine as a humanitarian catastrophe requiring a major effort to relieve distress and hence made only limited relief efforts.\" Similarly, Mark Tauger concludes that the famine was not intentional genocide but the result of failed economic policy: There is also the controversial argument by Douglas Tottle, a Canadian Communist Party member, that the famine was significantly worsened by the actions of the kulaks, a class of peasants who had become wealthy after the Stolypin reform, many of whom burned their crops and killed their livestock rather than give their lands and livestock over to collectivization.Tottle, Douglas \"Fraud, Famine and Fascism: The Ukrainian Genocide Myth from Hitler to Harvard.\" Progress Books (1987) Tottle's book has been severely criticised. David Patrikarakos, writing in the New Republic, called it \"revisionism\" and compared it to Soviet propaganda.. Former Harvard professor, Frank Sysyn, states that \"the book was likely compiled in the Soviet Union\" and Soviet-sponsored as a response to the release of Robert Conquest's book The Harvest of Sorrow which argues that the famine was man-made. === Demographic impact === The demographic impact of the famine of 1932\u20131933 was multifold. In addition to direct and indirect deaths associated with the famine, there were significant internal migrations of Soviet citizens, often fleeing famine-ridden regions. A sudden decline in birthrates permanently \"scarred\" the long-term population growth of the Soviet Union in a way similar to, although not as severe, as that of World War 2. Estimates of Soviet deaths attributable to the 1932\u20131933 famine vary wildly, but are typically given in the range of millions. Vallin et al. estimated that the disasters of the decade culminated in a dramatic fall in fertility and a rise in mortality. Their estimates suggest that total losses can be put at about 4.6 million, 0.9 million of which was due to forced migration, 1 million to a deficit in births, and 2.6 million to exceptional mortality.Vallin, Jacques; Mesl\u00e9, France; Adamets, Serguei; Pyrozhkov, Serhii (2002). A New Estimate of Ukrainian Population Losses during the Crises of the 1930s and 1940s. The long-term demographic consequences of collectivization and the Second World War meant that the Soviet Union's 1989 population was 288 million rather than 315 million, 9% lower than it otherwise would have been. In addition to the deaths, the famine resulted in massive population movements, as about 300,000 Kazakh nomads fled to China, Iran, Mongolia and Afghanistan during the famine.Kokaisl, Petr. \"Soviet collectivisation and its specific focus on central Asia.\" AGRIS on-line Papers in Economics and Informatics 5.4 (2013): 121.Thomas, Alun. Kazakh Nomads and the New Soviet State, 1919-1934. Diss. University of Sheffield, 2015. Although famines were taking place in various parts of the USSR in 1932\u20131933, for example in Kazakhstan, parts of Russia and the Volga German Republic, the name Holodomor is specifically applied to the events that took place in territories populated by Ukrainians and also North Caucasian Kazakhs. === Legacy === The legacy of Holodomor remains a sensitive and controversial issue in contemporary Ukraine where it is regarded as an act of genocide by the government and is generally remembered as one of the greatest tragedies in the nation's history.Kupfer, Matthew, and Thomas de Waal. \"Crying Genocide: Use and Abuse of Political Rhetoric in Russia and Ukraine.\" (2014). The issue of Holodomor being an intentional act of genocide or not has often been a subject of dispute between the Russian Federation and Ukrainian government. The modern Russian government has generally attempted to disassociate and downplay any links between itself and the famine. == 1940s == During the Siege of Leningrad by Nazi Germany, as many as one million people died while many more went hungry or starved but survived. Germans tried to starve out Leningrad in order to break its resistance. Starvation was one of the primary causes of death as the food supply was cut off and strict rationing was enforced. Animals in the city were slaughtered and eaten. Instances of cannibalism were reported. The last major famine in the USSR happened mainly in 1947 as a cumulative effect of consequences of collectivization, war damage, the severe drought in 1946 in over 50 percent of the grain-productive zone of the country and government social policy and mismanagement of grain reserves. The regions primarily affected were Transnistria in Moldova and South Eastern Ukraine. Between 100,000 and one million people may have perished. == 1947\u20131991 == There were no famines after 1947. The drought of 1963 caused panic slaughtering of livestock, but there was no risk of famine. After that year the Soviet Union started importing feed grains for its livestock in increasing amounts. == Post-Soviet Russia == Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, there have been occasional issues with hunger and food security in Russia. In 1992 there was a notable decline in calorie intake within the Russian Federation. Both Russia and Ukraine have been subject to a series of severe droughts from July 2010 to 2015. The 2010 drought saw wheat production fall by 20% in Russia and subsequently resulted in a temporary ban on grain exports. == See also == * 1921\u201322 famine in Tatarstan * Famine in Kazakhstan of 1932\u201333 * Holodomor * Hunger Plan * List of famines * Russian famine of 1921 * Siege of Leningrad * Soviet famine of 1932\u201333 * Soviet famine of 1946\u201347 * Trofim Lysenko === Notable victims === * Aleksey Shakhmatov * Alexander Blok == References == === Footnotes === === Notations === * * * == External links == * * Art and photographs from the Great Famine * The Years of Hunger: Soviet Agriculture, 1931\u20131933 Category:Economic crises in Europe Russia Category:History of the Soviet Union Category:Disasters in Russia Category:Agriculture in the Soviet Union Russia ",
