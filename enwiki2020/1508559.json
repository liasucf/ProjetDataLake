    "text": "Gerald Michael Edmonton (born Gerald McCrohan, October 24, 1946 \u2013 November 28, 1993) was the drummer for the rock band Steppenwolf. He was born in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. Both his brother Dennis, also known as Mars Bonfire, and he changed their surnames to Edmonton during the 1960s, when they performed in a group called The Sparrows. John Kay and Goldy McJohn joined this group in Toronto in 1965 and, after some more changes in personnel and relocating to California, the group was renamed Steppenwolf. When Steppenwolf temporarily broke up on February 14, 1972, Edmonton and Steppenwolf organist Goldy McJohn formed the band Seven with singer Lance Gullickson and guitarist Robin Huff. After Seven, Edmonton, and McJohn formed Manbeast with Rod Prince and Roy Cox of Bubble Puppy before Steppenwolf reconvened in 1974 for three albums before breaking up again in 1976. Edmonton married former Steppenwolf bandmate Andy Chapin's widow in the 1980s. Edmonton died in a car accident in Santa Ynez, California in 1993. ==Studio albums== *Presenting Jack London & The Sparrows 1965 Capitol Records *Steppenwolf 1968 U.S. #6 U.K. #59 Gold Dunhill Records *The Second 1968 U.S. #3 Gold Dunhill Records *John Kay & The Sparrow 1969 Capitol Records *At Your Birthday Party 1969 U.S. #7 Gold Dunhill Records *Monster 1969 U.S. #17 U.K. #43 Gold Dunhill Records *7 1970 U.S. #19 Gold Dunhill Records *For Ladies Only 1971 U.S. #54 Dunhill Records *Slow Flux 1974 U.S. #47 Mums Records *Hour of the Wolf 1975 U.S. #155 Epic Records *Skullduggery 1976 Epic Records ==Live albums== *Early Steppenwolf 1969 (recorded in 1967 as The Sparrow) U.S. #29 Dunhill Records *Steppenwolf Live 1970 U.S. #7 U.K. #16 Gold Dunhill Records ==Compilations== *Gold: Their Great Hits 1971 U.S. #24 Gold Dunhill Records *Rest In Peace 1972 U.S. #62 Dunhill Records *16 Greatest Hits 1973 U.S. #152 Gold Dunhill Records *The ABC Collection 1976 ABC Records *Reborn To Be Wild 1976 Epic Records *Born to Be Wild - A Retrospective 1991 MCA Records *All Time Greatest Hits 1999 MCA Records *20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection: The Best of Steppenwolf 2000 Gold Universal Music Group *Steppenwolf Gold 2005 Geffen Records ==Singles== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\" |- !Release date !A-side !B-side !US Billboard Hot 100 Peak !UK Singles Chart Peak |- | 1967 | \"A Girl I Knew\" (Kay/Cavett) | \"The Ostrich\" (Kay) | | |- | 1968 | \"Born to Be Wild\" (Bonfire) | \"Everybody's Next One\" (Kay/Mekler) | #2 | #30 |- | 1968 | \"Sookie Sookie\" (Covay/Cropper) | \"Take What You Need\" (Kay/Mekler) | | |- | 1968 | \"Magic Carpet Ride\" (Moreve/Kay) | \"Sookie Sookie\" (Covay/Cropper) | #3 | |- | 1969 | \"Rock Me\" (Kay) | \"Jupiter Child\" (Monarch/Kay/Edmonton) | #10 | |- | 1969 | \"It's Never Too Late\" (St. Nicholas/Kay) | \"Happy Birthday\" (Mekler) | #51 | |- | 1969 | \"Move Over\" (Kay/Mekler) | \"Power Play\" (Kay) | #31 | |- | 1969 | \"Monster\" (Kay/Edmonton/St. Nicholas/Byrom) | \"Berry Rides Again\" (Kay) | #39 | |- | 1970 | \"Hey Lawdy Mama\" (Kay/Byrom/Edmonton) | \"Twisted\" (Kay) | #35 | |- | 1970 | \"Screaming Night Hog\" (Kay) | \"Spiritual Fantasy\" (Kay) | #62 | |- | 1970 | \"Who Needs Ya\" (Byrom/Kay) | \"Earschplittenloudenboomer\" (Byrom) | #54 | |- | 1970 | \"Snowblind Friend\" (Axton) | \"Hippo Stomp\" (Byrom/Kay) | | |- | 1971 | \"Ride With Me\" (Bonfire) | \"For Madmen Only\" | #52 | |- | 1971 | \"For Ladies Only\" (Edmonton/Henry/Kay/McJohn) | \"Sparkle Eyes\" (Biondo/Kay) | #64 | |- | 1974 | \"Straight Shootin' Woman\" (Edmonton) | \"Justice Don't Be Slow\" (Kay/Richie) | #29 | |- | 1975 | \"Get Into The Wind\" (Cochran/Van Beek) | \"Morning Blue\" (Biondo) | | |- | 1975 | \"Smokey Factory Blues\" (Hammond/Hazlewood) | \"A Fool's Fantasy\" (McJohn) | | |- | 1975 | \"Caroline (Are You Ready)\" (Bonfire) | \"Angeldrawers\" | | |- | 1979 | \"Brand New Key\" | | | |- | 1984 | \"Good That You're Gone\" | | | |} ==References== Category:1946 births Category:1993 deaths Category:Musicians from Oshawa Category:Canadian rock drummers Category:Canadian male drummers Category:Road incident deaths in California Category:Steppenwolf (band) members Category:20th-century Canadian drummers ",
