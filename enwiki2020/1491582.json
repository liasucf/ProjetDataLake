    "text": "Swimming as usual was one of the three aquatics disciplines at the 1980 Summer Olympics\u2014the other two being Water Polo and Diving. It was held in the Swimming Pool of the Olimpiysky Sports Complex between July 20 and July 27. There was a total of 333 participants from 41 countries competing. Because the number of participants was reduced by the boycott, FINA broke format by doing away with the semifinals. Instead, the top 8 finishers from the heats qualified directly for the final, or final A as it was called. In events up to 400m, those that finished 9th to 16th in the heats would swim in Final B for the 9th place after the swimmers from Final A swam. This would continue as the Olympic format up to the 1996 Olympic Games. == Events == == Participating nations == 333 swimmers from 41 nations competed. == Medal table == ==Men's events== {| |- | 100 m freestyle | || 50.40 | || 50.91 | || 51.29 |- | 200 m freestyle | || 1:49.81 | || 1:50.76 | || 1:51.60 |- | 400 m freestyle | || 3:51.31 | || 3:53.24 | || 3:53.95 |- | 1500 m freestyle | || 14:58.27 | || 15:14.30 | || 15:14.49 |- | 100 m backstroke | || 56.53 | || 56.99 | || 57.63 |- | 200 m backstroke | || 2:01.93 | || 2:02.40 | || 2:03.14 |- | 100 m breaststroke | || 1:03.34 | || 1:03.82 | || 1:03.96 |- | 200 m breaststroke | || 2:15.85 | || 2:16.93 | || 2:17.28 |- | 100 m butterfly | || 54.92 | || 54.94 | || 55.13 |- | 200 m butterfly | || 1:59.76 | || 2:01.20 | || 2:01.39 |- | 400 m individual medley | || 4:22.89 | || 4:23.43 | || 4:24.24 |-valign=\"top\" | 4 \u00d7 200 m freestyle relay | Sergey Kopliakov Vladimir Salnikov Ivar Stukolkin Andrey Krylov Sergey Rusin* Sergey Krasyuk* Yuri Presekin* || 7:23.50 | Frank Pf\u00fctze J\u00f6rg Woithe Detlev Grabs Rainer Strohbach Frank K\u00fchne* || 7:28.60 | Jorge Fernandes Marcus Mattioli Cyro Marques Djan Madruga || 7:29.30 |-valign=\"top\" | 4 \u00d7 100 m medley relay | Mark Kerry Peter Evans Mark Tonelli Neil Brooks Glenn Patching* || 3:45.70 | Viktor Kuznetsov Arsens Miskarovs Yevgeny Seredin Sergey Kopliakov Vladimir Shemetov* Aleksandr Fedorovsky* Aleksey Markovsky* Sergey Krasyuk* || 3:45.92 | Gary Abraham Duncan Goodhew David Lowe Martin Smith Paul Marshall* Mark Taylor* || 3:47.71 |} * Swimmers who participated in the heats only and received medals. ==Women's events== {| |- | 100 m freestyle | || 54.79 | || 55.16 | || 55.65 |- | 200 m freestyle | || 1:58.33 | || 1:59.64 | || 2:01.44 |- | 400 m freestyle | || 4:08.76 | || 4:09.16 | || 4:10.86 |- | 800 m freestyle | || 8:28.90 | || 8:32.55 | || 8:33.48 |- | 100 m backstroke | || 1:00.86 | || 1:02.07 | || 1:02.64 |- | 200 m backstroke | || 2:11.77 | || 2:13.75 | || 2:14.14 |- | 100 m breaststroke | || 1:10.22 | || 1:10.41 | || 1:11.16 |- | 200 m breaststroke | || 2:29.54 | || 2:29.61 | || 2:32.39 |- | 100 m butterfly | || 1:00.42 | || 1:00.90 | || 1:01.44 |- | 200 m butterfly | || 2:10.44 | || 2:10.45 | || 2:11.66 |- | 400 m individual medley | || 4:36.29 | || 4:46.83 | || 4:48.17 |-valign=\"top\" | 4 \u00d7 100 m freestyle relay | Barbara Krause Caren Metschuck Ines Diers Sarina H\u00fclsenbeck Carmela Schmidt* || 3:42.71 | Carina Ljungdahl Tina Gustafsson Agneta M\u00e5rtensson Agneta Eriksson Birgitta J\u00f6nsson* Helena Peterson* || 3:48.93 | Conny van Bentum Wilma van Velsen Reggie de Jong Annelies Maas || 3:49.51 |-valign=\"top\" | 4 \u00d7 100 m medley relay | Rica Reinisch Ute Geweniger Andrea Pollack Caren Metschuck Sarina H\u00fclsenbeck* || 4:06.67 | Helen Jameson Margaret Kelly Ann Osgerby June Croft || 4:12.24 | Yelena Kruglova Elvira Vasilkova Alla Grishchenkova Natalya Strunnikova Irina Aksyonova* Olga Klevakina* || 4:13.61 |} * Swimmers who participated in the heats only and received medals. == Gallery of the medalists == Some of the Olympic medalists in Moscow: File:J\u00f6rg Woithe 1979.jpg|J\u00f6rg Woithe, winner of the 100-metre freestyle.
