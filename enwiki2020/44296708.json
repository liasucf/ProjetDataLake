The Express, a Pacific Division team in the Major Arena Soccer League, played their home games at Turlock Indoor Soccer in Turlock, California. The team was led by general manager Matt Warner and head coach Art Pulido. The Surge finished the regular season with a 9\u201311 record, good enough for 4th place in the MASL's Pacific Division but not enough to qualify for post-season play. ==Season summary== The team opened the 2014\u201315 season with a road loss to the Las Vegas Legends then won their next three games before dropping the three after that. The Sacramento Surge accounted for two of those three wins. The team regained its footing, winning 3 out of the next 4, but 4 consecutive losses in January put the team below .500 on the season and ended their playoff hopes. The team's 9\u201311 record includes a surprising 9 road losses. Turlock's only road win came early in the season at Sacramento. ==History== The Express was founded as an expansion team for the Professional Arena Soccer League's 2011\u201312 season. Based in the league's smallest market, the team went 10\u20139 its first season and 9\u20137 the second, reaching the playoffs both times. The Express started the 2013\u201314 season strong with a pair of wins but then lost their next 7 consecutive games. The team improved in the second half of the season, Turlock finishing the season with a 5\u201311 record and averaging 521 fans per home game, but did not qualify for the playoffs. ==Off-field moves== In May 2014, the Professional Arena Soccer League added six teams from the failed third incarnation of the Major Indoor Soccer League and reorganized as the Major Arena Soccer League. With the league expansion and reorganization, the other Pacific teams for 2014\u201315 are California-based Ontario Fury, Sacramento Surge, and San Diego Sockers plus the Las Vegas Legends and the expansion Seattle Impact. The Impact's assets were purchased mid-season and the team replaced on the schedule by the Tacoma Stars. ==Roster moves== Defender and assistant coach Enrique \"Queeks\" Tovar was released by the team on January 29. ==Schedule== ===Regular season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40\" | Game ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Day ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"110\" | Date ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Kickoff ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Opponent ! colspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Results ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"240\" | Location ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" | Attendance |- ! width=\"120\" | Score ! width=\"60\" | Record |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 1 | Sunday | October 26 | 3:00pm | at Las Vegas Legends | L 6\u20137 (SO) | 0\u20131 | Orleans Arena | 1,125 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 2 | Saturday | November 1 | 7:05pm | Sacramento Surge | W 11\u20138 | 1\u20131 | Turlock Indoor Soccer | 460 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 3 | Friday | November 14 | 7:35pm | Seattle Impact | W 11\u20135 | 2\u20131 | Turlock Indoor Soccer | 569 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 4 | Saturday | November 22 | 7:05pm | at Sacramento Surge | W 12\u20133 | 3\u20131 | McClellan Park | 447 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 5 | Friday | November 28 | 7:30pm | at Seattle Impact | L 3\u20138 | 3\u20132 | ShoWare Center | 204 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 6 | Saturday | December 6 | 7:05pm | at San Diego Sockers | L 4\u20135 | 3\u20133 | Valley View Casino Center | 2,570 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 7 | Sunday | December 7 | 3:05pm | at Ontario Fury | L 6\u20139 | 3\u20134 | Citizens Business Bank Arena | 1,952 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 8 | Friday | December 12 | 7:35pm | Las Vegas Legends | W 6\u20135 | 4\u20134 | Turlock Indoor Soccer | 532 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 9 | Friday | December 19 | 7:35pm | Sacramento Surge | W 10\u20135 | 5\u20134 | Turlock Indoor Soccer | 493 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 10 | Saturday | December 20 | 7:05pm | at Sacramento Surge | L 5\u201313 | 5\u20135 | McClellan Park | 375 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 11 | Saturday | December 27 | 7:05pm | Ontario Fury | W 9\u20138 (OT) | 6\u20135 | Turlock Indoor Soccer | 498 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 12 | Tuesday | December 30 | 7:00pm | at Las Vegas Legends | L 5\u20137 | 6\u20136 | Orleans Arena | 1,997 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 13 | Friday | January 9 | 7:35pm | Seattle Impact | W 16\u20135 | 7\u20136 | Turlock Indoor Soccer | 492 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 14 | Sunday | January 11 | 5:05pm | Las Vegas Legends | W 8\u20137 (OT) | 8\u20136 | Turlock Indoor Soccer | 517 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 15 | Saturday | January 17 | 7:05pm | at Ontario Fury | L 6\u201310 | 8\u20137 | Citizens Business Bank Arena | 1,911 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 16 | Friday | January 23 | 7:35pm | San Diego Sockers | L 3\u201310 | 8\u20138 | Turlock Indoor Soccer | 570 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 17 | Friday | January 30 | 7:35pm | Ontario Fury | L 5\u20138 | 8\u20139 | Turlock Indoor Soccer | 509 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 18 | Sunday | February 8 | 7:05pm | at Tacoma Stars | L 2\u201312 | 8\u201310 | ShoWare Center | 1,123 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 19 | Friday | February 13 | 7:35pm | Sacramento Surge | W 9\u20135 | 9\u201310 | Turlock Indoor Soccer | 385 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 20 | Saturday | February 14 | 7:05pm | at Sacramento Surge | L 8\u20139 (OT) | 9\u201311 | McClellan Park | 413 |} Seattle Impact shut down mid-season; franchise purchased by Tacoma Stars ==Awards and honors== Turlock defender Enrique Tovar was selected for the 2014-15 MASL All- League Third Team. ==References== ==External links== *Turlock Express official website *Turlock Express at Turlock City News *Turlock Express at Turlock Journal Category:Turlock Express seasons Turlock Express Turlock Express 2014 Turlock Express 2014 ",
