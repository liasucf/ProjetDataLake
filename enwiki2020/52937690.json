Their first EP was recorded with G\u00e1bor Szeifert on bass and drummer Zsolt Mih\u00e1ly, titled \"Butterflies EP\". The EP was found by Karmatronic, the founder of Karmatronic Records, and afterwards, Soulwave released the band's first single titled Lonely, and was subsequently contracted to prepare another song, which ultimately was not issued. Their first video clip was that of their song Lonely. ===First album and troubles: 2010\u20132012=== In 2010, their first album was released, titled One Night Stand. This first shows the rock and roll and blues influence that is an important element in Soulwaves' music. The album, however, did not bring a major success, and due to this the band was forced to shorter breaks, which were never officially announced. Fodor and Mih\u00e1ly still performed together, but they virtually and temporarily ceased Soulwave as a band. ===Changes: 2012\u20132015=== After returning from the hiatus, Fodor and Ocho Macho member Andr\u00e1s N\u00e9meth revived Soulwave and worked actively. After a number of domestic and foreign concerts, the Swedish Substream Records announced on the band's new EP, 1975, which began to show Soulwaves' contemporary influences. The EP was critically acclaimed in Hungary, and their subsequent singles, I Can't Be Loved and Gimme Gimme, both debuted on Pet\u0151fi Radio. Subsequently, the band has performed in several countries and made their domestic debut at festivals and senior clubs. Their first television appearances were in 2014 on the Magyar Telev\u00edzi\u00f3 show Szerencseszombat and Pet\u0151fi Radio and MR2 Akusztik entitled on live radio. ===Record deal and A Dal 2017: 2015\u2013present=== Soulwave in 2016 Domestic interest increased in Soulwave, which released its first Hungarian-language song, Sz\u00e9lcsend, which also debuted on Pet\u0151fi Radio and topped at 27th place on national music charts, which had a decisive influence on the band's decision to further record Hungarian songs.
