    "text": "Brilliant Detroit is a nonprofit organization based in Detroit, Michigan founded by Carolyn and Jim Bellinson and Cindy Eggleton that re-purposes houses and coordinates the evidence-based programs of partner organizations through them with the goal to prepare young children and their families for school, and to ensure that they are healthy and stable. The organization also makes sure that young children under its care are reading at grade level by the third grade. As of early 2019, it operates seven hubs, with 80 partners, and over 900 families. == Mission == Brilliant Detroit is dedicated to building \u201ckid success neighborhoods\u201d where families with children of up to eight years old have what they need to be school-ready, healthy, and stable. They do this by establishing and operating homes in high-need neighborhoods that offer proven programming to families and children. == History == Co- founders Carolyn and Jim Bellinson and Cindy Eggleton met in 2015 at the Early Childhood Education presentation that Eggleton gave to the Metro Detroit Jewish Fund. They identified the necessity for improved kindergarten readiness in city neighborhoods and developed their plan over the course of a year. The Bellinson's combined skills in business development and entrepreneurial scaling with Eggleton's early childhood expertise, formed the basis of this partnership. Envisioning a unique service delivery model in which the underused housing stock in Detroit could be reused to create early childhood and family centers in each neighborhood, they reached out to others for input and built a model \u201cwith, for, and by neighbors\u201d to deliver holistic services for kids ages 0\u20138 in their neighborhoods. Each home-based hub coordinates existing evidence-based programs around health, family support, and education. Brilliant Detroit became a formal 501(c)(3) nonprofit in January 2016 and launched its first house in the Warrendale/Cody Rouge neighborhood on the far west side of Detroit. After the first six months, Eggleton was named CEO as they prepared to launch a new location in the Chadsey-Condon/Southwest neighborhood. From 2016 to early 2019, the organization grew from two houses with five organizational partners, and 50 participating families to seven houses, 80 organizational partners, and over 900 participating families. More staff joined to oversee roles such as social media, volunteer and donor stewardship, finances, outreach, operations, and special projects. As of January 2019, the organization has 12 communities on its waitlist for a new house. It is actively searching for new houses on the eastside of Detroit, and is in conversation with other U.S. cities to support new \u201cBrilliant\u201d programs outside of Detroit. == Philosophy and model == Brilliant Detroit's business model is focused on service delivery which is achieved by recognizing the hundreds of evidence-based organizations throughout Metro Detroit and thousands across the country. Despite these programs, at the time of Brilliant Detroit's launch, 60% of Detroit's children were living in poverty, only 14% of students were reading at grade level by third grade, and most were not ready for kindergarten; all of which reduce a child's chances of high school graduation and later success in life. National early childhood policy recommends holistic, whole-family approaches to programming that incorporate education, health, and family support focuses, not just for children but for their caregivers as well. While many such services were available to Detroit families, few were coordinated and continuous along the early childhood years and low car ownership rates and lack of mass transportation outside of a bus system made it difficult for families with children to access these programs throughout the city. Brilliant Detroit sought to coordinate these existing resources out of houses for accessibility and welcoming atmospheres rather than the usual institutional settings generally available for early childhood work and could also be positioned in the middle of neighborhoods, near homes, parks, and schools. In addition to coordinating existing, evidence-based programs, Brilliant Detroit's model is \u201cwith, for and by\u201d neighbors, based in part on Magnolia Place's model of neighbor-led community organizing. The organization does not launch a new house until invited into the neighborhood by a local organization and after conducting as many as 12 listening sessions with block clubs, local social service agencies, and unaffiliated neighbors. After launching a house, Brilliant Detroit staff organize a local advisory team of neighbors to provide feedback on programming and community needs and identify priorities to advance the work in the Brilliant Detroit house and the neighborhood. In this way, Brilliant Detroit organizes social structures with, for, and by neighbors, finding that few people are as passionate about any given neighborhood than the individuals and groups living there already. Aligning resources behind neighborhood leadership is seen has having the greatest chance of expanding opportunities for success among individuals, families, and communities. == Partners and programming == Brilliant Detroit coordinates programs through their houses into the following four categories: education, health, family support, and community-building. As of January 2019, partners include local organizations (Central Detroit Christian, Chadsey Condon Community Organization, Cody Rouge Action Alliance, Mohican Regent Community Group, and the like); schools (Munger Elementary School, Southwest Community Schools, and the like); and other entities that support with outreach to participants and volunteers (Osborn Neighborhood Alliance, Repair the World, and the like). The programs offered by these partners buttress at least one of the following groups of participants: children only, adults only, and children and adults together. == Education == Brilliant Detroit's educational programs range from Play and Learns for families and children (CARE of Michigan, Detroit Parent Network, and the like) and parenting workshops (DPTV PreSchool U, Wayne Metro, and the like) to online childhood literacy support (ABC Mouse) and after-school high dosage tutoring (Center for Success Network), among other programs. The organization also partners with national organizations such as LENA Start and Raising a Reader to build early literacy and family reading habits, respectively. Finally, Brilliant Detroit serves as the backbone organization of the 313Reads grade level reading campaign, through which they work with organizations such as the United Way for Southeastern Michigan, other programming partners, and local neighborhood associations to ensure that Detroit students are reading at grade level by third grade. == Health == The organization's health programming is focused on nutrition and gardening (Forgotten Harvest, Henry Ford Hospital System, Keep Growing Detroit, and the like), physical fitness (Wayne State Center for Health and Community Impact, Michigan Fitness Foundations, and independent facilitators of activities such as yoga and Zumba), social emotional and mental health support groups (Adult Well-Being, Black Mothers Breastfeeding Association, Michigan State University Building Early Emotional Skills, and the like), and other topics. Brilliant Detroit also partners with Make Your Date to provide health education and other supports for pregnant women to ensure that they make their due date. == Family support == Family support programs include financial workshops (Accounting Aid, Family Independence Initiative, and the like), parent leadership workshops (Detroit Parent Network, Parent Cafe, etc.), monthly community meals and Mom-2-Mom Clubs organized by Brilliant Detroit staff. == Finances == When it launched in 2016, Brilliant Detroit was funded solely by the Bellinsons to ensure that it could develop their model with fidelity before seeking external funding. By fall 2017, the organization was ready to go public with their income sources and held their inaugural housewarming fundraising event on October 5 just outside of Detroit. With a goal of raising $100,000, it instead raised $1.5 million, thanks in large part to an unsolicited donation of $1 million from an anonymous donor who attended the event. Since then, Brilliant Detroit has had other fundraising events and campaigns both online and in-person, allowing them to finance their expansion through the city. == References == Category:2016 establishments in Michigan Category:Non-profit organizations based in Michigan Category:Organizations based in Detroit ",
