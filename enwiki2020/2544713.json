Subsequently, sultan of Gujarat took over all the islands, which were then conquered by the Portuguese. Following the continued support of England in the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, stemming from the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 and on the accession of a Catholic monarch in 1660, in 1661 the island of Mumbai was given to the British as part of a Royal Dowry, on the occasion of the marriage of King Charles II of England with the Portuguese Princess Infanta Catherine of Braganza. The island of Mumbai, was then to remain part of British Raj until 15 August 1947, the day India celebrates annually as Indian Independence day, when it became an autonomous dominion, experiencing the dawn of independence from foreign rule see History of the Republic of India.
