    "text": "Nonclassic eicosanoids are biologically active signaling molecules made by oxygenation of twenty-carbon fatty acids other than the classic eicosanoids. ==Terminology== : \"Eicosanoid\" is the collective term for oxygenated derivatives of three different 20-carbon essential fatty acids-- Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), Arachidonic acid (AA) and Dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA). Current usage limits the term to the leukotrienes (LT) and three types of prostanoids--prostaglandins (PG) prostacyclins (PGI), and thromboxanes (TX). However, several other classes can technically be termed eicosanoid, including the eoxins, hepoxilins, resolvins, isofurans, isoprostanes, lipoxins, epi-lipoxins, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and endocannabinoids. LTs and prostanoids are sometimes termed 'classic eicosanoids' in contrast to the 'novel', 'nonclassic' or 'eicosanoid-like' eicosanoids. The classic eicosanoids are autocrine and paracrine mediators, active at micromolar concentrations (or lower), produced with high stereospecificity. They are produced from EFAs (chiefly AA) from either cyclooxygenase (COX) or 5-lipoxygenase. Broadly, the nonclassic eicosanoids are the products of 20-carbon EFAs and * Other oxygenation enzymes, (eoxins, hepoxilins, resolvins, lipoxins, epi-lipoxins, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs)); * Uncatalyzed oxygenation reactions, (isofurans, isoprostanes, phytoprostanes); * Addition reactions other than oxygenation (endocannabinoids). Also included are * Side products from the classic eicosanoid biosynthesis, (levuglandins, Oxoeicosanoids); * Reactions between other fatty acids and these pathways (the COX products of pinolenic and mead acid). ==See also== *Docosanoids ==References== Category:Eicosanoids ",
