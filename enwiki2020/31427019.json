    "text": "The Grammy Award for Best Banda or Norte\u00f1o Album was an award presented at the 2012 Grammy Awards, but was discontinued after that. When established in 2012, the award was the result of a major restructuring of Grammy categories, announced in 2011. It was the Recording Academy's wish to decrease the list of categories and awards, as the list had grown to well over 100 awards by 2011. According to the Academy, \"it was determined that musical distinctions among some of the regional Mexican subgenres were often very difficult to draw, so the restructuring in categories was warranted\".Grammy Awards Restructuring This award combined the previous categories for Best Banda Album and Best Norteno Album. Other Latin categories were also either merged or discontinued. Further restructuring took place in 2012 (and was implemented in the 2013 Grammy Award season). According to the Academy, \"Best Banda or Norte\u00f1o Album and Best Regional Mexican or Tejano Album are now merged into one category: Best Regional Mexican Music Album (Including Tejano), for albums containing at least 51 percent playing time of new vocal or instrumental regional Mexican (banda, norte\u00f1o, corridos, gruperos, mariachi, ranchera, and Tejano) recordings.\"NARAS Press Release, 8 June 2012 As a result, the Best Banda or Norte\u00f1o Album category was discontinued. ==Recipients== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Year ! bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Performing artist ! bgcolor=\"#efefef\"|Work ! bgcolor=\"#efefef\" class=unsortable|Nominees ! bgcolor=\"#efefef\" class=unsortable|Ref. |- | align=\"center\"|2012 | Los Tigres Del Norte | Los Tigres del Norte and Friends | |align=\"center\"| |} ==See also== *Grammy Award for Best Regional Mexican or Tejano Album *Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop, Rock or Urban Album *Grammy Award for Best Tropical Latin Album ==References== == External links == * Official Site of the Grammy Awards Category:Awards established in 2012 Category:Awards disestablished in 2012 Category:Banda music Category:Former awards Banda Norteno Album Banda Norteno Album Category:Norte\u00f1o (music) ",
