It was released on 25 September 2015 through Resist and Epitaph Records, and was streamed online on 20 September. The album was produced by George Hadji- Christou. The band sought to change their established style with Ire, and reviewers have noted the inclusion of new influences. At the J Awards of 2015, the album was nominated for Australian Album of the Year. ==Composition== ===Influences, style and themes=== Ire marks a change from the style established on the band's previous records. In an interview with Music Feeds, frontman Winston McCall stated: \"...in the past ... [when] we took the influence we had and then we put it into the context of what the Parkway Drive formula was, then that influence got mixed or buried or lost amongst the other stuff. This time around when any influence or unorthodox idea came about we simply ran with it in its whole form and tried to form a concept around that, rather than try to squash it into the pre-existing formula. That became basically the conceptual approach for making this entire record. ... When you're playing the same style of riff, the same drumming, the same vocals and same breakdowns for ten years, what point is there in people listening to your new record or even recording one if it sounds the exact same as the last one?\" The album has been described as moving \"away from the shackles of 'metalcore'\", as well as representing a \"refreshing take on metalcore\" and being \"decidedly more metal than metal-core on the whole\" and reminiscent of '80s metal. Connor McKenzie of Rip It Up calls Rage Against the Machine an influence on the album's direction, both musically and lyrically, with the album being centred thematically around anger as an appropriate reaction to the state of human society. Jaymz Clements of Rolling Stone Australia stated that \"the epic sweep of lead single \"Vice Grip\", the piano-led ponderous stomp of \"Writings on the Wall\" and the shiny bounce of \"Vicious\" ... showcase a muscular power-metal edge to [Parkway Drive].\" Brenton Harris of Music Feeds described \"Destroyer\" as showcasing \"Jeff Ling and Luke Kilpatrick's harmonised classic metal riffs clashing against a ferocious backdrop\", said that \"Dying To Believe\"'s \"chaotic juxtaposition of death-metal rhythmic patterns in the verses and pit-call inciting half-time chorus hit like a napalm bomb ..., simultaneously calling to mind Lamb of God, Slayer and Slipknot\" and highlighted the \"nu-metal tinged stomp of 'Writings on the Wall' ... which integrates spoken-word vocals, piano and classical instrumentation\". ==Release and promotion== Ire was announced on 8 June 2015, when the first song from the album, \"Vice Grip\", was released, accompanied by a music video. On 24 August, Parkway Drive released a second song, \"Crushed\", also accompanied by a video. On 14 September, the band released a third song, \"The Sound of Violence\". On 20 September, the album was streamed online in its entirety. Throughout 2015, the band headlined tours across Australia and the United States in support of the album. In May 2016, they supported A Day to Remember on their Just Some Shows tour of the U.S. On July 15, the band released a Deluxe Edition of the album, with 2 new tracks and a remix of the song \"A Deathless Song\" with guest vocals by Tonight Alive's Jenna McDougall. ==Critical reception== The album received positive reviews from critics. Already Heard rated the album 3 out of 5 and said: \"After beginning so promisingly, Ire ends up being a tale of two halves, and whilst this is disappointing I can still say hand on heart that I enjoyed listening to it. If you're already well acquainted with these guys then get this as well because it will give you joy. For everyone else, go with Horizons or Deep Blue for prime Parkway cuts.\" Distorted Sound scored the album 9 out of 10 and said: \"It's difficult to continuously break boundaries when you yourself set those boundaries in place with previous bodies of work, but that's exactly what PARKWAY DRIVE have done with Ire. Even if this album is to act as a transition record for the band for the new direction they wish to take it still stands tall amongst the rest of their back catalogue. It solidifies the Byron Bay lads as one of the most vital and impressive bands in the genre, and indeed in the entire heavy metal scene. If the changes made on Ire doesn't do it for you, then its probably best you re-evaluate before you lose interest in what is soon to be a shining example of just how well progression should be done.\" Alasdair Belling from KillYourStereo gave the album 80 out of 100 and said: \"Ire is the album Parkway Drive needed to produce to remain fresh and relevant. When approached from a purely musical perspective, this album is a fantastic, unique exploration into the world of metal. It's powerful, it's loud and despite all the change, it's Parkway Drive firing on every level.\" Louder Sound gave the album a positive review and stated: \"Despite the odd sidestep and inconsistency that stops it just shy of being a classic, Ire is an album that should be applauded for not only being a gallant effort that has seen Parkway Drive transcend the limits of metalcore, but also for producing moments of spectacle, which at their best result in the best songs of the band's career.\" ==Commercial performance== The album was included at number 21 on Rock Sounds top 50 releases of 2015 list.Bird, ed. 2016, p. 26 ==Touring== Parkway Drive have announced they will be touring Australia, North America and Europe (and doing one show in Auckland) in support of Ire. On the Australian leg of the tour, they will be supported by Thy Art Is Murder, Memphis May Fire and the Word Alive. On the NA leg, they will be supported by Miss May I, Thy Art Is Murder and In Hearts Wake. On the European leg, they will be supported by Bury Tomorrow in the United Kingdom and Architects in the rest of Europe, alongside Thy Art Is Murder. Suicide Silence was originally supposed to appear on the Australian leg in place of Thy Art Is Murder, but they dropped to support Korn on their 20th anniversary tour. == Track listing == ==Personnel== ;Parkway Drive * Winston McCall \u2013 lead vocals * Jeff Ling \u2013 lead guitar * Luke \"Pig\" Kilpatrick \u2013 rhythm guitar * Jia \"Pie\" O'Connor \u2013 bass * Ben \"Gaz\" Gordon \u2013 drums ;Additional musicians * Jenna McDougall of Tonight Alive \u2013 guest vocals on track 14 * Greg Weeks \u2013 cello, strings composition and arrangement * Tim Millar \u2013 piano * Christian Vachon \u2013 violin * Maria Demacheva \u2013 violin ;Additional personnel * George Hadji-Christou \u2013 production, strings composition and arrangement * Dean Hadji-Christou \u2013 engineering @ All Buttons In and Metalworks * Kevin Dietz \u2013 assistant engineering * Peter Rutcho \u2013 mixing * Ted Jensen \u2013 mastering * Callum Preston \u2013 artwork, creation, execution ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (2015) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 44 |- |} == References == ;Citations ;Sources * == External links == * Ire at Epitaph Category:2015 albums Category:Parkway Drive albums Category:Epitaph Records albums Category:Resist Records albums ",
