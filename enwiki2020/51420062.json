    "text": "Stephen J. Mackwell (born June 5, 1956) is a researcher in geophysics, specializing in laboratory-based studies of the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of geological materials. He is also interested in the transport of fluid components in mantle and crustal rocks on the microscopic and macroscopic scales, and on the effects of such components on mechanical properties.LPI Scientific Staff: Dr. Stephen Mackwell He has authored or co- authored over 80 articles in international scientific journals and is an editor of a book on comparative climatology of terrestrial planets published by the University of Arizona Press.Stephen J. Mackwell, Editor, University of Arizona Press ==Education== Stephen J. Mackwell received a B.Sc. in Physics and Mathematics in August 1978 at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. He continued his studies at the University of Canterbury and earned his M.Sc. in Physics in August 1979. His master's thesis was titled \"Excitation Temperatures for Late Type Stars.\" He went on to receive his Diploma of Education at Christchurch Teachers College in New Zealand in November 1979. He earned his Ph.D. in Geophysics in March 1985 from the Research School of Earth Sciences of the Australian National University, Canberra, Australia. His dissertation was titled \"Diffusion and Weakening Effects of Water in Quartz and Olivine.\"Lunar and Planetary Institute: Dr. Stephen Mackwell, Professional Background ==Early career== Stephen J. Mackwell worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York from 1984 to 1987, and then moved to the Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pennsylvania as an Assistant Professor in 1987 and subsequently Associate Professor of Geosciences in 1992. He was Program Director for Geophysics in the Earth Sciences Division at the National Science Foundation in Washington, D.C. from 1993-1994, and spent 1996 as an Alexander von Humboldt Fellow at the Bayerisches Geoinstitut in Bayreuth, Germany. In 1998, Mackwell became a Full Professor for Experimental Geophysics at the Bayerisches Geoinstitut at the University of Bayreuth. In January 2000 he was appointed Director of the Bayerisches Geoinstitut and served there until December 2002.Annual Report 2002 and List of Publications of the Research Institute of Experimental Geochemistry and Geophysics, University of Bayreuth ==Director of the Lunar and Planetary Institute== Stephen J.

In 2016, Louise Prockter became the Director of the LPI, and Mackwell was named as the USRA Corporate Director of Science Programs.USRA Names Louise M. Prockter Director of the Lunar and Planetary Institute Mackwell has served on the editorial board of several planetary science journals, including serving as editor-in-chief for the journal Geophysical Research Letters from 2002 to 2004. He currently serves on the advisory board for the journal Physics and Chemistry of Minerals.Physics and Chemistry of Minerals Editorial Board Mackwell has participated in the 2013\u20132022 Planetary Science Decadal Survey Steering Group and Inner Planets Panel.Vision and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013-2022. He is also a current member of the Space Studies Board, Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences, of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.Space Studies Board, Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences Mackwell has also been an Adjunct Professor in the Department of Earth Science at Rice University in Houston, Texas from July 2005 to present. ==American Institute of Physics== Since February 2019, Mackwell has served as the Deputy Executive Officer of the American Institute of Physics in College Park, MD. ==Honors== Stephen J. Mackwell has been named Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2017; Fellow of the American Geophysical Union in 2010; Stipendiat der Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung in Bayreuth, Germany in 1996; Minist\u00e8re de L'Education Nationale, Academie de Lille, Nomm\u00e9 Professeur in 1996; and Fellow of the Mineralogical Society of America in 1996. In 2016, Mackwell was honored by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) with the naming of main-belt asteroid 5292 Mackwell (formerly designated as 1991 AJ1).LPI Community News Feature: Mackwell Has Asteroid Named After Him Hitoshi Shiozawa and Minoru Kizawa originally discovered asteroid 5292 Mackwell on January 12, 1991, in Fujieda, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. 5292 Mackwell has an absolute magnitude of 11.9 and is part of the main asteroid belt, which is located between the orbits of planets Mars and Jupiter. ==Bibliography== Mackwell S.
