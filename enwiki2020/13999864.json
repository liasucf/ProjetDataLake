Since then, the magazine has won several awards and continues to expand its audience base. Published twice a year by KSU students, Fusion addresses sexual minority issues within the general population using illustrative photo essays and in-depth feature articles. Available in print and online, the magazine strives to unify people of different backgrounds through education and awareness. Past stories tackled political trends, religion and sexuality, domestic partner benefits, LGBT athletes in the NCAA, anti-discrimination policies, parents coming out to spouses and children, gay adoption, AIDS support groups, physical and mental health issues, social change and more. Its national advertisers have included the popular lesbian magazine, Curve, as well as Pride & Equality Magazine. == Grants == The Gay Community Endowment Fund of Akron Community Foundation awarded a $2,000 grant to Fusion in December 2006. GCEF's grant helped the magazine increase its circulation, exposing more college students to LGBT issues.
