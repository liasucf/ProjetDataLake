    "text": "Unione Calcio AlbinoLeffe is an Italian association football club representing Albino and Leffe, two small towns located in Val Seriana. The club played in Serie B for nine consecutive years and narrowly missed promotion in Serie A at the end of the 2007-08 season. It currently plays in Serie C and has been in the Italian third tier since its relegation in 2011-12. ==History== The club was created in 1998 as a result of the merger between former Serie C2 (fourth division) teams Albinese Calcio and Societ\u00e0 Calcio Leffe, respectively from Albino and Leffe, two neighboring towns. In their first season, the club finished 2nd in the Serie C2 and won a promotion having defeated A.C. Prato in the Girone A Play-offs final. After rising to Serie C1 (the Italian third division), they performed at the middle of the pack, finishing 9th in 2000 and 13th in 2001. However, in 2002, the Seriani went to the finals of the Coppa Italia Serie C, where they defeated Livorno 2\u20131 at home before losing 2\u20133 on the road. They won the tournament on the tiebreaker (most away goals scored). In league play they again finished 13th. In 2003, AlbinoLeffe, under coach Elio Gustinetti, finished second in league play before heading to the promotion play-off. There, they defeated Padua in the semifinals, then had a surprising triumph over Pisa Calcio, which pushed them up to Serie B. The team moved from the small Martinelli Stadium in Leffe, where they used to play home matches before promotion to Serie B, to the bigger Stadio Atleti Azzurri d'Italia located in Bergamo, the chief-town of the province where both Albino and Leffe are located. Even though AlbinoLeffe was considered to be an outsider in Serie B, which historically includes several former Scudetto winners, the team remarkably managed to avoid relegation in the last two seasons. In 2005\u20132006, after a great comeback in the second half of the season following the appointment of Emiliano Mondonico as new head coach, Albinoleffe ended the season in eighteenth place and managed to save itself from relegation by prevailing in the playouts against Avellino (score: 2\u20130, 2\u20133). The 2006\u20132007 Serie B campaign, the fourth consecutive for the small Lombard team, ended with a good tenth place, well ahead of the relegation zone. Historically, AlbinoLeffe's home games have been characterized by very low attendance, as shown by the average 2,400 spectators per game in the 2006\u201307 season, the most successful in the club history. With local hero Gustinetti back in charge of the team and despite a lineup composed of relative unknowns, the club's 2007\u201308 campaign started surprisingly well, with the team leading the Serie B table for a few weeks and arousing the interest of the national media, which began providing regular coverage of the team's games. This has thus far failed to improve the club's low home attendance, however. During the season, AlbinoLeffe confirmed as a potential candidate for direct promotion to Serie A, however a string of poor results, ended with four consecutive home defeats, the final one being a 0\u20134 loss to Rimini, denied them the chance to achieve a place in the top two, and persuaded club chairman Gianfranco Andreoletti to sack Gustinetti, who then confirmed not to be in good relationships with the chairman, and appoint youth team coach Armando Madonna as caretaker boss for the final regular season match and the following promotion playoffs. Even after a 1\u20130 loss to Brescia, AlbinoLeffe managed to win at home in the second leg (2\u20131) and qualified for the final against Lecce. In the first leg they suffered a 1\u20130 loss. On 15 June, the second match was played in Lecce and its result was 1\u20131, so AlbinoLeffe did not reach Serie A. At the end of the 2011\u201312 season, it was relegated to Lega Pro Prima Divisione after 9 consecutive years in Serie B. AlbinoLeffe following the systematic match fixing as a club controlled by Singapore-based organized crime was penalized 10 points in the 2012\u201313 Lega Pro Prima Divisione. ==Stadium and colors== Since 2003-04 season until 2019, AlbinoLeffe played its home games at the Atleti Azzurri d'Italia stadium in the city of Bergamo. Following Atalanta's renovation works on the stadium, the club reached a venue sharing agreement with Giana Erminio from the nearby city of Gorgonzola allowing the club to play their home matches for the 2019\u201320 Serie C season at the Stadio Citt\u00e0 di Gorgonzola. The club is also planning to move to a brand-new stadium to be built in the city of Zanica; the plan involves a small stadium with a capacity of 1,800 (with possibility to expand it to up to 5,500 in case of Serie B games), to be built next to the club's headquarters and training centre, and it was formally approved by the Italian National Olympic Committee on March 2019. The club's official colors are dark blue and azure blue, also used for home matches, while the outfit worn by the players for away matches is red and yellow. ==Players== ===Current squad=== ==Seasons== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Season !Div !Pos !colspan=\"7\"|League record !Other |- ! | | |P |W |D |L |F |A |Pts | |- !style=\"text-align: center;\"|1998\u201399 |style=\"text-align: center;\"|Serie C2/A |style=\"text-align: center; background-color: #ddffdd;\"|2nd |34||16||10||8||44||35||58 |promoted through playoffs |- !style=\"text-align: center;\"|1999-00 |style=\"text-align: center;\"|Serie C1/A |style=\"text-align: center;\"|9th |34||11||12||11||36||37||45 | |- !style=\"text-align: center;\"|2000\u201301 |style=\"text-align: center;\"|Serie C1/A |style=\"text-align: center;\"|13th |34||7||18||9||27||31||39 | |- !style=\"text-align: center;\"|2001\u201302 |style=\"text-align: center;\"|Serie C1/A |style=\"text-align: center;\"|13th |34||8||17||9||33||35||41 | |- !style=\"text-align: center;\"|2002\u201303 |style=\"text-align: center;\"|Serie C1/A |style=\"text-align: center; background-color: #ddffdd;\"|2nd |34||17||12||5||62||36||63 | |- !style=\"text- align: center;\"|2003\u201304 |style=\"text-align: center;\"|Serie B |style=\"text- align: center;\"|18th |46||13||15||18||47||59||54 | |- !style=\"text-align: center;\"|2004\u201305 |style=\"text-align: center;\"|Serie B |style=\"text-align: center;\"|11th |38||14||13||15||55||51||55 | |- !style=\"text-align: center;\"|2005\u201306 |style=\"text-align: center;\"|Serie B |style=\"text-align: center;\"|18th |38||10||16||16||38||52||46 |won relegation playoffs to Avellino |- !style=\"text-align: center;\"|2006\u201307 |style=\"text-align: center;\"|Serie B |style=\"text-align: center;\"|10th |38||11||20||11||46||48||53 | |- !style=\"text-align: center;\"|2007\u201308 |style=\"text-align: center;\"|Serie B |style=\"text-align: center;\"|4th |38||23||9||10||67||48||78 |lost promotion playoff finals to Lecce |- !style=\"text-align: center;\"|2008\u201309 |style=\"text- align: center;\"|Serie B |style=\"text-align: center;\"|9th |38||15||13||14||49||49||58 | |- !style=\"text-align: center;\"|2009\u201310 |style=\"text-align: center;\"|Serie B |style=\"text-align: center;\"|11th |42||14||13||15||59||56||55 | |- !style=\"text-align: center;\"|2010\u201311 |style=\"text-align: center;\"|Serie B |style=\"text-align: center;\"|18th |42||13||10||19||55||66||49 |won relegation playoff against Piacenza |- !style=\"text-align: center;\"|2011\u201312 |style=\"text-align: center;\"|Serie B |style=\"text-align: center; background-color: #ff8888;\"|22nd |42||6||12||24||39||60||30 |relegated to Lega Pro Prima Divisione |- !style=\"text-align: center;\"|2012\u201313 |style=\"text-align: center;\"|Serie C1/A |style=\"text-align: center;\"|6th |32||13||14||5||44||27||47 | |- !style=\"text- align: center;\"|2013\u201314 |style=\"text-align: center;\"|Serie C1/A |style=\"text- align: center;\"|7th |30||12||7||11||42||40||43 |lost in quarterfinals of promotion playoffs to Cremonese |- !style=\"text-align: center;\"|2014\u201315 |style=\"text-align: center;\"|Lega Pro/A |style=\"text-align: center;\"|20th |38||7||11||20||27||51||32 |relegated to Serie D, but reinstated in Lega Pro by Italian Football Federation |- !style=\"text-align: center;\"|2015\u201316 |style=\"text-align: center;\"|Lega Pro/A |style=\"text-align: center;\"|17th |34||4||8||22||23||57||20 |relegated to Serie D for the second time, but reinstated one more time in Lega Pro by Italian Football Federation |- !style=\"text-align: center;\"|2016\u201317 |style=\"text-align: center;\"|Lega Pro/B |style=\"text-align: center;\"|9th |38||12||16||10||38||34||52 | |- !style=\"text-align: center;\"|2017\u201318 |style=\"text-align: center;\"|Serie C/B |style=\"text-align: center;\"|5th |34||13||10||11||36||31||49 | |- !style=\"text-align: center;\"|2018\u201319 |style=\"text-align: center;\"|Serie C/B |style=\"text-align: center;\"|14th |38||9||16||13||31||35||43 | |} ==Former players== ==Former managers== ==Honours== *Coppa Italia Serie C :Winner in 2002 *Serie B :Play-off Finals in 2008 *Serie C1 :Promotion gained as runner- up in 2003 *Serie C2 :Promotion gained as runner-up in 1999 ==References== ==External links== *Official Website Category:Football clubs in Italy Category:Football clubs in Lombardy Category:Association football clubs established in 1998 Category:Serie B clubs Category:Serie C clubs Category:Sport in the Province of Bergamo Category:1998 establishments in Italy ",
