In 1876 it was taken over by the London School Board, which moved it to a new site in Silver Street, today the northern end of Kensington Church Street.Survey of London: Volume 37 In 1877 the original site of the school in Holland Park Road was sold by auction for \u00a32,650, and in its place was built the present Nos. 20\u201330 (even) Holland Park Road, a group of six two-storey studio residences arranged around a courtyard with an arched entrance, originally called \"The Studios\".Survey of London: Volume 37 The school moved a third time in 1937 to its present site on Kensington Place. ===Charles Richard Fox (1796-1873)=== A large new house completed in 1827 and named for a while \"Little Holland House\" was first occupied by Charles Richard Fox (1796-1873) (the illegitimate son of Henry Richard Vassall-Fox, 3rd Baron Holland, through a liaison with Lady Webster, whom Lord Holland later married) and his wife Lady Mary Fox, illegitimate daughter of King William IV. However this was actually at Number 1 Addison Road, at the north-eastern boundary of the Holland House estate, and it is probable he was persuaded to buy the freehold from his father in order to attract other high society occupants to the new development. He also purchased from his father much land surrounding the house. After his death in 1873 Number 1 Addison Road was mostly demolished and built upon, but part of the house survives as the club-house of Holland Park Tennis Club.'The Holland estate: To 1874', in Survey of London: Volume 37, Northern Kensington, ed.

British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vol37/pp101-126 ===Prinsep family=== In 1850 Henry Thoby Prinsep (1792\u20131878), a director of East India Company, obtained a 21-year lease on it from Henry Fox, 4th Baron Holland (1802-1859), of Holland House, thanks to the painter George Frederic Watts (1817-1904), a friend of both the Hollands and the Prinseps. Watts, the Prinseps and Henry's sisters-in-law such as Julia Margaret Cameron lived, worked and entertained here for 21 years, making it the centre of their salon. When the lease expired in 1871, the Prinseps moved out and the Hollands demolished the building. Thoby Prinsep then leased a large plot of land on Melbury Road (abutting the leasehold plot of Lord Leighton) from Henry Fox- Strangways, 5th Earl of Ilchester (the heir of the 4th Baron Holland), part of which he gave to Watts. On his plot, Watts commissioned Frederick Cockerell to build a new house which he named New Little Holland House, and in which he lived from 1876 until his death in 1904. The house was demolished in 1964 after failed attempts by the London County Council to place a building preservation order on it. In its place was built a block of flats designed by Austin Blomfield, named Kingfisher House, which continues to occupy the site. ==Notes== Category:Former houses in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Category:Country houses in London Category:Demolished buildings and structures in London Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1964 Category:Dower houses ",
