In such ceremonies, the Mishaguji were 'summoned' by one of the shrine's high-ranking priests, the Kan-no-Osa (\u795e\u9577, also Jinch\u014d) or Jinch\u014dkan (\u795e\u9577\u5b98), into persons or objects that would act as their vessels (yorishiro) for the duration of the ritual, being then 'dismissed' upon its completion. In addition to playing a role in Suwa Shrine's religious rites, the Mishaguji are also enshrined in 'Mishaguji Shrines' (\u5fa1\u793e\u5bae\u53f8\u793e Mishaguji-sha) found throughout the Lake Suwa region and its vicinity. Worship of kami with similar-sounding names are also attested in various localities throughout east and central Japan; indeed, such deities have been speculated to be related to the Mishaguji. The exact nature of the Mishaguji is a matter of debate. Medieval documents from the Upper Shrine seem to imply them to be lesser gods or spirits subordinate to the shrine's deity, Suwa Daimy\u014djin (a.k.a. Takeminakata), with post-medieval sources conflating them with Suwa Daimy\u014djin's children; indeed, 'Mishaguji' was often interpreted as an epithet of these gods during the early modern period. In addition, outside of Suwa Shrine the Mishaguji were also worshiped as, among other things, god(s) of boundaries and tutelary protectors (ubusunagami) of local communities. In this regard they are functionally similar to the guardian gods known as D\u014dsojin or Sai-no-kami. Upon becoming the focus of intense study during the modern period (especially during the postwar era), various theories as to the origins and original nature of Mishaguji worship and its relation to Suwa Shrine began to be put forward by local historians and other scholars. One theory for instance claims that they were originally deities of fertility or agriculture, another proposes that the Mishaguji were viewed as spirits that inhabited sacred rocks or trees, while yet another claims that 'Mishaguji' originally denoted an impersonal, empowering force in present in nature analogous to the Austronesian concept of mana. As phallic stone rods (\u77f3\u68d2 sekib\u014d) dating from the J\u014dmon period and similar prehistoric artifacts are employed as cult objects (shintai) in some Mishaguji-related shrines in Suwa and other areas, a number of authors have speculated that Mishaguji worship may ultimately originate from J\u014dmon religious beliefs. A few even surmise that the Mishaguji were already being worshiped in Suwa before the cult of Takeminakata - claimed here to be a later import - was introduced into the region; the appearance of the Mishaguji in the Upper Shrine's rites are seen by these scholars to be a relic of original local beliefs. These assumptions, however, have recently come into question. ==Names== Multiple variants of the name 'Mishaguji' exist such as 'Mishaguchi', 'Misaguchi', 'Misaguji', 'Mishakuji', 'Misakuji(n)', or 'Omishaguji'.Moriya, Sanae (1991). Moriya Jinch\u014dke no ohanashi (\u5b88\u77e2\u795e\u9577\u5bb6\u306e\u304a\u8a71\u3057). In Jinch\u014dkan Moriya Historical Museum (Ed.). Jinch\u014dkan Moriya Shiry\u014dkan no shiori (\u795e\u9577\u5b98\u5b88\u77e2\u8cc7\u6599\u9928\u306e\u3057\u304a\u308a) (Rev. ed.). p. 4.\u014cwa (1990). p. 189.Miyasaka (1987). p. 24. There are also various ways of rendering the name in kanji such as \u5fa1\u5de6\u53e3\u795e, \u5fa1\u4f5c\u795e, \u5fa1\u793e\u5bae\u795e, or \u5fa1\u793e\u5bae\u53f8, with \u5fa1\u5de6\u53e3\u795e being the commonly used form in medieval documents penned by the Suwa Shrine priesthood. Outside Suwa, deities thought to be related to the Mishaguji with names such as '(O)shaguji', '(O)shagoji', '(O)sang\u016bji', 'Sa(n)goji', 'Saguji', 'Shagottsan', 'Shagottan', 'Jogu-san', 'Osang\u016b-san', 'Oshamotsu-sama', or 'Oshamoji-sama' - with different ways of writing them in kanji - are found. The name's etymology is uncertain. During the early modern period when the Mishaguji were conflated with the divine children (mikogami) of Takeminakata, the god of the Upper Suwa Shrine, the name was explained as being derived from the term sakuchi (\u95e2\u5730, lit. 'to open up / develop the land'), which in turn was connected with legends that credit Takeminakata's offspring with forming and developing the land of Shinano. The name has also been interpreted as deriving from shakujin / ishigami (\u77f3\u795e 'stone deity'), a term used for sacred stones or rocks that were worshiped as repositories (shintai) of kami (it has been observed that stones or stone items were employed as shintai in many Mishaguji-related shrines), or shakujin (\u5c3a\u795e), due to another association with bamboo poles and measuring ropes used in land surveying and boundary marking.\u014cwa (1990). pp. 189-191. The term sakujin (\u4f5c\u795e 'harvest / crop deity') has also been suggested as a possible origin. \u014cwa Iwao (1990) meanwhile theorized the name to be derived from (mi)sakuchi (honorific prefix \u5fa1 mi- + \u4f5c\u970a, \u54b2\u970a sakuchi), a spirit (chi; cf. ikazu-chi, oro-chi, mizu-chi) that brings forth or opens up (saku, cf. \u54b2\u304f 'to bloom', \u88c2\u304f 'to tear open', \u4f5c 'to do/make/cultivate/grow'\uff1bcf. also the verb sakuru/shakuru 'to dig/scoop up') the latent life force present in the soil or the female womb.\u014cwa (1990). pp. 192-194.Oh (2011). p. 178. ==Extent of cult== 'Mishaguji' shrines by region (in Japanese) Research conducted by local historian Imai Nogiku in the 1950s revealed a total of 780 shrines to the Mishaguji (or similarly-named deities) within Nagano Prefecture, 109 of which are in the Suwa area (comprising the modern municipalities of Chino, Suwa, Okaya, Shimosuwa, Fujimi, and Hara).Miyasaka (1987). p. 24.Oh (2011). p. 164. As noted above, worship of possibly related kami with names such as 'S(h)aguji' or 'S(h)agoji' are also attested in neighboring areas, being notably widespread throughout the Kant\u014d and Ch\u016bbu regions of Japan. Shrines enshrining these gods are found in places such as Shizuoka (233 shrines), Aichi (229 shrines), Yamanashi (160 shrines), Mie (140 shrines) and Gifu (116 shrines).\u014cwa (1990). p. 199.Tanaka (2011). p. 128. On the other hand, such shrines are conspicuously absent in the two prefectures of Niigata and Toyama, located to the north of Nagano. Ont\u014d Mishaguji S\u014dsha (\u5fa1\u982d\u5fa1\u793e\u5bae\u53f8\u7dcf\u793e) in Chino, Nagano The head shrine of the local Mishaguji shrine network in Suwa is the Ont\u014d Mishaguji S\u014dsha (\u5fa1\u982d\u5fa1\u793e\u5bae\u53f8\u7dcf\u793e) in Chino, situated within the grounds of the Moriya family estate. Before the Meiji period, the Moriya (\u5b88\u77e2\u6c0f) served in the Upper Suwa Shrine as priests known as Kan-no-Osa (\u795e\u9577) or Jinch\u014dkan (\u795e\u9577\u5b98). The Jinch\u014dkan was second only to the \u014ch\u014dri (\u5927\u795d), the shrine's high priest revered both as the descendant and the living vessel or shintai of the shrine's deity, Takeminakata, and was responsible for conducting the shrine's religious ceremonies; indeed, summoning and dismissing the Mishaguji in rituals was held to be the prerogative of this priest.Moriya (1991). pp. 4-5.Miyasaka. (1987). pp. 25-27. However, local historians believe that the Maemiya (\u524d\u5bae), one of the Upper Shrine's two sub-shrines and one of the four sites that comprise the Suwa Grand Shrine complex, was the original center of local Mishaguji worship, known as the 'Great Mishaguji' (\u5927\u5fa1\u793e\u5bae\u795e \u014c-Mishaguji); indeed, medieval records refer to the \"twenty Mishaguji of the Maemiya\" (\u524d\u5bae\u5eff\u30ce\u5fa1\u793e\u5bae\u795e). ==Function== A 2.23-meter stone rod (sekib\u014d) from the J\u014dmon period known as the 'Great Sekib\u014d of Kitazawa' (\u5317\u6ca2\u5927\u77f3\u68d2) after its place of discovery, the Kitazawa River (\u5317\u6ca2\u5ddd) in the town of Sakuho, Nagano. Mishaguji were thought to dwell in various objects (yorishiro), the sekib\u014d being one of them. Mishaguji are believed to be spirits that dwell in rocks, trees, or bamboo leaves,Miyasaka (1987). p. 27.Tanigawa (1987). p. 185, 193. as well as various man-made objects such as phallic stone rods (\u77f3\u68d2 sekib\u014d), grinding slabs (\u77f3\u76bf ishizara) or mortars (\u77f3\u81fc ishiusu).\u014cwa (1990). p. 191.Oh (2011). p. 164. In addition to the above, Mishaguji are also thought to descend upon straw effigiesTanigawa (1987). pp. 180-181. as well as possess human beings, especially during religious rituals. This concept of Mishaguji as a possessing spirit are reflected in texts that describe Mishaguji being 'brought down' (\u964d\u7533 oroshi-m\u014dsu, i.e. being summoned into a repository, whether human or object) or 'lifted up' (\u4e0a\u7533 age-m\u014dsu, i.e. being dismissed from its vessel) by the Moriya jinch\u014dkan, the priest with the exclusive right to call upon Mishaguji in the religious rites of the Suwa Grand Shrine.Miyasaka (1987). p. 26. Folk beliefs considered Mishaguji to be associated with fertility and the harvest, as well as healers of diseases like the common cold or pertussis.Miyasaka (1987). p. 25. Mishaguji have been worshipped as tutelary deities of whole villages (\u7523\u571f\u795e ubusuna-gami) as well as specific kinship groups (\u795d\u795e iwai-gami).Miyasaka (1987). p. 23. Further reflecting this relationship between Mishaguji and local communities is their being believed to preside over the act of founding villages as well as their being associated with the broadly similar concept of saikami (patrons of boundaries or borders). ==Mishaguji in Suwa== Within the Suwa region, syncretism with other myths has resulted in the representation of Mishaguji as snakes, as well as their connection with the story of Takeminakata-no-kami and Moreya-no-kami; Moreya-no-kami is said to represent the autochthonous worship of Mishaguji that syncretized with the worship of new gods represented by Takeminakata-no-kami.\u300e\u6771\u6d0b\u795e\u540d\u4e8b\u5178\u300fp. 463 == See also == * Suwa-taisha * Moreya * Takeminakata * Snake worship * Suwa clan * Mana * Holy Spirit * Great Spirit * Baetylus * Animism ==Notes== == References == ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * Category:Fertility deities Category:Japanese deities Category:Japanese mythology Category:Nature deities Category:Shinto kami Category:Suwa faith ",
