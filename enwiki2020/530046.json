    "text": "The knobcone pine, Pinus attenuata (also called Pinus tuberculata , with illustrations by Carl Eytel - Kurut, Gary F. (2009), \"Carl Eytel: Southern California Desert Artist\", California State Library Foundation, Bulletin No. 95, pp. 17-20 retrieved Nov. 13, 2011), is a tree that grows in mild climates on poor soils. It ranges from the mountains of southern Oregon to Baja California with the greatest concentration in northern California and the Oregon-California border. ==Description== The knobcone pine (Pinus attenuata) crown is usually conical with a straight trunk. It reaches heights of . However, it can be a shrub on especially poor sites. It prefers dry rocky mountain soils. The bark is smooth, flaky and gray-brown when young, becoming dark gray-red-brown and shallowly furrowed into flat scaly ridges. The twigs are red-brown and often resinous. The leaves are in fascicles of three,eNature Field Guides, 2007 needle-like, yellow-green, twisted, and 9\u201315 cm (about 3.5\u20136 in) long. The cones are 8\u201316 cm long and clustered in whorls of three to six on the branches. The scales end in a short stout prickle. The cones remain closed for many years until a fire opens them and allows reseeding. As a result, the cones may even become embedded in the trunk as the tree grows.

In the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada, knobcone pine is often a co-dominant with blue oak (Quercus douglasii).C.
