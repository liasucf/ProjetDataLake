    "text": "Military relations between Pakistan and the United States have been present since the two established diplomatic relations in 1947. The United States' military relations with Pakistan have been consistently close and it has sometimes been referred to as \"America's most allied ally in Asia\", reflecting shared interests in security and stability in South Asia, Central Asia as well as in regions covering the Eastern Europe. The military establishments of both countries have cooperated in taking action against militant groups involved in the War in Afghanistan and the Bosnian War while cooperating on shared mutual understanding of key issues in security and defense. The Pakistan Army and Pakistan Air Force regularly engage in joint exercises with their American counter interservices, while the Pakistan Navy and the Pakistan Marines is the second most consistent participant in Combined Task Force 150 and Combined Task Force 151 after the United States Navy. Since 1956, the U.S. military personnel have served in the Pakistani military as military advisers and Pakistani military cadets have consistently attended the coveted U.S. military academies and war colleges. ==U.S. bases== The following military bases in Pakistan have been accessible to the United States, mainly for logistics, relief efforts or as launching bases for drone operations. Pakistan comes under the United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) theatre of operations. The Afghanistan-Pakistan Center of Excellence is a division of USCENTCOM, focusing on analysis of operations in Pakistan and Afghanistan (formerly known as the AfPak theatre). Currently, there are no U.S. bases in Pakistan. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Base !! Location !!

The base was used for intelligence gathering operations and radio transmission intercepts relating to the Soviet Union. At one point, there were 800 personnel and 500 supporting staff stationed at the base. Francis Gary Powers, who was shot down and captured in the Soviet Union during the 1960 U-2 incident, took off from this base for his spy mission. |- | Shamsi Airfield || Washuk, Balochistan || A private airfield leased by the Abu Dhabi royal family for hunting trips to Pakistan.

Ayaz Ahmed, \"Shamsi Air Base\", Defence Journal, November 2007, Volume 11, No. 4, Karachi, Pakistan The base was exclusively used to conduct drone operations in northwest Pakistan, and housed several U.S. military personnel. Blackwater employees were also involved in these operations. The CIA and USAF jointly developed the airfield, constructing two permanent and one portable hangars for housing drones, in addition to support and residential facilities as well as resurfacing of the asphalt runway. The U.S. ceased its drone operations from Shamsi in April 2011, following the controversial Raymond Allen Davis incident. However, it continued using Shamsi airfield for logistics and emergency landings.
