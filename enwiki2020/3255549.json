    "text": "The Tattooed Man is the name of two of Green Lantern's enemies, as well as of one related character. The first Tattooed Man first appeared in Green Lantern vol. 2, #23 (September 1963) and was created by Gardner Fox and Gil Kane. A version of the Tattooed Man called Tattoo Man appears as a recurring character in the television series Black Lightning, portrayed by William Catlett. This version of the character is named Latavius \"Lala\" Johnson. ==Fictional character biography== ===Abel Tarrant=== Abel Tarrant was a sailor based in Coast City who turned to burglary. During one of his heists, he was exposed to a bunch of mysterious chemicals which left him with the mental ability to create actual objects from the chemicals. When he got back from the robbery, he tattooed himself using the chemicals so he would always have the chemicals near him. Some of the shapes he was able to conjure from his tattoos were an axe, shield, cannon, and dragon. The Tattooed Man originally had the advantage against Green Lantern because the chemicals' base was yellow (though the tattoos themselves were usually shown as purple). The Emerald Gladiator eventually beat the Tattooed Man by making him concentrate on more than one of his tattoos. The Tattooed Man would return, however, as a member of the Injustice Gang. While previously he had tattooed only his arms (that he may hide them under a shirt), by this point he has tattooed much of his body, including his face. Tarrant would fall along with the rest of the Injustice Gang, and his activities would remain mysterious for some time. Tarrant was eventually thought murdered by the Goldface mafia for trying to con them. Obviously surviving, years later he would reform as a tattoo artist involuntarily being forced to battle Guy Gardner.Green Lantern Vol. 3 #2. DC Comics. Tattooed Man later appearing at the funeral for Hal Jordan.Green Lantern Vol. 3 #81. DC Comics. Still later, he would attend the funeral of former Injustice Gang teammate David Clinton, aka Chronos. While Clinton left Tarrant his 1965 Mustang, what he really wanted was Clinton's time travel equipment. Forcing the secret of time travel out of Walker Gabriel, he unsuccessfully attempted to dissuade himself from becoming the Tattooed Man, before Walker dragged him back to the present.Chronos #6. DC Comics. He made an appearance in Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special #1 trying to escape from Alcatraz only to be stopped by Arsenal.Infinite Crisis Special #1. DC Comics.

Oakes first appeared in Skin Graft #1 (July 1993). A cellmate of Abel Tarrant, John Oakes learned the art of tattoo - with a supernatural edge - from his fellow prisoner. After being released from jail, Oakes learned that his strange tattoos were a curse as well as a blessing as his tattoos now opened arcane 'doors' and could involuntarily trap people as 'tattoos' on his own body. Further studying for the Irezumi master Kobo in Kyoto, Oakes learned to control his strange abilities, and finally defeated both Tarrant and the 'tattoo killer' Mizoguchi Kenji by absorbing them. However, Oakes' beloved Yuko died in the battle as well, which prompted him to make her part of his own self. ===Mark Richards=== The third Tattooed Man first appeared in Green Lantern Vol. 4 #9. Mark Richards was a former U.S. Marine who went missing after his helicopter crashed a few years ago. He was presumed dead until he showed up in Gotham City as a hit man. He claimed that the tattoos covering his body were the sins of men he had killed and that by the art of \"sin- grafting\", which he had learned from the nation of Modora, in which he takes the sins of others and puts them on himself, he claimed to be redeeming the men and women he killed. All his victims had tattoos of their sins. He was eventually stopped by Green Lantern and Batman.

In the sixth issue, Mark is on the JLA satellite with the other survivors. Looking down on the earth with wonder, Mark resolves to never again take his powers for granted, prompting Black Canary to make him an honorary member of the Justice League. The satellite is then attacked by Justifiers and the brainwashed Black Lightning, and Mark discovers that the circuit protects him from the effects of the Anti-Life Equation.

He clashes with the neighborhood's gangs and crooked cops while also trying to keep his family together.

This is revealed to be the result of the supervillain behind the gangs and the cops: Sync, Richards' own brother who everyone thought long dead.

After being killed by Tobias Whale for his repeated failures to kill Black Lightning, he was reanimated by unknown means. As a side effect, he's forced to see the ghosts of those he killed and have their faces forcibly tattooed onto his body. In addition, the phrase \"the Devil deals the cards\" forces him to become obedient to Whale.

This plan failed as two A.S.A. agents perish while Martin is safely evacuated from the interrogation room.

Despite some arguing between his ghosts, Lala learns that Earl was killed moments after he went to the police about the 100 and that he was the one who killed him.

While recalling how Lazarus Prime, a coroner with an axe to grind against Whale, put him back together, Lala plans to redeem himself by getting revenge on Tobias. In the season 2 finale, Lala saves Black Lightning by shooting Heatstroke and confronts Tobias after Cutter left him. While \"the Devil deals the cards\" doesn't work on him anymore, Whale quotes \"E pluribus unum\", which causes the tattoos of Lala's victims to surface on him and painfully incapacitate him. In season three, Lala has recovered with the briefcase in his possession. He begins another attempt at revenge on Tobias Whale while gaining control of the remnants of the 100. Lala finds that Lady Eve is operating on his turf. In a later meeting, she reveals that she came up with the programming used on Lala including another one that makes him obedient to her.
