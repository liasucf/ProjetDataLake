    "text": "A shade house is a garden structure which provides a mix of shade and light to provide suitable conditions for shade-loving plants. Typically, it will have a frame which supports the elements providing shade which might be fabric, mesh or wooden laths. Shade houses may also be used in commercial horticulture. For example, vanilla vines need 50% shade and, in deforested areas of Mexico, this is provided by shade houses of 1,000 \u2013 10,000 square metres. These have tree- like support posts or actual living trees. From these, shade cloth walls of 3\u20135 metres height are suspended and these are black or red to cut the luminosity by half. ==References== ==Gallery== File:Shade House at Rockledge Gardens.jpg|The Shadehouse at Rockledge Gardens File:Shade house - Flickr - peganum.jpg|A fabric shade house at Small Dole File:Shade house at Toowoomba residence, Roslyn (6796831990).jpg|A lath shade house at Toowoomba in 1900 Category:Agricultural buildings Category:Garden features ",
