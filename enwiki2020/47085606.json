    "text": "2012 Department for Transport plans for UK rail electrification by 2019 including Northern Hub (red), Electric Spine (yellow/green), Great Western Main Line and South Wales Main Line (red) and Valleys & Cardiff Local Routes (blue). For 'HLOS', see Network Rail > Control periods. Proposed railway electrification in Great Britain. ==Background== In 2009, Lord Adonis was appointed Secretary of State for Transport. After a gap of more than a decade, electrification was back on the agenda and Adonis announced plans to electrify the Great Western Main Line from London as far as Swansea, as well as infill electrification schemes in the North West of England. In July 2012 the UK government announced \u00a34.2 billion of new electrification schemes, all at 25 kV AC and reconfirmed schemes previously announced by Adonis. These were to be Northern Hub, Great Western Main Line, South Wales Main Line, Midland Main Line, Electric Spine, Crossrail, Gospel Oak to Barking Line and West Midlands suburban lines including the Cross-City Line. Rail transport in Scotland is a devolved matter for the Scottish Government, but they too have pursued electrification with multiple schemes in the Central Belt. All these have been 25 kV AC, as in England and Wales. On 25 June 2015 the government announced that some of the electrification projects would be delayed or cut back because of rising costs. Electrification work was to be \"paused\" on the Trans-Pennine route between York and Manchester and on the Midland main line between Bedford and Sheffield. Electrification of the Great Western main line would go ahead but the status of the Reading-Newbury and Didcot-Oxford sections was unclear. However, in September 2015, the electrification work was \"un-paused\", but with a delayed completion date. Since then there have been regular updates including one published in October 2016. On 20 July 2017 Chris Grayling the Secretary of State for Transport cancelled a number of electrification projects citing disruptive works and use of bi-mode technology as an alternative.https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40669869 In June 2018, Electrification has not been without controversy with cancellations and various appearances of the Secretary of State for Transport called before the Transport Select Committee. The Transport Select Committee published its report into various matters including regional investment disparity on the railways and calling again for the reinstatement of various cancelled electrification schemes. A written question was submitted and answered in parliament regarding route miles electrified in the years 1997-2019. In March 2019 the Railway Industry Association published a paper on Electrification cost challenge suggesting ways forward and a rolling programme of electrification. ==List of routes== ===Northern Hub=== As part of the Northern Hub project, the following lines in North West England and Yorkshire are to be electrified: * Liverpool to Manchester Northern Route: Manchester to Newton- le-Willows completed December 2013; to Liverpool, planned by December 2014 but completed in February 2015.North West Electrification, Network Rail. Accessed 16 July 2012 * Liverpool to Wigan: planned by December 2014 but completed in March 2015.Network Rail * Manchester to Preston (via Bolton) by December 2017 and Preston to Blackpool North by May 2018. An October 2017 update pushed back the completion of the Manchester - Preston section.https://www.greatermanchester- ca.go...d/2510/item_06_local_rail_service_performance This scheme provides an electrified route from Blackpool to the West Coast Main Line at Preston and then on to Manchester diverging from the West Coast Main Line at Euxton Jct. Originally, Preston - Blackpool was to be done before Manchester - Preston, but Network Rail said Preston - Blackpool needed to have new signalling and the opportunity was also taken to completely remodel Blackpool North and Kirkham & Wesham stations and other remodelling improvements at Salwick and Poulton-le-Fylde. The scheme was to have followed with a new completion date of March 2018. Further delays ensued and a powered electric train (a Virgin Pendolino) finally carried out multiple test runs overnight on 14\u201315 May 2018, a few days after energisation. Similarly, in the early hours of 13 December 2018, a Virgin Pendolino ran test runs between Preston and Manchester Piccadilly shortly after energisation. The full electric service from Manchester to Blackpool North started in February 2019 * to As a spin-off, in December 2013 it was announced that the branch from to would also be electrified by 2017. However, the enhancements delivery plan update of September 2016 moved the completion date with only GRIP Stage 3 (Option selection) being completed by then. * The North TransPennine route, comprising the Huddersfield Line between Manchester Victoria and via and : expected by 2022. ** As an extension of this the Hull to Selby Line was going to follow: Hull Trains planned to electrify the line between Temple Hirst Junction on the East Coast Main Line south of and Hull using private finance. This moved closer to reality on 20 March 2014 when Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin confirmed in the House of Commons that he had made \u00a32.4m available to move the project to the next stage of development, GRIP Stage 3. This scheme was to have joined the already planned transpennine electrification (part of the Northern Hub project) at Selby. In November 2016 this project was shelved indefinitely.http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/anger-as-ministers-shelve- yorkshire-rail-electrification-plans-1-8242509https://www.bbc.com/news/uk- england-humber-38004362 **Harrogate line Harrogate to Leeds electrification proposed, but not yet agreed. === Windermere branch line === * Windermere Branch Line: In August 2013, the Department for Transport announced that the branch line between and was to be electrified by 2016.\"DfT Unveils Lakes Electrification Plans\" Railnews news article 09-08-2013; Retrieved 2014-03-13 The Hendy review moved the completion of GRIP 3 to March 2017 with a yet to be determined date for completion of electrification. In July 2017 Chris Grayling the Secretary of State for Transport announced the scheme had been cancelled and bi-mode technology would be used. ===Great Western Main Line and South Wales Main Line=== *The electrification of the GWML to Thingley Junction (near Chippenham) and the SWML via Bristol Parkway to Cardiff Central was due for completion in December 2018, but was delayed to December 2019, with electric trains only beginning to run to Cardiff from January 2020. https://www.railwaygazette.com/uk/cardiff-electric-services-go- live/55486.article Electrification from Reading to Newbury was completed in December 2018. On 8 November 2016, Transport Minister Paul Maynard announced that several parts of the Great Western electrification project were being deferred 'until further notice': these include the line between Didcot and Oxford, the lines to (both via Bristol Parkway and Bath), the line between Cardiff and Swansea ,Rail electrification delayed but passengers told there will be new trains with more seats Oxford Times, 8 November 2016 and the Henley and Marlow branch lines. On 20 July 2017, it was announced that the Cardiff-Swansea electrification project had been cancelled and that bi-mode trains would be used on the route.http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/policy/single-view/view/sheffield- swansea-and-windermere-electrification-cancelled.html *As a spin-off, it was proposed that the Valleys & Cardiff Local Routes would be electrified once the main route is complete. === Midland Main Line === Main article: Midland Main Linealt=Near Felmerham|thumb|Bridges over the Midland Main Line in Bedfordshire have been replaced to allow greater clearances for electrification and larger rolling stock. Before (top) and after (bottom) the 2014 upgrade. * Already electrified to Bedford. This was to be extended to Corby, Leicester, Nottingham, Derby and Sheffield. In November 2016 only the electrification to Kettering and Corby was confirmed as continuing with the DfT refusing to be drawn on dates for the remaining parts of the original scheme.[45][46] On 20 July 2017, it was announced that the Kettering- Nottingham-Sheffield electrification project had been cancelled and that bi- mode trains would be used on the route.[24] * However, in March 2019, it was announced by Department for Transport that the line between Kettering and Market Harborough would be electrified.[47] === Electric Spine === Main article: Electric Spine * Electrification of the lines from the Port of Southampton to Nuneaton, and to the Midland Main Line via the East West Rail between Oxford and Bedford. This would have involved electrifying the Coventry to Nuneaton, and Coventry to Leamington Line, part of the Chiltern Main Line, Cherwell Valley Line and Reading to Basingstoke Line; also converting part of the South Western Main Line between Basingstoke and Southampton Central from 750 V DC third rail to 25 kV AC overhead.[45] As a large portion of the spine depends on electrification of the Midland Main Line and this has been cancelled north of Kettering and defunded for East West Rail, it may be assumed this scheme has also been put on hold indefinitely. ===Crossrail=== New cross-London main line, originally due to open in December 2018. Opening has been delayed until 2021. ===Gospel Oak to Barking Line=== * Electrification of this line which is part of London Overground was announced in July 2013. Major civil engineering with line closures started July 2016. Full in-service date was expected to be 30 June 2017. However, design errors and the late delivery of materials and structures meant that the project was delayed. The start of electric services was to be in May 2018. * Delays in the electrification of the line were followed by delays in the delivery of the Class 710 electric train sets. The first two trains entered service on 23 May 2019, with the full fleet entering service in August 2019. These 4-car train sets doubled the length of the trains and passenger capacity compared to the former 2-car Diesel train sets, completing the project.. ===West Midlands suburban lines=== Extensions to the existing West Midlands suburban electrification: *Cross-City Line electrification to be extended from to by 2017. Due to delays in the project, electric services started in July 2018. *Chase Line electrification to be extended from to by 2017. There were delays in the original date,https://www.networkrail.co.uk/feeds/railway-between- rugeley-trent-valley-and-walsall-to-close-for-16-days-as-electrification- gathers-pace/https://www.networkrail.co.uk/feeds/residents-invited-to-drop-in- events-about-upgrades-between-rugely-trent-valley-and-walsall/ with electric services on this line starting in May 2019. ===Scotland=== ====Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvement Programme (EGIP)==== This electrification scheme and associated works has come to mean Edinburgh-Glasgow via Falkirk High and was due to be completed by December 2016. The rolling programme would then follow with the route via Shotts. The scheme via Carstairs in association with the ECML electrification was completed in the early 1990s. With other infills in the central belt of Scotland there will soon be 4 different electrified routes between the two cities with assorted diversionary routes.http://www.transport.gov.scot/project/electrification-programme The December 2016 date was not met and in May 2017 a further delay to the wires going live was announced due to a safety-critical component possibly for the whole route needing to be replaced.http://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/edinburgh-glasgow-rail- electrification-delayed-again-1-4449540 It was actually completed in December 2017. The infills include the route from Cumbernauld and Falkirk Grahamston to Larbert, Alloa, Dunblane and Stirling. === 2020 onwards === Under Transport Secretary Chris Grayling many of the proposed electrification projects were cancelled, despite pledging to remove full diesel trains by 2040 . However after being sacked in 2019, and replaced by Grant Shapps many of the cancelled electrification schemes are being reconsidered. ==== Stalybridge to Leeds ==== ==== Hull to Selby and Sheffield ==== Now the electrification scheme could be back on the agenda after transport secretary Grant Shapps confirmed plans to spend nearly \u00a3600m on work to upgrade and electrify the TransPennine main line. ====Rolling programme==== On 28 July 2020, Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson announced plans to phase out fossil fuel use on the railway network by 2035. The plan would see most lines electrified, but suggests that intermittent electrification in difficult places may be implemented. Alternative traction will be implemented rather than electrification for some lightly-used lines. These are the Far North Line, Kyle of Lochalsh Line, West Highland Line, and the southern portion of the Stranraer Line. ==See also== * Network Rail Control Periods, including High- Level Output Specification (HLOS) * Timeline of future railway upgrades in Great Britain * Campaign to Electrify Britain\u2019s Railways ==References== Category:Rail infrastructure in the United Kingdom Category:Proposed rail infrastructure in England Great Britain ==Further reading== * * * * * ",
