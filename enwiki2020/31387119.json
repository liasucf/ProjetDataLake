    "text": "The Jaca Navarra (), or Navarrese Horse, is a breed of small horse from the Navarre region of northern Spain. It is listed in the Cat\u00e1logo Oficial de Razas de Ganado de Espa\u00f1a in the group of autochthonous breeds in danger of extinction. The total population of the Jaca Navarra has been variously estimated at 350 (in 1999), 250 (in 2000), and 240 and decreasing (in 1997). In April 2011 the total population was reported to be 899, all of which were in Navarre. The breed is listed by the FAO as Endangered. A breeders' association, the Asociaci\u00f3n de Criadores de Ganado Equino Jaca Navarra, was formed in 1999, and a stud-book opened in 2001. The conservation and reference herd kept in semi-feral conditions at the Sabaiza estate contains all but a few examples of the breed. ==Names== In Spanish, this breed is also known as the Poney Navarro, Caballo Navarro, Caballo Vasco-navarro, Caballito de And\u00eda, Caballito de las Am\u00e9scoas or Caballito de la Barranca, and was in the past also known as Jaca de Monta\u00f1a, Raza de Pamplona or Raza Pamplonica. The word jaca has an unusual history, from Old Spanish haca, itself from Old French haque, which in turn is ultimately derived from the English place-name Hackney, a place famous for its horses. ==See also== *Iberian horse *Basque breeds and cultivars ==References== Category:Horse breeds Category:Horse breeds originating in Spain ",
