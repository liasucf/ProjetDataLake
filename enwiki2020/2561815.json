Platform screen doors (PSDs), also known as platform edge doors (PEDs), are used at some train or subway stations to separate the platform from trains, as well as on some Bus rapid transit systems. They are primarily used for passenger safety. They are a relatively new addition to many metro systems around the world, some having been retrofitted to established systems. They are widely used in newer Asian and European metro systems. == History == Singapore MRT was the first in the world to be fitted with glass screen doors. These are the first-generation doors, seen here at Raffles Place station. The first stations in the world with platform screen doors were the ten stations of the Saint Petersburg Metro's Line 2 that opened between 1961 and 1972. The platform \"doors\" are actually openings in the station wall, which supports the ceiling of the platform. The track tunnels adjoining the ten stations' island platforms were built with tunnel boring machines (TBMs), and the island platforms were actually located in a separate vault between the two track tunnels. Usually, TBMs bore the deep-level tunnels between stations, while the station vaults are dug out manually and contain both the tracks and the platform. However, in the case of the Saint Petersburg Metro, the TBMs bored a pair of continuous tunnels that passed through ten stations, and the stations themselves were built in vaults that only contained the platform, with small openings on the sides of the vault, in order for passengers to access the trains in the tunnels.http://www.mic- ro.com/metro/platform-screen-doors.html In 1987, Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit was the first metro system in the world to incorporate glass PSDs into its stations for climate control and safety reasons, rather than due to architectural constraints. All underground stations on all lines have these doors installed since their opening, and above-ground stations were retrofitted with the doors by 2012. The design of the doors themselves differ depending on their installation location and time (see ). Hong Kong's MTR was the first metro system in the world to retrofit PSDs on a transit station already in operation. == Reasons for use == The main reason platform screen doors are installed is for passenger safety. Their use helps prevent suicides, accidents, objects falling on the track and stops people entering tunnels. Platform screen doors also improve climate control within the station, which can lead to cost savings and reduced energy use by lowering the use of heating and air conditioning in the station. PSD's can also offer protection from the weather when used in open air. == Types == Although the terms are often used interchangeably, platform screen doors can refer to both full-height and half- height barriers. Full height platform screen doors are total barriers between the station floor and ceiling, while the half-height platform screen doors are referred to as platform edge doors, as they do not reach the ceiling and thus do not create a total barrier. Platform gates are usually only half of the height of the full-screen doors, but they sometimes reach to the height of the train. These two types of platform screen doors are presently the main types in the world. ===Platform screen doors and platform edge doors=== These doors help to: * Prevent people from accidentally falling onto the tracks, getting too close to moving trains, and committing suicide (by jumping) or homicide (by pushing). * Prevent or reduce wind felt by the passengers caused by the piston effect which could in some circumstances make people lose their balance. * Improve safety\u2014reduce the risk of accidents, especially from trains passing through the station at high speeds. * Improve climate control within the station (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning are more effective when the station is physically isolated from the tunnel). * Improve security\u2014access to the tracks and tunnels is restricted. * Lower costs\u2014eliminate the need for motormen or conductors when used in conjunction with Automatic Train Operation, thereby reducing manpower costs. * Prevent litter buildup on the tracks, which can be a fire risk, as well as damage and possibly obstruct trains. * Improve the sound quality of platform announcements, as background noise from the tunnels and trains that are entering or exiting is reduced. * At underground or indoor platforms, prevent the air from being polluted by the fumes caused by friction from the train wheels grinding against the tracks.PDF on the issue (London Underground): Personal Exposure and Air Quality in Northbank Their primary disadvantage is their cost; installing a system typically costs several million USD per station. When used to retrofit older systems, they limit the kind of rolling stock that may be used on a line, as train doors must have exactly the same spacing as the platform doors; this results in additional costs due to depot upgrades and otherwise unnecessary purchases of rolling stock. The doors also pose their own safety risks. The primary risk is that people may be trapped between the platform doors and the train carriage, and be subsequently crushed when the train begins to move (see ). Cases of this happening are rare, and may depend upon door design.

Like full-height platform screen doors, these platform gates slide open or close simultaneously with the train doors. Half-height platform gates are cheaper to install than platform screen doors, which require more metallic framework for support. Some railway operators may therefore prefer such an option to improve safety at railway platforms and, at the same time, keep costs low and non-air- conditioned platforms naturally ventilated. However, these gates are less effective than full platform screen doors in preventing people from intentionally jumping onto the tracks. These gates were first in practical use by the Hong Kong metro system on the Disneyland Resort Line for their open-air station design. The later design by other manufacturers, such as Manusa, Grupsa or Gilgen Door Systems AG, have their gates higher than the ones installed on the Disneyland Resort Line. == Rope doors == There are also rope type platform doors, mainly used in Japan and a few stations in South Korea, where the budget is limited or multiple train types using the same platform. == Use == ===Argentina=== Line D of the Buenos Aires Subte is planned to have platform screen doors installed in the future as soon as the CBTC system is installed.Plan de modernizaci\u00f3n del Subterr\u00e1neo de Buenos Aires \u2013 Buenos Aires CiudadPiccardo present\u00f3 en Brasil el Plan de Modernizaci\u00f3n del Subte \u2013 EnElSubte, 18 September 2015. === Australia === Rouse Hill Station on the Sydney Metro In Sydney, the first phase of the Sydney Metro (known as Sydney Metro Northwest) opened in May 2019, and was the first-fully automated rapid transit rail system in Australia. The stations are equipped with full-height platform screen doors on most underground platforms and half-height doors on at grade, elevated and some underground platforms. The existing five stations on the Epping to Chatswood railway line were upgraded to rapid transit standard, all featuring half-height platform screen doors.North West Rail Link - Homepage In Melbourne, the Melbourne Metro tunnel currently under construction from South Kensington to South Yarra will feature platform screen doors on the underground stations. New trains are being constructed that will line up with the full-height doors. The Metro Tunnel is due to open in 2025. === Belarus === Platform screen doors are being added to Line 3 of the Minsk Metro, which is due to open in late 2020. === Brazil === Paulista Station on S\u00e3o Paulo Metro's Line 4, the first fully automated transit line in Latin America.http://www.viaquatro.com.br/imprensa/noticias/Linha-4-Amarela-e- eleita-a-melhor-pelos-paulistanos?releaseId=31186 The Platform Screen Doors are present in the S\u00e3o Paulo Metro since 2010, when the Sacom\u00e3 Station was opened.http://www.saopaulo.sp.gov.br/ultimas-noticias/serra-inaugura-estacao- sacoma-do-metro-1/ As of 2019, 5 of the 6 lines of the S\u00e3o Paulo Metro have the equipment: Line 4 - Yellow and Line 15 - Silver have the equipment installed in all of its stations. The feature is also present in some stations of Line 2 - Green, Line 3 - Red and Line 5 - Lilac. They are planned to be installed in 41 stations of lines 1, 2 and 3 by the end of 2021http://www.saopaulo.sp.gov.br/ultimas-noticias/governo-de-sp-contrata- instalacao-de-portas-de-plataforma-do-metro/, as well as all stations of line 5 by the end of 2020.https://diariodotransporte.com.br/2018/08/31/portas-de- plataforma-em-toda-a-linha-5-lilas-serao-entregues-ate-2020-diz-pelissioni/ PSDs are also found on Santos Light Rail since 2016.https://viatrolebus.com.br/2016/11/emtu-conclui-instalacao-de-portas- plataforma-em-estacao-do-vlt/ === Bulgaria === Half-height platform screen doors will be in use on all stations of the Sofia Metro Line 3. === Canada === Screen doors are in use at all three LINK Train stations and the Union and Pearson stations along the Union Pearson Express route to Toronto Pearson International Airport in Mississauga, Ontario. Greater Montreal's forthcoming R\u00e9seau express m\u00e9tropolitain (REM), the 67-kilometre-long driverless complementary suburban rapid transit network opening in three phases between 2021 and 2023 will feature screen doors at each of its 26 stations. With the advent of the REM on the horizon, advocating retrofits of platform edges in the Montreal Metro with doors to combat delays attributed to overcrowding is becoming increasingly customary. Were its type of door to be screen (full- height), then such installations might quash the fully underground system's notoriety whereby opening or passing through station entrance doors proves mightily troublesome due to the excessive windiness brought about by arriving or departing trains. === Chile === Line 6 of the Santiago Metro, inaugurated in November 2017, introduced the platform doors and converted it into one of the most modern in Latin America Platform edge doors are currently in use at Lines 3 and 6 of the Santiago Metro, being a novelty in the system. ===China=== All Chinese metro systems have platform screen doors installed on most of their lines. All stations built after the mid 2000s have some form of platform barrier. Only the Nanjing Metro, Dalian Metro and Wuhan Metro have stations without the platform screen doors on their early lines (). However many are starting the process of retrofitting these lines with platform screen gates. In addition, many BRT systems such as the Guangzhou Bus Rapid Transit are also equipped with platform screen doors. Several underground high speed railway stations of the CRH network use platform screen doors set back from the platform edge. === Colombia === Several stations on Bogota's TransMilenio bus rapid transit system use platform screen doors. ===Denmark=== A TransMilenio bus rapid transit station in Bogot\u00e1 with platform screen doors. The Copenhagen Metro uses Westinghouse and Faiveley platform screen doors on all platforms. ===Finland=== The Helsinki Metro had a trial run with Faiveley automatic platform gates installed on a single platform at Vuosaari metro station during phase one of the project. The doors, which are part of the Siemens metro automation project, were built in 2012. Phase 2 of the project has been delayed due to metro automation technical and safety related testings. The doors were removed in 2015 ===France=== Fully enclosed platform screen doors in Paris M\u00e9tro Platform curtains at Vanves\u2013Malakoff station All lines of the VAL automated subway system are equipped with platform screen doors at every station, starting with Lille subways in 1983. Those also include Toulouse and Rennes as well as the CDGVAL and Orlyval airport shuttles. Paris M\u00e9tro's line 14 from Saint-Lazare to Biblioth\u00e8que Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was inaugurated in 1998 with platform screen doors manufactured by Faiveley Transport. The new station Olympiades opened with platform screen doors in June 2007. Line 1 has been retrofitted with platform screen doors, for full driverless automation effective in 2012. Some stations on Line 13 have had platform edge doors since 2010 to manage their overcrowding, after tests conducted in 2006, and stations on Line 4 are currently being fitted with platform edge doors in preparation for its automation. Since 30 June 2020, a new kind of vertical platform screen doors, called platform curtains, are being tested on the platform 2bis of Vanves\u2013Malakoff station (in Paris region) on the Transilien Line N commuter rail line. Their experiment should end in February 2021. These 1 meter 60 high vertical doors are manufactured by HENGZHU. Transilien said that they preferred platform curtains to classical screen doors for this line because the positioning of the doors is not the same across the rolling stock, and that they plan to install them in other Transilien stations if the experiment is successful. The D line in Lyon, which is equipped with fully automated trains, does not have platform screen doors but identifies obstructions by infrared detectors upon the tracks. A similar system is employed by the metro system in Nuremberg, Germany. ===Germany=== People movers at Frankfurt International Airport, Munich International Airport and D\u00fcsseldorf Airport are equipped with platform screen doors, as well as the suspended monorail in Dortmund, called H-Bahn. === Greece === Platform screen doors will be used on the driverless Thessaloniki Metro, which opens in November of 2020. ===Hong Kong=== East Tsim Sha Tsui Station has the longest set of platform screen doors in the world, but a third have been out of service since the station began serving the West Rail Line's shorter trains in 2009. Today, all heavy rail platforms except those on the East Rail Line have either platform screen doors or platform edge doors. Platform edge doors are only used on above-ground stations, while platform screen doors are used in both underground and above-ground stations. None of the light rail platforms has platform screen doors or platform edge doors. In 1998, the Tung Chung Line and Airport Express saw the earliest operations of platform screen doors in Hong Kong. The MTR Corporation had also, since mid-1996, been studying the feasibility of installing PSDs at the older stations. It decided in 1999 to undertake the PSD Retrofitting Programme at 74 platforms of 30 underground stations on the Kwun Tong, Island, and Tsuen Wan Lines. This was completed in early 2006. The Mass Transit Railway was the first metro system in the world to retrofit PSDs on a transit system already in operation. In 2006 the MTR began studying ways to introduce barriers at above-ground and at-grade stations, which was considered more complicated as these stations are naturally ventilated and the introduction of platform screen doors would entail the installation of air conditioning systems. In 2008 the corporation decided to install automatic platform gates at these eight stations (the MTR and KCR Corporation were operationally merged in 2007, but KCR stations were except from this study). The eight stations were retrofitted with APGs in 2011. From July 2000 to December 2013, the MTR Corporation collected a surcharge of 10 cents from each Octopus-paying passenger to help pay for the installation of PSDs and APGs. Over HK$1.15 billion was collected in total. Platform screen doors were also installed on all platforms of the West Rail Line, then built by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) before the MTR-KCR merger. The Ma On Shan Line did not have gates upon opening even though it was built at the same time as the West Rail. The installation of platform screen doors in Hong Kong has been effective in reducing railway injuries and service disruptions. The longest set of platform screen doors in the world can be found in East Tsim Sha Tsui Station. A reduction of train length from 12 to 7 cars following the construction of Kowloon Southern Link caused many of the screen doors to be put out of service, although the trains were lengthened to eight cars in May 2018. The platform screen doors presently in service in the MTR were supplied by the Swiss manufacturer Kaba Gilgen, the Japanese Nabtesco Corporation (under the Nabco brand), as well as Faiveley Transport. The last stations in Hong Kong without platform screen doors or gates are all found on the East Rail Line and Ma On Shan Line, both former KCR lines not part of the MTR APG retrofitting programmes. However, these remaining stations are all being retrofitted by Kaba as part of the Sha Tin to Central Link project. Adding APGs to the East Rail platforms requires platform strengthening as the gates, combined with heavy winds, can greatly increase structural loading on the platform edge. Apart from the MTR, all stations on the Hong Kong International Airport Automated People Mover are equipped with platform screen doors made from Westinghouse Platform Screen Doors (for Phase 1) and Panasonic (for Midfield Extension). === India === On the Delhi Metro, all stations on the Delhi Airport Metro Express line, which links to Indira Gandhi International Airport have been equipped with full-height platform screen doors since November 2015 and the six busiest stations on the Yellow Line have also been equipped with half height platform gates. Automatic platform gates on all the stations of the Pink and Magenta Line. Platform screen doors are also used in all underground stations of the Chennai Metro. There are platform screen doors in all elevated stations of Kolkata Metro Line 2. Platform screen doors will be introduced in underground stations of Kolkata Metro Line 2, Kolkata Metro Line 3, Kolkata Metro Line 6. There are plans to install platform screen doors also in Kolkata Metro Line 1. On the Namma Metro in Bangalore, platform doors will be installed for its phase II operations and is expected to be completed by 2019.

Soekarno\u2013Hatta Airport Rail Link stations, such as SHIA railway station, also uses platform screen doors. The Soekarno-Hatta Airport Skytrain are also equipped with platform screen doors. The Jakarta LRT and future Greater Jakarta LRT also uses half-height doors at its stations (all above ground). The TransJakarta bus rapid transit system also uses automatic half-height doors at the Bundaran HI and Tosari stations. In the future, platform screen doors and half height doors will be installed on Phase 2 and 3 of the Jakarta MRT.

PSDs are present on Turin Metro, the Venice People Mover, the Perugia Minimetr\u00f2, the Brescia Metro, Line 5 of the Milan Metro, and Line C of the Rome Metro. ===Japan=== Full-height doors on Tokyo Metro Namboku Line and Toei Mita Line The Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway began using barriers with the 1991 opening of the Namboku Line (which has full-height platform screen doors), and subsequently installed automatic platform gates on the Mita, Marunouchi, and Fukutoshin lines. Some railway lines, including the subway systems in Sapporo, Sendai, Nagoya, Osaka, Kyoto, and Fukuoka, also utilize barriers to some extent. In August 2012, the Japanese government announced plans to install barriers at stations used by 100,000 or more people per day, and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism allotted 36 million yen ($470,800) for research and development of the system the 2011-2012 fiscal year. A difficulty was the fact that some stations are used by different types of trains with different designs, making barrier design a challenge.Asahi Shimbun Keeping commuters safe; mobile station barriers 20 October 2011 , only 34 of 235 stations with over 100,000 users per day were able to implement the plan. The ministry stated that 539 of approximately 9,500 train stations across Japan have barriers. Of the Tokyo Metro stations, 78 of 179 have some type of platform barrier. In 2018, automatic platform gates will be installed on the S\u014dbu Rapid Line platforms at . As these trains are long, it is believed that this will break the world record for the longest platform doors at East Tsim Sha Tsui Station in Hong Kong.15 car trains at 20m lengths, totaling approximately 300m ===Malaysia=== Platform screen doors (PSD) are installed at all underground stations, from to and , from to stations. The automated announcement message reading \"For safety reasons, please stand behind the yellow line\" in both English and Malay languages are also heard before the train arrived at all stations. There are also platform screen doors (PSD) on the KLIA Ekspres at Kuala Lumpur Sentral and KLIA stations. Both stations at KLIA Aerotrain also have platform screen doors. The Platform screen gates (PSG) also have been installed in all elevated stations of the and .

The platform screen doors will be installed on Line 2 of the Lima Metro (in construction). ===Pakistan=== In Pakistan, platform screen doors are installed at all stations of bus rapid transits Lahore Metrobus and Rawalpindi-Islamabad Metrobus. There are plans to install them at all stations of Multan Metrobus, Karachi Metrobus and the under construction Lahore Metro. === Qatar === Platform screen doors are in use in all stations of the Doha Metro. ===Russian Federation=== Park Pobedy (Russian: \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a \u041f\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044b) is a station of the Saint Petersburg Metro that was the first station in the world with platform doors. The station was opened in 1961. Later, nine more stations of this type were built in Leningrad (nowadays Saint Petersburg): Petrogradskaya (Russian: \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f), Vasileostrovskaya (Russian: \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0435\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f), Gostiny Dvor (Russian: \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440), Mayakovskaya (Russian: \u041c\u0430\u044f\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f), Ploshchad Alexandra Nevskogo I (Russian: \u041f\u043b\u043e\u0449\u0430\u0434\u044c \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430 \u041d\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e-1), Moskovskaya (Russian: \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f), Yelizarovskaya (Russian: \u0415\u043b\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f), Lomonosovskaya (Russian: \u041b\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f), and Zvyozdnaya (Russian: \u0417\u0432\u0451\u0437\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f). There was an electronic device to ensure that the train stopped with its doors adjacent to the platform doors; they were installed so that driverless trains could eventually be used on the line. Unlike other platform screen doors, which are lightweight units with extensive glazing installed on a normal platform edge, the St Petersburg units give the appearance of a solid wall with heavyweight doorways and solid steel sliding doors, similar to a bank of elevators in a large building, and the train cannot be seen entering from the platform; passengers become familiar with the sound alone to indicate a train arrival. In May 2018, two other similar stations were opened: Novokrestovskaya and Begovaya. Unlike the first ten stations that were built, these stations utilize glass screen doors, allowing the train to be seen from entering the platform.

Full height PSDs mainly manufactured by Westinghouse are installed at all existing underground MRT and sub-surface stations in Singapore, as well as at Ten Mile Junction LRT station since its opening in 1999, but which has since been permanently closed. Future underground MRT stations will also have full-height doors installed upon opening. Half-height platform screen doors mostly manufactured by ST Electronics have been retrofitted into all elevated stations by March 2012 (starting with three elevated MRT stations in 2009), as well as all future above-ground MRT stations. The LRT stations at Sengkang, Bukit Panjang and Punggol also have half height platform screen panels installed beginning in 2015. These panels lack physical doors and vary in size according to their location on the platform. All remaining LRT stations received these panels by 2018. There are two series of the full-height platform screen doors in use. The first series, made by Westinghouse, was installed at all underground stations along the North South line and the East West line from 1987 to the completion of the initial system in 1990. The second series of PSDs sport a sleeker design, producing less sound when the doors were opened and closed while incorporating more glass. The first station with these doors was Changi Airport MRT station which opened in 2002. All stations in the fully underground North East line and Circle line, which opened in 2003 and 2010 respectively, sport these new doors, also made by Westinghouse, although there are slight differences in their designs. The same doors used in the Circle line also equip the rebuilt North South line platforms at Bishan MRT station in 2009 following renovations in conjunction with the Circle line interchange at the station. The Downtown line features Westinghouse doors of a still-newer design, which is also found in Marina South Pier MRT station which opened in 2014. The Thomson-East Coast line uses full-height doors by a different manufacturer, GE Transportation, in its stations. Considered a novelty at the time of its installation, platform screen doors were introduced primarily to minimise hefty air-conditioning costs, especially since elevated stations are not air-conditioned and are much more economical to run in comparison. Since then the safety aspects of these doors have become more important, as highlighted by a series of high-profile incidents where individuals were injured or killed by oncoming trains since the year 2002\u2014all occurring on elevated stations with no screen doors. The Land Transport Authority reports that there have been more than 220 cases of commuters trespassing on the tracks between 1991 and 15 September 2004, of which 87 percent were deliberate acts of trespass. Nine fatalities were recorded during this period, of which only one was an accident. Since September 2004 there have been six fatalities occurring on elevated MRT and LRT stations.
