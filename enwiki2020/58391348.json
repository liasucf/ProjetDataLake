    "text": "Goodyera umbrosa, commonly known as the native jade orchid or green jewel orchid, is a species of orchid that is endemic to a small area in Queensland where it grows in highland rainforest. It has between four and eight large, egg-shaped leaves and up to ten small pale green or pinkish flowers with the dorsal sepal and petals forming a hood over the column. == Description == Goodyera umbrosa is a tuberous, perennial herb with a loose rosette of between four and eight shiny bright green, wavy, egg-shaped leaves, long and wide. Between three and ten resupinate, pale green to pinkish flowers, long and wide are borne on a fleshy flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is long, about wide and overlaps the petals, forming a hood over the column. The lateral sepals and petals are a similar size to the dorsal sepal with the lateral sepals spreading downwards. The labellum is hairy, broadly egg-shaped, long, about wide with a deep pouch. Flowering occurs from June to August. ==Taxonomy and naming== The native jade orchid was first formally described in 2004 by David Jones and Mark Clements who gave it the name Eucosia umbrosa and published the description in The Orchadian. In 2014, Julian Shaw changed the name to Goodyera umbrosa. The specific epithet (umbrosa) is a Latin word meaning \"shaded\". ==Distribution and habitat== Goodyera umbrosa usually grows in leaf litter and in rock crevices in rainforest between Mount Finnigan and Mount Fox in Cedar Bay National Park. ==References== Category:Orchids of Queensland Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Plants described in 2004 umbrosa ",
