Born into a family of musicians, Jos\u00e9 began his musical career in his early teens playing guitar and singing in serenade. He later joined a jazz and bossa nova trio where he sang and played bass and double bass. Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 found success as a solo artist in the early 1970s. Demonstrating his tenor vocal ability with a stunning performance of the song \"El Triste\" at a Latin music festival held in Mexico City in 1970, he climbed the Latin charts during that decade. Having achieved recognition as a balladeer, his singing garnered universal critical acclaim from musical peers and media. In the 1980s, after signing with Ariola Records, Jos\u00e9 rose to international prominence as one of the most popular and talented Latin performers. His 1983 album Secretos has sold over four million units. With many international hits, he received several Grammy nominations and recognition worldwide. He sold out in venues such as Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall. His music reached non-Spanish-speaking countries like Japan, Israel and Russia. He forged a career as an actor, starring in movies such as Gavil\u00e1n o Paloma (1985) and Perd\u00f3name Todo (1995). Also known in the entertainment world as El Pr\u00edncipe de la Canci\u00f3n (The Prince of Song), his performance and vocal style have influenced many Latin pop artists in a career that spanned more than four decades. Due to his vocals and popularity, Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 was considered by Latin audience and media as an icon of Latin pop music and one of the most emblematic Latin singers of his time. == Life and career == === 1948\u20131962: Childhood === Jos\u00e9 R\u00f3mulo Sosa Ortiz was born on 17 February 1948 in Claver\u00eda, Azcapotzalco, Mexico City. His father, Jos\u00e9 Sosa Esquivel, was an operatic tenor (tenor comprimario) and his mother, Margarita Ortiz, was a classical pianist. When Jos\u00e9 showed interest in singing, they tried to discourage him claiming that it was too difficult to be successful in show business. In that time, his reportedly alcoholic father abandoned the family forcing Jos\u00e9 to work to help his mother and younger brother. === 1963\u20131969: Early career === At the age of fifteen, his mother gave him his first piano. Besides working in his teens, he learned to play guitar and sang in the church and in serenades along with his neighborhood friends for extra money. In 1963, Jos\u00e9 joined Los PEG, a Mexican bossa nova and jazz trio. He played electric bass and double bass as the band performed at the main jazz venues of Mexico City. He spent three years playing and learning music from top Mexican jazz musicians such as Mario Patr\u00f3n, Chilo Mor\u00e1n, Enrique Herrera, Gilberto S\u00e1nchez Galguera and Paco S\u00e1nchez, among others. Although he made several recordings with the group, the songs failed to be hit singles. In 1965, under the name of \"Pepe Sosa\", pursuing a solo career encouraged by his mother, he recorded the singles \"Ma vie\" and \"El Mundo\" without success. He made a breakthrough with his artistic career when he was invited to perform a song for a friend's sister on her birthday. His friend's sister was the executive secretary for the managing director of Orfe\u00f3n Records. He joined his first name \"Jos\u00e9\" with his father's first name - also Jos\u00e9 - who died of alcoholism. He signed a contract with RCA Victor and recorded his first album: Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 (also known as Cuidado). The album featured songs by Rub\u00e9n Fuentes and Armando Manzanero. It was arranged by his former teacher Mario Patr\u00f3n, who was considered the best jazz musician of Mexico, and employed Brazilian percussionist Mayuto Correa, who was in Mexico City playing with bossa nova stars Jo\u00e3o Gilberto, Carlos Lira, Leny Andrade and Tamba Trio. The album's sound is a combination of boleros and romantic ballads with a jazz and bossa nova influence. The quality of his debut album garnered praise from critics but did not achieve much popular success. === 1970\u20131980: \"El Triste\", consolidation and Ariola Records === In early 1970 he released the song \"La nave del olvido\" which became his first big hit in Mexico and Latin America, and recorded his second album: La Nave Del Olvido.

In 1973, Frank Sinatra listened to Jos\u00e9's music at Reprise Records and invited him to record a duet and a full album under Sinatra's label.

The show, broadcast by Televisa, lasted over five hours and featured special guests such as Armando Manzanero, Libertad Lamarque, Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez and Marco Antonio Mu\u00f1iz. Later that year, he released En las Buenas... y en las Malas with the lead single \"Amnesia\" reaching number-one on the Hot Latin Songs chart. Two years later, he released 40 y 20 in which the title track speaks about men who fall in love with women that are much younger than them and the reaction of the society to those situations. By the early 1990s, Jos\u00e9's vocals began to deteriorate. It worsened over time and became evident in his live performances. His excessive drinking and unceasing activity of his career caused his voice to falter. In August 1993, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Jos\u00e9's career, BMG hosted a tribute in the city of Puerto Vallarta. It was called 30 A\u00f1os de ser el Pr\u00edncipe (30 years of being the Prince). The tribute included some of the most prestigious artists of Spanish music such as Roc\u00edo D\u00farcal, Camilo Sesto, Armando Manzanero, Marco Antonio Mu\u00f1iz and Ra\u00fal di Blasio.

Four years later, he married Sara \"Sarita\" Salazar, his third wife. The same year during a Latin American tour, his third child Sara was born. He lived in Miami, Florida, with his wife. === Alcoholism === Jos\u00e9 said that he started drinking at the age of fifteen, when his father (an alcoholic) left home. As a result of his alcoholism, he developed a cocaine habit. He stated that his addiction was because he \"was frail, weak, innocent, ignorant, weak-willed and did not know how to say no\". In the early 1970s, after the success of \"El Triste\" and missing a collaboration with Frank Sinatra, he fell into depression and alcoholism, but with help of his friends and family he managed to stop drinking for a while. His ongoing battle against alcoholism continued during the 1970s and 1980s. He attended AA meetings and stopped drinking for periods of time, but fell steadily back into the addiction. After his divorce from Anel in 1991 he reached his lowest point, reportedly declaring that he wanted to die drinking. With the help of his friends, family and fellow artists, he decided to go to rehab. He went to the Hazelden clinic in Minnesota for rehab and remained a sober recovering alcoholic. ===Health issues=== Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 suffered from a severe case of pneumonia in 1972 and his thoracic diaphragm was paralyzed. The disease almost ended his career. He recovered after months of therapy involving breathing exercises. One of his lungs was permanently damaged. In 1987, he underwent an operation at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to remove nodes in his vocal fold as a consequence of the excessive use of cortisone before singing, alcohol use, and the lack of rest after many of his performances. Jos\u00e9 would suffer dire consequences from his problem with alcoholism, as his health faltered dearly during the 1990s. He developed diabetes. The effects of alcoholism, the abuse of cortisone, and his hiatus hernia not only affected his ability to sing but to talk, as well. In 2007, he suffered from Bell's palsy. As a result of all these problems, he fought a serious depression. He acknowledged this during an interview on the Univision program Don Francisco Presenta..., hosted by Don Francisco. He struggled with diabetic retinopathy in one of his eyes undergoing a successful operation. In 2012, he underwent surgery due to gastritis. In November 2013, he underwent an operation to remove cataracts from one of his eyes. ===Financial problems=== In later years, Jos\u00e9 made his financial problems public. Despite being one of the most recognized Latin artists for decades, his alcoholism caused him serious monetary loss. His career declined when he lost his vocal ability, stopping income from live performances. He claimed that during his career he was constantly defrauded by people close to him, including his former wife Anel and her brother. In November 2008, his wife suffered a cerebral haemorrhage, Jos\u00e9 stated that the medical bills nearly caused him to go bankrupt. He told TV Notas magazine that he and his family lived \"day to day\" and in 2014, he sold his five-million-dollar house in Coral Gables, Florida, and moved to an apartment in Miami. ==Illness and death== In March 2017, Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 announced he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.
