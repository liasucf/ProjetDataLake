    "text": "Afi Nayo (born 1969) is a French artist of Togolese origin. Nayo is a native of Lom\u00e9, but moved with her family to Paris early in life; she continues to live and work in that city. After studies at the \u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des beaux-arts she began her career as a sculptor, later turning to painting as well. She has shown work throughout Europe and Africa as well as in New York, and was featured in Revue Noire several times during the later 1990s. Her work is concerned with themes of spirituality and cultural interconnectedness. A 2007 work by Nayo, Love Suite I, in pyrogravure and mixed media on board, is currently owned by the National Museum of African Art. ==References== Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:People from Lom\u00e9 Category:Togolese emigrants to France Category:French women painters Category:French women sculptors Category:21st- century French painters Category:21st-century French sculptors Category:21st- century French women artists Category:Artists from Paris Category:Alumni of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts Category:20th-century French women artists ",
