    "text": "Valladolid (; Saki in Maya) is a city located in the eastern part of the Mexican state of Yucat\u00e1n. It is the seat of Valladolid Municipality. As of the 2010 census the population of the city was 45,868 inhabitants (the third- largest community in the state), and that of the municipality was 74,217. The municipality has an areal extent of 945.22 km\u00b2 (364.95 sq mi) and includes many outlying communities, the largest of which are Popol\u00e1, Kanxoc, Yalcob\u00e1, and Xoc\u00e9n. Valladolid is located approximately 160 km east of the state capital M\u00e9rida, 40 km east of Chichen Itza, and 150 km west of Cancun. On August 30, 2012, Valladolid became part of the Pueblo M\u00e1gico promotional initiative led by the Mexican tourism department. ==History== Named after Valladolid, at the time the capital of Spain. The name derives from the Arabic expression Ballad Al-Walid \u0628\u0644\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u064a\u062f, which means \"city of Al-Walid\", referring to Al-Walid I. the first Valladolid in Yucat\u00e1n was established by Spanish Conquistador Francisco de Montejo's nephew on May 27, 1543 at some distance from the current town, at a lagoon called Chouac-Ha in the municipality of Tizimin. However, early Spanish settlers complained about the mosquitos and humidity at the original location, and petitioned to have the city moved further inland. On March 24, 1545, Valladolid was relocated to its current location, built atop a Maya town called Zaci or Zaci-Val, whose buildings were dismantled to reuse the stones to build the Spanish colonial town. The following year the Maya people revolted, but were put down with additional Spanish troops coming from M\u00e9rida. In 1705 there was a revolt by local Maya; the rebels killed a number of town officials who had taken refuge in the Cathedral. When the revolt was suppressed, the Cathedral was considered irreparably profaned, and was demolished. A new Cathedral was built the following year that still exists; it was oriented to face north unlike most other Colonial churches in Yucatan which face east. Valladolid had a population of 15,000 in 1840. In January 1847, the native Mayans rioted, killing some eighty whites and sacking their houses. After a Mayan noble was shot by firing squad, the riot became a general uprising. It was led by Jacinto Pat, batab of Tihosuco and by Cecilio Chi of nearby Ichmul.Ronald Wright, 'Stolen Continents, Conquest and resistance in the Americas.' 257 The city and the surrounding region was the scene of intense battle during Yucat\u00e1n's Caste War, and the Ladino forces were forced to abandon Valladolid on March 14, 1848, with half being killed by ambush before they reached M\u00e9rida. The city was sacked by the Maya rebels but was recaptured later in the war. Until the beginning of the 20th century, Valladolid was the third largest and most important city of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula, (after M\u00e9rida and Campeche). It had a sizable well-to-do Criollo population, with a number of old Spanish style mansions in the old city. Valladolid was widely known by its nickname The Sultana of the East. ==Sights== Zac\u00ed Cenote Valladolid is a popular city in which to explore the history and culture of the Yucatan peninsula. From colonial era churches and architecture to natural attractions like cenote, notable sights include the colonial era cathedral Ex-convent and church Convent of San Bernardino de Siena named after saint Bernardino of Siena which was built by Franciscan missionaries between 1552 and 1560 in the Sisal neighbourhood. In downtown Valladolid is the cathedral of San Servacio located in the main square of the city. The center of the city's grid-like road structure features a plaza surrounded by restaurants and shops. Located close to the heart of the city is the Cenote Zaci, a landscaped freshwater cenote or underground sinkhole in which visitors can explore and swim. There is also a restaurant in the premises of the Cenote Zaci and artisans selling handcrafts.
