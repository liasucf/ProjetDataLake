    "text": "Rodovia dos Imigrantes (official designation SP\u2011160) is a highway in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The highway connects the city of S\u00e3o Paulo to the Atlantic coast and with the seaside cities of S\u00e3o Vicente and Praia Grande. It follows the route of Rodovia Anchieta and is also one of Brazil's busiest highways, especially on weekends. Rodovia dos Imigrantes has 44 viaducts, 7 bridges, and 11 tunnels, along its 58.5 km stretch. The highway has recently been expanded, in one of the most audacious feats of Brazilian highway engineering, with extremely long tunnels and high strutting six-lane bridges constructed over the tropical rain forest, which covers the steep faces of the Serra do Mar, the cliff range that separates the S\u00e3o Paulo plateau from the seaside lowlands. During sunny weekends, more than 1 million automobiles commonly cross its near 60 km run, separating the city of S\u00e3o Paulo from the sea. Rodovia dos Imigrantes was inaugurated in 1974, due to traffic saturation on Rodovia Anchieta. Although longer than Anchieta, Rodovia dos Imigrantes is nowadays busier due to its building standards, which permit higher speed limits, and its more direct path to the cities of Santos and Guaruj\u00e1, the northern coast (with Bertioga), as well as the southern coast (with cities Praia Grande, Mongagu\u00e1, and Itanha\u00e9m). Meaning \"immigrants' highway\" in Portuguese, Rodovia dos Imigrantes was so named as a way to remember the contribution of immigrants to the cultural, economic, and social development of Brazil. It is managed by a state concession to the private company, Ecovias, which also maintains Rodovia Anchieta; it is, therefore, a toll road. The two carriageways of Rodovia dos Imigrantes are both fully reversible and traffic is managed to flow either bidirectionally (uphill on one carriageway and downhill on the other) or unidirectionally (uphill or downhill on both carriageways), depending on demand. In the unidirectional mode, the opposing traffic is diverted to Rodovia Anchieta. == Directions == The path of the Immigrant Road crosses the following municipalities, all in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo:S\u00e3o Paulo, Diadema, S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo, Cubat\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Vicente and Praia Grande. == Tolls == The Rodovia dos Imigrantes has been tolled since its inauguration. As in all the highways that suffered concessions, the tolls of the Imigrantes suffered strong readjustments, even after discounting inflation, considered excessive by significant users. Currently, the toll of Imigrantes is the most expensive in the state, at R $26.20, valid for a round trip by car. In the stretch of plateau, the Imigrantes presents three tolls of blockade to the access to the bordering localities. ==See also== * Brazilian Highway System * Highway system of S\u00e3o Paulo * Rodovia Anchieta ==References== ==External links== * Secretary of Transportation of the State Government of S\u00e3o Paulo * Ecovias Category:Highways in S\u00e3o Paulo (state) ",
