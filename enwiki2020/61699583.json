    "text": "Leaving Meaning (stylized as leaving meaning.) is the fifteenth studio album by American experimental band Swans. It was released October 25, 2019 on Young God and Mute. A double album, Leaving Meaning's songs have been mixed separately for vinyl and CD releases, with the CD version of the album containing the original (and extended) mixes of the songs, as well as an additional track, \"Some New Things\". As with all Swans' releases of the 2010s, Leaving Meaning was financed by a fundraiser album \u2013 in this case, What Is This? in March 2019. ==Critical reception== Upon its release, Leaving Meaning received mostly positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, Leaving Meaning received an average score of 75, based on 16 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Andrew Perry of Mojo gave the album a favorable review, comparing it partly to The Burning World and writing, \"Whatever the sonic weather, Gira's spiritual austerity remains unimpaired.\" ===Accolades=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
