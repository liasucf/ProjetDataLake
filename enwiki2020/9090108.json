    "text": "The is a railway line operated by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) adjacent to Tokyo Bay, paralleling the western (i.e., inner) shore of the B\u014ds\u014d Peninsula. It connects Soga Station in the city of Chiba to Awa-Kamogawa Station in the city of Kamogawa, passing through the municipalities of Chiba, Ichihara, Sodegaura, Kisarazu, Kimitsu, Futtsu, Kyonan, Tateyama, and Minamib\u014ds\u014d. The line is connected at both ends to the Sotob\u014d Line. The name of the Uchib\u014d Line in the Japanese language is formed from two kanji characters. The first, , means \"inner\" and the second, is the first character of the B\u014ds\u014d. The name of the line thus refers to its location along the inner part of the B\u014ds\u014d Peninsula in relation to the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, as opposed to the Sotob\u014d Line, \"outer B\u014ds\u014d\" which is on the opposite side of the peninsula. South of Kimitsu is single track, and north of Kimitsu is double track. ==Station list== ;Legend * \u25cf : All trains stop * | : All trains pass ; Notes * Local trains stop at every station. * See Limited Express Sazanami article also. {|class=wikitable |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Line name !rowspan=\"2\"|Station !rowspan=\"2\"|Japanese !rowspan=\"2\"|Distance (km) !colspan=\"2\"|to/from Keiy\u014d Line !to/from S\u014dbu Line (Rapid) !rowspan=\"2\"|Connecting lines !rowspan=\"2\"|Location |- !style=\"background-color:MediumSeaGreen;\" |Keiy\u014d Line Rapid !style=\"background-color:Crimson;\" |Keiy\u014d Line Commuter Rapid !style=\"background-color:Lavender;\" |S\u014dbu Line Rapid |- !rowspan=\"3\"|Sotob\u014d Line |Chiba |\u5343\u8449 |align=\"right\"|From Chiba 0.0 |rowspan=\"2\"| |rowspan=\"2\"| |style=\"text-align:center;

Trains headed directly for Tokyo Station merge with the Sotob\u014d Line between Soga and Chiba Stations, and with the S\u014dbu Main Line between Chiba and Tokyo, while express and commuter trains merge with the Keiy\u014d Line from Soga station. ===Local trains=== A 209 series EMU on a \"Local\" service in July 2010 Daytime service from Chiba to and (sometimes to ) is generally 3 round trips per hour, from Chiba to and (sometimes to ) is 1 round trip per hour. Formerly, the Uchib\u014d and Sotob\u014d lines were connected by trains running from to Sotob\u014d Line , and from Kazusa- Ichinomiya station to Chiba Station via Tateyama/Kisarazu Stations, but no trains now pass Awa-Kamogawa Station in either direction. All-stations \"Local\" services use 209-2000/2100 series EMUs based at Makuhari Depot. ===Rapid service=== An E217 series EMU on a \"Rapid\" service in December 2013 *Direct connection to S\u014dbu Line (Rapid) *:Trains leaving north from Kimitsu station connect directly to the S\u014dbu Line Rapid. Since the October 2004 timetable revision, all trains now stop at Nagaura and Sodegaura stations. *Direct connection to Keiy\u014d Line (Rapid/Commuter Rapid) *:Commuter Rapid and Rapid service trains connecting to the Keiy\u014d Line extend to Kimitsu station in the morning and evening, with three trains inbound in the morning, and five outbound trains in the evening. One of the inbound morning trains originates from . ====Rolling stock==== * Yokosuka Line\u2014S\u014dbu Line Rapid through service trains: E217 series 11+4-car EMUs with 2 green cars (Kamakura and Makuhari depots) * Keiyo Line through service trains: E233-5000 series 10-car EMUs ===Limited express trains=== An E257-500 series EMU on a Sazanami service in October 2006 The limited express train Sazanami runs from Tokyo Station to Kimitsu and Tateyama stations (and Chikura station during busy periods). The limited express View Sazanami formerly ran on the Uchib\u014d Line as well, but it was merged with the Sazanami following the timetable revision on December 10, 2005. The limited express Shinjuku Sazanami runs from to Chikura on weekends. ====Rolling stock==== *255 series (including green cars) *E257-500 series (standard-class only) ==History== The Uchib\u014d line began operation in 1912, and was originally known as the . It operated from Soga Station to Anegasaki Station in Ichihara. Several extensions were built over the next few years, and in 1919 it reached Awa-H\u014dj\u014d (present day Tateyama). At this time it was renamed the . By 1925 it had been extended to its present-day terminus, Awa- Kamogawa Station. In 1929, the H\u014dj\u014d Line was incorporated into the B\u014ds\u014d Line. However, in 1933, the original section between Soga and Awa-Kamogawa Stations again became its own line, this time renamed the , and in 1972 it received its current name. The Soga - Kimitsu section was duplicated between 1964 and 1971, and the entire line was electrified between 1968 and 1971. Individual section dates as given in the Timeline section below. ===Timeline=== *March 28, 1912 \u2013 Kisarazu Line (Soga to Anegasaki) begins operation *August 21, 1912 \u2013 Extended from Anegasaki to Kisarazu *January 15, 1915 \u2013 Extended from Kisarazu to Kazusa-Minato *October 11, 1916 \u2013 Extended from Kazusa-Minato to Hamakanaya *August 1, 1917 \u2013 Extended from Hamakanaya to Awa-Katsuyama *August 10, 1918 \u2013 Extended from Awa-Katsuyama to Nako-Funakata *May 24, 1919 \u2013 Extended from Nako-Funakata to Awa-H\u014dj\u014d; renamed H\u014dj\u014d Line *June 1, 1921 \u2013 Extended from Awa-H\u014dj\u014d to Minamihara *December 20, 1922 \u2013 Extended from Minamihara to Emi *July 25, 1924 \u2013 Extended from Emi to Futomi *July 11, 1925 \u2013 Extended from Futomi to Awa-Kamogawa *June 16, 1926 \u2013 Takeoka station opened *May 20, 1927 \u2013 Chitose railyard opened *August 15, 1929 \u2013 B\u014ds\u014d line extended to Awa-Kamogawa; H\u014dj\u014d Line incorporated into B\u014ds\u014d Line *August 1, 1930 \u2013 Chitose railyard is upgraded to a station *April 1, 1933 \u2013 B\u014ds\u014d line from Soga to Awa-Kamogawa (the run of the former H\u014dj\u014d Line) is renamed B\u014ds\u014d West Line *November 20, 1941 \u2013 Iwane station opened *March 1, 1946 \u2013 Awa-H\u014dj\u014d station renamed Tateyama Station *January 10, 1947 \u2013 Nagaura station opened *April 10, 1956 \u2013 Sh\u016bsai station renamed Kimitsu Station *July 1, 1964 \u2013 Double-track section built between Soga and Hamano *September 20, 1964 \u2013 Double track extended from Hamano to Yawatajuku *July 4, 1965 \u2013 Double track extended from Yawatajuku to Goi *May 26, 1968 \u2013 Double track extended from Goi to Nagaura *July 13, 1968 \u2013 Electric wires extended from Chiba station, past Sogo, extending to Kisarazu *March 20, 1969 \u2013 Double track extended from Nagaura to Naraba *July 10, 1969 \u2013 135 C57-105 steam engines removed from service *July 11, 1969 \u2013 Electric wires extended from Kisarazu to Chikura *March 18, 1970 \u2013 Double track extended from Naraba to Kisarazu *March 24, 1970 \u2013 Double track extended from Kisarazu to Kimitsu *July 1, 1971 \u2013 Electric wires extended from Chikura to Awa-Kamogawa *July 15, 1972 \u2013 Renamed Uchib\u014d Line *March 31, 1974 \u2013 Naraba station renamed Sodegaura *November 15, 1982 \u2013 Freight service between Kisarazu and Awa-Kamogawa discontinued *April 1, 1987 \u2013 Acquired by East Japan Railway Company following the division and privatization of JNR initiated by prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone; Japan Freight Railway Company becomes a second class railway enterprise between Soga and Kisarazu *November 1, 1996 \u2013 Japan Freight Railway Company second class enterprise between Soga and Kisarazu is discontinued *February 4, 2001 \u2013 ATS-P usage implemented between Chiba and Iwane *October 1, 2009 - 209-2000/2100 series EMUs are introduced on local services ==References== Category:Lines of East Japan Railway Company Category:Railway lines in Chiba Prefecture Category:1067 mm gauge railways in Japan Category:Railway lines opened in 1912 Category:1912 establishments in Japan ",
