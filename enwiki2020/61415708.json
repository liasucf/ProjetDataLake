    "text": "Om Namah Shivaya is a 1999 Indian Kannada action film produced and directed by Thriller Manju. The film features Sai Kumar and Shobharaj in the lead roles. The film has musical score by Sadhu Kokila. The film was the Kannada movie debut of actress Preetha Vijayakumar. The film was named after a popular Hindu mantra, the most important mantra in Shaivism, which means \"O Salutations to the auspicious one\" or \"adoration to Lord film\". However, the film didn't have a devotional theme. The film revolves around a mobster who tries to eradicate social evils and in the process makes an enemy in an obnoxious crime lord thereby endangering his life and that of his loved ones. Shobharaj was praised for his performance. The film was released with big expectations due to it being the second venture of Thriller Manju - S.S.David - Sai Kumar trio after the cult blockbuster Police Story. Police Story also had Shobharaj playing the antagonist. Moreover, the film was released when Sai Kumar, by then referred to as Dialogue King, was in the peak of his popularity. Just like Police Story, Om Namah Shivaya had lengthy and loud monologues, a social theme and several action sequences. == Cast == * Sai Kumar * Shobharaj * S. S.
