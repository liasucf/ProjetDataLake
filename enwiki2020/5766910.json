    "text": "{| |} R/V Marcus Langseth is a research vessel owned by the National Science Foundation and operated by the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) of Columbia University as a part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) fleet. The Marcus G. Langseth was dedicated on December 4 2007, came into service in early 2008, replacing the R/V Maurice Ewing. Langseth is intended primarily to collect multichannel seismic data, including 3-D surveys. The ship was purchased from the geophysical survey company WesternGeco in 2004, having previously been named M/V Western Legend. The Marcus Langseth was named for Marcus G. Langseth, a Lamont scientist. In March 2009 Chinese authorities denied the vessel permission to pass between Taiwan and China. In August 2009, Marcus Langseth was named in a Canadian lawsuit seeking to halt its seismic tomography experiment. The lawsuit was dismissed, diplomatic clearance was issued and the ship sailed after a delay of a day. ==References== == External links == * Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory * LDEO marine operations: R/V Marcus G.
