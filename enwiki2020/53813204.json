    "text": "The Pigeon Wants a Puppy! is a 2008 picture book by Mo Willems about a pigeon that really wants a puppy, but on receiving the animal has second thoughts. ==Reception== Booklist, reviewing The Pigeon Wants a Puppy!, wrote \" Willems skillfully executes the formula that made previous Pigeon titles so popular: minimal artwork that places all the attention on the cajoling little bird, whose words and body language will strike a chord of familiarity with every child. Once again, kids will reach the story's end wondering what Pigeon will want next.\" and the School Library Journal wrote \"Kids will love this perfectly paced picture book, which offers both the expected (breaking the fourth wall, Pigeon's classic temper tantrum) and a new twist (Pigeon actually gets what he wants? Impossible!). Willems's hilariously expressive illustrations and engaging text are cinematic in their interplay. Maybe kids won't appreciate the genius behind it the way adults will, but that won't stop them from asking for this book again and again.\" The Pigeon Wants a Puppy! has also been reviewed by The New York Times, Publishers Weekly, Kirkus Reviews, and The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books. ==See also== *Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus! *Don't Let the Pigeon Stay Up Late! *The Duckling Gets a Cookie!? ==References== Category:2008 children's books Category:American picture books Category:Fictional passerine birds Category:Fictional dogs ",
