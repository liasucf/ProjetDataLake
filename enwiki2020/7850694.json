    "text": "Salm () is a character in the Persian epic Shahnameh. He is the oldest son of legendary hero and king Fereydun. It is believed that his name was given to him by his father, after Salm chooses to seek safety and run instead of fighting the dragon that had attacked him and his brothers (the dragon was Fereydun himself who had disguised himself to test his sons). When Fereydun decides to divide his kingdom among his sons, he gives Salm Anatolia and West. Salm and his brother Tur become jealous of their younger brother Iraj. They combine their forces against him and eventually murder the young prince. Years later Iraj\u2019s grandson Manuchehr avenges his grandfather\u2019s death by killing both Salm and Tur. ==Name== English scholar Harold Walter Bailey (1899\u20131996) derived the base word from Avestan sar- (to move suddenly) from tsar- in Old Iranian (tsarati, tsaru-, hunter), which also gave its name to the western Avestan region of Sairima (*salm, \u2013 *Sairmi), and also connected it to the 10\u201311th century AD Persian epic Shahnamehs character \"Salm\". == Family Tree == == See also == *Sarmatians ==References== ==External links== *A king's book of kings: the Shah-nameh of Shah Tahmasp, an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art (fully available online as PDF), which contains material on Salm Category:Persian mythology Category:Shahnameh characters ",
