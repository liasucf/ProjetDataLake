Billy Warbrick played at least 59 matches during the Natives' tour, including at least 36 in the British Isles. He was one of the star players on tour, and was described by tour manager Thomas Eyton as \"a dashing player, grand tackler, first-class kick, very quick at follow up\". Following the tour Warbrick moved to Australia where he played for Queensland, and then New South Wales. He also coached Australia in their first ever Test match\u2014against the British Isles in 1899. He contracted tuberculosis and returned to New Zealand shortly before he died in 1901. == References == == Bibliography == * Category:1866 births Category:1901 deaths Category:New Zealand rugby union players Category:M\u0101ori All Blacks players ",
