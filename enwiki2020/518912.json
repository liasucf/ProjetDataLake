It was replaced by a similar version of the Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye, the Grumman C-2 Greyhound. ==Design and development== The C-1 Trader grew out of a need by the United States Navy for a new anti- submarine airplane. In response to this Grumman began development on a prototype twin-engine, high-wing aircraft which it designated the G-89. In 1952 the Navy designated this aircraft the XS2F-1 and flew it for the first time on December 4 that year. During the rest of the 1950s three major variants emerged, the C-1 Trader being one of them. The C-1 (originally the TF-1) was outfitted to carry nine passengers or of cargo and first flew in January 1955. ==Operational history== Throughout the 1960s and 1970s the C-1 Trader carried mail and supplies to aircraft carriers on station in the Pacific Ocean during the Vietnam War and also served as a trainer for all- weather carrier operations. Over its production life 87 C-1 Traders were built, of which four were converted into EC-1A Tracer electronic countermeasures aircraft. The last C-1 was retired from USN service in 1988; it was the second-to-last radial-engine aircraft in U.S military service (The last C-131 wasn't retired until 1990). As of 2010, approximately ten were still airworthy in civil hands, operating as warbirds. In 1956 the U.S. Marine Corps Test Unit Number 1 (MCTU #1) tested the concept of using the TF-1 variant as a vehicle for inserting reconnaissance teams behind enemy lines. \u201cOn 9 July 1956 MCTU Recon Marines became the first to parachute from a TF-1. Less than three weeks later, four recon parachutists launched from the USS Bennington, which was 70 miles at sea, and jumped on a desert drop zone near El Centro California, some 100 miles inland. For the first time in Marine Corps and Naval Aviation history, the technique of introducing recon personnel off a carrier sea base to an inland objective had successfully been tested.\u201d In August 2010, Brazilian Naval Aviation announced that it will buy and modernize eight C-1 airframes to serve in carrier onboard delivery (COD) and aerial refueling roles for use on its aircraft carrier S\u00e3o Paulo.Brazilian navy buys Traders In 2011 contract was signed with Marsh Aviation to convert four ex-US Navy C-1A Trader airframes into KC-2 Turbo Traders.https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/brazilian-navy-restarts- kc-2-turbo-trader-contract-406169/ The first KC-2 prototype flight is expected for November 2017 and the delivery of the first operational aircraft is scheduled for December 2018. ==Variants== Grumman C-1 at Willow Grove USS Coral Sea ;TF-1 :Carrier Onboard Delivery version of the S-2 Tracker with enlarged fuselage for nine passengers, redesignated C-1A in 1962, 87 built. ;TF-1Q :Electronic Countermeasures conversion of the TF-1, redesignated EC-1A in 1962, four conversions. ;TF-1W :Airborne Early Warning project that was developed in the WF-2 Tracer. ;C-1A :TF-1 redesignated in 1962. ;EC-1A :TF-1Q redesignated in 1962. ;KC-2 Turbo Trader :Marsh Aviation modernization project for Air-to-Air Refueling, requested for the Brazilian Navy.\"Brazilian Traders set for modernisation\" Fight Global, 14 Dec 2011 Retrieved: 23 December 2011 ;G-101 :proposed 10-12 seat passenger variant ;G-104 :proposed tanker variant ==Operators== ; *United States Navy ; *Brazilian Naval Aviation ==Surviving aircraft== ;Airworthy * BuNo 136752 - privately owned in Phoenix, Arizona.\"FAA Registry/N71456.\" faa.gov Retrieved: 27 April 2016. * BuNo 136766 - privately owned in Carson City, Nevada.\"FAA Registry/N6193Z.\" faa.gov Retrieved: 27 April 2016. * BuNo 136773 - privately owned in Wilmington, Delaware.\"FAA Registry/N6193N.\" faa.gov Retrieved: 27 April 2016. * BuNo 136778 - based at Champaign Aviation Museum Urbana, Ohio.\"FAA Registry/N778SR.\" faa.gov Retrieved: 27 April 2016. * BuNo 136781 - based at Pacific Coast Air Museum, Santa Rosa, California.\"FAA Registry/136781.\" faa.gov Retrieved: 27 April 2016.\"Grumman C-1A Trader/136781.\" Pacific Coast Air Museum.

This aircraft was modified with the Grumman E-1 Tracer-type radome assembly (but no radar) and twin tails and served (under the designation XTF-1W) as the aerodynamic prototype for the E-1. After testing, it reverted to the transport role, (as C-1A) with radome removed but retaining the twin tails. Throughout, this aircraft retained the S-2/C-1 upward folding wings, not the E-1 wing fold which were necessitated (by the radome atop the fuselage) to fold wings back along the sides of the fuselage.\"Grumman C-1A Trader/136792.\" Quonset Air Museum.
