Ferko, et al., A modified radiofrequency-assisted approach to right hemihepatectomy, EJSO (2006), . This surgical technique has been published in various scientific journals and practiced by surgeons all around the world.Habib NA, et al., A paradigm shift towards bloodless surgery: radiofrequency assisted liver resection not only minimises blood loss but also optimises patient safety and reduced ICU admission, GUT, April 2004, 53:A87-A87. Moreover, he also developed two other devices Habib Probe and EUS-RFA, which are designed to treat advanced pancreatic cancer and obstructive jaundice secondary to advanced pancreatic cancer. The use of Habib Probe was first outlined by Dr. Michel Kahaleh in a pre-clinical study and has been successfully assessed in clinical studies too.
