    "text": "Class Records was an American record label established in Los Angeles, California in 1951 by songwriter and record producer Leon Ren\u00e9. Leon Ren\u00e9 and his brother Otis had previously established and run the independent rhythm and blues labels Exclusive and Excelsior, and owned their own record pressing plant. However, when the dominant format for singles changed from 78 rpm to 45rpm, they were unable to adjust, and the labels went out of business in 1950. Leon Ren\u00e9 then set up a new label, Class Records, installing his son, musician Rafael \"Googie\" Ren\u00e9, as A&R; Director.
