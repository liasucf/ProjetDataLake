    "text": "Danny Davis (born June 22, 1988 in Highland, Michigan) is a professional snowboarder. He was voted 2006 Rookie of the Year in the Transworld Snowboarding Riders Poll Awards, 2006 Rookie of the Year for Snowboarder Magazine, and 2008 Snowboarder Magazine Top 10 Riders of the Year. In January 2010 Davis won a snowboard Grand Prix event but not a spot on the US Olympic Team for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. He suffered a back injury in an ATV accident, ending his 2010 season and Olympic aspirations. Danny finished in 10th place at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Davis is a member of the Frends Crew made up of snowboarders Mason Aguirre, Kevin Pearce, Scotty Lago, Keir Dillon, Mikkel Bang, Jack Mitrani, and Luke Mitrani. Frends is a group of riders who turned their initial friendship into a formal alliance in 2007 to move the sport away from its recent competitive and business focus and return the sport to its grass roots and its collegial beginnings.There's No I in Frends NY Times, March 22, 2009 ==Competition history== 1st, 2015 Men's Snowboard Superpipe, ASPEN, CO 1st, 2014 Men's Snowboard Superpipe, ASPEN, CO 1st, 2010 Winter Dew Tour Wendy's Invitational, SNOWBASIN, UT 1st, 2010 US Grand Prix of Snowboarding, MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN, CA 1st, 2009 Winter Dew Tour Totino's Open, BRECKENRIDGE, CO 1st, 2009 Burton European Open, LAAX, SUI 4th, 2009 Winter Dew Tour, MT.
