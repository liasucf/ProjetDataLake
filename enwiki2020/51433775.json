The temple is located in a shrine in Ekambareswarar Temple, the largest temple in the town of Kanchipuram, located in the northern part of the town. The temple gopuram (gateway tower) is 59 m tall, which is one of the tallest gopurams in India. The temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th\u20139th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshiped as Nilathingal Thunda Perumal and his consort Lakshmi as Nilathingal Thunda Nayagi. Six daily rituals and two major yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Vaikunta Ekadasi festival, celebrated during the Tamil month of Margazhi (December - January), is the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Unlike other Vaishnavite temples where a Vaishnavite priest officiates, the temples has a Saiva priest as it in inside a Shiva temple. ==Legend== Legend indicating churning of Ocean of Milk Parvati, the consort of Shiva was doing penance under the temple's ancient Mango tree near Vegavathi river. In order to test her devotion Shiva sent fire on her. Goddess Parvati prayed to her brother, Vishnu for help. Vishnu took the crescent from Shiva's head and reflected the rays which then cooled down the tree as well as Parvati. Shiva wanted to test Parvati again and sent the river Ganga (Ganges) to disrupt her penance. Parvati prayed to Ganga and convinced her that both of them were sisters and so she should not harm her. Subsequently, Ganga did not disturb her penance and Parvati made a Shiva Linga out of sand to get united with Shiva. Shiva came to be known as Ekambareswarar or \"Lord of Mango Tree\" and Vishnu as Nilathingal Thundam. As per Hindu legend, Parvathi was doing penance at this place to attain the blessings of her husband Shiva. She sought the help of Vishnu to help her in the cause. Vishnu appeared as Vamana with a conch and disc and radiated light as moon. It is believed that Vishnu appeared for Chandra (moon) and Shiva. As per another legend, when Devas (celestial deities) and Asuras (demons) were churning the Ocean of Milk, Vishnu helped them as a tortoise Kurma holding the mount. The snake Vasuki using as a rope for churning emanated poison that turned the skin colour of the tortoise from blue to black. Vishnu reached out to Brahma for resolution, who advised him to worship Shiva. It is believed that Sun and moon are the two eyes of Shiva. He opened his left moon eye to ease the pain of Vishnu with the cold lunar rays. On account of it, the presiding deity came to be known as Nilathingal Thunda Perumal. ==History== The Ekambareswarar temple is one of the most ancient in India having been in existence since at least 600 AD. 2nd century AD Tamil poetry speaks of Kama kottam, and the Kumara kottam (currently the Kamakashi Amman temple and the Subramanya temple).Initially temple was built by Pallavas.

At the later stage a similar temple with same name Ekambareswarar was constructed in Chennai by Pachiappa Mudaliar in order to avoid travelling time to Kanchipuram. The Archaeological Survey of India report of 1905\u201306 indicates widespread renovation activities carried out in the temple by Nattukottai Chettiar.
