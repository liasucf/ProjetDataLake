The channel attracts a varied range of animals and birds, with one of the world's largest concentration of hippos and numerous Nile crocodiles. Lake George is a small lake with an average depth of only and which is fed by streams from the Rwenzori mountains. Its outflow is through the Kazinga Channel which drains into Lake Edward, water levels fluctuating very little. In 2005, large numbers of hippos were killed in the channel as a result of an anthrax outbreak, which occurs when animals eat remnants of vegetation in the driest months, absorbing bacterial spores that can live for decades in dry soil. The channel is described as a popular wildlife tourism area.Uganda cracks down on 'dissenting' Rwenzururu kingdom == External links == * Anthrax Kills 18 Hippos in Ugandan National Park * Strolling Guides - Kazinga Channel Some photographs and information. * == References == Category:Rivers of Uganda Category:Lake Edward Category:Lake George (Uganda) Category:Kasese District ",
