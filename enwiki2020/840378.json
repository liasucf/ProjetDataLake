Buchanan was previously based in Florida and lives in rural Georgia. Buchanan discovered documents related to Union Banking Corporation's business dealings with Fritz Thyssen, the Nazi industrialist who broke with the Nazis after Kristallnacht in 1938 and fled to Switzerland during World War II; together with Stacy Michael, Buchanan wrote an article about it for the New Hampshire Gazette, accusing one of the directors of the bank, Prescott Bush, of dealing with the Nazis. He e-mailed a number of threats against journalists and media outlets who refused to publish his theories, saying that he would expose the journalists as \"traitors to the truth.\" Buchanan was arrested and charged with aggravated stalking in Miami, Florida, over a dispute of how best to publicize his theories, but the charges were dropped in 2004. During his presidential campaign, he often referred to himself as \"the 9/11 Truth Candidate\".Archive of John Buchanan.org On September 1, 2000, before Mr. Bush took office, the Project for a New American Century proposed the invasions, without provocation or attack, of Afghanistan and Iraq. The motive? 'to protect America's oil interests.' The signatories to that sinister plan - Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz, and Richard Perle, to name but a few \u2013 cleverly and dishonorably set the stage for all that would follow, including the horrifying spectacle of 9/11, when they noted that since well-fed and materially-comfortable Americans would lack the will and focus to fight such 'interventionist' wars - now known as 'The Bush Doctrine' - there must be a galvanizing incident on the order of Pearl Harbor. He also opposed the 2003 Iraq war. A United Press International reporter called his campaign \"unhinged.\" With 836 votes, Buchanan finished in eighth in the 2004 New Hampshire primary, in which incumbent George W. Bush was not seriously contested. Buchanan also mulled a 2004 run with the Reform Party. The major contenders for the nomination were Ted Weill and Ralph Nader, the latter of whom was ultimately chosen. politics1.com, Buchanan served as editor of the Blairsville, GA Union Sentinel for 13 weeks in 2005.
