    "text": "I Corps (\"First Corps\") was an army corps in existence as an active formation in the British Army for most of the 80 years from its creation in the First World War until the end of the Cold War, longer than any other corps. It had a short-lived precursor during the Waterloo Campaign. ==Napoleonic precursor== Assembling an army in Belgium to fight Napoleon's resurgent forces in the spring of 1815, the Duke of Wellington formed it into army corps, deliberately mixing units from the Anglo-Hanoverian, Dutch-Belgian and German contingents so that the weaker elements would be stiffened by more experienced or reliable troops. As he put it: 'It was necessary to organize these troops in brigades, divisions, and corps d\u2019armee with those better disciplined and more accustomed to war'.Hofschroer, Ligny and Quatre Bras, p.109. He placed I Corps under the command of the Prince of Orange and it was this corps that was first contacted by the advancing French at Quatre Bras on 16 June 1815. However, Wellington did not employ the corps as tactical entities, and continued his accustomed practice of issuing orders directly to divisional and lower commanders. When he drew up his army on the ridge at Waterloo, elements of the various corps were mixed up, and although he gave the Prince of Orange nominal command of the centre, that officer had different forces under him. Subsequent to the battle, the corps structure was re-established for the advance into France, I Corps being commanded by Maj-Gen Sir John Byng, the Prince of Orange having been wounded at Waterloo.Hofschroer, The German Victory, p.201. ===Composition of I Corps in the Waterloo Campaign=== General Officer Commanding (GOC): General The Prince of Orange * 1st (British) Division (British Guards) * 3rd (British) Division (Anglo-Hanoverian) * 2nd (Netherlands) Division (Dutch- Belgian) * 3rd (Netherlands) Division (Dutch-Belgian) ==Prior to the First World War== After Waterloo the army corps structure largely disappeared from the British Army, except for ad hoc formations assembled during annual manoeuvres (e.g. Army Manoeuvres of 1913). In 1876 a Mobilisation Scheme for eight army corps was published, with 'First Corps' based on Colchester. In 1880 First Corps' organization was: * 1st Division (Colchester) ** 1st Brigade (Colchester) *** 1st Bn. 2nd Foot (Colchester), 1st Bn. 10th Foot (Colchester) ** 2nd Brigade (Colchester) *** 1st Bn. 9th Foot (Kinsale), 28th Foot (Fermoy) ** Divisional Troops *** 2nd Bn. 12th Foot (Portsmouth), Buckinghamshire Yeomanry (Buckingham), 1st Company Royal Engineers (Shorncliffe) ** Artillery *** F/1st Brigade Royal Artillery (Ipswich), D/1st Brigade RA (Woolwich) * 2nd Division (Chelmsford) ** 1st Brigade (Chelmsford) *** 1st Bn. 15th Foot (Tipperary), 47th Foot (The Curragh) ** 2nd Brigade (Warley) *** 1st Bn. 3rd Foot (Shorncliffe), 49th Foot (Dover), 55th Foot (Shorncliffe) ** Divisional Troops *** 1st Bn. 23rd Foot (Woolwich), Hertfordshire Yeomanry (St Albans), 20th Company Royal Engineers (Chatham) ** Artillery *** I/4th Brigade RA (Newcastle), N/4th Brigade RA (Woolwich), M/4th Brigade RA (Newcastle) * 3rd Division (Gravesend) ** 1st Brigade (Gravesend) *** 77th Foot (Dublin), 104th Foot (Belfast), 105th Foot (Newry) ** 2nd Brigade (Chatham) *** 2nd Bn. 5th Foot (Chatham), 31st Foot (Chatham), 86th Foot (Chatham) ** Divisional Troops *** 87th Foot (Limerick), West Kent Yeomanry (Maidstone), 22nd Company Royal Engineers (Woolwich) ** Artillery *** O/4th Brigade RA (Weedon), A/5th Brigade RA (Weedon) * Cavalry Brigade (Maldon) ** 3rd Hussars (Colchester), 4th Hussars (Shorncliffe), Suffolk Yeomanry (Bury St Edmunds), F Battery C Brigade Royal Horse Artillery (Canterbury) * Corps Artillery (Colchester) ** E Battery C Brigade RHA (Woolwich), H Battery A Brigade RHA (Woolwich) ** G/1st Brigade RA (Woolwich), B/5th Brigade RA (Sheffield) * Corps Engineers (Colchester) ** A (Pontoons) Troop Royal Engineer Train (Aldershot) ** C (Telegraph) Troop Royal Engineer Train (Aldershot) ** 23rd Company Royal Engineers and Field Park (Chatham) This scheme had been dropped by 1881.Army List 1876\u20131881. The Stanhope Memorandum of 1891 (drawn up by Edward Stanhope when Secretary of State for War) laid down the policy that after providing for garrisons and India, the army should be able to mobilise three army corps for home defence, two of regular troops and one partly of militia, each of three divisions. Only after those commitments, it was hoped, might two army corps be organised for the unlikely eventuality of deployment abroad.Dunlop ch 2. When the Second Anglo-Boer War was imminent in September 1899, a field army, referred to as the Army Corps (sometimes I Army Corps) was mobilised and sent to Cape Town. It was, in fact, 'about the equivalent of the First Army Corps of the existing mobilization scheme',Dunlop p 72. and was placed under the command of Gen Sir Redvers Buller, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Aldershot Command. However, once in South Africa the corps never operated as such, and the three divisions (1st, 2nd and 3rd) were widely dispersed. The 1901 Army Estimates introduced by St John Brodrick allowed for six army corps based on the six regional commands (Aldershot, Southern, Irish, Eastern, Northern and Scottish) of which only I Corps (Aldershot Command) and II Corps (Southern Command on Salisbury Plain) would be entirely formed of regular troops.Dunlop pp 130-40. However, these arrangements remained theoretical, the title 'I Corps' being added to Aldershot Command. In early October 1902 a memorandum was issued showing the organization and allocation of the 1st Army Corps, to which Sir John French had recently been appointed in command: * 1st Division ** 1st Brigade (Guards) (Marlborough Lines) ** 2nd Infantry Brigade (HQ Blackdown) ** One squadron of cavalry, two brigade divisions Royal Field Artillery, an ammunition column, a field company Royal Engineers, one company Army Service Corps, a field hospital * 2nd Division ** 3rd Infantry Brigade (HQ Stanhope Lines) ** 4th Infantry Brigade (HQ Wellington) ** One squadron of cavalry, two brigade divisions Royal Field Artillery, an ammunition column, a field company Royal Engineers, one company Army Service Corps, a field hospital * 3rd Division ** 5th Infantry Brigade (HQ Bordon) ** 6th Infantry Brigade (HQ Bordon) ** One squadron of cavalry, two brigade divisions Royal Field Artillery, an ammunition column, a field company Royal Engineers, one company Army Service Corps, a field hospital * 1st Cavalry Brigade (South Cavalry Barracks) In 1907 the title changed to 'Aldershot Corps' but reverted to simply 'Aldershot Command' the following year.Army List Finally, the Haldane Reforms of 1907 established a six-division British Expeditionary Force for deployment overseas, but only Aldershot Command possessed two infantry divisions and a full complement of 'army troops' to form an army corps in the field.Dunlop p 262. ==First World War== Pre-war planning for the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) did not envisage any intermediate headquarters between GHQ and the six infantry divisions, but it was assumed that if corps HQs became necessary, then the GOC Aldershot Command would automatically become GOC I Corps in the field.Neillands, p. 169. On mobilisation in August 1914 the decision was made to conform to the two-division army corps organisation employed by the French armies alongside which the BEF was to operate.Official History 1914, Volume I, p. 7. Sir Douglas Haig, then commanding at Aldershot, therefore took I Corps HQ to France with 1st Division and 2nd Division under command, and it remained on the Western Front throughout the war. It had a peripheral part at the Battle of Mons, then saw hard fighting at the Battle of the Aisne and First Battle of Ypres in 1914, at the Battle of Aubers Ridge in the Spring of 1915 and alongside the Canadian Corps at the Battle of Hill 70, as well in many other large battles of the First World War. ===Composition of I Corps in First World War=== The composition of army corps changed frequently. Some representative orders of battle for I Corps are given here. Order of Battle at Mons 23 August 1914Official History 1914, Volume I, Appendix 1.

Once the era of trench warfare had set in on the Western Front (1915\u201317), the BEF left its army corps in position for long periods, so that they became familiar with their sector, while rotating divisions as they required rest, training, or transfer to other sectors.Sanders Marble, 'Offensive versus Subsidiary Attacks, 1916\u20131918: The British Expeditionary Force Balancing its Options', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Volume 87, No 351 (Autumn 2009). On 25 September 1918, for the final battles, I Corps was transferred from First Army to Sir William Birdwood's Fifth Army.Official History 1918 Volume 5, p 125.

During the Second World War, I Corps' first assignment was again to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) where it was commanded by General Sir John Dill, and then Lieutenant General Michael Barker from April 1940. After the Germans broke through Allied lines in the Battle of France in May 1940, the BEF was forced to retreat to Dunkirk for evacuation to England. The Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the BEF, General Lord Gort, ordered Barker to form the rearguard with I Corps to cover the evacuation, and surrender to the Germans as a last resort. However, the acting commander of II Corps, Major General Bernard Montgomery, advised Gort that Barker was in an unfit state to be left in final command, and recommended that Major General Harold Alexander of the 1st Division should be put in charge. Gort did as Montgomery advised, and in the event the bulk of I Corps was successfully evacuated. As Montgomery recalled: '\"Alex\" got everyone away in his own calm and confident manner'.Montgomery p. 64 ===Composition of I Corps in the Battle of France=== The order of battle was as follows: General Officer Commanding: Lieutenant General M.G.H. Barker * 1st Infantry Division * 2nd Infantry Division * 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division * Royal Artillery ** 27th Army Field Regiment (21/24 & 37/47 Batteries) ** 140th (5th London) Army Field Regiment (366 (10th London) & 367 (11th London) Batteries) ** 3rd Medium Regiment (2/11 & 6/10 Batteries) ** 5th Medium Regiment (15/17 & 20/21 Batteries) ** 52nd (East Lancashire) Light Anti- Aircraft Regiment (154, 155 & 156 Batteries) ** 2nd Light Anti-Aircraft Battery ** 1st Survey Regiment * I Corps Troops, Royal Engineers ** 102nd, 107th, 221st Army Field Companies ** 105th Corps Field Park Company ** 13th Corps Field Survey Company * Infantry\u2014Machine Gun ** 2nd Battalion, Cheshire Regiment ** 4th Battalion, Cheshire Regiment ** 2nd Battalion, Manchester Regiment ===North-West Europe=== After returning to England I Corps then remained in the United Kingdom, based at Hickleton Hall in South Yorkshire within Northern Command on anti-invasion duties, preparing defences to repel a German invasion of the United Kingdom.Newbold, p. 202 Lieutenant General John Crocker, pictured here in August 1944. I Corps, now commanded by Lieutenant General John Crocker, then took part in the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944 where, along with XXX Corps, under Lieutenant General Gerard Bucknall (who had commanded I Corps between April and August 1943), it was a spearhead corps of Lieutenant General Miles Dempsey's British Second Army, itself part of the 21st Army Group. The corps was then involved in the Battle of Normandy in fierce attritional fighting for control of the Normandy beachhead. After fighting for two months in the Battle for Caen, I Corps was subordinated on 1 August 1944 to the Canadian First Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Harry Crerar, for the remainder of the Normandy campaign Hart, p.19 and the subsequent operations in the Low Countries.Williams, p. 466. participating in Operation Astonia, the capture of Le Havre, and the operations to clear the Channel Coast, later helping to garrison \"The Island\" area between Arnhem and Nijmegen in the aftermath of the failed airborne invasion of the Netherlands, Operation Market Garden. During Operation Pheasant, I Corps was unique in that it fielded multi national divisionsm - Polish 1st Armoured Division, the Canadian 4th Armoured Division the British 49th Polar Bears Division and the US 104th Timberwolf Division. After the Battle of the Scheldt I Corps Headquarters then took over administration of the 21st Army Group's logistics area around the port of Antwerp, Belgium until the end of the war. ===Composition of I Corps in NW Europe Campaign=== General Officer Commanding: Lieutenant-General John Crocker * Corps troops:Forty, p 346. ** Inns of Court Regiment, Royal Armoured Corps (armoured cars) ** 62nd (6th London) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery ** 102nd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA ** 9th Survey Regiment, RA ** I Corps Troops, Royal Engineers ** I Corps Signals, Royal Corps of Signals Attached: * 4th Army Group, Royal Artillery ** 150th (South Nottinghamshire Hussars Yeomanry) Field Regiment, RA (suspended animation January 1945) ** 53rd (London) Medium Regiment, RA (209 & 210 (London) Batteries) ** 65th Medium Regiment, RA (222 (Fraserborough) & 223 (Banffshire) Batteries) ** 68th Medium Regiment, RA (233 & 234 Batteries) ** 79th (Scottish Horse Yeomanry) Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery ** 51st (Lowland) Heavy Regiment, RA Assignments of corps to armies, and divisions to corps, changed frequently during the campaign: As of 6 June 1944Ellis, p.181 * British 3rd Infantry Division * 3rd Canadian Infantry Division * 6th Airborne Division As of 7 July 1944 * British 3rd Infantry Division * 3rd Canadian Infantry Division * 51st (Highland) Infantry Division * 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division * 6th Airborne Division As of 1 August 1944 (now part of First Canadian Army) * 51st (Highland) Infantry Division * 6th Airborne Division (returned to United Kingdom 3 September 1944) * 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division * 7th Armoured Division ==British Army of the Rhine== After the defeat of Germany, the 21st Army Group became the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR), and 1 Corps, under the command of Lieutenant-General Ivor Thomas, was transformed into a corps district, with an administrative, rather than combat, role. It was disbanded in 1947.The British Army in Germany: An Organizational History 1947-2004 By Graham Watson, Richard A. Rinaldi, Page 11 Tiger Lily, 2005, However, in October 1951 the corps was reactivated to become the principal combat element of the BAOR, with its HQ based in Bielefeld. In March 1952, following the reactivation of 6th Armoured Division, its component formations were: * 2nd Infantry Division * 6th Armoured Division * 7th Armoured Division * 11th Armoured Division Included as part of this was Canada's contribution to the NATO land forces in Germany. A Canadian mechanised brigade remained part of BAOR until 1970. The size of this force, 6,700, was such that it was referred to within British circles as a \"light division\". In a following 1958-60 reorganisation the Corps was formed into three mixed armour/infantry divisions including five brigade groups, which were in 1965 brought together into three centralised divisions. With the end of National Service, manpower across the whole of BAOR dropped from around 77,000 to 55,000. In the late 1970s the Corps was reorganised as four small five battle group armoured divisions plus a roughly brigade sized infantry 'Field Force'. It then comprised: * 1st Armoured Division * 2nd Armoured Division * 3rd Armoured Division * 4th Armoured Division * 5th Field Force Following the 1981-3 reorganisation, the Corps consisted of 1st and 4th Armoured Divisions, which would have manned the front line against the anticipated attack by the Soviet 3rd Shock Army, plus in an in-depth, reserve role the 3rd Armoured Division and finally the 2nd Infantry Division which was tasked with rear-area security.Isby & Kamps, pp.256-258 * 1st Armoured Division ** 7th Armoured Brigade ** 12th Armoured Brigade ** 22nd Armoured Brigade * 3rd Armoured Division ** 4th Armoured Brigade ** 6th Armoured Brigade ** 33rd Armoured Brigade * 4th Armoured Division ** 11th Armoured Brigade ** 20th Armoured Brigade ** 19th Infantry Brigade (in UK) * 2nd Infantry Division (in UK) ** 15th Infantry Brigade (TA) ** 24th Airmobile Brigade ** 49th Infantry Brigade (TA) * The Artillery Division (HQ Ripon Barracks, Bielefeld) : Structure of the 1 British Corps in 1989. With the end of the Cold War, in 1992 1 (BR) Corps was disbanded, and its HQ closed. Some of the staff serving in HQ 1(BR) Corps were reassigned to the new HQ UK Support Command (Germany) which was formed from the rump of HQ BAOR. The remainder of the staff formed the British component (50% of the total staff in the HQ) in the Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps (HQ ARRC), a newly instated multi-national NATO Rapid Reaction Corps HQ. The Corps Commander reported to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe SACEUR, but had no troops under command except when assigned to ARRC by NATO member nations, for operations or for exercises. HQ ARRC moved to Rheindahlen in 1994. ==General Officers Commanding== Commanders have included:Army Commands * 1815 General The Prince of Orange From 1901 to 1905 the commander of the troops at Aldershot was also commander 1st Army Corps * 1 October 1901: General Sir Redvers Buller * 25 October 1901: Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Hildyard, temporary * 15 September 1902: Lieutenant-General Sir John French * 1914 Lieutenant-General Sir Douglas Haig * 1914\u20131915 Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Monro * 1915\u20131916 Lieutenant-General Sir Hubert Gough * 1917\u20131918 Lieutenant- General Sir Arthur Holland Note: I Corps was disbanded at the end of the First World War and reformed at the start of the Second World War * 1939\u20131940 General Sir John Dill * 1940 Lieutenant-General Michael Barker * 1940 Lieutenant-General Harold Alexander * 1940\u20131941 Lieutenant-General Laurence Carr * 1941\u20131942 Lieutenant-General Henry Willcox * 1942\u20131943 Lieutenant- General Frederick Morgan * Apr-Aug 1943 Lieutenant-General Gerard Bucknall * 1943\u20131945 Lieutenant-General John Crocker * 1945 Lieutenant-General Sidney Kirkman * 1945\u20131947 Lieutenant-General Ivor Thomas Note: I Corps was disbanded in June 1947 and reformed in late 1951 * 1951\u20131953 Lieutenant-General Sir Dudley Ward * 1953\u20131954 Lieutenant-General Sir James Cassels * 1954\u20131956 Lieutenant-General Sir Hugh Stockwell * 1956\u20131958 Lieutenant-General Sir Harold Pyman * 1958\u20131960 Lieutenant-General Sir Michael West * 1960\u20131962 Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Jones * 1962\u20131963 Lieutenant-General Sir Kenneth Darling * 1963\u20131966 Lieutenant-General Sir Richard Goodwin * 1966\u20131968 Lieutenant-General Sir John Mogg * 1968\u20131970 Lieutenant-General Sir Mervyn Butler * 1970\u20131972 Lieutenant-General Sir John Sharp * 1972\u20131974 Lieutenant- General Sir Roland Gibbs * 1974\u20131976 Lieutenant-General Sir Jack Harman * 1976\u20131978 Lieutenant-General Sir Richard Worsley * 1978\u20131980 Lieutenant- General Sir Peter Leng * 1980\u20131983 Lieutenant-General Sir Nigel Bagnall * 1983\u20131985 Lieutenant-General Sir Martin Farndale * 1985\u20131987 Lieutenant- General Sir Brian Kenny * 1987\u20131989 Lieutenant-General Sir Peter Inge * 1989\u20131991 Lieutenant-General Sir Charles Guthrie * 1991\u20131992 Lieutenant- General Sir Jeremy Mackenzie ==Notes== ==References== * * Dunlop, Colonel John K., The Development of the British Army 1899\u20131914, London, Methuen (1938). * Ellis, John, The World War II Databook.
