She participated at the 2011, 2015, and 2019 editions of the FIFA Women's World Cup. ==Club career== Beatriz joined her local team Ferrovi\u00e1ria at the age of 13. In 2010, she moved to play for reigning Copa Libertadores Femenina champions Santos. In February 2013 Beatriz and her Vit\u00f3ria das Tabocas teammate Tha\u00edsinha announced that they had accepted a transfer to South Korean club Incheon Hyundai Steel Red Angels. With the team, Beatriz has won seven consecutive WK League championships between 2013 and 2019. In the 2015 championship, she scored an equalizing goal in the 123rd minute to force the game to penalty shoot-out, where her team prevailed. ==International career== Ahead of the inaugural 2008 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, a 14-year-old Beatriz was the youngest player in Brazil's squad and was highlighted as a \"player to watch\" by The New Zealand Herald newspaper. In May 2011, she made her debut for the senior national team in a 3\u20130 friendly win over Chile at Est\u00e1dio Rei Pel\u00e9 in Macei\u00f3. Beatriz was named in Brazil's squad for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup in Germany and participated in the 3\u20130 group stage win over Equatorial Guinea. In February 2015, Beatriz's club commitments in South Korea meant she was left out of Brazil's 18-month residency programme intended to prepare the national team for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup and the 2016 Rio Olympics. At the World Cup in Canada, Beatriz made substitute appearances in the final group game, a 1\u20130 win over Costa Rica, and the 1\u20130 second round defeat by Australia. Beatriz was named to the Brazil squad for the 2016 Summer Olympics, her first Olympic Games. She plundered three goals, including one in the Bronze Medal match which Brazil lost 2\u20131 to Canada, as hosts Brazil finished in fourth place. It was reported that her performances \"lit up\" the Games and made her a target for clubs in the American National Women's Soccer League, albeit her relatively high salary in South Korea made a transfer less likely. At the 2019 SheBelieves Cup, Beatriz suffered a fractured fibula during Brazil's 1\u20130 defeat by hosts the United States in Tampa, Florida. ===International goals=== Scores and results list Brazil's goal tally first. {|class=\"wikitable collapsible sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"| Goal !Date !Location !Opponent !data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"font- size:95%;\"|Score !data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"|Result !width=\"20%\"|Competition |- |1 |2015-03-11 | Albufeira, Portugal | | | |2015 Algarve Cup |- |2 |rowspan=3|2015-12-10 |rowspan=3| Natal, Brazil |rowspan=3| | |rowspan=3| |rowspan=3|Torneio Internacional Natal 2015 |- |3 | |- |4 | |- |5 |2016-03-07 | Lagos, Portugal | | | |Algarve Cup 2016 |- |6 |rowspan=2|2016-08-06 |rowspan=2| Rio de Janeiro, Brazil |rowspan=2| | |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2|Olympics 2016 |- |7 | |- |8 |2016-08-19 | S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil | | | |Olympics 2016 |- |9 |rowspan=2|2016-12-07 |rowspan=2| Manaus, Brazil |rowspan=2| | |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2|Torneio Internacional 2016 |- |10 | |- |11 |rowspan=2|2016-12-11 |rowspan=2| Manaus, Brazil |rowspan=2| | |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2|Torneio Internacional 2016 |- |12 | |- |13 |2016-12-14 | Manaus, Brazil | | | |Torneio Internacional 2016 |- |14 |2017-10-19 | Chongqing, China | | | |2017 Yongchuan International Tournament |- |15 |2017-11-26 | Ovalle, Chile | | | |Friendly match |- |16 |2017-11-29 | La Serena, Chile | | | |Friendly match |- |17 |2018-04-05 | Coquimbo, Chile | | | |Copa Am\u00e9rica 2018 |- |18 |rowspan=2|2018-04-07 |rowspan=2| Coquimbo, Chile |rowspan=2| | |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2|Copa Am\u00e9rica 2018 |- |19 | |- |20 |rowspan=2|2018-04-11 |rowspan=2| Coquimbo, Chile |rowspan=2| | |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2|Copa Am\u00e9rica 2018 |- |21 | |- |22 |2018-04-16 | La Serena, Chile | | | |Copa Am\u00e9rica 2018 |- |23 |2018-07-29 | East Hartford, United States | | | |2018 Tournament of Nations |- |24 |rowspan=2|2019-11-07 |rowspan=2| Chongqing, China |rowspan=2| | |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2|2019 Yongchuan International Tournament |- |25 | |- |26 |rowspan=3|2019-12-13 |rowspan=3| S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil |rowspan=3| | |rowspan=3| |rowspan=3|Friendly game |- |27 | |- |28 | |} ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:Brazilian women's footballers Category:Women's association football forwards Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in South Korea Category:Expatriate women's footballers in South Korea Category:WK League players Category:Brazil women's international footballers Category:Brazilian expatriate women's footballers Category:2011 FIFA Women's World Cup players Category:2015 FIFA Women's World Cup players Category:2019 FIFA Women's World Cup players Category:Footballers at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:Santos FC (women) players Category:Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Ferrovi\u00e1ria de Esportes (women) players Category:Olympic footballers of Brazil Category:Incheon Hyundai Steel Red Angels players Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:People from Araraquara ",
