Starting at Vila Real, Costa moved to Acad\u00e9mica, where he spent five years and won the 1938\u201339 Ta\u00e7a de Portugal. In 1941, he joined Benfica, where he won three league titles. ==Career== Costa began at Vila Real, before transferring for Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra, where he would spend five years and win the inaugural Ta\u00e7a de Portugal in 1938\u201339. Afterwards, he joined Benfica and made his debut on 18 January 1942 against Carcavelinhos. Alongside Francisco Rodrigues, Joaquim Teixeira and Alfredo Valadas, he helped Benfica win the league title, contributing with 6 goals in 16 games. The following year, still as first team player, he scored 12 in 14 games as Benfica retained the league title. His third season was not as successful, as Benfica lost the league title, despite him scoring 7 league goals. His playing time dwindled in his fourth year, as Julinho, Esp\u00edrito Santo and Ars\u00e9nio gained recognition. Still, with two appearances in the Primeira Divis\u00e3o, he secured his third league title. He left Benfica to play for Atl\u00e9tico CP in 1945, staying there for two seasons. ==Honours== ;Acad\u00e9mica * Ta\u00e7a de Portugal: 1938\u201339 ;Benfica * Primeira Liga: 1941\u201342, 1942\u201343, 1944\u201345 * Ta\u00e7a de Portugal: 1942\u201343 ==References== General * Specific Category:1916 births Category:Year of death unknown Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Primeira Liga players Category:Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra \u2013 O.A.F. players Category:S.L.
