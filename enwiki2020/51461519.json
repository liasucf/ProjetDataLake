He studied at Harvard with Roman Jakobson, and received his Ph.D. from Yale under the supervision of Sidney Mintz. He specialized in Slavic languages and literature, and in the ethnographic and linguistic study of the Pur\u00e9pecha people of Western Mexico, as well as in the role of poetics and aesthetics in creating linguistic and discursive patterns. Among his best known works were Agrarian Revolt in a Mexican Village (1970; 1977), The Princes of Naranja: An Essay in Anthrohistorical Method (1987), both ethnographic works describing local politics in a small community in the Mexican state of Michoacan. And in linguistics his works The Tarascan Suffixes of Locative Space: Meaning and Morphotactics [1971] and A Phonology of Tarascan [1973] were among the most detailed as well as earliest modern linguistic of the Pur\u00e9pecha language. In 2005, his former students honored him with a festschrift titled Language, Culture and the Individual: A Tribute to Paul Friedrich. In 2007 Yale University awarded Friedrich with the Wilbur Cross Medal.
