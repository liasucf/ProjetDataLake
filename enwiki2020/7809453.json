    "text": "9\u201310th & Locust is a PATCO Lindenwold Line subway station in Philadelphia. The station is located in the Washington Square West neighborhood of Center City, Philadelphia, near Wills Eye Hospital and Walnut Street Theatre. Because there is no concourse connection with any other subway station, this station closes every night from 12:07-5 am due to crime concerns, thus making it the only station on the line that is not open 24 hours a day. ==Station layout== {|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=50|G |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Street level |style=\"border- top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=450|Entrances/exits, buses |- |M |Mezzanine |Fare control |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" valign=top rowspan=3|P Platform level |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Westbound |style=\"border- top:solid 1px gray;\"|\u2190 (except late nights) toward () |- |style=\"border- bottom:solid 2px black;border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2| |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Eastbound |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"| (except late nights) toward () \u2192 |} ==External links== *9th-10th & Locust (PATCO) * Locust Street and 10th Street entrance from Google Maps Street View * Locust Street and 9th Street entrance from Google Maps Street View Category:PATCO Speedline stations in Pennsylvania Category:Railway stations in Philadelphia Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1952 Category:Railway stations located underground in Pennsylvania ",
