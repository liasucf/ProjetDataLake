The mine was active from 1984 until its closure in 2007; when it was put into care and maintenance; and again from late 2008 to June 2013 when the owners, APEX Minerals, went into receivership. After commissioning from its recent upgrade the mine should have resumed full operations before the end of 2008; however, delays in the comissoning had forced the owner, APEX Minerals, to raise more money and postpone this date.APEX Minerals website AXM announcement from 27 January 2009.

Retrieved 9 March 2009 but in June 2013 APEX had to declare insolvency and the mine was placed in care and maintenance again. In January 2014 it was announced that the mine would be sold to Blackham Resources, with the deal to be finalised before the 7 March 2014. The mine is located on the native title of the Ngaanyatjarra aboriginal people.NATIONAL NATIVE TITLE TRIBUNAL 16 January 2007. Retrieved 26 September 2009 == Overview == Mining in the Wiluna-Leinster area. The mine consists of several open pits, the largest being East Pit which was mined until July 2007 and again in late 2008 and early 2009, and three underground operations. Two of those, Happy Jack and East Lode, are older workings, the third, Bulletin decline was also mined until July 2007 and has since reopened. Bulletin and its extensions, Calais and Woodley decline were the sites of an underground drilling program during the mines closure in 2007 and 2008. There was then approx. 15 km of underground workings at the mine. Most of the open pits are flooded with salt water. Only one of them, the small Caledonia Pit, contains fresh water. It is home to long neck turtles and yabbies (a fresh water crustacean). The current owner, Apex Minerals, upgraded and reopened the mine in November 2008. It originally also planned to transport ore to the Wiluna plant from its other mine sites, the Gidgee Gold Mine (approx. 150 km south) and the Youanmi Gold Mine (approx. 300 km south). After having postponed this plan in 2009, APEX reconsidered this option in September 2009, when its Wiluna-focused strategy failed.Apex hits up investors for $100m more to fix Wiluna, The West Australian \u2013 Business section, page: 52, published: 23 September 2009. Retrieved 23 September 2009 Williamson pit, an open pit in the dry salt lake of Lake Way, was also mined by Agincourt until early 2007 but is now abandoned. The mining lease was still with Oxiana Limited after the sale of Wiluna, Oxiana having had plans to mine rich uranium deposits there through Toro Energy Limited in the foreseeable future. There are other mining companies that were carrying out exploration in the Wiluna area too, notably for nickel and iron ore. There is also an older mine site approximately 25 km south of Wiluna, along the road to Leinster, called Wiluna South or Matilda Mine. It was operated for about 10 years until 1989 by Chevron. Apart from a couple of old pits and tailings dams there is little remaining of the old site. One of the few historical buildings from the earlier days of mining is the old Mine Managers Lodge, currently a private residence. There also is some old equipment on display at the visitors' car park, notably an old crusher and an old mill. The Wiluna area was extensively mined from the discovery of gold there in 1896 until the end of World War II when mining ceased. Just before entering Wiluna from the south, a wooden building on the right-hand side is the old railway station's shed. In front of it, the railway dam can still be seen but the tracks which once went all the way to Leinster have been removed. The mine is connected to Perth through flights out of Wiluna Airport and serviced by Maroomba Airlines. ==Mine history== ===Discovery=== In 1896, gold was discovered in the region, which was then known as Lake Way, by three prospectors, George Woodley, James Wotton and Jimmy Lennon.Wiluna \u2013 Edge of the desert, author: Phil Heydon, publisher: Hesperian Press, published: 1996, page: IV. Retrieved 23 March 2003 On 29 December 1897, a 460-ounce nugget was found in Wiluna, then the largest found in the colony of Australia. The location it was found at was later to become the spot for the power house of the Wiluna Gold Mine Limited, the operators of the early mine.Wiluna \u2013 Edge of the desert, author: Phil Heydon, publisher: Hesperian Press, published: 1996, page: 15. Retrieved 23 March 2003 The town prospered from the development of the mine until the First World War. In 1920 however, a decline set in because the refractory ore could not be treated. As a consequence, the town's population shrank to less than 150 people. ===Second phase=== In 1924, Claude de Bernales floated a company that would undertake a drilling program and the Wiluna mine was revived. De Bernales went to London in 1926 and raised \u00a31 million to work Wiluna mines. A later issue of promissory notes for \u00a3300,000 was backed by the State government. When the mine reopened in 1931 it attracted a substantial workforce and stimulated community growth and within four years produced gold worth \u00a33 million.John H Laurence, \u2018de Bernales Claudew Albo (1876-1963)\u2019, Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/de-bernales-claude-albo-5935 /text10117, published first in hardcopy 1981, accessed online 21 June 2018.

With the outbreak of the Second World War, Wiluna started to decline once more as the men had to join the Services. The mine lasted for some more years until 1947, when all machinery was sold off and Wiluna went into a form of hibernation.Wiluna \u2013 Edge of the desert, author: Phil Heydon, publisher: Hesperian Press, published: 1996, page: V. Retrieved 23 March 2003 ===Third phase=== The third reincarnation of Wiluna mines, after 1896 and 1924, started in the early 1980s. Unlike the previous two before, the town did not profit from it as much. Fly-in fly-out rosters meant, there was no significant population growth. From 1987 to 1994, oxide ore was mined from open pit operations; from 1994 onwards, underground operations commenced.GOI's ann: Acquisition of Wiluna Gold Mine ASX announcement, published: 20 October 2003.
