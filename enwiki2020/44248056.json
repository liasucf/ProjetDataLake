    "text": "Christian Timothy Walton (born 9 November 1995) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for club Brighton & Hove Albion. He has represented England at under-19, under-20 and under-21 levels. ==Club career== ===Plymouth Argyle=== Born in Wadebridge, Cornwall, Walton began his career with Plymouth Argyle aged 10 and progressed through the club's youth system. He was named in a matchday squad for the first time three days after his 16th birthday for an FA Cup first round tie against Stourbridge, in which he remained an unused substitute, the match finishing 3\u20133. ===Brighton & Hove Albion and loan spells=== On 15 February 2013, Walton signed for Championship club Brighton & Hove Albion, where he completed his scholarship, before signing a three-year professional contract in the summer of 2013. He was twice an unused substitute in consecutive matches in the 2013\u201314 season, a 3\u20131 win at home to Leicester City on 7 December, prior to a 1\u20130 win away to Middlesbrough one week later. Ahead of the 2014\u201315 season, Walton signed a new four-year contract with the club on 8 July 2014. He was an unused substitute on the opening day of the season in a 1\u20130 defeat at home to Sheffield Wednesday. Walton made his professional debut for Brighton aged 18 in a 2\u20130 defeat away to Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup fourth round on 29 October 2014. He made his Football League debut six days later in a 1\u20130 win at home to Wigan Athletic. Walton made his second consecutive start in a 1\u20131 draw at home to Blackburn Rovers on 8 November. He returned to the starting lineup on the final day of the season in a 0\u20130 draw away to Middlesbrough, his first appearance since November. In addition to his four appearances for Brighton, Walton also kept two clean sheets. ====Bury (loan)==== On 21 July 2015, Walton signed for newly promoted League One club Bury on a season-long loan. He made his debut for Bury in a 1\u20131 draw at home to Doncaster Rovers on the opening day of the 2015\u201316 season. Walton returned to Brighton on 1 September due to an underlying groin injury, having made six appearances for Bury. ====Plymouth Argyle (loan)==== On 19 November 2015, Walton joined former club Plymouth Argyle on loan until 3 January 2016 as cover for the injured Luke McCormick. He made his Plymouth debut in a 2\u20131 defeat at home to arch-rivals Exeter City two days later. Walton started in three further matches, and returned to Brighton upon the expiration of his loan spell. ====Luton Town (loan)==== On 24 June 2016, Walton signed for League Two club Luton Town on a season-long loan, linking back up with Nathan Jones who was first-team coach for his first three years at Brighton. He made his Luton debut on the opening day of the 2016\u201317 season in a 3\u20130 win away to Plymouth Argyle. Walton saved a penalty from Vadaine Oliver during a 0\u20130 draw away to Notts County on 29 October to keep a clean sheet for Luton, which extended the club's unbeaten league run to seven matches and earned him a place in the English Football League Team of the Week. He was recalled by Brighton on 31 January 2017 following an injury to fellow goalkeeper Niki M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4, having made 33 appearances for Luton and conceded the fewest goals in League Two during his loan spell. ====Southend United (loan)==== On 1 April 2017, Walton signed for League One club Southend United on an emergency loan for an initial seven days as cover for Ted Smith who had sustained a wrist injury. He debuted later that day in a 3\u20130 victory at home to Oldham Athletic. It was agreed for Walton's loan to be extended by a further week as the club were still without a fit goalkeeper. The goalkeeping situation remained unchanged and therefore the loan was extended by a further week once more. Walton's loan was extended again to enable him to play in Southend's final match of 2016\u201317, and completed the loan spell with seven appearances. ====Wigan Athletic (loan)==== On 12 July 2017, Walton signed for League One club Wigan Athletic on a season-long loan. He made his debut for Wigan on the opening day of 2017\u201318 in a 1\u20130 victory away to Milton Keynes Dons. Walton finished the loan with 35 appearances, as Wigan won the League One title and promotion to the Championship. He re-signed for Wigan on 22 June 2018 on another season-long loan until June 2019, with a recall option in January. Walton played in Wigan's first game back in the Championship on 4 August 2018 in a 3\u20132 home victory over Sheffield Wednesday. Parent club Brighton didn't take up the option to recall Walton in January. On 22 April 2019 Walton kepted a clean sheet in a 2\u20130 home win over local rivals, Preston which secured The Latic's Championship status. ====Blackburn Rovers (loan)==== Walton joined another Championship club, Blackburn Rovers, on 23 July 2019 on loan for the 2019\u201320 season. Walton played in the opening game of the season making his debut in a 2\u20131 home loss to Charlton. Walton played in all 46 league matches of the season where The Riversiders finished 11th in the table. ==International career== Walton was called up to the England under-19 team for a friendly against Turkey on 5 March 2014. He entered the match as a 76th- minute substitute for Mitchell Beeney, the match finishing a 3\u20130 win. Walton received his first call-up to the England under-20 team for a friendly against Romania, in which he won his first cap. He was first called up to the England under-21 team on 25 August 2015 for their matches against the United States under-23 team and Norway under-21 team. However, he was forced to withdraw from the squad six days later after sustaining a groin injury playing for Bury in a 1\u20131 draw with Oldham Athletic. Walton received his next under-21 call-up on 3 October 2016 for two 2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification matches against Kazakhstan and Bosnia and Herzegovina. He won his first cap and kept a clean sheet in England's 5\u20130 win over Bosnia and Herzegovina on 11 October. ==Career statistics== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|FA Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=8|Brighton & Hove Albion |2013\u201314 |Championship |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2014\u201315 |Championship |3||0||0||0||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||4||0 |- |2015\u201316 |Championship |0||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |2016\u201317 |Championship |0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||0||0 |- |2017\u201318 |Premier League |0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||0||0 |- |2018\u201319 |Premier League |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||0||0 |- |2019\u201320 |Premier League |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||0||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !3!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!4!!0 |- |Bury (loan) |2015\u201316 |League One |4||0||colspan=2|\u2014||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||6||0 |- |Plymouth Argyle (loan) |2015\u201316 |League Two |4||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||4||0 |- |Luton Town (loan) |2016\u201317 |League Two |27||0||3||0||2||0||1||0||33||0 |- |Southend United (loan) |2016\u201317 |League One |7||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||7||0 |- |rowspan=3|Wigan Athletic (loan) |2017\u201318 |League One |31||0||4||0||0||0||0||0||35||0 |- |2018\u201319 |Championship |34||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||34||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !65!!0!!4!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!69!!0 |- |Blackburn Rovers (loan) |2019\u201320 |Championship |46||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||46||0 |- !colspan=3|Career total !156!!0!!7!!0!!5!!0!!1!!0!!169!!0 |} ==Honours== Wigan Athletic *EFL League One: 2017\u201318 ==References== ==External links== *Christian Walton profile at the Football Association website * Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:People from Wadebridge Category:Footballers from Cornwall Category:English footballers Category:England youth international footballers Category:England under-21 international footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. players Category:Bury F.C. players Category:Plymouth Argyle F.C. players Category:Luton Town F.C. players Category:Southend United F.C. players Category:Wigan Athletic F.C. players Category:Blackburn Rovers F.C. players Category:English Football League players ",
