Dundurn, 2009 ===Studio albums=== Beethoven: Concerto No. 2 in B flat Major for Piano and Orchestra, Op. 19 - Bach: Concerto No. 1 in D Minor for Piano and Orchestra is the third album of the Canadian classical pianist Glenn Gould. It contained a 1957 recording of Ludwig van Beethoven's second Piano Concerto and Johann Sebastian Bach's Keyboard Concerto BWV 1052, with Leonard Bernstein conducting the Columbia Symphony Orchestra. The recordings were made in 1957 at Columbia Records 30th Street studio in Manhattan over four days between April 9 and April 11 and April 30. Columbia Masterworks Records, the company's classical music division, released the album in October 1957. The album was produced by Howard H. Scott.
