He became close to the members of the Cobra movement. He devotes various articles to painters like Guillaume Corneille or Asger Jorn, before drafting a more comprehensive study of the logograms by Christian Dotremont in 1975. He also worked with Pierre Alechinsky who helped him to publish one of his last texts, L'\u00c9preuve. His philosophy takes root in phenomenology, from which he tries to rehabilitate the body. He starts from a genetic approach in which he tries to rethink the origin of the phenomenon as the genesis of the apparition. In Cri (Shout), he inaugurates a radical style from which he describes the effect of rupture, tearing and the void that emerges from the shout. This uncovering of the experience of language invites us to redefine the emergence of the apparition and show how the view resumes its bearings and reconstitutes a world. Starting from a critique of the Platonic vision, which fundamentally denies the body, since it is idealized as a vision of ideas, this path leads Loreau to rethink a new beginning of the body, vision and language. Max Loreau also published various poems under the titles Cerceaux s'orcellent, Chants de la perp\u00e9tuelle venue and Florence port\u00e9e aux nues. == Publications == *1966: (essay). *1967: . *1967: (poems). *1971: (tirage limit\u00e9). *1973: (essay). *1973: (essay). *1975: *1976: (short stories). *1977: (poems). *1980: (essay). *1980: (essay) *1986: (poems). *1987: (essay) *1989: (essay) *1990: (poems).
