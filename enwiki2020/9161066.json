He was on the Trojan staff at the 1988 Rose Bowl. ===Cincinnati=== Hiestand came to the University of Cincinnati in 1989 after a year at Toledo. He served as run game coordinator with the Bearcats in 1992 and offensive coordinator in 1993. As offensive coordinator, running back David Small broke Cincinnati's record for rushing touchdowns while the offense posted the 7th most points in school history.

During his tenure, Hiestand has produced 10 All-Big Ten selections on the offensive line. In 2002, Illinois marched out one of the nation's most balanced offensive attacks thanks in large part to Hiestand's offensive front. Illinois topped 5,300 yards in total offense for the first time in school history and running back Antoineo Harris topped the Illinois single season rushing yardage list with 1,330 yards. Seniors Tony Pashos and David Diehl each earned All-Big Ten accolades, and were fifth-round picks in the 2003 NFL Draft. In 2001, Hiestand tutored a pair of linemen to first team All-Big Ten accolades. Both Jay Kulaga and Pashos were named to the Big Ten's first team by the coaches and media, while senior center Luke Butkus was a second-team selection. Illinois topped the 5,000-yard total offense mark for the first time in school history. In 2000, Marques Sullivan and Ray Redziniak earned second-team All-Big Ten honors for the second straight year and Sullivan was named to the Football Writers Association All-America third-team. That season the line allowed only 20 sacks, the 17th lowest in the nation. In 1999, Hiestand's line led Illinois to the highest scoring offense in school history with 388 points scored in 12 games. The UI offensive line cleared paths for Illini running backs to rush for 2,082 yards and provided quarterback Kurt Kittner the room to throw for 2,702 yards and 24 touchdown passes. Sullivan and Redziniak earned second-team All-Big Ten honors. During his tenure at Illinois, Hiestand tutored 12 all-Big Ten selections on the offensive line. Every senior starting offensive lineman in Hiestand's first seven years with the Illini was signed to an NFL contract: Ryan Schau (1995\u201398), J. P. Machado (1995\u201398), Marques Sullivan (1997\u20132000), Ray Redziniak (1997\u20132000), Luke Butkus (1998\u20132001), Dave Diehl (1999\u20132002), and Tony Pashos (1999\u20132002). ===Chicago Bears=== Hiestand was hired on January 11, 2005 as Chicago\u2019s offensive line coach. The Bears were one of six teams to have the same five offensive linemen start all 16 games in 2008 (C Olin Kreutz, LG Josh Beekman, RG Roberto Garza, LT John St. Clair and RT John Tait), marking the first time since 2001 that Chicago had the same five players start all 16 contests along the line. The offensive line would become the most experienced unit on the Bears roster over the next couple of years, led by 11-year veteran and six- time Pro Bowl C Kreutz, who entered the 2009 season having started a team-high 102 consecutive games. In 2008, Chicago\u2019s offense attempted 557 pass plays and absorbed 29 sacks. In 2006, the Bears attempted 539 pass plays and allowed just 25 sacks, the lowest total given up by the team since allowing 17 in 2001, as Chicago went on to win the 2006 NFC Championship leading to the organization\u2019s first Super Bowl appearance in 21 years. ===Tennessee and Notre Dame=== After spending two years coaching the offensive line at the University of Tennessee from 2010\u20132012, Hiestand was hired to the same post at the University of Notre Dame under head coach Brian Kelly. Since reaching the BCS National Championship Game during his first season at Notre Dame, Hiestand has developed a number of current NFL offensive linemen with the Fighting Irish, including: * Zack Martin, Dallas Cowboys offensive guard * Chris Watt, Former New Orleans Saints offensive guard * Ronnie Stanley, Baltimore Ravens offensive tackle * Nick Martin, Houston Texans offensive guard * Quenton Nelson, Indianapolis Colts offensive guard * Mike McGlinchey, San Francisco 49ers offensive tackle ===Second stint with Bears=== On January 10, 2018, Hiestand returned to the Bears after being hired by new head coach Matt Nagy as the offensive line coach. Under Hiestand, the 2018 Bears allowed 33 sacks, tied for the eighth-fewest in the NFL. Center Cody Whitehair and left tackle Charles Leno Jr. were named to their first Pro Bowl to become the first Bears offensive linemen teammates to make the all-star game since 2006. In 2019, however, Chicago's offensive line allowed 43 sacks (12th most in the league) and helped the offense record just 91.1 rushing yards per game (sixth worst). Hiestand was fired on December 31. ==References== Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:People from Malvern, Pennsylvania Category:Players of American football from Pennsylvania Category:Chicago Bears coaches Category:Cincinnati Bearcats football coaches Category:Toledo Rockets football coaches Category:USC Trojans football coaches Category:University of Missouri faculty Category:American people of Swiss descent Category:Wyoming Seminary alumni ",
