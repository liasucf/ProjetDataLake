The Ivan Vazov National Library in Plovdiv has a collection of his monumental works. His work is also to be found in the National Art Gallery, the Art Gallery in Bourgas and in Veliko Turnovo and in Hilversum in the Netherlands. In Sofia, there are mosaics by Leviev in the National History Museum, in the National Palace of Culture and in the headquarters of the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and in Plovdiv, at the Drama Theatre and the Public Library.
