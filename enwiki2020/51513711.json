    "text": "Torynobelodon was a genus of large herbivorous mammal related to the elephant (order Proboscidea). It lived during the late Miocene Epoch in Asia and North America. ==Taxonomy== Shoshani (1996) placed Torynobelodon as a synonym of Platybelodon, but Lambert and Shoshani (1998) considered it morphologically distinct to be a separate genus.J.
