    "text": "Capsicum baccatum is a member of the genus Capsicum, and is one of the five domesticated pepper species. The fruit tends to be very pungent, and registers 30,000 to 50,000 on the Scoville Heat Unit scale. Pepper varieties in the C. baccatum species have white or cream colored flowers, and typically have a green or gold corolla. The flowers are either insect or self-pollinated. The fruit pods of the baccatum species have been cultivated into a wide variety of shapes and sizes, unlike other capsicum species, which tend to have a characteristic shape. The pods typically hang down, unlike a Capsicum frutescens plant, and can have a citrus or fruity flavor. The C. baccatum species, particularly the Aj\u00ed amarillo chili, has its origins in ancient Peru and across the Andean region of South America. It is typically associated with Peruvian cuisine, and is considered part of its condiment trinity together with red onion and cilantro. Aj\u00ed amarillo literally means yellow chili; however, the yellow color appears when cooked, as the mature pods are bright orange. Yellow aj\u00ed is one of the ingredients of Peruvian cuisine and Bolivian cuisine. It is used as a condiment, especially in many dishes and sauces. In Peru the chilis are mostly used fresh, and in Bolivia dried and ground. Common dishes with aj\u00ed \"amarillo\" are the Peruvian stew Aj\u00ed de gallina (\"Hen Chili\"), Papa a la Huanca\u00edna and the Bolivian Fricas\u00e9 Pace\u00f1o, among others. In Ecuadorian cuisine, Aj\u00ed amarillo, onion, and lemon juice (amongst others) are served in a separate bowl with many meals as an optional additive. In Colombian cuisine, Peruvian Cuisine, and Ecuadorian cuisine, aj\u00ed (sauce) is also a common condiment. Cultivated baccatum (C. baccatum var. pendulum) is the domesticated pepper of choice of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile. The Moche culture often represented fruits and vegetables in their art, including Aj\u00ed amarillo peppers.Berrin, Katherine & Larco Museum.

South American farmers also grow C. baccatum as ornamental plants for export. File:Capsicum bacatuum flower.jpg|Flower File:C baccatum lemon drop fruit.jpg|Cultivar 'Lemon Drop' == Etymology == Some form of the word aj\u00ed has been used since approximately 4600 BCE. It was first used in the protolanguage Otomanguean. It then spread along with the Capsicum fruit from Central and South America to other pepper growing regions. Capsicum baccatum is still referred to as aj\u00ed, while other peppers are referred to as pepper via the Spanish conquistadors noting of the similarity in heat sensation to Piper sp. Its Latin binomial is made up of Capsicum from the Greek kapos, and baccatum meaning berry-like.Aj\u00ed amarillo ==Cultivars== This species of chili pepper includes the following cultivars: *Aj\u00ed amarillo, also called amarillo chili and aj\u00ed escabeche *Bishop's crown *Lemon drop, aj\u00ed lim\u00f3n (not to be confused with aj\u00ed limo, a Capsicum chinense cultivar) *Piquant\u00e9 Pepper Larco Museum Collection. ==See also== *List of Capsicum cultivars ==References== ==External links== *Eshbaugh, W.
