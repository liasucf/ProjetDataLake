    "text": "The Fort of Casa was the most easterly of the forts and redoubts built in 1809-10 during the Peninsular War on the second line of the three defensive Lines of Torres Vedras aimed at protecting the capital of Portugal, Lisbon. It is situated in the parish of Forte da Casa, in the municipality of Vila Franca de Xira, in the Lisbon District. ==History== Following the Treaty of Fontainebleau signed between France and Spain in October 1807, which provided for the invasion and subsequent division of Portuguese territory into three kingdoms, French troops under the command of General Junot entered Portugal, which requested support from the British. In July 1808 troops commanded by the Duke of Wellington, at the time known as Arthur Wellesley, landed in Portugal and defeated French troops at the Battles of Roli\u00e7a and Vimeiro. This forced Junot to negotiate the Convention of Cintra, which led to the evacuation of the French army from Portugal. In March 1809, Marshal Soult led a new French expedition that advanced south to the city of Porto before being repulsed by Portuguese-British troops and forced to withdraw. The threat of a further invasion by the French led Wellington, on October 20, 1809, to order the secret construction of defensive lines in order to protect Lisbon from Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte's troops led by Marechal Mass\u00e9na. A total of 152 military installations were constructed and they were each given a number. The Fort of Casa was Number 38 and it was originally named \u201cDa Caza\u201d by the Portuguese Major Brand\u00e3o de Sousa. It had a star-shaped layout and, like most other forts of the Lines, it was built with a dry moat and equipped with an magazine. In 1810 it was garrisoned by around 340 soldiers, with five cannon. At an altitude of just 41 metres and close to the River Tagus it was given the task, together with the higher forts of Portela Grande and Portela Pequena, of potentially impeding the progress of the French army along two main roads. However, Mass\u00e9na\u2019s troops were repulsed by the first line of defence at Sobral de Monte Agra\u00e7o and the Fort of Casa never saw action. ==The present day== The fort was excavated in 2008 and 2010 and the ruins are now incorporated into a small urban park. The site also contains a Lines of Torres Vedras \u201cInterpretation Centre\u201d, one of several in the region. The Centre informs visitors about the construction of the two northerly lines of Torres Vedras, the relation of the fort with other military works, and on the impact of the French invasion and construction of the forts on the people of the area. ==See also== *List of forts of the Lines of Torres Vedras ==References== * Casa Category:Lines of Torres Vedras ==External links== * Friends of the Lines of Torres Vedras ",
