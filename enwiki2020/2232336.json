The park contains two active volcanoes (Tungurahua and Sangay), one extinct volcano El Altar (Kapak Urku), and ecosystems ranging from tropical rainforests to glaciers. The park has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983. In 1992, it was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to illegal poaching, extensive grazing, unplanned road construction and encroachment of the park's perimeter.
