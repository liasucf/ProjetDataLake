    "text": "Alex Nain Saab Mor\u00e1n (; born 21 December 1971) is a Colombian-born businessman of Lebanese descent mentioned in the Panama Papers, who has also been mentioned in journalistic investigations for conducting businesses with an estimated amount of US$135 million with the Venezuelan government, unlike other Colombian businessmen who had to stop exporting to Venezuela, due to uncertainty regarding the payments and currency controls. Saab's name also appears in the FinCEN Files.https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/2020/09/20/nota/7984663/fincen- files-alex-saab-testaferro-nicolas-maduro-antigua-barbuda?device=mobile As of October 2018, he is being investigated by Colombian authorities for alleged money laundering, due to his relationship with the Venezuelan government between 2004 and 2011. During the course of these investigations, his fiscal and accounting reviewer have been arrested and charged by the prosecutors office. During a fuel stop at Cape Verde, Alex Saab was arrested while on his way from Iran to Venezuela on a business jet on 12 June 2020. Saab was arrested in accordance to an Interpol red notice in relation to his indictment in United States, accused of money laundering. == Career == Alex Saab is the son of a Lebanese immigrant who settled in the city of Barranquilla and opened various businesses, finding success in Colombia\u2019s textile industry. Saab began his career in Barranquilla, selling business promotion keychains and subsequently work uniforms; eventually Saab was mixing between a group of recognized Colombian businessmen and ended up exporting merchandise to Venezuela, using the CADIVI currency system, in which he had free capital mobility. According to a Univisi\u00f3n source, during this time Saab accumulated millionaire debts after the suspension of foreign exchange payments by the Venezuelan government, which in turn alleged that some businessmen in the country had cheated the Cadivi system for a millionaire sum. Saab was not accused of such fraud. Univisi\u00f3n has also mentioned that his journalist Gerardo Reyes was sued by the businessman following these publications. Saab was also enriched due to the materials supplier business of the Housing Mission in Venezuela. On 28 November 2011, the Colombian-Venezuelan agreement of the Global Construction Fund was signed, whose legal representative was Saab, which resulted in a contract of US$685 million for the construction of prefabricated homes in Venezuela, while the organization was being investigated by the Ecuadorian government for alleged money laundering through false exports to Venezuela. The event was attended by presidents Juan Manuel Santos and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, as was the then Foreign Minister Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Saab's lawyer, Abelardo De La Espriella, assured La W Radio at the time that the headquarters of the Global Construction Fund in Ecuador had no connection with the Colombian businessman. == Investigations == Saab has sold food to Venezuela for more than US$200 million in a negotiation signed by President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro through a registered company in Hong Kong, China. On 23 August 2017, the Venezuelan attorney general, Luisa Ortega D\u00edaz, named Alex Saab as the owner of the Mexican firm Group Grand Limited, 26 along with Colombian businessmen \u00c1lvaro Pulido and Rofolfo Reyes, \"presumably President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\" and dedicated to selling food to the CLAP. Saab would have met \u00c1lvaro Pulido in 2012, when he was dedicated to supplying the Saab company, but this activity would have stopped doing it in 2014. === Censorship === On 11 September 2018, the National Commission of Telecommunications (CONATEL) of Venezuela banned the publication of information about Alex Saab to the journalists of the Armando.info web portal, who have published research papers in which they point to Saab as an alleged member of acts of corruption that would exist around the business and distribution of food for the CLAP. In the document that is addressed to the journalist Roberto Deniz and signed by the general director of CONATEL, Vianey Miguel Rojas \"prohibits citizens Roberto Denis Mach\u00edn, Joseph Poliszuk, Ewal Carlos Sharfenderg and Alfredo Jos\u00e9 Meza publish and disseminate through the digital media specifically on the site Armando.info, mentions that go against the honor and reputation of the citizen Alex Na\u00edm Saab (...) until the end of the present process in the case that is being pursued against the aforementioned citizens\". The ban was denounced by the Venezuelan National Press Workers' Union (SNTP). Since the publication of reports on Alex Saab, the Armando.info site has suffered massive cyber attacks, warning that the ban on mentioning the Entrepreneur in successive research works \"increases the threat\". Roberto Deniz rejected the measure, recalling that after the publications the journalistic team had previously been threatened via Twitter, they were banned from leaving the country by the 11th Court in Caracas and now they were forbidden to continue Saab's investigation. Denouncing that according to \"the logic of the judge that takes Alex Saab\u2019s lawsuit against journalists from Armando.info, Alex Saab\u2019s \u201chonor\u201d and \u201creputation\u201d are above the possibility that Venezuelans know the business behind of CLAP.\" The four journalists were sued by Saab for continuous aggravated defamation and slander aggravated in Caracas. === Conflict with the Criminal Investigation Department of Colombia === On 23 September 2018, one of Saab's lawyers filed a complaint with the prosecution for attempted extortion of \u201cpart of an alleged public official, who is providing confidential information about investigative proceedings against the Saab family using WhatsApp and Telegram messages, in exchange for some economic or labor purpose.\u201d On 12 October, Eddie Andr\u00e9s Pinto, a patrolman of the DIJIN who served as an interception analyst, accepted the extortion charges that were imputed to him. According to the complaint in the audios and WhatsApp captures provided therein, Pinto requested COP500 million in exchange for erasing all the information that existed on behalf of Saab, also stating that there was nothing that compromised the businessman or his family, but that they were going to be captured as a measure of pressure. === Criminal charges === On 8 May 2019, the Colombian prosecutors office charged Saab with crimes of money laundering, a concert to commit crimes, illicit enrichment, exports and fictitious imports and an aggravated fraud for events related to his Shatex company. Since September 2018, he is considered a fugitive in Colombia for failing to attend any judicial proceeding even with a firm arrest warrant. On 25 July 2019, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida charged Saab and another Colombian businessman with money laundering related to a 2011-15 scheme to pay bribes to take advantage of Venezuela's government- set exchange rate. == Arrest == During a fuel stop at Cape Verde, Alex Saab was arrested while on his way from Iran to Venezuela on a business jet on 12 June 2020. Saab was arrested in accordance to an Interpol red notice in relation to his indictment in the United States, accused of money laundering. On 22 July 2020, Baltasar Garz\u00f3n said that he would represent Alex Saab in the extradition case. On 25 August 2020, the Attorney General of Cape Verde opened an investigation into two men who posed as representatives of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in favor of Alex Saab. On 28 August 2020, Saab's lawyers stated that he was on a mission to Iran as a special envoy of Maduro to negotiate fuel and humanitarian supplies at the time of his arrest. == Sanctions == On 25 July 2019, the United States Department of Treasury imposed sanctions on 10 people and 13 companies (from Colombia, Hong Kong (China), Mexico, Panama, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the U.S.) in a Venezuelan food subsidy called \"CLAP\", which includes Nicolas Maduro stepsons and Saab himself. According to a statement by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, \"The corruption network that operates the CLAP program has allowed Maduro and his family members to steal from the Venezuelan people. They use food as a form of social control, to reward political supporters and punish opponents, all the while pocketing hundreds of millions of dollars through a number of fraudulent schemes.\" The Maduro government rejected the sanctions, calling it sign of \"desperation\" by \"the gringo empire.\" Maduro said \"Imperialists, prepare for more defeats, because the CLAP in Venezuela will continue, no one takes the CLAP away from the people.\" A communique from the Venezuelan foreign ministry \"denounces the repeated practice of economic terrorism by the US government against the Venezuelan people, announcing measures whose criminal purpose is to deprive all Venezuelans of their right to food.\" == See also == *Local Committees for Supply and Production *FinCEN Files *Armando.Info *Operaci\u00f3n Alacr\u00e1n == References == Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Colombian businesspeople Category:People of the Crisis in Venezuela Category:People named in the Panama Papers Category:Corruption in Venezuela Category:People from Barranquilla Category:Fugitives wanted by Colombia Category:Colombian criminals Category:Colombian people of Lebanese descent Category:Fugitives wanted by the United States Category:Naturalized citizens of Venezuela ",
