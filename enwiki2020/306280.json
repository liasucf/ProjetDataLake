Polk. Just prior to taking office in 1845, Polk sent Yell to Texas to advocate for its annexation to the union. He is reported to have single- handedly retrieved a criminal from a local saloon and physically brought him to his court. Yell was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1836, after Arkansas was admitted to the Union. He served one term, from December 5, 1836, to March 3, 1839.

Yell returned to Arkansas and formed the Mounted Regiment of Arkansas Infantry. Several of his men later achieved notability in Arkansas, including the future governor John Selden Roane, and future Confederate generals Albert Pike, Solon Borland, and James Fleming Fagan. His cavalry compiled a record of insubordination. General John E. Wool, commander of the Arkansas mounted volunteers, said they were, \"wholly without instruction, and Colonel Yell is determined to leave (them) in that condition.\" Yell, he continued had a \"total ignorance of his duties as Colonel.\" During the Mexican War, he was brevetted a Brigadier General of United States Volunteers. ==Death== On February 23, 1847, Yell was killed in action at the Battle of Buena Vista at age 49.
