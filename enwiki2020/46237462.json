    "text": "Conrad Janninck (\"Conrad Janningus\" in Latin) was one of the Bollandists who worked on the Acts of the Saints. Appointed to the task in 1679, he became one of the editors of the many volumes in the series. When his colleague, the Jesuit Daniel van Papenbroeck was under attack from the Spanish Inquisition and others opposed to the rigorous scholarly work of the Bollandists, Janninck spent several years in Rome on his behalf. Janninck also spent time in Austria and Hungary as well as Italy searching for relevant texts to aid in their efforts at recording the traditions regarding the early saints. Janninck died in 1723. ==References== Category:1723 deaths Category:Christian hagiographers Category:Jesuit historiography Category:17th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:18th-century Roman Catholic priests ",
