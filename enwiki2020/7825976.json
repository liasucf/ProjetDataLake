    "text": "\"Searchin'\" is a song written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller specifically for the Coasters. Atco Records released it as a single in March 1957, which topped the R&B; Chart for twelve weeks. It also reached number three on the Billboard singles chart. Although the Coasters had previously done well on the R&B; charts, it was \"Searchin'\" (along with \"Young Blood\" on the flip side) that sparked the group's rock and roll fame. ==Composition== The lyrics, written by Leiber, use vernacular phrasing. The plot revolves around the singer's determination to find his love wherever she may be, even if he must resort to detective work. The song's notable gimmick was in citing specific law-enforcement figures from popular culture, such as Sherlock Holmes, Charlie Chan, Joe Friday, Sam Spade, Boston Blackie, Bulldog Drummond, and the North- West Mounted Police (the Mounties). The vocals of the Coasters' lead singer Billy Guy are raw and insistent. Driving the song is a pounding piano rhythm of two bass notes alternating on every second beat. The theme of the song is searching for love: \"Well, I'm searching, Yeah I'm gonna find her\". The refrain is simple variations of this phrase, \"Gonna find her, yeah ah, gonna find her\". The song was recorded in Los Angeles on February 15, 1957; the backing band included Mike Stoller (piano and arrangement), Barney Kessell (guitar), Ralph Harrison (bass), and Jesse Sailes (drums).Peter Grendysa and Robert Pruter, Atlantic Rhythm and Blues 1947-1974 booklet notes (CD edition), Atlantic Records, 1991 ==Other versions== Johnny Rivers released a version of the song as a medley with \"So Fine\" which reached number 113 on the U.S. pop chart in 1973. Singer/songwriter Paul McCartney chose \"Searchin'\" as one of his Desert Island Discs in 1982. McCartney performed the song with the Beatles during their audition for Decca Records on January 1, 1962 (with somewhat mangled lyrics that included a mention of Peter Gunn). ==References== Category:Songs written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller Category:1957 singles Category:The Coasters songs Category:The Beatles songs Category:The Hollies songs Category:The Spencer Davis Group songs Category:Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip- Hop Songs number-one singles Category:Atco Records singles ",
