Its name comes from the central summit of the massif, the Pic des Trois-\u00c9v\u00each\u00e9s (so named because it marked the boundary between the dioceses of Digne, Embrun and Senez) where there are ridges to the north, west and south. The highest peak is the T\u00eate de l'Estrop, at . ==Geography== The massif in the broadest sense extends from north to south between the Bes to the west, the Ubaye in the north, the Verdon to the east and the Asse (approximately) to the south. It is also crossed by the Bl\u00e9one and the Vallon du Laverq. It is surrounded to the north by the Massif du Parpaillon, east by the Massif du Pelat, south-east by the Pr\u00e9alpes de Castellane and finally to the south and to the west by the Pr\u00e9alpes de Digne (which some southern peaks, or even the whole massif, are sometimes attached, although significantly higher altitudes, and different orientation). ===Main summits=== *T\u00eate de l'Estrop, , the highest point of the massif *Grande S\u00e9olane, *Petite S\u00e9olane, *Trois-\u00c9v\u00each\u00e9s, *T\u00eate de Chabri\u00e8re, *Roche Close, *Sommet du Caduc, *Mourre-Gros, *Montagne de la Blanche, : Bernardez, Neill\u00e8re, l'Aiguillette *Les M\u00e9es, *T\u00eate de la Sestri\u00e8re, *T\u00eate Noire, *Sangraure, *Dormillouse, *Sommet du Tromas, *Autapie, *Sommet de Denjuan, *Gros Tapy, *Grand Croix, *Montagne du Cheval Blanc, The Montagne de Cord\u0153il, of a more modest size and elevation [], is completely isolated from the rest of the massif, the Verdon to the east and the Issole to the north and west. ==Geology== The massif of the Trois-\u00c9v\u00each\u00e9s consists of sedimentary rock, mostly sandstones and marls, typical of the pre-Alps. The geological nature of the north of the massif relates to the Ubaye Valley. ==Plane crash== On 24 March 2015, Andreas Lubitz, co-pilot of Germanwings Flight 9525, who was reported to have had mental health problems, deliberately crashed the plane into the massif, after he locked the Captain out of the cockpit. ==Activities== ===Winter sports=== *Val d'Allos *Pra-Loup *Saint- Jean-Montclar ===Canyoning=== The massif contains, amongst others, two canyoning descents of high and exceptional level: Male Vasudevan and Bussing. ==See also== *Haute Bl\u00e9one Valley *Geography of the Western Alps ==Bibliography== * * ==References== ==External links== * Category:Mountains of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence Category:Mountain ranges of the Alps ",
