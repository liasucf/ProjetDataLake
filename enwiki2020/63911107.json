    "text": "John Glanville Phillips (8 November 1910 \u2013 26 June 1985) was a South African cricketer who played 16 matches of first-class cricket for Border and Transvaal between 1931 and 1938. John Phillips was an opening batsman and left-arm wrist-spinner. His best batting performance was 100 and 36 for Border against Orange Free State in 1933\u201334. In the 1934\u201335 season he took 15 wickets in two matches in East London in just over a week: 7 for 51 and 2 for 87 in a victory over Orange Free State, then 5 for 123 and 1 for 44 in a close loss to Natal. These performances led the cricket writer Louis Duffus to name him as a player \"who is sure to be heard of in subsequent seasons\".Louis Duffus, \"The South Africans\", The Cricketer, Spring Annual 1935, pp. 11\u201314. However, Phillips played only two more first-class matches. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1910 births Category:1985 deaths Category:South African cricketers Category:Border cricketers Category:Gauteng cricketers Category:Sportspeople from East London, Eastern Cape ",
