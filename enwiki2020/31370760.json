    "text": "The Palacette of Belomonte () is a former-residence on Rua de Belomonte, in the civil parish of Cedofeita, Santo Ildefonso, S\u00e9, Miragaia, S\u00e3o Nicolau e Vit\u00f3ria, in the northern Portuguese city of Porto. ==History== Up until the 18th century, the building functioned as the Col\u00e9gio de S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o (College of S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o), and the Banco Alian\u00e7a. The current building was constructed in the 18th century. By the middle of the 19th century, it was one of the principal meeting places associated with the Portuense high society. Following the death of Jo\u00e3o Pacheco Pereira (then owner) the building was obtained by collateral line of the family, but with time, fell into decline. In 1888, the residence was bought by the Companhia de Ferro Atrav\u00e9s de \u00c1frica (Iron Company Through Africa), and the family coat-of-arms was removed, to be replaced by a royal coat-of-arms. ==Architecture== The main accessway to the former- residence The building is flanked by a three- and two-storey building, located with a long narrow area between the Rua de Belomonte and Rua do Com\u00e9rcio do Porto., near the Palace of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Novo. The long symmetrical, rectangular Baroque manorhouse is marked by a two-storey frontispiece and Mansard roof, with undulating cornices and sculpted granite stone. The long building consists of a simple volume covered in Mansard and roof tile, with its principal facade oriented towards the roadway. This facade is oriented towards the north, consisting of a symmetric and subdivided form in five parts, divided by six pilasters. On the extremes of the building are accented doorways, surmounted by coat-of-arms and oculi, broken by granite cornices that run the length of the building. The ground floor consists of rounded window door, repeated above by windows topped with undulating forms. Over the Mansard roof are six pinnacles in masonry aligned by pilasters. The rear facade is circled by a long, wide varanda between the two corps, while the front facade includes several varandas with ironwork over plinths in granite and surmounted by pinnacles. The interior space includes a rectangular entranceway with slabs and granite staircase with balustrades. Over the staircase is an elliptic candelabra, surrounded by stucco walls decorated in carved flourishes. The ceiling of the entranceway in wood leads to rooms that plastered and decorated with paintings. ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== * * * Category:Palaces in Porto ",
