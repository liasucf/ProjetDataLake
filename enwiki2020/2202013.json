    "text": "Avian coronavirus (IBV) is a coronavirus that infects birds, causing the associated disease avian infectious bronchitis (IB). It is a highly infectious avian pathogen that affects the respiratory tract, gut, kidney and reproductive systems of chickens. IBV affects the performance of both meat- producing and egg-producing chickens and is responsible for substantial economic loss within the poultry industry. ==Classification== IBV is in the genus Gammacoronavirus, or group 3, with a non-segmented, positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. It is the type species of its Genus Igacovirus, today. And, when there was only one genus in the Coronaviruses, the genus Coronavirus, it was the type species of the group of all known coronaviruses. ==Recombination== When two strains of coronavirus IBV infect a host they may recombine during genome replication.Kottier SA, Cavanagh D, Britton P. Experimental evidence of recombination in coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus. Virology. 1995 Nov 10;213(2):569-80. doi: 10.1006/viro.1995.0029. PMID: 7491781; PMCID: PMC7131336 Recombination appears to contribute to the genetic variation of the IBV genome found in nature.Wang L, Junker D, Collisson EW. Evidence of natural recombination within the S1 gene of infectious bronchitis virus. Virology. 1993 Feb;192(2):710-6. doi: 10.1006/viro.1993.1093. PMID: 8380672Jia W, Karaca K, Parrish CR, Naqi SA. A novel variant of avian infectious bronchitis virus resulting from recombination among three different strains. Arch Virol. 1995;140(2):259-71. doi: 10.1007/BF01309861. PMID: 7710354; PMCID: PMC7086685 == Pathology == === Respiratory system === When inhaled, virus will attach to glycoprotein receptors containing sialic acid on ciliated epithelial cells of the respiratory epithelium. The respiratory replication will result in loss of ciliary activity, mucus accumulation, necrosis and desquamation, causing respiratory distress, r\u00e2les and asphyxia. Local virus replication will result in viremia, spreading the infection into other tissues and organs. Other respiratory diseases of chickens (Mycoplasma gallisepticum, avian infectious laryngotracheitis (Gallid alphaherpesvirus 1), Newcastle disease (avian paramyxovirus 1), Avian metapneumovirus infection may be confused clinically to infectious bronchitis. ===Kidney === Through viremia, some nephrotropic strains (most of high virulence) could infect the kidney epithelium in tubules and nephron, causing kidney failure. At gross examination, kidneys may appear swollen and pale in color and with urates in ureters === Reproductive system === In hens, the viremic IBV will also reach the oviduct, causing lesions in the magnum (the egg-white gland) and in the uterus (the egg-shell gland), leading to a sharp decline of egg production, shell-less, fragile or roughened shells eggs (uterus lesion) with watery whites (magnum lesion). Infection of chickens at puberty, during the oviduct development, will impede oviduct formation and destroy future laying capacity, resulting in \"false layers\". However, other diseases affecting layer chickens could lead to that condition. == Vaccines == There are both attenuated vaccines and inactivated vaccines available. Their effectiveness is diminished by poor cross-protection. The nature of the protective immune response to IBV is poorly understood, but the surface spike protein, the amino-terminal S1 half, is sufficient to induce good protective immunity. Experimental vector IB vaccines and genetically manipulated IBVs\u2014with heterologous spike protein genes\u2014have produced promising results, including in the context of in ovo vaccination. ==See also== *Infectious bronchitis virus D-RNA *Veterinary virology ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Poultry diseases Category:Animal virology Category:Gammacoronaviruses Category:Viral respiratory tract infections ",
