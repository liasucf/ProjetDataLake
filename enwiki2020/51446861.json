Finally, in 1786, he became a member of the Hofkapelle at the royal court in Copenhagen, which was then briefly under the direction of Johann Gottlieb Naumann. On account of his age and infirmity, he was relieved from his duties in 1798 and received an annual pension of 500 Reichsthaler until his death in 1809.Schilling Barth's two sons, Frederik Philip Carl August (1774-1804) and Christian Frederik (1787-1861), having been taught by their father, both became virtuoso performers on the oboe as well as composers. The youngest son became renowned as a touring soloist. ==Works== It seems that most of Barth's compositions have been lost.
