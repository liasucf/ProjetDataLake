    "text": ":This article describes the Pan-American Highway's routing in South America from north to south. For the North America portion of the route, see Pan- American Highway (North America). The project of a Pan-American highway began in or before 1923. The main idea was to create a network of wide roads that would connect the major points of interest in North and South America with a single highway. The longest segment connects the Brazilian city of Macap\u00e1 in Amap\u00e1 State to Cayenne in French Guiana, Paramaribo by the East-West Link Highway in Suriname, Georgetown in Guyana, and Boa Vista city in Roraima Brazilian State. Boa Vista is connected with all the cities in Venezuela such as Ciudad Guayana, its easternmost city. The highway supports trade among these countries. It is crossed by three large rivers, but an international system of ferries helps cross these natural obstacles. ==Venezuela== The highway begins its path through South America in Colombia. However, a branch called the Simon Bolivar Highway runs through Venezuela. This stretch of the highway is an important link between Caracas and Bogot\u00e1. ===G\u00fciria=== The road begins as Venezuela Highway 9 in G\u00fciria, a small town in the state of Sucre just west of Trinidad along the Gulf of Paria coastline. From G\u00fciria, the highway winds west towards the town of Yaguaraparo. ===Yaguaraparo=== Once the highway reaches Yaguaraparo, on the southern portion of the Paria Peninsula along the Gulf of Paria, Highway 9 continues west for approximately to the towns of Casanay and Panto\u00f1o. ===Casanay=== Upon reaching Casanay, the highway crosses Venezuela Highway 10, a major north\u2013south highway. From Casanay and neighboring Panto\u00f1o, it continues west, paralleling the Gulf of Cariaco. The highway crosses Secondary Highway 2 at Villa Frontado, which travels south into the state of Monagas. The distance from Casanay to Cuman\u00e1 is about . ===Cuman\u00e1=== Cuman\u00e1, founded in 1521, is the oldest city in South America. Cuman\u00e1 is located on the banks of the Manzanares River and the Gulf of Cariaco. Tourist attractions in Cuman\u00e1 include the Castillo de San Antonio de la Eminencia (Castle of Saint Anthony of the Eminence), the Museo del Mar (Maritime Museum), and the Cueva del Gu\u00e1charo (Gu\u00e1charo Cave). From Cuman\u00e1, the road travels southwest approximately 65 km to the border with the state of Anzo\u00e1tegui. ===Barcelona=== After crossing into Anzo\u00e1tegui, it almost immediately enters the city of Barcelona. Barcelona was founded in 1671 and is a traditional Venezuelan city. Local attractions include Barcelona Cathedral and Casa Fuerte, a national historic monument that celebrates Venezuelan independence. Nearby Puerto La Cruz is one of the most popular tourist areas in Venezuela and has some of the nation's best Caribbean beaches. Tourists can take a ferry from Puerto La Cruz to Margarita Island. ===Boca de Uchire=== Travelling from Barcelona and Puerto La Cruz, the highway continues westward. For about 47 km, it becomes a limited-access expressway, returning to a two- lane highway at Puerto P\u00edritu. The highway travels another 62 km reaches the border with the state of Miranda at the town of Boca de Uchire. This portion includes a short run through the llanos, or Venezuelan savannas. ===El Guapo=== About 34 km west of Boca de Uchire, the highway starts climbing up the Cordillera Central, in the Andes mountains. Highway 9 begins here to move further away from the Caribbean Sea coastline. From Boca de Uchire to El Guapo the distance is 65 km; from El Guapo to Caucagua adds 59 km. ===Caucagua=== At Caucagua, the Pan-American Highway crosses Venezuela Highway 12. Highway 9 continues through the Cordillera Central. After about 21 km, the highway becomes a limited-access expressway for 32 km west towards the Caracas metropolitan area and the Venezuelan Federal District. ===Caracas=== With a population of around four million, Caracas is the largest city and capital of Venezuela. Although located near the Caribbean Sea, Caracas is on a plateau at an approximate height of , so its weather can vary greatly. The city lies under Cerro El \u00c1vila, a mountain approximately high. Attractions include the Teresa Carre\u00f1o Theater, the National Art Gallery, and Avila National Park. The Pan-American Highway switches from Highway 9 in Caracas to turn south on Venezuela Highway 1, where it re-enters Miranda. It remains an expressway as it heads towards Carabobo for its remaining 48 km in Miranda. ===Maracay=== Maracay is the capital and most important city of Aragua state in central Venezuela. It was officially established on March 5, 1701, by Bishop Diego de Ba\u00f1os y Sotomayor in the valleys of Tocopio and Tapatapa (what is known today as the central valley of Aragua) in northern Venezuela. In Spanish, Maracay is known as \"Ciudad Jard\u00edn\", or \"Garden City\". Maracay was the name of a Cacique (Indian chief) of the indigenous people who lived in the area before the Spanish arrived. Apparently, the word means \"tiger\" in an ancient Caribbean language. Maracay is the cradle of Venezuelan aviation, and home to the two country's largest Air Force bases and other military facilities. From Maracay the highway extends about 44 km to Valencia, passing San Joaquin and near Cuacara en route to the city. ===Valencia=== Valencia is the capital city of Carabobo state. The city is an economic hub that contains Venezuela's top industries and manufacturing companies. Its population is about 1.4 million. Valencia is known for its racial and international diversity. The city is located in a valley, some over the sea and surrounded by a mountain range called the Coastal Range (Cordillera de la Costa). On its eastern outskirts lies Lake Valencia, Venezuela's second largest lake. Tourist sights include Casa P\u00e1ez, Casa de los Celis, the Museum of History and Anthropology and Iturriza Palace. In Valencia, the highway shifts northwest and passes through mountains that are part of the Sistema Coriano. The distance between Valencia and the small town of El Palito on the Caribbean Sea is approximately 40 km. At El Palito, the road joins with Venezuela Highway 3 for 10 km, then splits off at Mor\u00f3n. The distance from Mor\u00f3n to the state border with Yaracuy state and the village of Guaremal is about 20 km. ===San Felipe=== From Guaremal to San Felipe, the major city in Yaracuy, is about 26 km. The city itself is located on a route adjacent to Highway 1. The road runs 73 km from San Felipe to the state border with Lara (located just past the town of Cambural). ===Barquisimeto=== The distance from the border to Barquisimeto is about 16 km. Barquisimeto, the capital of Lara state, is a successful industrial and commercial centre. It has one of the largest markets in Latin America - Mercabar - where about 80% of the food produced in Venezuela is distributed throughout the country, and various shopping malls like Las Trinitarias, Ciudad Par\u00eds and Babylon. Among its many landmarks is an obelisk (El Obelisco) which commemorates Barquisimeto's 400th anniversary; and the oddly-shaped cathedral, rare in Latin America, that sits below a cross-like tinted glass dome. From Barquisimeto, Highway 1 continues roughly west, then southwest (at around Agua Salada) for 147 km to the state line with Trujillo, near El Empedrado. ===Trujillo (state)=== Once in the state of Trujillo (near the town of Paraj\u00e1), the Pan-American Highway continues in a southwest direction; it does not travel through the state capital city of Trujillo but connects to Trujillo by way of state highways 3 and 1. The highway's length in this state is about 111 km. ===M\u00e9rida (state)=== The highway enters M\u00e9rida state near Arapuey. As in Trujillo, the highway does not travel through the major population centers, of which the largest is M\u00e9rida. Highway 1 connects to M\u00e9rida via an 88 km stretch of M\u00e9rida state highway 4. About 5 km southwest of Caja Seca is a 13 km cutoff road to Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela's largest lake and one of the largest on the continent. The highway covers 104 km in M\u00e9rida. ===San Crist\u00f3bal=== Upon entering the state of T\u00e1chira, the high extends about 58 km from the border to the junction with Venezuela Highway 6. From the junction to the city of San Crist\u00f3bal the distance is 44 km, although there is a separate expressway that parallels the Pan-American Highway along this stretch. From San Crist\u00f3bal to the Venezuela-Colombia border, near San Antonio de T\u00e1chira, the distance is 32 km. ==Colombia== From Yaviza, Panama southeast lies the virtually impenetrable Dari\u00e9n Gap, a stretch of some of the world's most rugged, mountainous jungle terrain. It is advised that travelers do not enter the Dari\u00e9n Gap as it is considered dangerous; it is a haven for bandits, smugglers, and Colombian paramilitary forces. The Colombian town nearest to the Dari\u00e9n Gap is Turbo, located in Antioquia province. The highway linking Turbo to Medell\u00edn is Colombia Route 62 and is approximately 278 km in length. Travelers along the Inter-American Highway portion of the Pan-American Highway in Panama can take a ferry from Panama City to the port of Buenaventura, which is 115 km northwest of Cali. Cali represents a major junction between Buenaventura and two northern spurs of the Pan-American Highway that connect from northern Colombia and Venezuela. ===C\u00facuta=== The main route of the Pan- American Highway in Colombia (starting from the northeast) begins just east of C\u00facuta, the capital city of the department of Norte de Santander. The highway follows Colombia Route 55 for 63 km from C\u00facuta to Pamplona, where it shifts to Colombia Route 66 for 45 km to reach the border with the department of Santander. ===Bucaramanga=== From the department border, Route 66 continues southwest for 50 km toward Bucaramanga, state capital of Santander located on a plateau in the Cordillera Oriental. From Bucaramanga, the Pan-American Highway switches from Route 66 to Colombia Route 45A, which it follows south by southwest to the town of Barbosa. This 203-km stretch on Route 45A is a toll road. Approximately 26 km of this stretch of highway enters the department of Boyac\u00e1 and reenters Santander between Vado Real and Guepsa. From Barbosa, the Pan-American Highways switches from Route 45A to Colombia Route 62 and immediately reenters Boyac\u00e1 towards Tunja, the state capital of Boyac\u00e1. ===Tunja=== A 53-km stretch of highway connects Barbosa with Tunja, an important agriculture and mining center in the region. The Pan-American Highway switches routes again in Tunja, returning to Colombia Route 55 on its way to Cundinamarca and the national capital, Bogot\u00e1. The stretch of highway from Tunja to the departmental border with Cundinamarca is 54 km and is a toll road. ===Bogot\u00e1=== From the Cundinamarca departmental line, the highway continues another 26 km without tolls before becoming a toll road again. From that point, the highway reaches Bogot\u00e1 in 52 km. Bogot\u00e1 is the capital and largest city of Colombia, with a population of roughly 7.8 million (about 8.5 million in the metropolitan area). Bogot\u00e1 is above sea level on the Cordillera Oriental of the Northern Andean Mountains. Bogot\u00e1 is Colombia's largest economic center and is a center of art, culture, and learning. In Bogot\u00e1, the highway crosses from the north to the southwest portion of the city, switching from Route 55 to Colombia Route 40. Continuing as a toll road from Bogot\u00e1, it travels for 128 km through Fusagasug\u00e1 to the departmental border with Tolima. ===Ibagu\u00e9=== From the Tolima departmental border, the highway continues as a toll road for another 16 km to El Espinal. It travels west and after another 37 km, reaches the city of Ibagu\u00e9. Ibagu\u00e9 is the capital of Tolima department and has an estimated population of 422,549. The city is situated above sea level on the eastern slopes of the Andean Cordillera Central between the Chipalo and Combeima rivers, tributaries of the Coello River. From Ibagu\u00e9 to the Quind\u00edo departmental border near La Linea is about 77 km. ===Armenia=== Upon crossing into Quind\u00edo, Colombia Route 40 continues westward for another 4 km before reaching Calarc\u00e1, where Route 40 splits into two spurs. One enters Armenia. The spurs rejoin about 18 km southwest of Calarc\u00e1 at the town of Club Campestre. The city of Armenia has about 300,000 people and an economy based on coffee and bananas. Armenia has several universities, including the University of Gran Colombia and the University of Quind\u00edo. From Club Campestre, it covers another 16 km until reaching the Valle del Cauca departmental border. ===Cali=== From the border, the Pan-American Highway travels 26 km to the town of La Paila, where it crosses Colombia Route 25. At this junction, the two routes merge and become a toll road for 61 km from that point to Buga. At Buga, Route 40 splits west toward the city of Buenaventura and the Pacific Ocean; the Pan-American Highway continues south on Route 25 for another 42 km until arriving near Palmira. From Palmira, the highway continues southwest for 23 km, where it reaches the large city of Cali. Santiago de Cali, the city's complete name, is the capital of the Valle del Cauca department. It is Colombia's second largest city, with an estimated population of 2.3 million and a metropolitan area population of 4.3 million. Popular museums include the Museo Arqueol\u00f3gico La Merced (La Merced Archeological Museum) and the Museo del Oro del Banco de la Rep\u00fablica (Bank of the Republic Gold Museum), containing archaeological exhibits of pre-Columbian cultures. From Cali to the Cauca departmental border is 19 km. ===Popay\u00e1n=== The highway continues south along Route 25 throughout its length in the department of Cauca. After 50 km, the highway becomes a toll road at Santander de Qulichao until reaching Santander de Qulichao and Popay\u00e1n after 74 km. Popay\u00e1n is the capital of the department of Cauca, with a population of about 215,000. Located at , the city is known for its colonial architecture and its contributions to Colombian cultural and political life. More presidents have come from Popay\u00e1n than any other city and it birthed noted poets, painters and composers. Nearby is Purac\u00e9 National Park, a geothermal hotspot with hot springs, waterfalls, and an inactive volcano from which the park derives its name. It continues generally southwest from Popay\u00e1n; reaching Mojarras after 135 km. At Mojarras, Route 25 splits into two spurs; the western spur is preferred for traveling south toward the Nari\u00f1o departmental border. From Mojarras to the departmental border near Remolino is 36 km. ===Pasto=== From the Nari\u00f1o departmental border, the highway continues south as Route 25. From the border to the city of Pasto is 84 km. Pasto is the capital of the department of Nari\u00f1o, located in southwest Colombia. The city is located in the \"Valle de Atriz\", on the Andes cordillera, at the foot of the Galeras volcano, above sea level. The city has a population of 450,000. Pasto is the center of an agricultural region that specializes in dairy products. Furniture manufacturing is an important part of the local economy. From Pasto to the national border between Colombia and Ecuador near Ipiales is 82 km. The Pan American crosses the border at the Rumichaca Bridge. ==Ecuador== Ecuador Highway 35, the \"Troncal de la Sierra\" (Highland's Road), is commonly known to Ecuadorians as \"La Panamericana\" and forms Ecuador's contribution to the project. It connects cities and towns from the Sierra region, from Tulc\u00e1n at the north (border with Colombia), passing through Quito, the country's capital, to the southern border with Peru. Part of this highway is a toll-road administered by Panavial, a private concessionary. The road condition is quite good, but it mostly goes through mountains and it has some bad trails around the province of Ca\u00f1ar (center of the country), making it a fairly dangerous road to drive on. ===Tulc\u00e1n=== The Ecuadorian portion begins at the Colombian border in Carchi province and almost immediately enters the city of Tulc\u00e1n, the capital of Carchi province. The population of Tulc\u00e1n is approximately 53,000. Tulc\u00e1n is known for its hot springs and a topiary garden cemetery created by Jos\u00e9 Franco. From Tulc\u00e1n, the road continues south for 125 km, reaching Ibarra. ===Ibarra=== Ibarra (population 80,477) is the capital of Imbabura province. It lies at the foot of Imbabura volcano and on the left bank of the Tahuando river. It is about northeast of Ecuador's capital Quito. Ibarra is a market town popular with tourists.
