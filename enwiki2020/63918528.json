    "text": "The Mitre is a mountain summit located in the western Chugach Mountains, in Anchorage Municipality in the U.S. state of Alaska. The mountain is situated in Chugach State Park, east of Anchorage, northeast of Peril Peak, and south- southeast of Eklutna Lake. The nearest higher peak is Benign Peak, to the west-northwest, on the opposite side of the Eklutna Glacier. Although modest in elevation, relief is significant since the western aspect of the mountain rises 4,000 feet above this glacier in approximately half a mile. In Europe, \"mitre\" is the term used for a sharp, symmetrical rocky peak such as this one. The Mitre's descriptive name was submitted for consideration by the Mountaineering Club of Alaska as suggested by Dr. Rodman Wilson (1921\u20132003) of Anchorage after he returned from a European vacation.Donald J. Orth, Dictionary of Alaska Place Names, 1967, page 649. The Mitre name was officially adopted in 1966 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. In the Dena\u02bcina language, this mountain is known as Idlu Bena Dghelaya, meaning Mountain of Plural Objects Lake.James Kari and James A. Fall, Shem Pete's Alaska, 2nd Ed. 2003. Page 324. . ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, The Mitre is located in a subarctic climate zone with long, cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Weather systems coming off the Gulf of Alaska are forced upwards by the Chugach Mountains (orographic lift), causing heavy precipitation in the form of rainfall and snowfall. Temperatures can drop below \u221220 \u00b0C with wind chill factors below \u221230 \u00b0C. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Cook Inlet via the Eklutna River. ==See also== *List of mountain peaks of Alaska *Geology of Alaska ==References== ==Gallery== File:The Mitre north.jpg File:Eklutna Glacier, valley glacier, August 25, 1964 (GLACIERS 5004).jpg|The Mitre in lower left File:Eklutna Lake The Mitre.jpg|The Mitre and Benign Peak (right) from north ==External links== * The Mitre: Weather Forecast * Climbing The Mitre: YouTube Category:Mountains of Alaska Category:Mountains of Anchorage, Alaska ",
