Taki\u2019s Imperial Japanese Army page ==History and development== The Type 97 was developed from the earlier Type 91 Grenade which could also be used as a fragmentation hand grenade, but was predominately used as munitions for the Type 10, and Type 89 grenade launchers. For this reason, it had less explosive power and a relatively longer delay time than a dedicated manual hand grenade. To address these issues, the Army Technical Bureau developed a new design in 1937. ==Design== The Type 97 had the same principles as most of fragmentation grenades of the period: a grooved 'pineapple-shaped' segmented body which dispersed sharp pieces of shrapnel when it exploded. Operation was accomplished by first screwing down the firing pin, so that it protruded from the base of the striker. Then the safety pin was removed by pulling the cord to which it was attached; the protective cap which covered the striker was removed. A sharp blow against a hard surface, such as a rock or combat helmet would overcome a creep spring and crush a thin brass cap, allowing the pin to hit the primer and initiate the delay sequence before throwing at the target. Japanese World War II Ordnance However, in comparison with Allied hand grenades of the period, the explosive force of the Type 97 was weaker and, due to lack of an automatic ignition mechanism, the grenade in practice was found to be unreliable and even dangerous to use because of its inaccurate fuse.Rottman, Japanese Infantryman 1937-1945 Physically, the Type 97 was almost indistinguishable from the Type 91, except that it had no attachment on the base for a propellant canister. Paper labels with ink-stamped fill dates warned of the shorter 4-5 second delay. Details of internal construction ==Combat record== The Type 97 hand grenade was issued as standard equipment to Japanese infantrymen in the Second Sino-Japanese War and throughout the various campaigns of World War II.Rottman, Japanese Infantryman 1937-1945 ==See also== *Mills Fragmentation Hand Grenade (Mills Bomb) *Mk. 2 Fragmentation Hand Grenade ==References== ===Bibliography=== * * * ==External links== *Image of a Type 97 grenade *Details of internal construction *Taki\u2019s Imperial Japanese Army page *US Technical Manual E 30-480 9 37 Category:Fragmentation grenades Category:Hand grenades of Japan ",
