    "text": "L-13 Light Industrial Workshop is a contemporary art space that opened in May 2009 in Clerkenwell, London. Operated by Steve Lowe, it is a revised incarnation of his previous galleries and small presses, \u2018the aquarium\u2019 and The Aquarium L-13, and works with a small group of artists known for their unorthodox stances, in developing, exhibiting and publishing their work. ==Name== right \"L-13\" is the name of the zeppelin that left a trail of bombs across Clerkenwell in 1915. One of which destroyed the building at L-13\u2019s previous site on Farringdon Road ==Description== L-13 claims it \"seeks to reinvigorate and subvert pre-conceived ways in which art is considered and produced, blurring the distinctions between art production and exhibition\". The gallery is an underground space off Theobalds Road with artists using the workshop in the rear to produce work for regular shows at the venue. As such, it incorporates the nature of the production of the artists' work into the exhibition itself, and creates an anti-establishment atmosphere for its patrons and visitors. It was described as \"Part swish contemporary gallery, part subversive socio-political vision, part artists' studio and part members' club\" by the Urban Junkies website.Urban Junkies review The gallery's founder artists include Jamie Reid, Billy Childish, Jimmy Cauty, Sexton Ming as A. S. Waghorne, Geraldine Swayne and Harry Adams. ==Exhibitions and projects== *Red Rag to a Bull *National Art Hate Week 2009 *Not Banksy *With or Without God \u2013 Ecstatic Wonderment and Physical Experience in Painting *I am the Good Artist (Billy Childish and Neal Jones) *INFILTRATIONS \u2013 Auto Responsive Culture Jamming, Insurgency and Reality Adjustments in Contemporary Art Practice. *Harry Adams \u2013 A Short History of Our Progress *Bombs, Buggery and Buddhism by Billy Childish 2010 *Guest - Andrew Litten (Guest Artist) 2012 *Pigeons in a Topiary Cut Bush - Pete Bennett 2012 ==Notes and references== ==See also== *Billy Childish *The Aquarium L-13 *Jimmy Cauty *The KLF *Jamie Reid ==External links== *L-13 Light Industrial Workshop *James Cauty Design Solutions *James Cauty *Jamie Reid *Billy Childish *The Art of Distraction Category:Art museums and galleries in London Category:Art galleries established in 2009 Category:2009 establishments in England Category:Tourist attractions in the London Borough of Islington ",
