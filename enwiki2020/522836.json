    "text": "Elisabeth F\u00e9lix, better known only as Mademoiselle Rachel (21 February 1821 \u2013 3 January 1858), was a French actress. She became a prominent figure in French society, and was the mistress of, among others, Napoleon III, Napol\u00e9on Joseph Charles Paul Bonaparte and Alexandre Colonna-Walewski, the illegitimate son of Napoleon I. Efforts by newspapers to publish pictures of her on her deathbed led to the introduction of privacy rights into French law. ==Biography== Rachel F\u00e9lix was born as Elisabeth F\u00e9lix on 28 February 1821, in Mumpf, Rheinfelden, Aargau, to a family of Jewish background. Her father, Jacob F\u00e9lix, was a peddler and her mother, Esther Hayer, was a Bohemian dealer in second-hand clothes. She had four sisters (Sarah, Rebecca, Dinah, and Leah) and one brother, Raphael. As a child, F\u00e9lix earned money singing and reciting in the streets. She arrived in Paris in 1830 intending to become an actress. She took elocution and singing lessons, eventually studying under the instruction of the musician Alexandre-\u00c9tienne Choron and Saint-Aulaire. She took dramatic arts classes and debuted in La Vend\u00e9enne in January 1837, at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Gymnase. Delestre-Poirson, the director, gave her the stage name Rachel, which she chose to retain in her private life as well. Rachel was described as a very serious and committed student. She was admired for her intelligence, work ethic, diction, and ability to act. Auditioning in March 1838, she starred in Pierre Corneille's Horace at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais at the age of 17. During this time she began a liaison with Louis V\u00e9ron, the former director of the Paris Opera, which became the subject of much gossip.Agate, James, Rachel. Gerald Howe, London; Viking Press, NY; 1928. During this time, from 1838\u201342, she lived in a third-floor apartment in Paris's Galerie V\u00e9ro- Dodat. Her fame spread throughout Europe after success in London in 1841, and she was often associated with the works of Racine, Voltaire, and Corneille. She toured Brussels, Berlin, and St. Petersburg. Although French classical tragedy was no longer popular at the time Rachel entered the stage of Com\u00e9die- Fran\u00e7aise, she remained true to her classical roots, arousing audiences with a craving for the tragic style of writers like Corneille, Racine and Moli\u00e8re. She created the title role in Eug\u00e8ne Scribe's Adrienne Lecouvreur. Her acting style was characterized by clear diction and economy of gesture; she evoked a high demand for classical tragedy to remain on the stage. This represented a major change from the exaggerated style of those days, as society was beginning to demand the highly emotional, realistic, instinctual acting styles of the Romantics. F\u00e9lix completely rejected the Romantic Drama movement happening in nineteenth-century France. She was best known for her portrayal of the title role in Ph\u00e8dre. Portrait by Joseph Kriehuber ==Death== F\u00e9lix's health declined after a long tour of Russia. She died early in 1858, aged 36, from tuberculosis in Le Cannet, Alpes-Maritimes, France. ==Legacy== Upon her deathbed, she wrote many farewell letters to her sons, family members, lovers, colleagues and theatre connections at Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise. She is buried in a mausoleum in the Jewish part of P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery and :fr:Avenue Rachel in Paris was named after her.M-P. Hamache et C.

The English theatre critic James Agate published a biography of her in 1928, which echoes the anti-Semitism of his day. A modern account of her life and legacy by Rachel Brownstein was published in 1995.Brownstein, Rachel M., Tragic Muse: Rachel of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise. Duke University Press, Durham and London; 1995. The character \"Vashti\" in Charlotte Bront\u00eb's novel Villette was reportedly based on F\u00e9lix, whom Bront\u00eb had seen perform in London.http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405151191_chunk_g978140515119123_ss13 Rachel, a light tannish colour, primarily for face-powder used in artificial light, is named after her.http://www.cosmeticsandskin.com/aba/rachel.php The raschel knitting-machine is according to the OED also named after her.Oxford English Dictionary, OED2 on CD-ROM v 1.02.
