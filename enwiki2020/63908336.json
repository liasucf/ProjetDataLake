Throughout the war, the unit was mainly deployed in the Army Group South Rear Area behind the Eastern Front, which was a large, German-occupied area of the Soviet Union. == Operational history == === Division z.b.V. 403 === The Division z.b.V. 403, alternatively known as Landessch\u00fctzen-Division 403, was established on 25 October 1939 in Spandau, which was in the III Military District. It was to consist of ten Territorial Guard (Landessch\u00fctzen) battalions from the III Military District. August 1940 onwards, the division was part of the 6th Army, which was at the time in Brittany. It was renamed to 403rd Security Division in March 1942. === 403rd Security Division === The division was formed on 15 March 1941 near Neusalz in Silesia, in the VIII Military District, from the staff of Division z.b.V. 403 and elements of the 213th Infantry Division. During the whole war, the 403rd Security Division was used throughout the war mainly on the Eastern Front for security tasks in the rear army area, such as capturing scattered Soviet soldiers and commissars. Further anti-Semitic measures, such as confiscations, removal of functions, the formation of \"purely\" Jewish houses, followed. In 1941, the division fought in the Battle of Moscow and the Battle of Smolensk as part of the Heeresgruppenreserve. During this period, the division was used against the civilian population and burned down numerous villages. At the beginning of 1942, the fallback line of the division was broken by the Red Army near Toropets. In the summer of 1942, the division partook in actions against Jews in eastern Ukraine. At the beginning of 1943 the division was split into parts, with one part being assigned to the XXIVth Army Corps of the 2nd Panzer Army and the other to the XXXXth Army Corps assigned to the 4th Army. On 31 May 1943 in southern Russia, the division was dissolved. The division staff moved to Bergen in June 1943 and became the staff of the 265th Infantry Division. == Commanders == Commanding officers == Further reading == *Organizational History of 371st through 719th German Infantry, Security and Panzer Grenadier Divisions 1939\u20131945 (PDF; 394 kB), Nafziger Collection, Combined Armed Research Library. *Division z.b.V. 403 / 403.
