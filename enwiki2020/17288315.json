    "text": "The Committee of 100 in Finland (Sadankomitea in Finnish) was founded in 1963, based on the model of the Committee of 100 in Great Britain. The Committee of 100 has been one of foremost organizations of the peace movement in Finland, especially in the 1960s. Currently, the Committee of 100 publishes the magazine Ydin and the online magazine Pax, organises seminars, distributes pamphlets, and lobbies for peace and human rights. It has particularly criticised Finland's refusal to participate in international treaties banning cluster bombs. Active persons in the Committee of 100 have included the former Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja. ==See also== * Committee of 100 (United Kingdom) * Anti-war * Peace movement * Peace News * CND == References == == External links == * Committee of 100 in Finland Category:1963 establishments in Finland Category:Anti\u2013nuclear weapons movement Category:Political advocacy groups in Finland Category:Organizations established in 1963 ",
