    "text": "The World at Six is the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's flagship dinner- hour radio news program, airing Monday to Friday from 6 to 6:28 p.m. local time on CBC Radio One except in Newfoundland where it begins at 6:30. The program was launched on October 31, 1966. On Saturdays and Sundays, the show airs with the title The World This Weekend. In the Maritime provinces, The World This Weekend airs at 7 p.m. rather than 6, as the final hour of the live Cross Country Checkup occupies the 6 to 7 p.m. time slot. In Newfoundland, the program begins at 7:30 p.m. In the rest of Canada, however, The World This Weekend airs at 6 p.m. local time. Formerly simulcast on both CBC Radio One and CBC Radio 2, the program airs only on Radio One as of March 2007. It is produced by CBC Radio's National News department. ==History== The World at Six was the brainchild of its first senior editor, Angus McLellan. Its first anchors were CBC announcers, Bruce Rogers and John O'Leary. Initially the program began with satellite beeps and then presented a series of reports from correspondents across Canada and around the world. On statutory holidays, the program will devote about 10 minutes to current events, and then feature the remaining time to prepared radio documentary pieces on a particular theme. Prior to 1994, the program aired only on weekdays, with the weekend edition premiering that year.\"CBC revamps radio lineup: Weekend version of The World At Six among new programs slated for this fall\". The Globe and Mail, June 29, 1994. On October 31, 2016, the program celebrated its 50th anniversary. ==Anchors, reporters and editors== The program's weekday anchor is Susan Bonner, as of September 2, 2014.\"CBC News Announces New Host of CBC Radio One's World at Six\". Broadcaster, August 27, 2014. The weekend edition is currently anchored by Martina Fitzgerald. Other past anchors, reporters and editors associated with the program include Alison Smith, Joan Donaldson, Joan Gottselig, Eric Moncur, Jack Kusch, Laszlo Bastyovanszky, Dave Jensen, Phil Calder, Don Northup, Bill Hawes, Susan Helwig, Keeble MacFarlane, Maureen Brosnahan, Lorna Jackson, Barbara Smith, Russ Germain, Alannah Campbell, Bob Oxley, Bernie McNamee and Dave Seglins. ==References== ==External links== * The World at Six * The World This Weekend Category:CBC Radio One programs Category:CBC Music programs Category:CBC News Category:Canadian news radio programs Category:1966 establishments in Canada ",
