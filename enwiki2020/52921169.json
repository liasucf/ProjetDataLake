The initiative was founded in 2003 under the title Berlinale Talent Campus after the director of the Berlin International Film Festival Dieter Kosslick announced his plans to create a platform to support newcomers in film within the festival. The new title Berlinale Talents has been in place since October 2013. The platform is realised with the support of the Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media, Creative Europe - MEDIA programme of the European Union, Robert Bosch Stiftung and Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg and is coordinated by a project team under the supervision of Christine Tr\u00f6strum and Florian Weghorn. == Past Themes == * 2017: \u201eCourage: Against All Odds\u201c * 2016: \u201eThe Nature of Relations\u201c * 2015: \u201e2015: A Space Discovery\u201c * 2014: \u201eReady to Play? \u2013 Breaking the Rules\u201c * 2013: \u201eSome Like It Hot \u2013 Filmmakers as Entertainers\u201c * 2012: \u201eChanging Perspectives\u201c * 2011: \u201eFramespotting \u2013 Filmmakers Positioning Themselves\u201c * 2010: \u201eCinema Needs Talent: Looking for the Right People\u201c * 2009: \u201eSuddenly it all happened \u2013 The Turning Point in Close-up\u201c * 2008: \u201eScreening Emotions \u2013 Cinema's Finest Asset\u201c * 2007: \u201eHome Affairs \u2013 Privacy, Films and Politics\u201c * 2006: \u201eAt the Cutting Edge of Making Movies\u201c * 2005: \u201eDesigning Your Future\u201c * 2004: \u201eLet's Get Passionate About Film!\u201c * 2003: \u201eYou Always Remember the First Time\u201c == Participants == Each year up to 3000 filmmakers from approximately 130 countries apply to the programme. An international committee selects 250 talents, inviting them to Berlin. Berlinale Talents supports the participants, who are generally in the first ten years of their career, in positioning themselves in the filmmaking industry. With experts and renowned filmmakers they can then discuss innovations and trends in the business, develop their own projects in the project labs and present them to a diverse festival public. == The Programme == Consisting of a Summit, Project labs, Studios and a programme for film critics, i.e. Talent Press, the participants can choose from up to 100 individual events to attend, many of which are open to the public. === Summit === The Summit programme of Berlinale Talents offers a range of master classes and interactive panel discussions. Approximately 35 sessions focus on an annually changing topic featuring a variety of formats and set-ups: In the \u2018grand format\u2019 sessions at the main theatre (HAU1), experts of international reputation give insights into their work. During the mid-scale \u2018atelier\u2019 sessions in HAU2 and HAU3 experienced filmmakers and the audience are invited to enter into a dialogue. === Project Labs === * The Talent Project Market (for producers and directors) offers filmmakers the chance to present their projects at the Berlinale Co-Production Market and to get in contact with producers, financers, distributors and sales agents. Two prizes are awarded within this scheme - one worth 10.000 Euros and the other 6.000 Euros. * At the Script Station Talents work closely with renowned script consultants to fine-tune their scripts, deepen their stories and bring precision and life to their pages. With the support of their mentors, the participants have the opportunity to present their projects to the other attendants. * Doc Station enables Talents to advance their work on a particular documentary project and to make improvements with the instructions of professional mentors from the genre. * In the Short Film Station Talents move the development of their short film script forward and meet with potential partners to produce their film. === Studios === * The Camera Studio (formerly Post Production Studio) passes knowledge from experts in the fields of recording, colour correction, cutting and audio mastering to selected talents, following the newest developments digital technology, cinematography and postproduction. * The Editing Studio accepts applicants (editors and directors) with a rough cut of their film.
