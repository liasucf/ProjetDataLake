She is the first Tanzanian woman to earn a doctorate in mathematics. Beyond mathematics, she has also published on the education and participation of women in science. ==Education== Masanja was born in Bukoba, at the time part of the United Nations trust territory of Tanganyika. She was a student at the Jangwani Girls Secondary School in Dar es Salaam and then at the University of Dar es Salaam, completing a degree in mathematics and physics in 1976 and a master's degree in 1981. Her master's thesis was Effect of Injection on Developing Laminar Flow of Reiner\u2013Philippoff Fluids in a Circular Pipe. She earned a second master's degree in physics and completed a Ph.D. in mathematics at the Technical University of Berlin. Her dissertation, A Numerical Study of a Reiner\u2013Rivlin Fluid in an Axi-Symmetrical Circular Pipe, was jointly supervised by Wolfgang Muschik and Gerd Brunk. ==Career== Already, while a master's student, Masanja had become a lecturer at the University of Dar es Salaam, and on her return from Germany she became a professor there, and remained on the university's faculty until 2010. In 2006 she began teaching as well at the National University of Rwanda, and in 2007 became a professor there, as well as being appointed as the university's director of research, and as deputy vice chancellor and senior advisor at the University of Kibungo in Rwanda. In 2018 she returned to Tanzania as a professor of applied and computational mathematics at the Nelson Mandela African Institute of Science and Technology in Arusha. Masanja has served as vice president for Eastern Africa of the African Mathematical Union, chaired the African Mathematical Union Commission on Women in Mathematics in Africa and the Tanzania Education Network, and has served as National Coordinator for Female Education in Mathematics in Africa. Masanja is editor-in-chief of the Rwanda Journal. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Tanzanian mathematicians Category:Jangwani Girls Secondary School alumni Category:University of Dar es Salaam alumni Category:Technical University of Berlin alumni Category:University of Dar es Salaam faculty Category:National University of Rwanda faculty Category:Tanzanian expatriates in Rwanda Category:Tanzanian expatriates in Germany Category:20th-century mathematicians Category:20th-century women mathematicians Category:21st-century mathematicians Category:21st-century women mathematicians ",
