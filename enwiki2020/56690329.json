    "text": "John Justin and the Thunderwings were an Australian rock band formed by John Justin (guitar, vocals), Paul Hines (keyboards), Gordon Pitt (bass, vocals), Carl Manuel (drums) in 1985. In 1987, Tony Featherstone (bass) replaced Pitt and Robert Woodrow (drums) replaced Manuel. They released one full length album, Justice, in 1986. Debbie Cameron of The Canberra Times described the impact of the album, \"I am not wildly enthusiastic about this type of music so I do not want to be unduly unfriendly about it. All I will say is that Justin appears to be a competent exponent.\" Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt \"[it] was brimming with swaggering glam-pop material.\" Their debut single \"Flash King Cadillac\" (1986) was co-produced by Ross Fraser. Fraser was nominated for Producer of the Year at the ARIA Music Awards of 1987 for his work on this single and an album, Whispering Jack, by John Farnham. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |+ List of albums, with Australian chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\" | Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\" | Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | AUS |- ! scope=\"row\" | Justice | * Released: September 1986 * Format: LP, CD, Cassette * Label: Wheatley (WRLP 1017) | align=\"center\" | 64 |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |+ List of singles, with selected chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:23em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\" | Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"text- align:center;\" | AUS |- | 1984 ! scope=\"row\" |\"It's Magic\" (by John Justin) | style=\"text-align:center;\" |64 | |- |rowspan=\"2\"| 1986 ! scope=\"row\" |\"Flash King Cadillac\" (by John Justin and the Thunderwings) | style=\"text-align:center;\" |51 |rowspan=\"3\"| Justice |- ! scope=\"row\" |\"Justice\" (by John Justin and the Thunderwings) | style=\"text-align:center;\" |- |- |rowspan=\"2\"| 1987 ! scope=\"row\" |\"Little Miss Love\" (by John Justin and the Thunderwings) | style=\"text-align:center;\" |- |- ! scope=\"row\" |\"Rock On\" (by John Justin) | style=\"text-align:center;\" |50 | |} ==References== Category:Australian rock music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1985 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1987 Category:1985 establishments in Australia ",
