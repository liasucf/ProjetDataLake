On a visit to India, he is impressed with his friend's daughter, Ganga, in whom he sees all the qualities that he hopes to instill in his son. He decides to orchestrate their match - he first sends his foster son, Arjun, to \"prepare\" Ganga's family, and then sends his son Rajiv to India a week later. Despite initial setbacks owing to their cultural differences, Rajiv and Ganga approve of each other. They are engaged in the village and Ganga flies to the US with Rajiv to get accustomed to American life. Everything changes almost immediately for Ganga as soon as she lands in the US. She learns that the rest of Kishorilal's family is not so keen on the match, many openly expressing their disapproval of Ganga. She also realizes that Rajiv is not the same person in the US as the one who visited her house in India. Among other things, she discovers his excesses, temper, and secrets of his past affairs. Arjun is the only person she can confide in, though she partly blames him for her situation (having presented an idealized picture of Rajiv before her engagement). To stop any growing closeness between Arjun and Ganga, Kishorilal is urged by his family to relocate him. He also arranges for Rajiv and Ganga to take a trip together to Las Vegas. Things come to a head, however, when a drunk Rajiv insists Ganga have sex with him in their hotel in Vegas. She refuses (wanting to wait for marriage) to do so because she wants him to follow the Indian rules. Rajiv reveals his contempt for his fellow Indians and terms them \"hypocrites\" and \"stupid\" and also disrespects India, which prompts Ganga to slap him. She then cancels the engagement that she was supposed to have with Rajiv by discarding the ring and then demands Rajiv to get out. Furious, he tries to assault her. However, he is overpowered by Ganga, who successfully injures him and manages to escape, before being tracked down by Arjun. Rajiv informs Kishorilal that Ganga has gone missing, who quickly starts looking for the missing Ganga. However, Arjun eventually finds her, but he finds out that she is crying at a train station with her clothes torn. He tries to persuade her to go back to Kishorilal's home, but she refuses. Arjun promises to protect her and help her get back to her family safely in India. Meanwhile, unaware of the incident at the Vegas hotel, Kishorilal informs Suraj that Arjun eloped with Ganga and Suraj quickly picks up a family sword that hangs on the wall. He tries to kill Arjun for insulting Rajiv. He also tries to kill Ganga for trying to elope with Arjun. However, Arjun saves Ganga by seizing the sword and promises her father to leave and not to return ever again, but the former requests him not to kill Ganga. Ganga says that Arjun is innocent. However, Suraj doesn't trust Ganga and locks her in a horse shed and she is not allowed to explain further. Ganga's younger siblings and grandmother secretly make their way to the horse shed and advise her to elope with Arjun. Ganga realizes that she is in love with Arjun, and with their help, manages to leave home unobserved. By this time, Kishorilal has arrived in India with Rajiv. Ganga finds Arjun at a temple and wants Arjun to admit that he loves her, but Arjun refuses to marry Ganga because he is still loyal to Kishorilal. Ganga is devastated, but before Arjun walks away. Rajiv brings several goons to kill Arjun, but Ganga can protect Arjun. However, Arjun and Rajiv eventually clash after Rajiv slaps Ganga. And then Rajiv and his goons beat up Arjun. But they stop when they find Ganga and try to get her, which is when he beats Rajiv up. When he is about to kill Rajiv, his father calls him to come to him and he demands him to tell the truth about why he came to India with Rajiv's promised bride. He accuses Kishorilal of having become a true Westerner after all since his wealth has ruined his compassion and ability to examine the truth when it doesn't match what he wants it to be. He says that he truly loves Ganga and says that he never pursued her and has acted honourably, while Rajiv in every way rejected every honourable action and lied about how Ganga came to have returned so suddenly to India. Arjun claims that Ganga was unable to merge with Western culture and also Western values almost utterly ruined Ganga. He also goes, intending never to return. Ganga shows everyone the marks inflicted on her shoulder by Rajiv in Vegas, then tells her father she is willing to die by whatever means he chooses; poison, fire, or hunger. However, Once Kishorilal and Suraj know the truth, they let Arjun marry Ganga. Rajiv is upset about this and tells Kishorilal that he is his son, but Kishorilal slaps his son. Abandoning any hope of correcting him, he orders him to return to the US. Rajiv's friend also escorts him to the US. He then announces that Ganga will also return to the US, but this time as Arjun's bride. A credit montage shows Arjun and Ganga living a happy married life in the US. ==Cast== * Shah Rukh Khan as Arjun Sagar, Kishorilal's foster son who is also a talented singer. * Mahima Chaudhry as Kusum Ganga/Ganga Arjun Sagar, a.k.a.Ganga Rajiv's fiancee to be who falls in love with Arjun,Arjun's wife. * Amrish Puri as Kishorilal a wealthy businessman who lives in America. * Apurva Agnihotri as Rajiv, Kishorilal's son and Arjun's foster brother. * Alok Nath as Suraj Dev, Ganga's father * Padmavati Rao as Narmada, wife of Suraj Dev * Dina Pathak as Suraj's mother * Himani Shivpuri as Kulwanti * Madhuri Bhatia as Neeta, Rajiv's aunt who despises Ganga. * Smita Jaykar as Paddy * Pawan Malhotra as Sharafat Ali * Prachi Save as Daksha * Aditya Narayan as Potla (Ganga's little brother) * Ajay Nagrath as Daboo (Ganga's little brother) * Samta Sagar as Sonali * Subhash Ghai as Singer on the boat (special appearance) * Rakesh Thareja as Paul (Rajiv's friend) * Ruhshad Nariman Daruwalla (Potla's friend) ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack was composed by Nadeem-Shravan and the lyrics were penned by Anand Bakshi.

Praise was given to the music, however aspects of the script were criticised. India Today cites it as one of the first major Bollywood pictures to succeed in the United States. In their book, New Cosmopolitanisms: South Asians in the US, Gita Rajan and Shailja Sharma view the film as a dichotomous depiction of the good NRI versus bad NRI, with Khan depicting the good immigrant, who assists the rowdy Indian American playboy Rajiv (Apurva Agnihotri), the bad. Khan's character of Arjun is perceived as a metaphor for cosmopolitanism or Indian cultural nationalism in the wider sense, in direct contrast to Rajiv who represents wealthy Westernization and all its negative vices and connotations. ==References== ;Bibliography * ==External links== * Category:Indian films Category:1990s Hindi-language films Category:1997 films Category:Films directed by Subhash Ghai Category:Films scored by Nadeem\u2013Shravan Category:1997 romantic drama films Category:Films set in the United States Category:Hindi films remade in other languages Category:Indian romantic drama films Category:Hindi-language films ",
