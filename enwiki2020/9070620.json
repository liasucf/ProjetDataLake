The club first played games at West Green Playing Fields up until 1993 when they moved to their current ground at Willoughby Fields.http://www.crawleyrfc.com/a/history-9246.html?page=2 On 10 April 2010 Crawley were crowned League Champions of Sussex 1 and went on to be promoted into London 3 South East. After a 2010-11 difficult season, with 5 wins out of 22 games, Crawley was relegated back to the Sussex Intermediate League with a positive outlook to restructure the club and appoint a new chairman, after it was announced that Tony Smith, who had held the position for 14 years, resigned.http://clubs.rfu.com/fixtures/MatchByDivision.aspx?DivID=70000762http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/crawleyrfc/news/a-message- from-the-crawley-rug-565466.html As well as running a wide range of rugby clubs involving both junior and senior players, Crawley has in the past provided a home ground for the Sussex Swans Australian Rules Football team. ==Club honours== *Sussex 1 champions (3): 2009\u201310, 2016\u201317, 2019\u201320 == References == ==External links== * Crawley RFC Website Category:Sport in Crawley Category:Organisations based in Crawley Category:English rugby union teams ",
