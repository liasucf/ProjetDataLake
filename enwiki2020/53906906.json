On December 10, 1906 the Carnegie foundation allowed Pelham $10,000 to construct their public library on the condition the town pay an annual upkeep of 10% of the funded price. On January 13, 1907 the library committee agreed to the terms set forth by Carnegie and began construction of the building. The library was dedicated on July 1, 1908, and by 1911 had grown to hold a collection of 3,000 volumes with access to magazines and other periodicals all for free for use by the general public. The Pelham Carnegie building is one of the few original Carnegie libraries in the state of Georgia which hasn't undergone changes to the interior or exterior. Short of electrical repair in 1965 the library looks and functions much like it did when it first opened in 1908. Because of its historical significance and accuracy it is listed within the Pelham Commercial Historic District, a National Register Historic District. with ==Branches== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
