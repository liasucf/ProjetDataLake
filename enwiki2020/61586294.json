    "text": "Ashbery received the National Humanities Medal from President Barack Obama in February 2012. Video of the event is included below. American poet John Ashbery (1927\u20132017) received numerous awards, nominations, grants, fellowships, and other honors in his lifetime. He was generally regarded as the most-honored poet of his generation and one of the most-honored American writers of any era.; . He received his first award, the 92nd Street Y Discovery Prize for unpublished poets, in 1952. Four years later, W. H. Auden selected him as the winner of the Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition, resulting in the publication of his debut poetry collection Some Trees. He rose to prominence when his 1975 collection Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror became the first book to win a Pulitzer Prize, a National Book Award, and a National Book Critics Circle Award. To date, Ashbery remains the only writer to attain the achievement, which has been called the \"Triple Crown\" of American literature.; . Beyond prizes, he was a recipient of several monetary grants and fellowships that provided crucial support for his literary ambitions and travel. As a Fulbright scholar, Ashbery moved to France in 1955 to study French poetry and teach. He continued to live in the country for nearly a decade thereafter. Years later, the people of France conferred several honors in recognition of his lifelong engagement with French poetry and culture, most notably by making him an officer of the national Legion of Honor. In 1985 he received a MacArthur Fellowship\u2014an unconditional cash prize informally known as the \"Genius Grant\"\u2014allowing him to quit his job as a professor and write poetry full-time. He also received two Guggenheim Fellowships and two grants from the National Endowment for the Arts. Ashbery had acquired a reputation as a prolific prize-winner by the early 1990s. According to James F. English's book The Economy of Prestige, by 2004 he had become the most award-winning poet in the world. English counted 45 awards for Ashbery, followed by Irish poet Seamus Heaney at 30 awards and fellow American poet Adrienne Rich at 25 awards. David Lehman observed that Ashbery also held a lead over the novelist John Updike, with 39 awards, and therefore Ashbery was likely the most-honored of any living American writer\u2014at least in terms of sheer quantity of awards. Although he was considered a perennial contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature for three decades\u2014and, among American poets, probably the leading candidate overall during that period\u2014he never became a Nobel laureate. ==Accolades for individual works== ===92Y Discovery Prize=== The 92nd Street Y in 2019 The Discovery Prize is an award given to poets who have not yet published their debut book. It is given out annually by the 92nd Street Y (also called 92Y), a cultural and community center in Manhattan run by the Young Men's Hebrew Association (now called the Jewish Community Center). Ashbery received the Discovery Prize on April 3, 1952, as the winner of what was then called the Poetry Center Introductions contest. He shared the award with Harvey Shapiro and Gray Burr. The contest that year had hundreds of competing applicants and was judged by John Malcolm Brinnin, Kimon Friar, and Richard Wilbur. It was Ashbery's first literary award.; . He gave a reading of sixteen poems at the award ceremony\u2014his first since graduating college. When asked to judge the Discovery Prize competition in 2014, he replied, \"I'll have to say yes, since the contest was the beginning of my poetry career, a mere 52 years ago.\" ===ALA Notable Books=== Since 1944, the American Library Association (ALA) has compiled annual lists of Notable Books for adults. The winners are selected by the Notable Books Council, a subgroup within the ALA's Reference and User Services Association (RUSA), which also makes other award decisions. The criteria, as described in 2012, are: Books written by Ashbery have been listed three times: once in 1978 for Houseboat Days, again in 1982 for Shadow Train, and a final time in 2012 for his translation of the French poet Arthur Rimbaud's Illuminations. ! |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1978 | Houseboat Days | rowspan=\"3\" | ALA Notable Book | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1982 | Shadow Train | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2012 | Illuminations | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |} ===\"Best-of\" anthologies=== In general, Ashbery was among the top 25 most frequently anthologized American poets of the latter half of the 20th century. In most cases, literary anthologies either attempt to define a set of \"canonical\" works or collect writings united by a common characteristic such as historical time period, region, author identity, genre, etc. Although inclusion in such anthologies can be considered prestigious, they are not understood to be \"prizes\" or \"awards\" per se. The following anthologies were competitive selections of the previous year's \"best\" poetry, as judged by an editor or panel of editors. {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"table-layout: fixed; margin-right: 0;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Poem ! scope=\"col\" | Anthology ! scope=\"col\" | Series ! scope=\"col\" | Compiling editor or nominator ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1970 | | | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1977 | | | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1988 | | | rowspan=\"10\" | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1989 | | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1990 | | | | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1991 | | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1992 | | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1993 | | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1994 | | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1997 | | | | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" | 1998 | | | | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- | Three poems: * \"Baked Alaska\" * \"Myrtle\" * \"The Problem of Anxiety\" | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | data-sort-value=\"Some Trees\" |Five poems from Some Trees(1956): * \"The Instruction Manual\" * \"The Young Son\" * \"Some Trees\" * \"The Painter\" * \"The Pied Piper\" | | Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2001 | | | rowspan=\"5\" | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2002 | | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2004 | | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2005 | | | | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 2006 | | | | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- | | | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 2008 | | | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | | | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2009 | | | rowspan=\"7\" | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2010 | | | | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2011 | | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | 2013 | | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2014 | | | | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2017 | | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2019 | data-sort-value=\"Some Threes\" |Three poems from Some Trees(1956): * \"A Boy\" * \"Errors\" * \"Answering a Question in the Mountains\" | | Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |} ====Borestone Mountain Poetry Awards==== The 1970 Borestone Mountain Poetry Awards anthology included Ashbery's poem \"Soonest Mended\".

The Borestone Mountain Poetry Awards anthologies collected the editors' selections of the best original English-language poems of no more than 100 lines published the preceding year in literary magazines. After making an initial selection, the editors read poems with the names of the author and original publication removed and assigned scores. The authors of the three highest-scoring poems received cash prizes and were designated as First, Second, and Third place in the anthology. Ashbery's poem \"Soonest Mended\", first published in The Paris Review and included in his collection The Double Day of Spring(1970), was chosen for Best Poems of 1969: Borestone Mountain Poetry Awards 1970. It did not receive one of the top three placements. ====Pushcart Prize==== Published annually since 1976, the Pushcart Prize anthologizes the best writing from independently published periodicals including poetry, fiction and nonfiction. Ashbery's poem \"All Kinds of Caresses\" appeared in The Pushcart Prize, II: Best of the Small Presses. It was nominated by the Chicago Review, the same journal in which it was first published. Ashbery was also a contributing editor for that volume and nominated Douglas Crase's \"Cuylerville\" and James Schuyler's \"Song\". Joan Murray and other Pushcart editors also selected the poem for The Pushcart Book of Poetry: The Best Poems From Three Decades of the Pushcart Prize(2006). ====The Best American Poetry==== The Best American Poetry series launched in 1988 and is edited by David Lehman. Each year, a different guest editor selects 75 of the year's best American poetry published the preceding year. Ashbery was the guest editor for the first volume, The Best American Poetry 1988, in which he selected his own \"One Coat of Paint\". Between 1989 and 2017, poems of his were chosen 20 times. Three of those poems were included again in The Best of the Best American Poetry 1988\u20131997, which compiled Harold Bloom's selections from the 750 poems in the first ten years of the series.

See the section on the Yale Series of Younger Poets Prize below. Six of Ashbery's poems were included in The Griffin Poetry Prize 2008 Anthology because his book Notes from the Air: Selected Later Poems was shortlisted for the international Griffin Poetry Prize. He ultimately won that year's international prize. See the section on the Griffin Prize below. ===Bingham Poetry Prize=== The Bingham Poetry Prize was an award given by the literary magazine Boston Book Review. Established in 1993, the Boston Book Review published ten issues annually until it ceased publication in 2000 and, around 1997\u201398, reportedly had the third-highest circulation of any American book review periodical. Along with the magazine's Fisk Fiction Prize and Rea Non- Fiction Prize, the Bingham Poetry Prize was an annual award to \"celebrate excellent literary accomplishments\" that had been published the previous year. Each of the three awards carried a cash prize of $1,000.; see also Ashbery was a co-winner of the Bingham Poetry Prize for The Mooring of Starting Out: The First Five Books of Poetry, a compilation of his early work.; .

First presented by the National Book Committee in 1936, the National Book Awards are among the most prestigious American literary awards.; . The awards, currently administered by the National Book Foundation, have been organized by a variety of groups throughout their history. The National Book Award for Poetry has been bestowed annually since 1950, except for a hiatus between 1984 and 1990. Ashbery won the award once and was a finalist three times. In 1967, the National Book Committee named Rivers and Mountains as a poetry finalist. It was selected by a judges panel of W. H. Auden, James Dickey, and Howard Nemerov.; . In 1976, Ashbery won the award\u2014and its cash prize of $1,000\u2014for Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror.; .

The award is given by the National Book Critics Circle, an association of editors and critics founded in 1974 in New York City. According to Ashbery, the award itself was \"almost invented\" for him. In an interview with Mark Ford, Ashbery recalled an exchange reportedly sparked by a negative review for his Self-Portrait in The New York Review of Books: The National Book Critics Circle nominated three more of his original collections: Houseboat Days in 1977, A Wave in 1984, and April Galleons in 1987.; ; . He was also announced as a finalist in 2008 for The Landscapist, his translation of Pierre Martory's French poetry collection. ! |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1976 | Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror | rowspan=\"5\" | National Book Critics Circle Award for Poetry | | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1977 | Houseboat Days | | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1984 | A Wave | | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1987 | April Galleons | | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2008 | The Landscapist | | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |} ===New York Times Book Review accolades=== The New York Times Book Review is a weekly literary supplement to The New York Times.

His first, in 1963, was the Harriet Monroe Memorial Prize of $100 for five poems in that year's June issue. That year's prize winners were decided by a panel of Wallace Fowlie, Joseph Wiley, and then-editor Henry Rago.

The prize was sponsored by the Union League Club of Chicago. In 1974 he received the Frank O'Hara Prize, named in memory of his friend and fellow poet Frank O'Hara, who had died in 1966. The award and its $500 cash prize recognized poems from the November 1973, April 1974, and August 1974 issues, which included the title poem from Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror and others that would appear in the same collection. He received the $300 Levinson Prize, named for the attorney Salmon Levinson and created by an endowment of his family, in 1977 for poems in the April and August issues. Two years later he received the first English- Speaking Union Prize, awarded by the Junior Board of the titular organization and valued at $1,000, for seven poems from July 1979. ! |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1963 | Five poems from the June 1963 issue: * \"A Blessing in Disguise\" * \"If the Birds Knew\" * \"Last Month\" * \"The Recent Past\" * \"Civilization and Its Discontents\" | Harriet Monroe Memorial Prize | | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1966 | One poem from the February 1966 issue: * \"Fragment\" | Union League Civic and Arts Foundation Poetry Prize | | style=\"text- align:center;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1974 | Five poems published in Poetry, 1973\u201374: *\"As You Came from the Holy Land\" (November 1973) *\"A Man of Words\" (November) *\"Scheherazade\" (November) *\"Grand Galop\" (April 1974) *\"Self- Portrait in a Convex Mirror\" (August) | Frank O'Hara Prize | | style=\"text- align:center;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1977 | Four poems published in Poetry, 1977: * \"Syringa\" (April) * \"Blue Sonata\" (April) * \"The Ice-Cream Wars\" (April) * \"Fantasia on 'The Nut-Brown Maid'\" (August) | Levinson Prize | | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1979 | Seven poems published in the July 1979 issue: * \"Late Echo\" * \"Train Rising Out of the Station\" * \"Not Only / But Also\" * \"Many Wagons Ago\" * \"The Sun\" * \"Five Pedantic Pieces\" * \"Flowering Death\" | The English-Speaking Union Prize | | style=\"text- align:center;\" | |} ===Pulitzer Prize for Poetry=== Pulitzer Public Service medal (obverse shown) is a symbol of the Pulitzer Prizes in general. Ashbery won the Pulitzer for Poetry in 1976 and was a finalist in 1993. The Pulitzer Prizes have been administered by Columbia University since 1917 and are currently awarded in 21 categories for accomplishments in journalism, literature, and music. Columbia first awarded an informal Poetry Prize in 1918 and formally introduced the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1922. The winner of a Pulitzer Prize for Poetry receives a certificate and a cash prize. Although the value of the cash prize has steadily increased throughout the years, it has been considered fairly low within the field of literary awards throughout most of its history. However, the award's high public prestige and associated rise in sales have outpaced other awards with higher cash prizes. Self- Portrait in a Convex Mirror won the 1976 Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. At that time, the award's cash prize was $1,000. The book was unanimously selected by a jury of Anthony Hecht, Richard Howard, and Mark Strand, who also shortlisted Buried City by Howard Moss, The Western Approaches by Howard Nemerov, and Tales Told by Fathers by John Hollander. In the jury's report to the Pulitzer Advisory Board, Hecht wrote: Ashbery was a finalist in 1993 for Hotel Lautr\u00e9amont, nominated by a jury of Frank Bidart, Bonnie Costello, and Charles Wright. Louise Gl\u00fcck won that year for The Wild Iris, while James Merrill's Selected Poems 1946\u20131985 was also nominated. ! |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1976 | Self- Portrait in a Convex Mirror | rowspan=\"2\" | Pulitzer Prize for Poetry | | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1993 | Hotel Lautr\u00e9amont | | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |} ===Shelley Memorial Award=== Named for the English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792\u20131822), the Shelley Memorial Award was established in 1929. It is administered by the Poetry Society of America (PSA) and awarded on the basis of \"genius and need\". The three-person jury is appointed by the president (chancellor) of the University of California, Berkeley, the president of Radcliffe College, and the PSA board of directors. In 1973, Ashbery and Richard Wilbur were both awarded the Shelley Memorial Award. He received a cash prize of $1,800. The award was granted in recognition of his collection Three Poems(1972).; . ! |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1973 | Three Poems | Shelley Memorial Award | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |} ===SWR-Bestenliste=== S\u00fcdwestrundfunk (SWR) is a German public broadcasting corporation with television and radio stations. SWR releases the (Best List), a monthly ranking of recently released books as scored by a jury of critics. SWR's predecessor S\u00fcdwestfunk (SWF) began the Bestenliste in 1976, when it was conceived as an alternative to Der Spiegels strictly sales-based booklist. German translations of Ashbery's poetry have appeared on the Bestenliste twice. Ein weltgewandtes Land, a bilingual edition of the collection A Worldly Country with translations by multiple German poets, ranked in first place on the December 2010 list with 69 points. Flussbild, a bilingual edition of Flow Chart with a German translation by and Uda Str\u00e4tling, ranked tenth in May 2013 with 29 points. {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"table-layout: fixed; margin-right: 0;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Date ! scope=\"col\" | Book ! scope=\"col\" | List ! scope=\"col\" | Rank ! scope=\"col\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2010 | Ein weltgewandtes Land | SWR-Bestenliste | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" | 2013 | Flussbild | SWR-Bestenliste | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |} ===Yale Series of Younger Poets Prize=== Established in 1919, the Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition is the longest-running poetry prize in the United States. It began as a competition to recognize undergraduate poets at Yale University before expanding to accept any poets under the age of 30 (and later, 40) who had not yet published their first book. Each year, Yale University Press publishes the winner's debut book of poetry. The preliminary round of the contest is judged by a team of editors, mostly graduate students, who pass on their recommendations to an editor selected by the board of Yale University Press. The editor is typically a leading figure in poetry who is not necessarily otherwise associated with Yale. W. H. Auden judged the competition between 1946 and 1958, a run considered to be the best in the competition's history due to the high number of winners who went on to acclaimed and noteworthy careers in poetry. Alongside Ashbery, some of the highly regarded winners selected by Auden include James Wright, Adrienne Rich, W. S. Merwin, and John Hollander. Ashbery won the 1955 Younger Poets Competition, but only following a complicated and somewhat unfavorable process. Both he and Frank O'Hara, his friend and a fellow Harvard alumnus, were eliminated by the first round judges. However, Auden found himself dissatisfied with all of the twelve manuscripts that he had been given. He asked Ashbery and O'Hara to resubmit their poems directly to him and, a week later, decided he preferred Ashbery's submission. He named Ashbery the winner despite his own personal reservations about the avant-garde style and influence from surrealism in Ashbery's poetry, which he found alienating and often nonsensical.; . Ashbery's debut poetry collection, Some Trees, was published in 1956 with a foreword by Auden. Poems from Some Trees have been subsequently included in two anthologies related to the Younger Poets series; see the section on \"best-of\" anthologies above. ! |- ! scope=\"row\" | 1955 | Some Trees | Yale Series of Younger Poets Prize | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |} ==Grants and fellowships== Ashbery received several grants and fellowships that provided monetary support for his creative output as a writer.

He was rejected five times. However, he was accepted into the program in 1955 after an initial rejection because another applicant decided to withdraw. He lived in Montpellier and translated French poetry. As part of his Fulbright project, he translated works by Jules Supervielle, Paul \u00c9luard, and Francis Ponge, which much later appeared in his Collected French Translations. His Fulbright was extended for a second year, during which he taught American studies in Rennes. According to his own recollection in 2014, his monthly stipend had been about $135 (equivalent to about $ in , adjusted for inflation). After the grant expired, he moved to Paris and lived there until 1965. ===Poets' Foundation=== The Poets' Foundation\u2014not to be confused with the Chicago-based Poetry Foundation\u2014was an anonymously funded organization in New York. Ashbery received two grants from the Poets' Foundation: one in 1960, the other in 1964. The amounts Ashbery received from the foundation are not publicly known; other poets reportedly received grants ranging from $500 to $1,500 in the early-to-mid 1960s. ===Ingram Merrill Foundation=== American poet James Merrill established the Ingram Merrill Foundation in the 1950s. Merrill was a son of businessman Charles E. Merrill, who co-founded the investment and wealth management company Merrill Lynch. After the deaths of both his father and mother in 1956, Merrill received a substantial inheritance. He used the money to fund his own creative endeavors and to create the foundation, which provided grants to writers and artists until its dissolution in 1996. Though Merrill was a foundation board member, the foundation ostensibly made its grant-making decisions on an independent basis without his influence. He relied on this formal separation from the foundation to preserve normal social relations with other artists; he did not want to appear to be granting favors to friends, or to put others in the awkward position of personally asking him for funding. However, in practice Merrill retained final authority over the foundation's actions. He relied on the advice of colleagues like John Hollander and Irma Brandeis . Ashbery received grants from the Ingram Merrill Foundation in 1962 and 1972. It is not known how much money Ashbery received from the foundation, but its typical grant sizes ranged from about $4,000 to $6,000. ===Guggenheim Fellowships=== alt=Guggenheim Foundation logo Guggenheim Fellowships, disbursed by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation since 1925, are grants intended \"to help provide Fellows with blocks of time in which they can work with as much creative freedom as possible.\" (\"to help provide...\"); (\"since 1925\"). Individuals are selected for fellowships through an application process. The amount of a grant varies depending on the foundation's budget, the scope of the applicant's creative project, and the extent of other financial resources available to the fellow. Starting in 1955, Ashbery applied for a Guggenheim Fellowship eleven times. He was named a fellow two times\u2014first in 1967, then in 1973. While the amounts of money he received through the program are not publicly known, the program's average grant sizes in those years were $7,430 and $11,252, respectively. He used the proceeds of his first fellowship to travel to Europe in 1968, visiting Pierre Martory in Paris then Switzerland and Italy with his mother. The second fellowship allowed him to delay taking a job teaching at Brooklyn College until 1974 so he could focus on writing poetry in the meantime. His poetry collections The Double Dream of Spring(1970) and Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror(1975) include notes of acknowledgement to the Guggenheim Foundation. ===National Endowment for the Arts (NEA)=== alt=Nationial Endowment for the Arts logo In fiscal year 1969, he received a publication award of $500 from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). The award was given in recognition of his poem \"Spring Day\", first published in a 1967 issue of The Paris Review, and resulted in the poem's inclusion in The American Literary Anthology, Volume 2. Vance Bourjaily, Robert Duncan, Albert Guerard, Mark Harris, Philip Roth, Anne Sexton, Roger Shattuck, John Simon, and Louis Simpson. In 1975, he applied for a Composer\u2013Librettist grant from the NEA along with the modernist composer Elliott Carter. Their collaboration resulted in the musical piece Syringa, set to Ashbery's poem of the same name and several texts in Greek. Although Ashbery wrote several original libretti for Carter, the composer was inspired by the previously published \"Syringa\" and chose to use it instead. As such, Ashbery did not ultimately contribute new writing to the composition. Nevertheless, his grant\u2014in the amount of $4,350\u2014was not revoked.; . ===Rockefeller Foundation=== alt=Rockefeller Foundation logo The Rockefeller Foundation is a large American private foundation. In 1971, it launched a yearly program of writing grants for a \"playwright-in-residence\" program, pairing a writer together with a theater with the goal of staging an original production. Eight or nine playwrights were chosen each year based on nominations taken from theaters and from the panel of judges followed by deliberation of the judges; applications were not accepted. Each playwright would receive $8,500 outright with an additional $500 for relocation expenses, while each designated theater would receive $4,000. There were little to no conditions placed upon receipt of the grant\u2014according to The New York Times, one grant-winning playwright used the money to purchase a Ferrari sports car. Although best known for poetry, Ashbery was also involved in theater early in his career and wrote several experimental plays, most of which were published together in the 1978 book Three Plays. He had largely abandoned dramatic writing by the time his first poetry collection was published in 1956. In an October 1978 interview, he described an untitled dramatic \"work-in-progress\" of about 100 pages that he had been developing, on and off, for several years. However, his final new play was To the Mill, published in 1960 as part of The Hasty Papers magazine edited by Alfred Leslie. It is not clear what became of the \"work-in-progress\". Jack Larson, an actor and writer, nominated Ashbery and two others for the Rockefeller Foundation's playwright-in-residence program in 1978. In December 1978, the Rockefeller Foundation announced Ashbery and eight playwrights would receive grants under the program, though he was the only one listed without a paired theater. The New York Times announced the grant awards three months later, but still listed Ashbery only as \"theater to be determined\". It does not seem to be the case that he ultimately worked with a theater under the \"playwright-in-residence\" program, but he did receive the grant. ===MacArthur Fellowship=== alt=MacArthur Foundation logo In 1985, the MacArthur Foundation named Ashbery as one of 25 new MacArthur Fellows. Colloquially known as the \"genius\" grant, the fellowship is given to \"outstandingly talented and creative people\" so that they may \"pursue whatever they believe is important and relevant\", without conditions or limitations on how they spend the grant money. At the time, each fellow received between $155,000 and $300,000 over the course of five years, with higher value based on age. Between 1985 and 1990, Ashbery received $272,000, or $54,400 a year. Because of the MacArthur Fellowship, he was able to quit his jobs as a professor at Brooklyn College and as an art critic at Newsweek. ===Wallace Stevens fellowship=== The Wallace Stevens fellowship, named for American poet Wallace Stevens, was a program of the Timothy Dwight College at Yale University. It was established in 1976 by an anonymous donation from a fellow from the college. An annual program, the fellowship invited a prominent poet to come to the college and give readings of their work. The first Wallace Stevens fellow was Richard Eberhart, who was in residence at the college at the time. Ashbery was appointed to the fellowship in 1985. ==Honors for cumulative or lifetime achievement== The following awards and honors were bestowed in recognition of Ashbery as an individual, either for lifetime achievement or the cumulative sum of his literary career and oeuvre. ===Academic honors=== Ashbery received several honors from universities and academic institutions. ====Honorary degrees==== Ashbery completed his formal education in 1951 with an M.A. at Columbia. He briefly considered going for a PhD, even beginning work on a dissertation about the life of French poet Raymond Roussel, but abandoned the project before completion. While the M.A. was the highest degree he attained through schooling, he received honorary degrees at the DLitt (Doctor of Letters) level from the following universities and colleges: ====Accademia dei Lincei==== In 2006, Ashbery was elected a foreign member of the Italian Accademia dei Lincei in Rome. He had previously received its prestigious Antonio Feltrinelli International Prize; see the section on the Feltrinelli Prize below. ====Bard College==== Bard College is a private liberal arts college in Annandale-on- Hudson, New York.

The annual award recognizes a person who has made \"a significant contribution to the American artistic or literary heritage.\" *Since 1995, the college has a recurrent reading event called the John Ashbery Poetry Series named in his honor.; . *At the occasion of the poet's 80th birthday in 2007, Ann Lauterbach held a weekend-long celebration at the college and the college's biennial literary journal Conjunctions dedicated a \"special birthday anthology\" issue to him. The issue, edited by Peter Gizzi and Bradford Morrow, featured personal essays from writers responding to Ashbery's poetry and reprinted some of his rare early writings. ====Brandeis University==== The Creative Arts Awards of Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts recognizes \"active American artists\" with honors in three categories: the Creative Arts Medal, for lifetime achievement; the Creative Arts Citation, for \"mid-career\" achievement; and the Special Award for Notable Achievement in the Creative Arts, for an artist who has made \"singular cultural contributions\". In May 1989, Ashbery received the Creative Arts Medal for Poetry at the 33rd Creative Arts Awards. The ceremony took place at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. The Brandeis Review said he was \"credited with creating the most original and influential poetic mode of our time.\" Other medalists that year were Louise Bourgeois for sculpture, Jonas Mekas for film, Mel Powell for music. ====Deerfield Academy==== In 1984, Ashbery received the Heritage Award from the Deerfield Academy Alumni Association.

Founded as a fraternity in 1776, Phi Beta Kappa (\u03a6\u0392\u039a) is an academic honor society with chapters throughout the United States. Its Harvard chapter, chartered in 1779, was the longest-running chapter when it merged into a broader Massachusetts chapter in 1995. Chosen annually, the Phi Beta Kappa poet gives a reading during commencement week events; other Phi Beta Kappa poets at Harvard have included W. H. Auden, Robert Frost, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Robert Lowell, and Wallace Stevens. Ashbery later judged the first Phi Beta Kappa poetry competition in 2001, awarding a $10,000 prize and bronze medal to Kenneth Koch from a field of 200 applicants. *Ashbery was selected to give the Charles Eliot Norton Lecture for the 1989\u201390 academic year. Named for Charles Eliot Norton, the annual lecture series on poetry\u2014defined broadly enough to include poetic expressions like music and architecture\u2014is considered one of the most highly prestigious of the hundreds at Harvard. Each of his six lectures surveyed the work of an under-appreciated \"minor\" poet from whom he had taken inspiration: they were John Clare, Thomas Lovell Beddoes, Raymond Roussel, John Wheelwright, Laura Riding, and David Schubert. These lectures were later published by Harvard University Press in the book Other Traditions(2000). *The Signet Society is an exclusive literary society at Harvard. Ashbery joined as an undergraduate, completing his initiation by performing an original Henry James parody titled \"Return of the Screw\". Other noteworthy members who pursued poetry include James Agee, Conrad Aiken, T. S. Eliot, and John Updike. The Signet Society Medal for Achievement in the Arts has been awarded on an annual basis since 1937. Ashbery was named a Signet Medalist in 2001. He was subsequently named the honorary poet of the Signet Society Annual Dinner in 2006. *In 2009, Ashbery received the Harvard Arts Medal at that year's Arts First festival at the university. According to Harvard Magazine, the award \"celebrates alumni and faculty members whose excellence in the arts has served education or the public good.\" After an introduction by fellow Harvard alum John Lithgow, Ashbery discussed his work with scholar Daniel Chiasson and then received the medal from the university president, Drew Gilpin Faust. ====New York University==== In May 2011, the New York University Center for French Civilization and Culture conferred its Medal of Honor to Ashbery. ====Pasadena City College==== In 1985, Ashbery was named the Poet of the Year at Pasadena City College, a public community college in Pasadena, California.

In his opening remarks, Obama quoted from Emily Dickinson's poem \"I dwell in possibility\". First Lady Michelle Obama was also present. Writing about the event for the Poetry Society of America, Darrel Alejandro Holnes remarked that Ashbery appeared \"cordial and visibly joyful\" as he received his medal. ===New York honors=== Ashbery received several awards from public and nonprofit entities in New York. ====New York State Poet==== Ashbery served as New York State's seventh Poet Laureate (officially the \"State Poet\") from 2001 to 2003. The position was created by state statute in 1985, with term lengths of two years. New York State Poets receive the Walt Whitman Citation of Merit and a $10,000 honorarium. The New York State Writers Institute at the University at Albany, SUNY selected Ashbery for the award, which was conferred on January 22, 2001. Kurt Vonnegut became the New York State Author at the same ceremony, receiving the Edith Wharton Citation of Merit for Fiction Writers. ====Columbia County Special Citation for Literature==== In 2001, the Columbia County Council on the Arts gave the poet a Special Citation for Literature. He had lived in the county since 1978, when he purchased a home in Hudson. ====New York City honors==== In 1983, he received a Mayor's Award of Honor for Arts and Culture from the city's Department of Cultural Affairs. Mayor's Awards for Arts and Culture were given most years between 1976 and 1994 and were revived in 2004. Ashbery accepted the award in a ceremony at Gracie Mansion, presented by Mayor Ed Koch, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Academy of American Poets. Other recipients of the award that year were Merce Cunningham, Brendan Gill, Alberta Hunter, David Katz, LuEsther Mertz, Tina Ramirez, Vivian Robinson, Arthur Ross, Rudolf Serkin, Maureen Stapleton, and Sol Steinberg. In 2006, the New York City Council proclaimed April 7 \"John Ashbery Day\", in conjunction with a three-day John Ashbery Festival held at The New School. In 2013, Ashbery was announced as the winner in the poetry category of the second annual NYC Literary Honors, established under Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration. Other honorees that year included Toni Morrison, Calvin Trillin, Jules Feiffer, Morton L. Janklow, and Lynn Nesbit. The awards were presented during a ceremony at Gracie Mansion, with Ashbery and the other winners giving selected readings. The honorees were selected by Cultural Affairs Commissioner Kate D. Levin, New York City Schools Chancellor Dennis Walcott, and heads of the New York Public Library system.; . ====New York Public Library and library organizations==== On April 22, 1977, Ashbery received the annual literary award of the nonprofit Friends of the Library organization in Rochester, his birthplace.; . It was his first lifetime achievement award.; . In 1984, he received the New York Public Library's Literary Lion award. The library launched the award\u2014more recently called the Library Lion\u2014in 1981. These awards, given in the form of a lion-head medallion, have been conferred annually at black tie fundraising events benefitting the library. Alongside Ashbery there were 21 other writers who received the award on November 12, 1984, during an event that raised $250,000. Ashbery was inducted into the New York State Writers Hall of Fame in 2011, the institution's second year, at the Empire State Book Festival Gala in Albany. The Hall of Fame is a project of the New York Library Association and the New York Council for the Humanities. Ashbery and Paula Fox were the two living writers to join the Hall of Fame that year; the others were Willa Cather, Julia de Burgos, Ralph Ellison, Lorraine Hansberry, Madeleine L'Engle, Herman Melville, and Dorothy Parker. ===Premio Napoli Special Prize=== The (\"Naples Prize\") is an annual Italian literary award recognizing Italian and international literature. The prize has been administered by the Fondazione Premio Napoli (\"Naples Prize Foundation\") since 1960, when it was established by the government of Italy. In 2009, the Fondazione Premio Napoli recognized Ashbery with a special prize for career achievement in world literature. The prize also recognized the recent publication of Un mondo che non pu\u00f2 essere migliore: Poesie scelte 1956\u20132007, an Italian-language collection of selected poems translated by Moira Egan, Damiano Abeni, and Joseph Harrison.; . The special prize for Italian literature went to Antonio Moresco. As part of the Premio Napoli events in October, Ashbery called in from New York for a conversation with Moresco, presented for a live audience at the Royal Palace of Naples and broadcast on the radio by RAI. In December, Ashbery received the award in-person during a ceremony hosted by the Italian Academy at Columbia University. Attendees included Fondazione Napoli president and several members of the Columbia faculty. Charles Simic, who had received the main international Premio Napoli that year, presented Ashbery with a plaque. During his acceptance speech Ashbery read from \"And You Know\", a poem written about his first travels through Europe that recounts his impressions of Naples. ===Raymond Roussel Society Medal=== {| align=right | | \\---- |} As a great admirer of avant-garde French writer Raymond Roussel (1877\u20131933), Ashbery was a founding member of the Raymond Roussel Society in 2016. The following June, he became the first recipient of the Raymond Roussel Society Medal for \"rediscovering and spreading awareness of Raymond Roussel in the Unites States of America.\" Joan Bofill-Amarg\u00f3s, president of the Raymond Roussel Society, designed the medal itself: a gold-plated silver medallion which, as a reference to an event from Roussel's life, contained a cookie in the shape of a five-pointed star inside. Ashbery's poor health did not permit him to leave his home, so Bofill-Amarg\u00f3s personally delivered it to him at his home in Hudson. The next day, Trevor Winkfield publicly accepted the medal on Ashbery's behalf during an event held at the Instituto Cervantes in New York. ===Robert Creeley Award=== The Robert Creeley Foundation was formed in 2001 in Acton, Massachusetts to benefit the town's local library, schools, and community at large. It was formed by poets Robert Clawson and Robert Creeley, the foundation's namesake and the first recipient of its Robert Creeley Award. The foundation presented the award every year to an \"internationally renowned poet\", who would be invited to Acton to offer free public readings, give presentations at local schools, and donate signed copies of their books to the collection of the Acton Memorial Library.; Creeley and Ashbery had attended Harvard together and remained friends long afterward. Ashbery won the Robert Creeley Award in spring 2008, three years after Creeley's death. The award was presented by Robert's widow Pen Creeley. He gave three poetry readings: the first at R. J. Grey Junior High School, another the following day at Acton- Boxborough Regional High School, and at the Memorial Library. More than 800 audience members, in total, attended these events.; . Local students Peter Boskey and Michael Bottari opened for Ashbery with readings of their original poems. They were the first winners of the foundation's Helen Creeley Student Poetry Prize, a contest open to submissions from area high schoolers and named for Robert's sister, who was also a poet. ===Robert Frost Medal=== \\---- The Robert Frost Medal is a lifetime achievement award of the Poetry Society of America (PSA). Introduced in 1930 as the PSA's \"Gold Medal\", it was renamed after poet Robert Frost and turned into an annual award in 1984. Since 1995, the Frost Medal winner is expected to give a speech at the PSA's Annual Awards Ceremony known as the Robert Frost Lecture, which includes readings of their poetry.; . Ashbery won the Frost Medal in 1995. As such, he delivered the first Frost Lecture. The text of his lecture was published for the first time in his 2004 collection Selected Prose. ===Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize=== The Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize was established in 1986 by philanthropist Ruth Lilly as an annual prize to a poet \"whose lifetime accomplishments warrant extraordinary recognition.\" Throughout its history it has been among the most substantial cash prizes for a literary award in the United States; as of 2019, its value is $100,000.; The prize was initially administered by the Modern Poetry Association and the American Council for the Arts and is currently administered by the Poetry Foundation. The Modern Poetry Association was also the publisher of Poetry magazine prior to the Poetry Foundation. Ashbery was announced as the winner of the 1992 Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize on May 5. Poetry ran the announcement in its July issue. The prize money that year was $25,000, which he told The New York Times was \"certainly welcome but hardly enough to quit my job and retire.\" However, he said the prestige \"makes one feel better. It temporarily allays one's doubts about one's work that you think you've conquered but that eventually come creeping back.\" ===Wallace Stevens Award=== The Wallace Stevens Award is a lifetime achievement prize from the Academy of American Poets for \"outstanding and proven mastery in the art of poetry.\" The award carries one of the largest cash prizes for a literary award, worth $100,000 as of 2019. Ashbery won the award in Fall 2001, receiving a cash prize of $150,000. The selection committee included Charles Bernstein, Susan Howe, Harryette Mullen, Geoffrey O'Brien, and Cole Swenson. ==Miscellaneous honors== In 2007, Ashbery was named the first \"Poet Laureate of MTVU\" (logo pictured). The following are miscellaneous honors and distinctions which do not squarely fit into any of the other categories: *In 1980, he was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. *In 1983, he was elected as a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. *In 1988, he was elected as a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets. He retained the position until his term expired at the end of 1999, in the midst of a restructuring and the introduction of a new rotation schedule to help encourage greater diversity and less elitism in the organization. *From April 6\u20138, 2006, The New School hosted a John Ashbery Festival featuring poetry readings and discussions. Ashbery gave a reading on the second day. The festival was organized by David Lehman. In the lead-up to the festival, Lehman also coordinated to have the New York City Council proclaim April 7 as John Ashbery Day. See the section on New York City honors above. *Also in 2006, the University of Massachusetts Amherst dedicated its Juniper literary festival to the 50th anniversary of the publication of Some Trees. *In August 2007, Ashbery was named the first \"Poet Laureate of MTVU\". His poetry featured in short promotional videos on the network and its website. He accepted the unpaid position because he saw it as an opportunity to \"broaden the audience for poetry\" without expending much effort on his part. As he told the New York Times, MTVU were \"going to publicize my poetry and maybe people will get interested in it and other poets will benefit,\" which was \"about as much work or responsibility as I would want.\" The position endured after Ashbery's tenure: the Iranian poet Simin Behbahani was named the second Poet Laureate of MTVU in October 2009. *In October 2008, the nonprofit publisher Library of America issued Ashbery's Collected Poems 1956\u20131987 as volume 187 in its ongoing series of classic American literature, marking the first time it had published a volume of writing by a living poet.; . *In October 2011, Ashbery was named an LGBT History Month Icon. Beginning in 2006, the organization Equality Forum dedicated each day in October to honor an LGBT individual who had \"changed the world in some way\". Ashbery was recognized on October 2, 2011. *In November 2011, Ashbery was featured in the American LGBT culture magazine Outs 17th Annual Out100 list of 100 notable openly LGBT individuals. ==All honors== {| role=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable sortable mw- collapsible\" |+ All honors received by Ashbery |- !

| | | | | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |} ==Ashbery and the Nobel Prize in Literature== \\---- Ashbery never received the Nobel Prize in Literature, and a Nobel cannot be awarded posthumously. (\"The Nobel Prize for literature aside, there is hardly an award\u2014at least in the U.S.\u2014that John Ashbery has not received\"); (\"No, it is not possible to nominate someone for a posthumous Nobel Prize\"). During his lifetime, he was a leading contender for the prize among American poets. It is not known whether Ashbery was ever formally nominated for the prize or, if so, how many times he was nominated or how far he may have gotten in the process. Nomination records are kept secret for fifty years, after which time they may become available to the general public. Because he was last eligible for the prize in 2016, having died in 2017, records covering the full span of his eligibility will not be publicly available until at least 2067. At present, no American-born writer has become a Nobel laureate in recognition of literary work that is universally and uncontroversially agreed to be American poetry. Following Ashbery's death, New York Times critic Dwight Garner said the Nobel Committee's failure to recognize Ashbery ranked among its major oversights in American poetry alongside its omissions of Elizabeth Bishop, Robert Frost, Wallace Stevens, Frank O'Hara, and John Berryman. Though he never spoke of it publicly, there is some indication he contemplated winning the Nobel and hoped to achieve it. ===Factors that may have affected Ashbery's odds to win the Nobel=== Ashbery was the subject of public Nobel speculation as early as 1995, when Swedish publisher dropped his name to the Associated Press as a candidate under discussion. Members of the Swedish literati generally predicted a Nobel was due for a poet or a European, possibly both. Ultimately, Irish poet Seamus Heaney won that year. {| class=\"wikitable floatleft sortable\" style=\"text- align:center; margin: 0.5em 1.4em 1.3em 0; font-size:90%;\" |+ class=\"nowrap\"| Ashbery's Nobel odds 2009\u20132016 !

Their odds are often cited in the press for their usefulness as a general reference, given that the prize has a wide field of potential candidates and it is notoriously difficult to predict the outcome.; . Per Ladbrokes, Ashbery had the best odds to win in 2010, at .; ; ; ; ; . Those odds placed him below E. L. Doctorow (at ), above Philip Roth and Maya Angelou (both at ), and on par with the Polish poet Adam Zagajewski. Literary commentators believed his chances were boosted by his high-profile; it stood to reason that if any poet, especially an American one, were to receive a Nobel in a given year, he would have been one of the most likely choices. In 2008, David Orr wrote in The New York Times that, among American poets, only Ashbery and Adrienne Rich enjoyed \"international reputations conceivably large enough to interest Nobel jurors\" at that time. The same year, the Swedish scholar commented that it had been a long time since a Nobel had gone to a poet\u2014the last had been Heaney in 1995\u2014and named Ashbery, Syrian poet Adunis, and the Australian poet Les Murray as probable winners for poetry. On the other hand, his chances were likely dampened by his avant-garde style, which diverged from the universalism favored by the Nobel Committee. Ange Mlinko commented that year that the Nobel committee passes over poet John Ashbery for a socially responsible novelist, it proves that the prize for literature is just an arm of the Peace Prize, rather than\u2013like the Nobels for physics or chemistry\u2013a prize for radical discovery in the field.\" According to Charles North, Ashbery was hindered because, \"unlike most of those who have won the prize,\" he was \"not perceived as engag\u00e9\"\u2014that is, he was not perceived to be seriously engaged as a writer with any pressing moral or political cause. Nevertheless, North wrote, there was \"no writer whose poems are more engaged with what it means to be human.\" Jeffrey Gray wrote that there can be a symbolic expectation for Nobel winners to embody their national literature, and Ashbery was not necessarily an obvious choice to represent American literature as a whole: Ashbery was also openly gay, and his sexuality may have influenced the committee's deliberations. Alfred Corn, a gay American poet and friend of Ashbery, noted in an obituary for The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide that he had won \"every prize you can think of except for the Nobel, which almost never goes to gay writers.\" Eileen Myles, an American writer and lesbian, suggested in Out magazine that Ashbery's heightened aestheticism and open homosexuality made him an improbable fit for the committee's restrained sensibilities: ==Notes== ==Citations== ==Sources== ===Bibliography=== : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : ===Academic and literary journals=== : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : ===Magazines, newspapers and websites=== : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : : Category:Lists of awards received by writer ",
