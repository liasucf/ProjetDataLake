    "text": "The forward rate is the future yield on a bond. It is calculated using the yield curve. For example, the yield on a three-month Treasury bill six months from now is a forward rate.. ==Forward rate calculation== To extract the forward rate, we need the zero-coupon yield curve. We are trying to find the future interest rate r_{1,2} for time period (t_1, t_2), t_1 and t_2 expressed in years, given the rate r_1 for time period (0, t_1) and rate r_2 for time period (0, t_2). To do this, we use the property that the proceeds from investing at rate r_1 for time period (0, t_1) and then reinvesting those proceeds at rate r_{1,2} for time period (t_1, t_2) is equal to the proceeds from investing at rate r_2 for time period (0, t_2). r_{1,2} depends on the rate calculation mode (simple, yearly compounded or continuously compounded), which yields three different results. Mathematically it reads as follows: ===Simple rate=== : (1+r_1t_1)(1+ r_{1,2}(t_2-t_1)) = 1+r_2t_2 Solving for r_{1,2} yields: Thus r_{1,2} = \\frac{1}{t_2-t_1}\\left(\\frac{1+r_2t_2}{1+r_1t_1}-1\\right) The discount factor formula for period (0, t) \\Delta_t expressed in years, and rate r_t for this period being DF(0, t)=\\frac{1}{(1+r_t \\, \\Delta_t)}, the forward rate can be expressed in terms of discount factors: r_{1,2} = \\frac{1}{t_2-t_1}\\left(\\frac{DF(0, t_1)}{DF(0, t_2)}-1\\right) ===Yearly compounded rate=== : (1+r_1)^{t_1}(1+r_{1,2})^{t_2-t_1} = (1+r_2)^{t_2} Solving for r_{1,2} yields : : r_{1,2} = \\left(\\frac{(1+r_2)^{t_2}}{(1+r_1)^{t_1}}\\right)^{1/(t_2-t_1)} - 1 The discount factor formula for period (0,t) \\Delta_t expressed in years, and rate r_t for this period being DF(0, t)=\\frac{1}{(1+r_t)^{\\Delta_t}}, the forward rate can be expressed in terms of discount factors: : r_{1,2}=\\left(\\frac{DF(0, t_1)}{DF(0, t_2)}\\right)^{1/(t_2-t_1)}-1 ===Continuously compounded rate=== :EQUATION\u2192 e^{{(r}_2\\ast t_2)}=e^{{(r}_1\\ast t_1)}\\ast\\ e^{\\left(r_{1,2}\\ast\\left(t_2-t_1\\right)\\right)} Solving for r_{1,2} yields: :STEP 1\u2192 e^{{(r}_2\\ast t_2)}=e^{{(r}_1\\ast t_1)+\\left(r_{1,2}\\ast\\left(t_2-t_1\\right)\\right)} :STEP 2\u2192 \\ln{\\left(e^{{(r}_2\\ast t_2)}\\right)}=\\ln{\\left(e^{{(r}_1\\ast t_1)+\\left(r_{1,2}\\ast\\left(t_2-t_1\\right)\\right)}\\right)} :STEP 3\u2192 {(r}_2\\ast\\ t_2)={(r}_1\\ast\\ t_1)+\\left(r_{1,2}\\ast\\left(t_2-t_1\\right)\\right) :STEP 4\u2192 r_{1,2}\\ast\\left(t_2-t_1\\right)={(r}_2\\ast\\ t_2)-{(r}_1\\ast\\ t_1) :STEP 5\u2192 r_{1,2}=\\frac{{(r}_2\\ast t_2)-{(r}_1\\ast t_1)}{t_2-t_1} The discount factor formula for period (0,t) \\Delta_t expressed in years, and rate r_t for this period being DF(0, t)=e^{-r_t\\,\\Delta_t}, the forward rate can be expressed in terms of discount factors: : r_{1,2} = \\frac{1}{t_2-t_1}(\\ln DF(0, t_1) - \\ln DF(0, t_2)) r_{1,2} is the forward rate between time t_1 and time t_2 , r_k is the zero-coupon yield for the time period (0, t_k) , (k = 1,2). == Related instruments == * Forward rate agreement * Floating rate note == See also == *Forward price *Spot rate == References == Category:Financial economics Category:Swaps (finance) Category:Fixed income analysis Category:Interest rates ",
