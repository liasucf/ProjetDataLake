Before World War II, it was a separate municipality with its own administrative area. ==History== The first written mention of Neratov dates from 1550, when its emergence coincided with a burgeoning glassworks, which arose in the late 15th century in connection with the German colonization of Orlick\u00e9 hory. Just prior to World War II, the alpine village had several hundred residents. After the Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia, which occurred after World War II in 1945-1946, the community almost disappeared. In 1989, Neratov had only two permanent residents.Doubravova, K., \"Church with glass roof (and interesting history too!)\", BCingUMagazine, April 20, 2018. In 1992, local priest Josef Such\u00e1r of Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, a Baroque church built between 1723 and 1733, founded the Neratov Association with the aim of restoring the village by concomitantly establishing a living community for mentally disabled adults from throughout the country. In 2016 the erstwhile Neratov section of municipal Barto\u0161ovice v Orlick\u00fdch hor\u00e1ch was home to about 60 permanent residents and was otherwise filled during winter and summer months with cottagers and vacationers. Neratov has become one of Czech Republic's three largest employers of mentally challenged persons. Key among sources of that employment are local gardening needs and the manufacture of baked goods shipped daily to Prague.Rambouskov\u00e1, M., \"V\u00e1no\u010dku, v\u011bnec i propisku vyr\u00e1b\u011bj\u00ed v Orlick\u00fdch hor\u00e1ch lid\u00e9 s hendikepem\", Mlad\u00e1 fronta DNES, December 22, 2016.
