    "text": "The Congress of Irish Unions was a confederation of trade unions in Ireland. ==History== Congress was one of the two governing bodies that emerged after the split in the Irish trade union body the Irish Trades Union Congress in 1945. The split developed under pressure from an anticipated fresh labour- state relationship, and alleged 'British domination in ITUC'. The CIU consisted entirely of Irish-based unions, and retained 77,500 workers, including the members of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union. The aim of the CIU was to create a trade union movement in Ireland which was Irish-based and nationalistic in outlook, in contrast to the more internationalist and socialist ITUC which had 146,000 members. The Government, contrary to expectation, did not legislate against the British unions, and from 1953 encouraged a d\u00e9tente between the two factions.Policy concertation and social partnership in Western Europe Stefan Berger, Hugh Compston 2002 The confederations amalgamated in 1959, becoming the Irish Congress of Trade Unions . ==Affiliates== On formation, the following unions affiliated to the Congress:Fergus A.
