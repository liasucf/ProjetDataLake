The play has a run time of about 85 minutes. The creation of Rose and the Rime followed the House Theatre's success with their original play Sparrow in the previous season. Rose and the Rime balances a fantastical plot with the human themes of greed, power, birth and age. === Synopsis === The Michigan town of Radio Falls has been trapped in a perpetual winter for an entire generation, cursed by the Rime Witch and her magic coin to an eternal blizzard that blocks every way in or out of the town. The last moment of warmth and passion in Radio Falls gave the town its only remaining child; a young girl named Rose, who is determined to save the town from the Rime Witch's curse. Her success, however, comes at a cost. The magic of the witch's coin can either nurture or destroy those who possess it, and Rose and her town begin to understand the true ramifications of power. == Original Team == === Original Cast === Prior to its first professional run, Rose and the Rime debuted at the DeWitt Center Main Stage at Hope College in Holland, Michigan in April 2007. The Hope College production was workshopped by guest artist Nathan Allen, the artistic director of The House Theatre of Chicago, who began work with Hope College students in 2006 in monthly workshops for actors, directors, theatre technicians and writers. His work with the students developed into Allen's residency at the college in March and April 2007, when the first run of the production was staged. The Hope College production of Rose and the Rime starred Rachel Wells as Rose, held a cast of around 25 students, and was directed by Allen. The first professional production of Rose and the Rime was done by The House Theatre of Chicago and staged at the Chopin Theatre. The original production ran from February 19, 2009 to April 11, 2009.First professional production of Rose and the Rime {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Character !!
