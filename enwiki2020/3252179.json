The stadium was built in 1939 and is able to hold 20,000 people. Est\u00e1dio dos Aflitos is owned by Clube N\u00e1utico Capibaribe. The stadium is named after El\u00e1dio de Barros Carvalho, who was N\u00e1utico's president fourteen times. Aflitos is nicknamed this way because it is located in Nossa Senhora dos Aflitos neighborhood. == History == In 1939, the stadium was built. The inaugural match was played on June 25 of that year, when N\u00e1utico beat Sport Recife 5-2. The first goal of the stadium was scored by N\u00e1utico's Wilson. On July 1, 1945, N\u00e1utico beat Flamengo de Recife 21-3. This was N\u00e1utico's largest win at Est\u00e1dio dos Aflitos. During the 1970s, the N\u00e1utico board of directors started a project to build a new 80,000 spectators stadium at Guabiraba neighborhood, to replace the outdated Est\u00e1dio dos Aflitos. However, the project failed, and the stadium was not built. During the early years of the 1980s, the architect H\u00e9lvio Polito developed a project to increase the stadium maximum capacity to 25,000 spectators with the construction of new bleachers. This project also failed. In May, 1995, during a meeting of the UniN\u00e1utico group, which is a N\u00e1utico supporting group, the architect M\u00facio Juc\u00e1 suggested the need to increase the stadium maximum capacity. In August of that year, a preliminary study about the technical viability of the stadium expansion and modernization was approved by the club's estate board. The first stadium improvement was the elevation of the internal walls of the gerais section from two meters to five meters. In 1996, the stadium reformation started, ending only on April 7, 2002, when it was reinaugurated. The stadium's attendance record currently stands at 28,022, set on December 4, 1997, when N\u00e1utico beat Am\u00e9rica Mineiro 1-0. == References == *Enciclop\u00e9dia do Futebol Brasileiro, Volume 2 - Lance, Rio de Janeiro: Aret\u00ea Editorial S/A, 2001. == External links == *Templos do Futebol *N\u00e1utico Official Website *N\u00e1uticonet Aflitos Aflitos Category:Sports venues in Recife ",
