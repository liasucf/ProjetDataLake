After 14 rounds, the two best teams in each group qualified, along with the best non-qualified team, while the team with the fewest points in each group was relegated, to dispute the Second level in the same year. Rio Grande, as a guest, would be relegated after that year regardless of placing. * Second phase: The five remaining teams joined the teams that participated in the Copa Sul-Minas (Internacional, Gr\u00eamio and Juventude), and played against each other twice, with the winners of each half qualifying to the Finals. The three best teams qualified to the next year's Copa Sul-Minas. * Finals: The Second phase round winners played in two matches to define the Champions. ==Championship== ===First phase=== ====Group 1==== ====Group 2==== ===Second phase=== ===First round=== ===Second round=== ===Final standings=== ===Finals=== ==References== Category:Campeonato Ga\u00facho seasons Ga\u00facho ",
