It is also the first not to feature long- time keyboardist and violinist Martin Powell, who became a live member of Anathema shortly afterwards, and full-time member of Cradle of Filth two years after the album was released.

Questions are asked in Cantonese and reversed, and singer Aaron Stainthorpe's replies can be heard.
