    "text": "National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) is an advisory committee consisting of multidisciplinary groups of experts responsible for providing information to national governments that is used to make evidence- based decisions regarding vaccine and immunization policy. The majority of industrialized and some developing countries have formally established advisory committees to guide immunization policies; other countries are working towards establishment of such committees. NITAG in each country may have different names, for example: Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in the United States, Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) in the United Kingdom, Standing Committee on Vaccination (St\u00e4ndige Impfkommission am Robert-Koch-Institut / STIKO) in Germany, Technical Committee of Vaccination (Comit\u00e9 Technique des Vaccinations / CTV) in France, National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) in Canada, and National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) in India. ==Purpose== The primary purpose of NITAG is to provide technical resources, supplying guidance and recommendations to national policy makers and programme managers to enable them to make evidence-based immunization related policy and program decisions. This may also include vaccination schedules regarding appropriate timing, dosage, and contraindications of vaccines. To ensure that the government gives proper attention to NITAG recommendations, NITAG usually report to high level officials of the Ministry of Health. NITAG are considered to be functional when they meet six defined process indicators agreed upon by the World Health Organization (WHO), which are: # having a legislative or administrative basis, # having formal terms of reference, # having at least five areas of expertise represented among its membership, # having at least one meeting per year, # distribution of the agenda and background documents at least one week prior to meetings, and # having mandatory disclosure of conflict of interests. As of January 2020, there are 151 countries reporting existence of NITAG and 134 countries with NITAG with all six WHO functionality criteria. ==Members== There are no fixed rules about the total number of NITAG members as it depends on local considerations such as the need for geographic representation, the size of the country, and the availability of resources. However, experience has shown that successful NITAG function with about 10\u201315 members. NITAG members typically consist of multidisciplinary experts and represent a broad range of skills and expertise from the following disciplines/areas: clinical medicine (paediatrics and adolescent medicine, adult medicine, geriatrics), epidemiologists, infectious diseases specialists, microbiologists, public health, immunology, vaccinology, immunization programme, health systems and delivery, clinical research and health economics. ==See also== * Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, NITAG in the United States * Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, NITAG in the United Kingdom * Standing Committee on Vaccination, NITAG in Germany ==References== ==External links== * NITAG Resource Center page Category:Vaccination-related organizations ",
