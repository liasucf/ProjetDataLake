    "text": "Nokia 8850 The Nokia 8850 is a mobile phone handset manufactured by Nokia. It was a light alloy-bodied enhanced version of Nokia 8210 model with slider protection of the keypad and white lighting of the keypad and screen. The 8850 is considered to be an un-repairable phone, thus resulting in very few active handsets in the market. Today it remains a collector's item. It also came in gold. It was introduced as a successor of an earlier model, the chrome phone Nokia 8810. It was succeeded by the Nokia 8910, which was released in 2002. ==Memory== The phone's memory can store up to 250 names and 50 calendar notes. SMS messages can only be stored on the SIM card. ==Call management== The phone has a speed dial feature in which the user can assign a name to 8 of the keys of the keypad. Voice dialing can also be used by assigning up to 8 voice tags to names. Dialed, received and missed calls are all logged. Contacts can be added to one of five groups that can have different logos and ringtones. ==Messaging== The phone uses SMS (Short Message Service) with T9 predictive text input, with support for major European languages. Asian version firmware features PinYin text input which enables Chinese words to be typed and sent. Messages can be up to 160 characters long. Compatible phones can send and receive picture messaging in Nokia standard Smart Messaging, not in later (universal) EMS. It could receive network operator logos and ringtones (up to five). ==Wireless transfer== The phone features an infrared port on the lower left side which can be used to communicate with a compatible PC. As well as this, the infrared port can also be used to transfer names and phone numbers between compatible phones an addition to business card sending and receiving. Data is transferred at 9.6 kilobits per second (CSD). ==Other specifications== The phone weighs 91 g (with a lithium battery) and had dimension of 100x44x17 mm.
