It is alleged to be near the place where Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado gave up his search for the seven cities of gold and turned around to return to Mexico. Coronado Heights is one of a chain of seven sandstone bluffs in the Dakota Formation and rises approximately 300 feet. ==History== In 1915, a professor at Bethany College in Lindsborg found chain mail from Spanish armor at the Sharps Creek site, an Indian village excavation site a few miles southwest of the hill, and another Bethany College professor promoted the name of Coronado Heights for the hill. In 1920, the first road was built up the hill, known as Swensson Drive, with a footpath known as Olsson Trail. In 1936, a stone shelter resembling a castle was built on top of the hill as a project of the Works Progress Administration. In 1988, a sculpture by John Whitfield was placed half-way up the hill with the inscription \"Coronado Heights 'A Place to Share'\". The hill is now Coronado Heights Park, owned by the Smoky Valley Historical Association. It is possible to see for miles from the summit, and wildflowers bloom on the hill in spring and summer. In summer, there are many prairie racerunners around the castle. ==Directions== In Lindsborg, go west on Swensson Ave to 13th Ave (aka Coronado Ave), go north 2 miles to Winchester Rd (aka Coronado Heights Rd), go west 1 mile to corner of 12th Ave, turn north into Coronado Heights Park, go over 1/4 mile to Castle.Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) details for Coronado Heights Park; United States Geological Survey (USGS); October 13, 1978. ==References== ==External links== * Coronado Heights Park * Ground broken for Coronado Heights renovation work; $150K project - The Hutchinson News Category:Works Progress Administration in Kansas Category:Parks in Kansas Category:Protected areas of Saline County, Kansas Category:Colonial United States (Spanish) Category:Pre-statehood history of Kansas ",
