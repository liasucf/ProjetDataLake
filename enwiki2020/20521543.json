The death of Laura's grandmother was the inspiration for the song. It talks about a longing for a person. The music talks about things that were not said and old memories. ==Music video== The music video was filmed in Santa Monica and in West Hills, California in August 2008. Directed by Alessandro D'Alatri and starring former contestant on Survivor: Cook Island Oscar Lusth and fashion model Krystal Davidsohn, the video shows how difficult it is for a soldier to return to every day life.
