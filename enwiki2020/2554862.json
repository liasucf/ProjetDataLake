    "text": "Waseley Hills Country Park is a Country Park and Local Nature Reserve owned and managed by Worcestershire County Council's Countryside Service. It consists of rolling open hills with old hedgerows, pastures and small pockets of woodland with panoramic views over Worcestershire, England. It is just south-west of Birmingham, close to Junction 4 of the M5 Motorway, from which it is signposted. The North Worcestershire Path and Illey Way long-distance paths run through the park. The park contains the source of the River Rea. The hills form part of the watershed between the Rea valley and that of the river Salwarpe, and thus between the catchments of the rivers Trent and Severn. According to the Worcestershire County Council, the elevation reaches a maximum of 998 feet (304 metres). ==Facilities== The park has an information centre, a meeting room and caf\u00e9, all located in a timber-framed threshing barn, which originally stood at Lower Smite Farm in Hindlip. Other facilities include a play area and an orienteering course. ==The name== The name may be derived from \"Waer\" (sheep) and \"ley\" (field), but the first element could be \"weardsetl\" (watchplace). If it is the latter, it was one of a chain of four such watchplaces along the northern boundary of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of the Hwicce, along with Wast Hills in Alvechurch, Wassell Grove to the east of Wychbury Hill in Hagley, and Wassell Wood at the southern end of Shatterford Hill at Trimpley. ==Views== {| | View of Waseley Hills Country Park | View of Waseley Hills Country Park | View of Waseley Hills Country Park |} ==External links== * Official website * Visitor Guide ==References== Category:Country parks in Worcestershire Category:Local Nature Reserves in Worcestershire ",
