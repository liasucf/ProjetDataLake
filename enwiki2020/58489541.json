    "text": "Martin Maxwell Fleming Luckie (30 January 1868 \u2013 3 July 1951) was a New Zealand cricketer who played two matches of first-class cricket 29 years apart \u2013 one in 1891 and the other in 1920. He became a prominent cricket administrator and a city councillor in Wellington. He was twice Deputy-Mayor: from 1929 to 1931 and again from 1936 to 1947. ==Biography== ===Early life and career=== Luckie was born on 30 January 1868 in Nelson. He worked as a barrister and solicitor in Wellington. ===Cricket career=== Luckie played first-class cricket for Wellington in 1891 and 1920. He was primarily a left- arm slow bowler. He played lower grade cricket when his senior days were over and did not retire from active play until he was 70 years old. He later served as President of the Wellington Cricket Association. The Wellington City Council named Martin Luckie Park after him which houses playing fields for both cricket and soccer.Wisden 1952, p. 958. ===Local politics=== Luckie served two separate terms as a Wellington city councillor. In 1913 he won a seat on the Council on a Citizens' League ticket which he was to hold until 1931 when he did not seek re-election as a councillor. That year he stood for Mayor of Wellington as an independent against Thomas Hislop. He polled well but lost. In 1933 he made a return to local-body politics and spent another spell on the council until he retired in 1947. He stood for parliament as the Reform Party's candidate for the seat of Wellington South in the 1928 general election. He came runner-up to Labour's Robert McKeen who was likewise a city councillor. ===Later life and death=== In the 1948 Birthday Honours he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. Luckie died in Wellington on 3 July 1951. ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== * * Category:1868 births Category:1951 deaths Category:People educated at Wellington College (New Zealand) Category:Wellington cricketers Category:New Zealand cricketers Category:Cricketers from Nelson, New Zealand Category:New Zealand cricket administrators Category:New Zealand lawyers Category:New Zealand Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:Wellington City Councillors Category:Deputy Mayors of Wellington Category:Wellington Harbour Board members Category:Wellington Hospital Board members Category:Reform Party (New Zealand) politicians Category:Unsuccessful candidates in the 1928 New Zealand general election Category:New Zealand sportsperson-politicians ",
