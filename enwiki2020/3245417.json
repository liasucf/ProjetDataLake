    "text": "Camphene, the chemical, not to be confused with camphine, the burning fluid lamp fuel. Camphene is a bicyclic monoterpene. It is nearly insoluble in water, but very soluble in common organic solvents. It volatilizes readily at room temperature and has a pungent smell. It is a minor constituent of many essential oils such as turpentine, cypress oil, camphor oil, citronella oil, neroli, ginger oil, and valerian. It is produced industrially by catalytic isomerization of the more common alpha-pinene. Camphene is used in the preparation of fragrances and as a food additive for flavoring. == References== Category:Alkene derivatives Category:Perfume ingredients Category:Flavors Category:Monoterpenes Category:Bicyclic compounds Category:Cyclopentanes ",
