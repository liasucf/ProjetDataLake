Such woods often have a higher density of leisure facilities like play parks, restaurants and cafes, bridleways, cycle paths and footpaths. Unlike an urban forest, which is located largely or entirely within an urban area and may be privately owned, a municipal forest is publicly owned and may well be outside the city or town to which it belongs. Most urban forests will be municipal forests, but many municipal forests are non-urban. == Europe == === Germany === In Germany municipal forests are usually corporate forests in accordance with Section 3 of the Federal Forest Act (\u00a7 3 Bundeswaldgesetz). Among the best known municipal forests in Germany are the Tiergarten (210 ha) in Berlin, the Berlin City Forest (28,500 ha) which includes the Grunewald (ca. 3,000 ha) and K\u00f6penick Forest (ca. 6,500 ha), the Frankfurt City Forest (3,866 ha), the Dresden Heath (6,133 ha) and the Rostock Heath (6,004 ha), which are some of the largest in the world. The Duisburg City Forest, together with the Broich- Speldorf Forest in M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr, the Sportpark Duisburg and the Duisburg Huckinger Mark form a contiguous forest area of about 3,000 ha. The Leipzig Riverside Forest is one of the largest surviving riparian forests in Central Europe. ==== List of municipal forests in Germany ==== * Berlin City Forest (28,500 ha) with Grunewald, K\u00f6penick Forest and other woodland areas in and around Berlin * Brilon Municipal Forest (7,750 ha) * Baden-Baden, Municipal Forest (ca. 7,500 ha)Landesarchivdirektion Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Stadt Baden-Baden (publ.): Der Stadtkreis Baden-Baden.
