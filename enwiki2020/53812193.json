    "text": "Ieronim \u0218erbu (pen name of Afon Herz Erick; December 2, 1911 \u2013 December 8, 1972) was a Romanian prose writer. Born into a Jewish family in Boto\u0219ani, his parents were Avram Moise Erick and his wife Frieda Ruhla (n\u00e9e Sigal). He attended Gheorghe Laz\u0103r High School in the national capital Bucharest. From 1932 to 1943, he was a participant in the literary circle surrounding Sbur\u0103torul magazine. His first published work appeared in 1932 in Discobolul, a magazine he founded with Dan Petra\u0219incu. He also wrote for Azi, Lumea, Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103, Revista Funda\u021biilor Regale and Gazeta literar\u0103, early on using the pen name Aron Ciuntu. \u0218erbu's first book was the 1940 short story collection Dincolo de triste\u021be. Two further story collections followed: Oamenii viseaz\u0103 p\u00e2ine (1945) and Vi\u021belul de aur (1949), as well as the novels R\u0103d\u0103cinile bucuriei (1954) and Podul amintirilor (1963). An interesting memoir, Vitrina cu amintiri, appeared posthumously in 1973. His articles on literary themes were collected as Itinerarii critice (1971). \u0218erbu's early prose was analytical; after 1945 and the country's turn toward socialist realism, he adopted social and ethical themes. Despite rewriting texts subjected to various pressures, \u0218erbu did not manage to produce an artistically fulfilled body of work.Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic\u021bionarul biografic al literaturii rom\u00e2ne, vol.
