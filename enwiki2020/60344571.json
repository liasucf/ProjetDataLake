Participation was not compulsory. 22 of 30 participated this season. The competition consisted of five rounds. In the first, second and third round each tie was played as a single leg and was held at the home ground of one of the two teams, according to the draw results. Each tie winner was qualifying for the next round. If a match was drawn, extra time was following. If extra time was drawn, there was a replay at the ground of the team who were away for the first game. If the rematch was also drawn, then extra time was following and if the match remained drawn after extra time the winner was decided by penalty shoot-out. The fourth round was played in a two-legged format, each team playing a home and an away match against their opponent. The team which scored more goals on aggregate was qualifying for the next round. If the two teams scored the same number of goals on aggregate, then the team which scored more goals away from home was advancing to the next round. If both teams had scored the same number of home and away goals, then extra time was following after the end of the second leg match. If during the extra thirty minutes both teams had managed to score, but they had scored the same number of goals, then the team who scored the away goals was advancing to the next round (i.e. the team which was playing away).
