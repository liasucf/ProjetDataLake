In the Fallas of Valencia, the plant\u00e1 takes place on March 15, when all the Falla monuments must be positioned correctly. The reason is that the jury appointed by the Central Fallera committee has to go to the next day to assess the falla. Formerly, the plant\u00e0 began and ended the same day but, due to the complexity of the monuments and the fact that the makers of Fallas are responsible for several Fallas monuments at the same time, it usually begins a few days before. The burning of the Falla or crem\u00e1 is carried out four days later, on the night of March 19. In the Bonfires of Saint John which are celebrated in the city of Alicante, the plant\u00e1 takes place on June 20. As in Valencia, the next day the jury visits each bonfire before later awarding the prizes in each category. The crem\u00e1 also takes place four days later, on the night of June 24 to 25. ==External links== *The plant\u00e1 \u2013 Fallas of Valencia *What are the Bonfires? \u2013 Official website of the Federation of Bonfires of Saint John *Everything about the plant\u00e1 *Plant\u00e0 2011 Category:Traditions involving fire Category:Valencian culture Category:Festivals in Spain Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Falles ",
