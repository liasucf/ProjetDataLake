    "text": "Thomas \"Tom\" Aguiyi-Ironsi is a career diplomat and former Defence Minister of Nigeria. He is the son of former military leader Major General Johnson Aguiyi- Ironsi, and was the ambassador to Togo before former President Olusegun Obasanjo appointed him to succeed Roland Oritsejafor as Defence Minister. Aguiyi-Ironsi is from Umuahia, Abia State. While Aguiyi-Ironsi was ambassador to Togo, the choices to replace the outgoing Foreign Minister, Ngozi Okonjo- Iweala, were reportedly narrowed down to him and Joy Ogwu. However, after Obasanjo fired Oritsejafor, Aguiyi-Ironsi received the job of Defence Minister while Ogwu became foreign minister. The two were sworn in on August 30, 2006. On January 24, 2007, Aguiyi-Ironsi announced that Nigeria would send a battalion of peacekeeping troops to Somalia. ==References== ==External links== *April elections, a big challenge - Military, Nigerian Tribune Category:Defence ministers of Nigeria Category:Ambassadors of Nigeria to Togo Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
