The Orang Laut live and travel in their boats on the sea. They made their living from fishing and collecting sea products. Another Malay term for them, Orang Selat (literally \"Straits people\"), was brought into European languages as Celates. ==Distribution== Regions inhabited by peoples usually known as \"Sea Nomads\". Broadly speaking, the term encompasses the numerous tribes and groups inhabiting the islands and estuaries in the Riau-Lingga archipelagos, the Pulau Tujuh Islands, the Batam Archipelago, and the coasts and offshore islands of eastern Sumatra, southern Malaysia Peninsula and Singapore.\"The Malay Peninsula and Archipelago 1511\u20131722\" The Encyclopedia of World History 2001; ==History== House barges of the Orang Laut off the coast of Jambi and Riau, Dutch East Indies, circa 1914-1921.
