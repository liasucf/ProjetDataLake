    "text": "GelreDome Stadium SBV Vitesse (Stichting Betaald Voetbal Vitesse), widely known as Vitesse Arnhem, or simply as Vitesse (), is a Dutch professional football club located in the municipality of Arnhem, in the province of Gelderland. Established on 14 May 1892, Vitesse is one of the oldest professional football clubs in the Eredivisie. Since 1998, the club has played its home games at the GelreDome. Vitesse had its most successful period in the 1990s. Their best result in the Eredivisie was third place in 1997\u201398. They won the KNVB Cup in 2017 and also reached the final in 1912, 1927 and 1990. Throughout the years, Vitesse established itself as a stepping stone for future world class players like Raimond van der Gouw, Philip Cocu, Roy Makaay, Sander Westerveld, Nikos Machlas, Pierre van Hooijdonk, Mahamadou Diarra, Nemanja Mati\u0107, Marco van Ginkel, Davy Pr\u00f6pper, Wilfried Bony, Bertrand Traor\u00e9, Mason Mount and Martin \u00d8degaard. ==History== Vitesse's first squad in 1896. Vitesse's first squad in 1913. Against AFC Ajax in the 1970 Dutch Cup match. Nicky Hofs played for Vitesse 194 matches. He was the cousin of Bennie Hofs and Henk Hofs. Wilfried Bony was awarded the Golden Shoe for the best player in the Netherlands. Vitesse, founded in 1892, are the 2nd oldest professional football club still in existence in the Netherlands, after Sparta Rotterdam who were formed in 1888. The roots of Vitesse actually pre-dated Sparta by a year as in 1887, a club with the name \"Arnhemsche cricket- en voetbalvereeniging Vitesse\" was formed by a group of high school students who played their sport on the Rijnkade, overlooking the River Rhine in the city centre. Reluctant to choose a Latin or English name for the club as they felt those languages were too elitist, they picked the French word Vitesse, meaning \"speed\". In 1891 the club disbanded as they were no longer able to find anywhere suitable to play cricket after a Velodrome was built on their usual playing field in the Klarenbeek Park. The following year a group of wealthy students resurrected the sports club, this time with the name AVC (Arnhemse Voetbal en Cricketclub) Vitesse. In the summer they played cricket and in the winter football. In the end of 1892, Vitesse played its first real football match, and in 1894 Vitesse disbanded the cricket branch. In 1895 and 1896 Vitesse became champions of the Gelderland competition. From the foundation of the Dutch national football championship in 1898 until 1954, the title was decided through play-offs by a handful of clubs who had previously won their regional league. Vitesse lost the final of the national championship six times (1898, 1899, 1903, 1913, 1914 and 1915). In 1912, Vitesse reached the final of the Dutch Cup Tournament for the first time. Vitesse lost the final with 0\u20132 from HFC Haarlem. In this period Vitesse had top players, likes Willem Hesselink and Just G\u00f6bel. This players were also active in the Dutch national team. In 1914 John William Sutcliffe became the first foreign trainer. During World War II, Vitesse didn't play-official matches because playing football in the open air was forbidden. During the Battle of Arnhem, the residents of the city were forcibly evicted from their homes, allowing the Germans to turn the north bank of the Rhine into a heavily defended line. Residents were not allowed to return home without a permit and most did not return until after the war. The football field and clubhouse was completely destroyed. The damage was repaired in the years after the liberation. In 1984 it was decided to divide the professional and amateur sections of the club. The professional section was renamed SBV (Stichting Betaald Voetbal \u2013 \"Professional Football Foundation\") Vitesse whilst the amateur section became \"Vitesse 1892\", which lasted until they disbanded in 2009. From 1984, Karel Aalbers was the president of SBV Vitesse. Aalbers' goal was to bring Vitesse from the bottom of the Second League (Eerste divisie, now Jupiler League), the league in which the club originated, to the top 40 soccer clubs of Europe. He developed the basic idea for the 'Gelredome', a stadium with a sliding pitch that can be moved out of the building. Later, the same system was applied in Gelsenkirchen (Schalke 04) and in Japan. Events such as pop concerts can be held without damaging the grass. Gelredome opened in 1998. It has a roof that can be opened and closed. It is fully climate controlled as well. In the first season after the opening, Gelredome's attendance rose to 20,000, (from less than 8,000 in the old stadium). Vitesse made their debut in European competition in 1990. The club won their first match in the first round 1\u20130 over Derry City. The club remained financially sound through making notable profits on the transfer market. Players such as Roy Makaay, Sander Westerveld, Nikos Machlas, Glenn Helder and Philip Cocu were sold for large sums of money. Others came to occupy empty player positions, such as Mahamadou Diarra and Pierre van Hooijdonk. Vitesse finished in top 4 positions, made profits and showed a solid balance sheet in the final years of Aalbers' presidency. Also, the club became regular competitors in the UEFA Cup and in 1997\u20131998 finished third in the Eredivise, its record highest finish to date. Herbert Neumann was Vitesse's manager over most of these years (1992\u201395 and 1998\u201399), while star players included: Nikos Machlas, the first ever Vitesse player to win the European Golden Boot in 1998 when he scored 34 goals in a season; John van den Brom, who played 378 matches for Vitesse during this period scoring 110 goals from midfield; and Edward Sturing, who played 383 matches in defence for Vitesse from 1987 to 1998, as well as receiving 3 caps for the Netherlands national team. Additional stars included Dejan \u010curovi\u0107, who spent six years at Vitesse playing 109 matches as a striker, scoring 41 goals including the first goal in GelreDome. Meanwhile, Dutch forward Roy Makaay spent four years at Vitesse, scoring 42 goals in 109 matches between 1993 and 1997. Aalbers resigned on 15 February 2000, after the main sponsor, Nuon, threatened to pull the plug if he did not. Nuon, as a public utility company owned by local authorities, had trouble explaining why it invested heavily in Aalbers' ambitious plans. His successor was Jan Koning (former chief of Sara Lee/DE who resigned after four months). In a short period of time, Vitesse began to show negative financial results due to poor deals on the transfer market. The club survived numerous financial crises, such as the last one in 2008, when debts were bought off, under the threat of bankruptcy. The club was in serious financial trouble, and in August 2010 its majority shareholder agreed to sell the club to the Georgian businessman Merab Jordania. There was rumors that this purchase was engineered by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. The club underwent a successful transformation into a modern, commercial sports organization and established itself as one of the dominant teams of the Eredivisie. On 1 July 2012, Fred Rutten signed a contract as the new manager of Vitesse, for the season 2012-13. Rutten left Vitesse after the season, finishing in 4th place. Wilfried Bony ended the season as the Eredivisie's top scorer with 31 goals in 30 matches and was awarded the Golden Shoe for the best player in the Netherlands. For the 2013\u201314 season, Vitesse appointed Peter Bosz as its new manager. In November 2013, Vitesse was top of the league in the Eredivisie for the first time since 2006. It was the first time since 2000 they'd been top of the league later than the first week. Halfway through the season, after 17 matches, Vitesse was the leader in the competition. Key players in the squad from this period included Davy Pr\u00f6pper, Christian Atsu and Bertrand Traor\u00e9. Vitesse announced on 13 June 2016 that Henk Fraser would replace Bosz at the start of the 2016\u201317 season. In his first full season, won the club first major trophy in its 125-year existence. Fraser defeating AZ by a score of 2\u22120 in the final of the KNVB Cup, with two goals from Ricky van Wolfswinkel. On 5 August 2017 Vitesse were beaten 1\u20131 (4\u20132 pen.) at De Kuip, Rotterdam in the Johan Cruyff Shield final by Feyenoord. In the 2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League group stage, Vitesse's opponents were Lazio Roma, OGC Nice and Zulte Waregem. Vitesse ultimately finished the group stage in fourth place. In October 2017, Guram Kashia wore a rainbow-striped captain's armband for Vitesse against Heracles Almelo in support of LGBT rights, leading to a backlash in his own country. In August 2018, he became the inaugural recipient of UEFA's #EqualGame award for his act. ==Stadium and training facilities== GelreDome with closed roof and pitch outside. thumb thumb The club plays its home games at the GelreDome stadium, with a capacity of 21,000 seats. The GelreDome was built to serve as a multifunctional stadium suited for sports, concerts and other events. It was the first football stadium in the world to have a retractable pitch, and, after the Amsterdam ArenA, the second stadium in Europe to have a sliding roof. The pitch is surrounded on each side by four covered all-seater stands, officially known as the Edward Sturing Stand (North), Charly Bosveld Stand (East), Theo Bos Stand (South) and Just G\u00f6bel Stand (West). The idea of building a multifunctional stadium, which had more than double the capacity of Vitesse's old Nieuw Monnikenhuize stadium, came from former Vitesse chairman Karel Aalbers. The ambitious chairman had been playing with the idea from as early as the late 1980s, but it took until 1996 and the prospect of the upcoming Euro 2000 championships for construction to finally begin. The GelreDome opened two years later, on 25 March 1998, with a league match between Vitesse and NAC Breda (4-1). Three international matches of the Dutch national football team were played in the stadium, the first one being on May 27, 1998: a friendly against Cameroon (0\u20131). The last one, played on April 26, 2000, was also a friendly: a 0\u20130 against Scotland. In 2019, the Netherlands women's national team, also played their an international (friendly) match at the stadium. Furthermore, the GelreDome was the location for three UEFA Euro 2000 group stage matches, as well as the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship tournament. Vitesse's training facilities are conducted at National Sports Centre Papendal, located in the outskirts of Arnhem in woodland surroundings. The training ground consists of several pitches, a number of which have an artificial turf pitch, and extensive training facilities, including a fitness centre. Papendal, a mere twelve kilometers north of the GelreDome, is not only the training facility for Vitesse's first team; the youth teams play their home matches here as well. Its main field has seating capacity for 500 people. The complex is situated in large wooded area, where the players can prepare in a peaceful and private environment, whilst not being too far from the hustle and bustle of Arnhem's city centre. Papendal is also the base for administration staff, scouting department and all club coaches. === Stadium history === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"background:#0D4C92; color:#fff;\" scope=\"col\"| Name !! style=\"background:#0D4C92; color:#fff;\" scope=\"col\"| Years |- |align=\"left\"|Rijnkade / Klarenbeek Park |1887\u20131891 |- |align=\"left\"|Molenbeekstraat |1892 |- |align=\"left\"|IJsclub Boulevard Heuvelink |1892\u20131894 |- |align=\"left\"|Bronbeek Royal Palace |1893 |- |align=\"left\"|Paasweide |1894\u20131896 |- |align=\"left\"|Klarenbeek Stadium |1896\u20131915 |- |align=\"left\"|Monnikenhuize |1915\u20131950 |- |align=\"left\"|Nieuw Monnikenhuize |1950\u20131997 |- |align=\"left\"|GelreDome |1998\u2013present |- |} ==Symbols== Vitesse's crest is composed of an eagle. Theo Bos ===Hertog=== Vitesse are well known for the American bald Eagle 'Hertog', which is released before the match and flies over the crowds. ===Anthems=== Vitesse fans are known to be creative and have various songs and chants during matches. Among the most important Vitesse songs are \"Geel en Zwart zijn onze kleuren\" by Emile Hartkamp, \"Ernems Trots\" by Joey Hartkamp, and \"Bouw mee aan een steengoed Vites!\" by Henk Bleker & Enka Harmonie. Vitesse opens its home matches with \"Whatever You Want\" by Status Quo, and after every home goal \"Bro Hymn\" by Pennywise is played. ===Mr Vitesse=== Theo Bos was raised in Arnhem and started playing football from an early age. He began his career at amateur club Sv Sempre Avanti and played from 1979 to 1983 in the academy of Vitesse. Manager Leen Looijen gave him his professional debut on 13 August 1983 against FC Wageningen; the match ended in a 3\u20130 victory for Vitesse. Bos spent his entire playing career for Vitesse, making a total 369 appearances in 14 seasons with his club. After his playing career, Bos worked at Vitesse as youth coach, assistant coach and manager. He is therefore considered to be Mister Vitesse. In 2012, the south stand of the GelreDome stadium was named the Theo Bos Stand. Bos died on 28 February 2013 of pancreatic cancer, aged forty-seven. Following his death, a special remembrance to honour Theo Bos took place at Gelredome with around 7,000 Vitesse supporters. As of the 2012\u201313 season, no player could wear the number 4 shirt at Vitesse after the club decided to retire the shirt out of respect for Theo Bos, \"the legendary number four\". Dutch defender Jan-Arie van der Heijden was the last player to wear the number. In November 2013, his biography Het is zoals het is ('It is what it is') was published, written by journalist Marcel van Roosmalen. In 2015, a statue of Bos was erected outside of the training complex at Papendal. ====Other club legends==== Below is a list with members who have established themselves as club legends: * Willem Hesselink * Just G\u00f6bel * Frans de Munck * Henk Bosveld * Karel Aalbers * Bert Jacobs * Edward Sturing * Frans Thijssen * John van den Brom * Martin Laamers * Raimond van der Gouw * Ben Hofs * Nicky Hofs * Ricky van Wolfswinkel * Theo Janssen * Marc van Hintum * Herman Veenendaal * Gerrit Horsten * Bo\u0161ko Bursa\u0107 * Dejan \u010curovi\u0107 * Nikos Machlas * Guram Kashia * Cor Guijt * Jan Snellenburg * Martin Esveld * Jan Dommering * Dik Herberts * Johnny Peters (Arnhem Veteran) * Wilf Oldham (Arnhem Veteran) ===Airborne-match=== The 'Airborne memorial' football match Around September there is an annual 'Airborne memorial' football match. During this annual Airborne-match the veterans of World War II will be honored. The Gelredome is decorated with Airborne flags, both outside and inside the stadium, and at halftime, 120 members of the Royal British Legion played the bagpipes with some other musical guests. Clubsymbol Hertog fly with the typical Airborne colours. The match is traditionally visited by veterans who were fighting in this battle, while a special shirt is worn by Vitesse. The club drop their normal striped black and yellow kit for this special match. Instead they wear claret and blue outfits, the same colours of the 1st Airborne Division, with a 1st Airborne 'winged horse' emblem also etched on the kit. Pictured on the collar sticker is the John Frost Bridge. These shirts are after the match auctioned for charity. In addition, Vitesse wearing a special captain's armband as a sign of recognition and respect for those who have fought for our freedom. In the 2014\u201315 and 2019\u201320 seasons, Vitesse played their away games in the same colours of the 1st Airborne Division. ===Colours and badge=== Originally, Vitesse played in white shirts with a blue sash from inception until 1900, paying hommage to the city's colours. At the turn of the century, player Reinhard Jan Christiaan baron van Pallandt offered to sponsor the club's shirts in exchange for Vitesse switching to his family colours of black and yellow. The board were quick to accept, noting that Vitesse, being one of the strongest team in the province of Gelderland, would be vindicated in playing in what could also be considered the province's colours (the flag of Gelderland is a tricolour in blue, yellow, and black). The first logo of Vitesse was a shield-shaped crest. In the middle there was a diagonal dividing line between the left yellow face and the right black box. In the left box, \"AVC Vitesse\" was diagonally written and in the right-hand side, \"1892 \", the club's founding year. The old logo was replaced in 1984, the year in which the roads of the BVO branch and the amateur branch separated. The amateur branch retained the logo with limited modification, SBV Vitesse got a new logo. The new logo of the BVO from 1984 is once again a shield-shaped figure, but it has straight lines at both the top and sides of the logo. At the top is with thick white uppercase Vitesse. Under the name is a double-headed eagle, with left and right half mirrored. Also the colors are mirrored, which is left yellow is black right and vice versa. This double-headed eagle can also be found in the coat of arms of Arnhem. In the middle of the logo is a football positioned. In the autumn of 2011, a new version of the logo was put into use; A total of 13 changes have been made. For example, the symmetry of the eagle was improved, the black outer edge replaced by a white and in the writing has been made thinner. The football has been altered in terms of appearance as a shadow effect is added and (if the context allows it) the year of creation as text EST. 1892 under the logo can be found.

Vitesse has two independent fan bodies. The Supportersvereniging Vitesse was founded in 1992 and currently consists of 3,000 members. They own a fan base within the GelreDome. The second one, Arnhem Ultras, serve a more specific purpose: to improve the atmosphere in the stadium. Besides the fan unions, there are several sets of fans who work together on tifo choreography, likes VIVO (Vitesse Is van Ons), De Aftrap and VAK 113 among others. Nowadays, Vitesse is supported by one fanatic side: The Theo Bos \u2013 South Stand. This stand is responsible for a big part of the atmosphere in the stadium. Vitesse have attracted around 18,000 people to Eredivisie matches on average in the last years. The record attendance stands at 26,600, achieved in a match against NAC Breda at 25 March 1998. Research showed that about 10,000 season ticket holders from Gelderland, with other significant groups coming from Utrecht, South Holland and North Rhine- Westphalia. The Vitesse Kids Club was founded by Vitesse in 1998 for children up to 16 years. Every year, the Vitesse Kids Club Day is organized, offering activities for members who are joined by the first team squad. During pre- season, Vitesse also holds an Open Day for people of all ages; the event gives the opportunity for sponsors and new player signings to be presented. Vitesse fans have established a close friendship with the supporters of FC Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti and RFC de Li\u00e8ge. Back in the days they had a friendship with Lierse SK till there was a big riot between them at a friendly match in 2011. ==Rivalries== ===Rivalry with N.E.C.=== NEC from Nijmegen are Vitesse's archrivals. The two clubs share a long history together and matches between the two clubs are called the Gelderse Derby (Derby of Gelderland). The rivalry between these two clubs goes beyond the football rivalry, it transcends into the city rivalry between the two largest cities of Gelderland: Nijmegen and Arnhem. This city rivalry began when these two cities first received their city rights. The two cities are just 20 kilometres apart, leading to an intense feeling of a cross-town rivalry, heightened by a feeling that local pride is at stake. The meeting between the two teams is still considered to be one of the biggest matches of the season. The inhabitants of these cities differ extremely in both attitudes and cultures which is clearly reflected on to the football pitch. Vitesse's style of play has long been a source of pride for the supporters, and one of irritation for the NEC fans. Since 1813, Arnhem has been the capital of Gelderland, historically based on finance and trade. Arnhem is perceived as an office city with modern buildings. Nijmegen, on the other hand, is predominantly a workers' city, with middle and high-income groups in the minority. People from Nijmegen see Arnhem as arrogant and lazy. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- ! ! Played ! Vitesse wins ! Draws ! N.E.C. wins ! Vitesse goals !

Nijmegen. The rivalry has existed for some time with De Graafschap and stems from various causes, such as the opposition between the large city (Arnhem) and the countryside (Doetinchem). Further teams who share a rivalry with Vitesse include FC Twente and AFC Ajax. Past rivalries include local derbies between Vitesse and clubs such as FC Wageningen, Go Ahead Eagles, Quick 1888, Arnhemse Boys and VV Rheden. However, the tension between the local sides lessened as the division of the clubs through playing in different leagues over time became greater. Years of not competing in the same league resulted in less frequent match-ups, until tensions finally settled between the local clubs. ==Players== ===Current squad=== https://www.vitesse.nl/nl/nieuws/detail/8572/rugnummers-seizoen-2020-2021 For recent transfers, see 2020\u201321 SBV Vitesse season. ===Players out on loan=== ===Retired numbers=== {| |style=\"text-align:right; padding-right:0.6em\"| 4 | Theo Bos, defender (1983\u201398), posthumous honour |- |style=\"text-align:right; padding-right:0.6em\"| 12 | Club Supporters (the 12th Man) |- |style=\"text- align:right; padding-right:0.6em\"| 13 | Vito, the official team mascot |} ===Reserve team (Under-21)=== ===Youth teams=== The club is famous, however, for its Youth Academy, which is rated with the maximum of 4 Stars by the KNVB. Many players in professional football in Europe have played at Vitesse in the past including Roy Makaay, Peter Bosz, Marco van Ginkel, Alexander B\u00fcttner, Theo Janssen, Erwin Mulder, Eloy Room, Ricky van Wolfswinkel, Davy Pr\u00f6pper, Piet Velthuizen, Martin Laamers, Nicky Hofs, Mitchell van Bergen and Stijn Schaars. All youth teams will train and play their matches at Papendal. The Vitesse Academy comprises age-group teams ranging from U8's up to the flagship U19's. The youngest players are scouted at amateur clubs in the direct surroundings of Arnhem. For the age of twelve and older the academy extends its scouting area, mainly to the remaining part of the Netherlands and Germany. In Vitesse's youth efficient and qualified training is done by full- time coaches and organized by further employees looking after the administration. Goal of the sporting education is to train the youths from basic to development to performance levels, for them to fulfil the sportive and non sportive demands of professional football. ==List of Vitesse coaches== *No official coach (1887\u20131914) * Edgar Chadwick (1914) * John William Sutcliffe (1914\u20131915) * James McPherson (1919\u20131920) * Charles Griffith (1920\u20131922) * Jan van Dort & Bram Evers (1922\u20131923) * Jan van Dort (1923\u20131924) * Bob Jefferson (1924\u20131927 * Heinrich Schwarz (1927\u20131936) * Joop Damst\u00e9 (1936) * Gerrit van Wijhe (1936\u20131938) * Gerrit Horsten (1938\u20131946) * George Roper (1946\u20131947) * Arie van der Wel (1948\u20131949) * Gerrit Horsten (interim) (1949) * Jan Zonnenberg (1949\u20131954) * Joseph Gruber (1954\u20131957) * Louis Pastoors (1957\u20131960) * Branko Vidovi\u0107 (1960\u20131962) * Jan Zonnenberg (1962\u20131964) * Joseph Gruber (1964\u20131966) * Frans de Munck (1966\u20131969) * Cor Brom (1969\u20131972) * Frans de Munck (1972\u20131974) * Nedeljko Bulatovi\u0107 (1974\u20131975) * Jan de Bouter (1975\u20131976) * Clemens Westerhof (interim) (1976) * Henk Wullems (1976\u20131982) * Leen Looijen (1982\u20131984) * Henk Hofstee (interim) (1984) * Clemens Westerhof (1984\u20131985) * Janusz Kowalik (1985\u20131986) * Hans Dorjee (1986\u20131987) * Niels Overweg (1987) * Bert Jacobs (1987\u20131992) * Herbert Neumann (1992\u20131995) * Ronald Spelbos (1995) * Frans Thijssen & Jan Jongbloed (interim) (1995\u20131996) * Leo Beenhakker (1996\u20131997) * Henk ten Cate (1997\u20131998) * Artur Jorge (1998) * Herbert Neumann (1998\u20131999) * Jan Jongbloed & Edward Sturing (interim) (1999\u20132000) * Ronald Koeman (2000\u20132001) * Edward Sturing (interim) (2001\u20132002) * Mike Snoei (2002\u20132003) * Edward Sturing (2003\u20132006) * Aad de Mos (2006\u20132008) * Hans Westerhof (2008) * Theo Bos (2009\u20132010) * Raimond van der Gouw & Hans van Arum (interim) (2010) * Albert Ferrer (2010\u20132011) * John van den Brom (2011\u20132012) * Fred Rutten (2012\u20132013) * Peter Bosz (2013\u20132016) * Rob Maas (2016) * Henk Fraser (2016\u20132018) * Edward Sturing (interim) (2018) * Leonid Slutsky (2018\u20132019) * Joseph Oosting (interim) (2019) * Edward Sturing (interim) (2020) * Thomas Letsch (2020\u2013) ==Board and staff== ===Corporate hierarchy=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background:#00f; color:#fff;\" scope=\"col\"|Position ! style=\"background:#00f; color:#fff;\" scope=\"col\"|Name |- |Owner|| Valeriy Oyf |- |Supervisory Board || Yevgeny Merkel (Chairman) Valeriy Oyf Henk Parren |- |Board of the Vitesse-Arnhem Foundation || Henk Parren (Chairman) Peter van Bussel Gerrit Jan Steenbergen |- |Advisory Council || Cor Guijt Bert Roetert Jan Snellenburg |- |Directors|| Pascal van Wijk (General director) Johannes Spors (Technical director) Peter Rovers (Marketing director) |- |Ambassadors|| Edward Sturing Marc van Hintum Theo Janssen Nicky Hofs |} ===Management hierarchy=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background:#00f; color:#fff;\" scope=\"col\"|Position ! style=\"background:#00f; color:#fff;\" scope=\"col\"|Staff |- |Technical director|| Johannes Spors |- |Head coach|| Thomas Letsch |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Assistant coach|| Jan Fiesser |- | Joseph Oosting |- |Goalkeeper coach|| Rein Baart |- |Fitness coach / Recovery trainer|| Jan van Norel |- |Video analyst|| Dennis van der Meulen |- |Head of academy|| Edward Sturing |- |Chief scout|| Marc van Hintum |- |Under-21 coach || Nicky Hofs |- |Under-18 coach || Theo Janssen |- |Under-16 coach || Patrick Ax |- |Under-15 coach || Richard van der Lee |- |Under-14 coach || Frank van Kouwen |- |Under-13 coach || Mitchel Jansen |- |Under-12 coach || Jos Dietrich |- |Under-11 coach || Bart van Rooijen |- |Under-10 coach || Ken van den Broek |} == Owners == After Karel Aalbers left, the financial situation for the club became dire. This downfall almost led Vitesse into bankruptcy in 2008, as they were not able to pay back loans given by their sponsor AFAB Geldservice B.V. Eventually the club arranged a deal that saw AFAB's owner, Maasbert Schouten, gain 100% of Vitesse's shares. Schouten immediately expressed his intent to sell the club, which opened the window for Merab Jordania to buy Vitesse. When Jordania, a former Dinamo Tbilisi player and owner, bought the team in 2010, Vitesse became the first Dutch club in history with a foreign owner. In 2013, Russian businessman Alexander Tsjigirinski bought the club from Jordania. In May 2018 a new acquisition took place at Vitesse. Valeriy Oyf became the new majority shareholder of Vitesse. The Russian oligarch, who was part of the Board of Directors of Vitesse from 2016, took over the shares of Tsjigirinski. ==Chairmens== The first chairman was Frans Dezentj\u00e9. Willem Hesselink was chairman of the club from 1917 to 1922 and was appointed honorary chairman in 1962. Although Vitesse's coaches have come from all over Europe, the club's chairmen have been mostly Dutch, with Merab Jordania and Yevgeny Merkel as the only exceptions. The name of Karel Aalbers is inseparably linked to Vitesse. Although a club's success is never the work of a single man, nonetheless, the former chairman's part in the sportive and professional growth of Vitesse may be labelled as truly exceptional. Karel Aalbers handled the chairman's gavel from 1984 to 2000. * Frans Dezentj\u00e9, 1982 * Dick Couv\u00e9\u00e9, 1892\u20131993 * Siegfried Leopold, 1893 * Fons Donkers, 1893\u20131895 * Chris Engelberts, 1895\u20131909 * Johan Caderius van Veen, 1902\u20131906 * Lodewijk Suringa, 1906\u20131908 * Jan F.

It plays its home matches at Papendal and it is coached by Joseph Oosting. The team is composed mostly of professional footballers, who are often recent graduates from the highest youth level (Vitesse U19) serving their first professional contract as a reserve, or players who are otherwise unable to play in the first team. ====Honours==== The team's honours: * Derde Divisie ** Champions: 2018 * Beloften Eredivisie ** Champions: 1993, 2015 * KNVB Reserve Cup ** Winners: 1998, 2002, 2011 * KNVB District (South) ** Champions: 1992, 1993 * KNVB District Cup (East) ** Winners: 1990 ===Amateur team=== In 1984 it was decided to divide the professional and amateur sections of the club. The professional section was renamed SBV (Stichting Betaald Voetbal \u2013 \"Professional Football Foundation\") Vitesse whilst the amateur section became \"(AVC) Vitesse 1892\", who played their home matches at the Sportcomplex Valkenhuizen. In total, the club has won 5 trophies; one Derde Klasse title, one Vierde Klasse title, one Zesde Klasse title and two Arnhem Cups. On 2009, Vitesse 1892 was declared bankrupt. The amateur section has produced a number of professional players including Andy van der Meijde, Nicky Hofs, L\u00e9on Hese, Erwin van de Looi en Theo Janssen. ===Vitesse Legends=== Vitesse Legends are a beneficiary team that was initiated by Ben Snelders, Leo de Kleermaeker and Dik Herberts in the nineties, competing in at least one match a year, usually in the name of charity and/or to bid farewell to retiring former Vitesse players. The team is made up of various members of the Club van 100 of Vitesse who will come out of retirement for this match to face the current Vitesse squad. Past participants have included Theo Janssen, Marc van Hintum, Edward Sturing, Ruud Knol, Remco van der Schaaf, Nicky Hofs, Erwin van de Looi, Glenn Helder, Philip Cocu, John van den Brom, Theo Bos, Martin Laamers, Michael Dingsdag, Roberto Straal, Frans Thijssen, Dejan \u010curovi\u0107, Jhon van Beukering and Huub Loeffen. ==National team players== Willem Hesselink. A number of Vitesse players have represented the Dutch national team, the first official international being Willem Hesselink. He was one of the founders of Vitesse in 1892 at age 14. In 1905 he started in the first ever home match of the Netherlands national football team, a 4\u20130 victory against Belgium. Some historians attribute one of the goals scored to him.
