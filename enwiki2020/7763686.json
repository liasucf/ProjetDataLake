    "text": "\"Talk Shows on Mute\" is a song by the American alternative rock band Incubus. It was released as the second single from the band's 2004 album, A Crow Left of the Murder..., and peaked at #3 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart and #18 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. ==Background== The song has a mellow and stripped-down sound, with lyrics containing references to George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four and Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. Lead singer Brandon Boyd says the inspiration for the song came to him while watching a talk show on an airplane. \"I was on an airplane when a talk show began playing on the TVs. I decided to start narrating for the people, which is a really great game if you're ever bored enough. I realized a time will probably come when television will watch us if we're watching it, if that hasn't already happened, figuratively or literally. It sounded like some sort of pseudo-Big Brother nightmare, so I wrote it down.\" ==Music video== The song's music video was directed by Floria Sigismondi, who also directed the band's \"Megalomaniac\" video. The video alludes to another George Orwell novel, Animal Farm. It depicts a world where animals have taken over, and the members of Incubus are shown on a talk show demonstrating \"stupid human trix\". ==Track listing== US/EU CD Single # Talk Shows On Mute # Wish You Were Here (Live In Osaka, Japan) # Talk Shows On Mute (Live In Osaka, Japan) # Hello - BBC Radio 1 Version Yellow 7\" *Side A # Talk Shows On Mute # Here In My Room - BBC Radio 1 Version *Side B # Vitamin - Live \"Bootleg\" Version - Osaka, Japan # Hello - Live \"Bootleg\" Version - Osaka, Japan ==References== * Category:2004 singles Category:Incubus (band) songs Category:Music videos directed by Floria Sigismondi Category:Music based on Nineteen Eighty-Four Category:Song recordings produced by Brendan O'Brien (record producer) Category:Rock ballads Category:2004 songs Category:Immortal Records singles Category:Songs written by Brandon Boyd Category:Songs written by Mike Einziger Category:Songs written by Ben Kenney Category:Songs written by Chris Kilmore Category:Songs written by Jos\u00e9 Pasillas Category:Songs about television ",
