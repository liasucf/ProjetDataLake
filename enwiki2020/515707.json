Dell EMC sells data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics, cloud computing and other products and services that enable organizations to store, manage, protect, and analyze data. Dell EMC's target markets include large companies and small- and medium-sized businesses across various vertical markets. The company's stock (as EMC Corporation) was added to the New York Stock Exchange on April 6, 1986,EMC Corporation Announces Two-for-One Stock Split;Annual Meeting of Stockholders, Live Video Web, May 3, 2000, D&B; AllBusiness and was also listed on the S&P; 500 index. EMC was acquired by Dell in 2016; at that time, Forbes noted EMC's \"focus on developing and selling data storage and data management hardware and software and convincing its customers to buy its products independent of their other IT buying decisions\" based on \"best-of-breed.\" It was later renamed to Dell EMC. Dell uses the EMC name with some of its products. Pre-Dell EMC acquired Iomega in 2008; Dell EMC formed a partnership with Lenovo in 2013, named LenovoEMC that superseded and rebranded Iomega. ==History== Richard Egan, co-founder of EMC Corporation EMC, founded in 1979 by Richard Egan, Roger Marino & John Curly (the E, M & C in EMC), introduced its first 64-kilobyte (65,536 bytes) memory boards for the Prime Computer in 1981 and continued with the development of memory boards for other computer types. In the mid-1980s, the company expanded beyond memory to other computer data storage types and networked storage platforms. EMC began shipping its flagship product, the Symmetrix, in 1990. Symmetrix was the main reason for EMC's rapid growth in the 1990s, both in size and value, from a company valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars to a multi-billion dollar company.EMC Company Web site, July 19, 2000 \"EMC Reports 43% Growth in Storage Revenue, First $2 Billion Quarter\". In 2009 EMC signed a two-year deal to be the principal shirt sponsor for English Rugby Union club London Wasps in a deal worth \u00a31 Million. This was later extended until the end of the 2013 season. Michael Ruettgers joined EMC in 1988 and served as CEO from 1992 until January 2001. Under Ruettgers' leadership, EMC revenues grew from $120 million to nearly $9 billion 10 years later, and the company shifted its focus from memory boards to storage systems. Ruettgers was named one of BusinessWeeks \"World's Top 25 Executives\"; one of the \"Best Chief Executive Officers in America\" by Worth magazine; and one of Network Worlds \"25 Most Powerful People in Networking\". Some of EMC's growth was via acquisitions of small companies. ===Acquisition by Dell=== EMC Corporation logo prior to merger On October 12, 2015, Dell Inc. announced its intent to acquire EMC in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $67 billion, which has been considered the largest-ever acquisition in the technology sector. This would combine Dell's enterprise server, personal computer, and mobile businesses with EMC's enterprise storage business in a significant Vertical merger of IT giants. Dell would pay $24.05 per share of EMC, and $9.05 per share of tracking stock in VMware. On September 7, 2016, Dell Inc. completed the merger with EMC Corp., which involved the issuance of $45.9 billion in debt and $4.4 billion common stock. At the time, some analysts claimed that Dell's acquisition of the former Iomega could harm the LenovoEMC partnership. ==Products and services== In addition to those of the majority-owned Pivotal company, Dell EMC sells products and services, including products from other Dell Technologies companies, designed to allow IT departments to move to a cloud computing model and to analyze big data. LenovoEMC, formerly Iomega, sells storage products. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Product category !!
