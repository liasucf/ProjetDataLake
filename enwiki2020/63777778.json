    "text": "Sursaigh () is an island off North Uist in the Sound of Harris, Scotland. It lies northeast of the village of Lochmaddy and there are numerous nearby islands including Stromay, Sgarabhaigh and Tahay. The island has \"a patchy cover of glacial deposits.\" Airigh na h-Aon Oidhche (one-night shieling) is a ruined hut on the south side of the island. It is said that in the late 19th century a shepherd who was staying on the island was awakened by the sound of gulls and his frightened dog. Rushing outside he saw \"an enoromous cartwheel in the sky making a strange noise\". He fled the island and never returned. ==See also== * List of Outer Hebrides ==Footnotes== Category:Islands of the Sound of Harris Category:Uninhabited islands of the Outer Hebrides ",
