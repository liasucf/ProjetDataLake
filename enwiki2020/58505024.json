    "text": "Telefunken Blues is an album led by jazz drummer Kenny Clarke recorded in late 1954 and early 1955 and first released on the Savoy label.Savoy Records Catalog: 12000 series accessed September 17, 2018Discography of the Savoy/Regent and Associated labels accessed September 17, 2018 ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Jim Todd stated: \"Everyone's in good form on these two sessions from the mid-'50s. The earlier 1954 set, though, is the more interesting. It teams Modern Jazz Quartet alumni Kenny Clarke, Milt Jackson, and Percy Heath with West Coast beboppers ... The four tracks from the later 1955 date feature a familiar Savoy grouping of Count Basie band members ... Telefunken Blues is recommended for the set with Morgan, Benton, and Wiggins, although the session with the Count's men does offer several pleasures\". ==Track listing== All compositions by Ernie Wilkins except where noted # \"Strollin'\" (Kenny Clarke) \u2013 4:21 # \"Sonor\" (Gerald Wiggins, Clarke) \u2013 4:50 # \"Blue's Mood\" (Clarke) \u2013 4:17 # \"Skoot\" (Eddie Beal, Erroll Garner) \u2013 3:48 # \"Telefunken Blues\" \u2013 5:50 # \"Klook's Nook\" \u2013 5:09 # \"Baggin' the Blues\" \u2013 5:40 # \"Inhibitions\" \u2013 3:52 *Recorded November 1, 1954 in Hollywood, CA (tracks 1-4) & February 7, 1955 at Van Gelder Studio, Hackensack, NJ (tracks 5-8) ==Personnel== *Kenny Clarke \u2013 drums *Milt Jackson \u2013 vibraphone (tracks 1-4), piano (tracks 5-8) *Henry Coker \u2013 trombone (tracks 5-8) *Frank Morgan \u2013 alto saxophone (tracks 1-4) *Walter Benton \u2013 tenor saxophone (tracks 1-4) *Frank Wess \u2013 tenor saxophone, flute (tracks 5-8) *Charlie Fowlkes \u2013 baritone saxophone (tracks 5-8) *Gerald Wiggins \u2013 piano (tracks 1-4) *Percy Heath \u2013 bass (tracks 1-4) *Eddie Jones \u2013 bass (tracks 5-8) *Ernie Wilkins \u2013 arranger (tracks 5-8) ==References== Category:Savoy Records albums Category:Kenny Clarke albums Category:1955 albums Category:Albums produced by Ozzie Cadena Category:Albums recorded at Van Gelder Studio ",
