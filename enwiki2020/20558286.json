    "text": "The Forum of the Venetians (Forum dei Veneti, FdV) was a Venetist political party. It was founded in November 2008 by Diego Cancian, a member of the Regional Council of Veneto for North-East Project. Cancian decided to leave that party because he did not agree with the political line the party took after Giorgio Panto's death. In May 2009 Cancian joined the Sicilian-based Movement for the Autonomies, while in 2010 he unsuccessfully ran for re- election to the Regional Council in slate with The People of Freedom. ==External links== *Official website ==References== Category:Political parties in Veneto Category:Venetian nationalism Category:Political parties established in 2008 Category:Italian political party stubs ",
