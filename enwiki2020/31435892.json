    "text": "The DFV-Supercup (also known as Pokal des Deutschen Sportechos) was the super cup of East German football, played between the winners of the DDR-Oberliga and the FDGB-Pokal. ==History== It was originally planned to start in 1988, but was postponed as BFC Dynamo had won both competitions. An edition was played in 1989, with the Cup Winners BFC Dynamo beating Dynamo Dresden 4\u20131. The competition was not played in 1990 with German reunification underway, and a pan-German Deutschland Cup was played instead. In 1991, the winners of the last East German titles, Hansa Rostock, along with cup finalists Stahl Eisenh\u00fcttenstadt, entered the DFB- Supercup.http://www.rsssf.com/tablesd/ddrcuphist.html ==Teams== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
