    "text": "\"Honey I Need\" is a song written by Dick Taylor and first performed by the rock band Pretty Things in 1965. It was first published in 1966 and registered at number 13 in the UK Pretty Things guitarist Dick Taylor wrote the tune, along with a couple of friends who weren't in the band. == Personnel == * Phil May \u2013 vocal * Dick Taylor \u2013 lead guitar * Brian Pendleton \u2013 guitar * John Stax \u2013 bass guitar * Viv Prince \u2013 drums == Influence == The poppiest element of the song, and most likely the one that got it to climb the British hit parade, is the insistent, uplifting chorus, which is followed by a typically verging-on- undisciplined, raw bluesy guitar solo. May slightly changes the melody of the verse when he returns after the break, adding a little more urgency to a song that was already plenty propulsive. It was those kinds of little clever attentions to subtleties that belied the Pretty Things' image as crude musical louts, lifting them above most of the standard raw British R&B-derived; rock groups of the mid-'60s in originality. == Chart performance == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Chart (1965) !Peak position |- |UK Singles Chart |align=\"center:|13 |- |Australia Kent Music Report |align=\"center\"|54 |} == References == == External links == * Category:1965 singles Category:1965 songs Category:Pretty Things songs Category:Fontana Records singles Category:Rhythm and blues songs Category:British garage rock songs Category:Songs written by Dick Taylor ",
