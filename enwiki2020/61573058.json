The Scottish poet, James Montgomery, was a boyhood and lifelong friend of Halliday. At age fourteen, his father died and, as eldest son, he was left in charge of his small estate which Halliday managed for many years with the help of his younger brothers and sisters. ==Career== In 1790, Halliday went to Birmingham in England where he lived for six years and learned business. In 1796, he sailed to the United States as the representative for two large Birmingham steel manufacturing firms there, including one run by senior partner name William Cairns. Halliday was very successful in the U.S. and became partner in one of the firms, which was renamed Cairns, Freres, Halliday & Carmichael. He served as a director of the Greenwich Insurance Company, president of the Northern Dispensary (a hospital on Waverly Place and Christopher Street), chairman of the board of trustees of the Eighth Presbyterian Church in Greenwich Village. Halliday was elected a member of the Saint Andrew's Society of New York in 1797, a \"society instituted for the relief of indigent natives of Scotland, and their descendants.\" He served as manager from 1814 to 1815, second vice-president from 1815 to 1816, first vice-president from 1816 to 1821 and as president from 1823 to 1828. While Halliday was president, he led the effort to incorporate the Society in New York to better \"enable them to obtain the objects of their association.\" ==Personal life== In 1805, Halliday was married to Mary Cairns at Torr Estate in Castle Douglas. Mary was the daughter of Ann (n\u00e9e Humphreys) Cairns and Edward Cairns of Torr and Shirland Hall (in Birmingham), the senior partner in one of the Birmingham steel firms Halliday was associated with and son of William Cairns.
