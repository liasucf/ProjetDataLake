    "text": "Saliha () (born 1914 in Nebeur in El Kef, died 26 November 1958) was a Tunisian singer. Her birth name was Salouha Ben Ibrahim Ben Abdelhafidh. == Biography == Salouha Ben Ibrahim Ben Abdelhafidh, later known as Saliha or Sallouha, was born in 1914 in Nebeur. She appeared on stage for the first time in 1938. On the occasion of the inauguration of Radio Tunis, she sang at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre municipal de Tunis during a concert broadcast live on the radio. Then she crossed paths with Mustapha Sfar, founder of The Rachidia, who invited her to join the institution marked by the presence of Chafia Rochdi. There, the musicians Khema\u00efs Tarnane, Mohamed Triki and Salah El Mahdi composed a series of songs for her, the lyrics of which were written by poets belonging to Taht Essour. Right from the start, these songs were such hits that Abdelhamid Ben Aljia said \"Saliha and La Rachidia are one.\"\"Saliha et La Rachidia ne font plus qu'un.\" Saliha's rich repertoire, charismatic charm and deep voice earned her the appellation \"kawkab echarq ettounnisia\" from critics. She left her mark on Tunisian music and song during the first half of the 20th century. Freg Ghzeli (My friend left me), Khali Baddalni (My uncle dropped me), Zaama Yesafi Eddahr (Time does not forgive) and ya machkaya (The complainant), were all composed by Mohamed Triki, and are among his most famous songs. Years of glory left Sallouha exhausted. Her death in 1958, following an incurable disease, was a painful national event; 22,000 people formed the funeral procession in Sidi Yahia. == Discography == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Songs |- |Touness elyoum brat |- |Ya khdoud et-toffah |- |Om lahsan ghannat'Om lahsan ghannat |- |Mridh fani |- |A\u00e0\u00efoun soud |- |Ya khil salem |- |Men frag ghzali |- |Bakhnoug'Bakhnoug |- |Kif dar kass el hobb |- |Habbitha ma lgit menha manja |- |Na wejjemel frida |- |Sag naj\u00e0ek sag |- |A\u00e0ordhouni zouz sbaya |- |Nenni ahna mnam |- |Fel ghorba fenani'Fel ghorba fenani |- |Chargi gheda bezzine |- |M\u00e0a el \u00e0azzaba |- |Rabbi \u00e0atani kol chay bekmalou |- |Dar el falak |- |Ya khlila |- |Wada\u00e0ouni |- |Ya kha\u00efna |- |Hozt-al-baha |- |Yalli boodek dhaya\u00e0 fekri |- |Sag naj\u00e0ak ber-ranna |- |Hajr el Habib |- |Awtari-w-oudi |- |Ya laimi \u00e0azzine |- |Ghzali nafar |- |Mouhal kelmet ah |- |} == References == Category:1914 births Category:1958 deaths Category:Tunisian female singers ",
