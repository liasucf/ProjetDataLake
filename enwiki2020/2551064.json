    "text": "Roop County is a defunct county of Nevada. It was created as Lake County in 1861 as one of the original nine counties of Nevada. The name Lake County was chosen due to the many lakes in the area, including Honey Lake, Pyramid Lake, and Winnemucca Lake. ==History== In March 1861, Congress created the official Territory of Nevada, with the Honey Lake Valley and the area to its north included within its provisional bounds. When this occurred, the border between Nevada and California was poorly defined in Nevada's Organic Act. Later in 1861, Lake County was established in northwestern Nevada, creating a boundary dispute with California. In 1862 Lake County was renamed Roop County after Isaac Roop, governor of the unofficial \"Provisional Territorial Government of Nevada Territory,\" which had previously existed in the same area. Much of Roop County, including Susanville (which was named for Roop's daughter), was claimed by California as part of Plumas County. This has been called the Roop County War, the War of Injunctions, or the Sagebrush War. This resulted in the appointment of a joint California\u2013Nevada boundary survey, with Surveyor- General J.F. Houghton acting for the State of California and Butler Ives, for the Territory of Nevada. The final surveyors report, accepted by California on April 4, 1864, and by Nevada on February 7, 1865, proved that the Honey Lake area and virtually all the population of Roop County was in California. The California portion of Roop County became part of the newly created Lassen County, California, in 1864. The remainder was ceded to Washoe County, Nevada. == See also == * List of former United States counties * List of Nevada counties * Nataqua Territory == References == ==External links== * The Nevada Observer: History of Roop County * Nevada Association of Counties: Creation of Nevada's Counties Category:Former counties of the United States Category:1861 establishments in Nevada Territory Category:Populated places established in 1861 Category:1864 disestablishments in the United States Category:Populated places disestablished in 1864 ",
