    "text": "Les Ardentes is a Belgian multi-day electro-rock music festival which yearly takes place in Li\u00e8ge, in early July. The event is located in the Astrid Park in the Coronmeuse quarter, close to the city centre. Les Ardentes is organised ever since 2006, with Fabrice Lamproie and Ga\u00ebtan Servais as founders. The festival name is a French plural noun meaning \"The Burning\", a referral to the nickname of host city Li\u00e8ge, La cit\u00e9 ardente (\"The Burning City\"). Les Ardentes is one of the major festivals in the Meuse\u2013Rhine Euroregion (formed by parts of Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands). Every year the happening attracts more people, with over 25,000 spectators at its start and a record of 76,000 visitors in 2014. Since 2008, it is a four-day event whereas before it lasted three days. Les Ardentes has different stages on which the artists perform, the largest being situated in the centre of the park and others situated in the Halles des foires (\"fair halls\").
