Mazowiecka BK w 1938 == Beginnings == In early November 1918 in Krak\u00f3w, a group of officers of the dissolved 1st Legions Uhlan Regiment formed the so-called Squadron of Rotmistrz Jablonski. On November 17, the squadron, divided into three platoons, left its barracks at Rakowce near Krak\u00f3w, and traveled by train to Przemy\u015bl, where it merged with a local cavalry unit. The regiment then takes part in the Battle of Przemy\u015bl (1918), with its elements entering Lwow In late January 1919, the regiment was sent to Krasnik for rest. In March, it was sent to Pinczow, where it the so- called Radom Squadron and J\u0119drzej\u00f3w Squadron were merged with it. On February 19, 1919, Polish headquarters officially tasked Mariusz Zaruski with forming the regiment. Zaruski gathered cavalry squadrons from Krasnik, Pinczow and Kielce. All concentrated in Pinczow. On March 16, 1919, Rotmistrz Antoni Jablonski was named first commandant of the regiment, and on April 7, 1919, following the order of J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, the regiment was sent by rail to Wilno. Uhlans of the 11th regiment captured Wilno on April 20, 1919, after heavy fighting against the Red Army. Two days later, the regiment marched towards Landwarow, to cover the Polish-Lithuanian demarcation line. In August 1919, the regiment fought against the Soviets in Belarus. On August 20, together with 1st Chevau-leger Regiment, it captured Glebokie. By late August, it covered the line of the Daugava, repelling several Soviet counterattacks and remaining there until spring 1920. In May 1920, Soviet counteroffensive in Belarus began. Outnumbered and outgunned Polish units were forced to retreat. On June 20, the regiment was loaded on a train at the rail station of Dukszty, and via Wilno-Baranowicze-Brzesc-Kowel traveled to Rowne, reaching its destination on June 21. In Volhynia, Polish uhlans faced the assault of 1st Cavalry Army (Soviet Union), commanded by Semyon Budyonny. The regiment defended the line of the Horyn River, capturing Korzec on July 1. In mid-July it retreated westwards, fighting the enemy. On August 1, 1920, it clashed with Soviet cavalry near Mikolajow.
