    "text": "==NCHA Triple Crown== The NCHA Triple Crown comprises three major cutting horse aged events beginning with the NCHA Futurity for 3-year-olds, followed by the NCHA Derby for 4-year-olds, and NCHA Super Stakes for 5-year-olds. All three events are held at the Will Rogers Coliseum in Ft. Worth, Texas. The culmination of prize money for all three events in 2008 was in excess of $10 Million, surpassing that of the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. There have been only 3 NCHA Open Division Triple Crown winners since the inception of the NCHA in 1946: *Smart Little Lena ridden by Bill Freeman (1982-1983) *Docs Okie Quixote ridden by Joe Heim (1983-1984) *Chiquita Pistol and Tag Rice (2002-2003) In August 2016, Armando Costa Neto riding Watch Me Whip became the first Non-Pro Triple Crown winner. ==References== ==External links== Armando Costa Neto Makes Historic Win in Non Pro Derby Final of 2016 NCHA Summer Spectacular, Video West, August 7, 2016 Category:National Cutting Horse Association ",
