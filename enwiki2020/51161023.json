    "text": "Andrew Oscar J\u00e1szi (; March 1, 1917 \u2013 June 22, 1998) was a Hungarian-born philosopher and literary scholar. He taught as professor of German at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1948 to 1984. == Biography == J\u00e1szi was born in Budapest into a distinguished family of assimilated Jews. His father, Oszk\u00e1r J\u00e1szi, was a sociologist, historian, and politician who served as Minister of Nationalities in Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi's cabinet during the Hungarian Democratic Republic of 1918\u201319 before moving to the United States in 1925 to join the faculty of Oberlin College as Professor of Political Science. Andrew J\u00e1szi\u2019s mother, Anna Lesznai, was a well-known artist and writer. After his parents\u2019 divorce in 1919, J\u00e1szi moved with his mother and brother George (1915\u20131992) to Vienna, where he received his primary school education. This was followed by a return to Budapest in 1931 and enrollment in the Deutsche Oberschule (\u201cGerman High School\u201d).Hinrich Seeba, \"Andrew O. J\u00e1szi,\" Internationales Germanisten-Lexikon 1800\u20131950, 3 vol., Christoph K\u00f6nig, ed. (Berlin, New York: de Gruyter 2003), pp. 841-842. As was typical of those of his background, he was raised bilingual in Hungarian and German, though German remained the primary language of his intellectual work throughout his life. He finished high school in 1935, then came to the United States to join his father at Oberlin where he earned his B.A. in German in 1938. From there, he went to Harvard to begin his doctoral studies. Drafted into the U.S. army in 1942, he was dispatched to serve as an intelligence officer with the occupation forces in Germany.Seeba, pp. 841-842. J\u00e1szi completed his Ph.D. in German at Harvard in 1947. He was hired the following year by the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught classes in German literature until his retirement in 1984. He died at his home in Oakland, California, in 1998. == Academic career == J\u00e1szi enjoyed a campus-wide reputation as an outstanding teacher. Recognized as \u201cone of the most respected critics of German literature in the United States\u201d as well as \u201cone of the most beloved professors of the University,\u201dSandra Larson, \"Faculty Profile: Andrew Jaszi of the German Department burns with an idealism that purifies,\" California Monthly, November 1966, pp. 18-19. he developed an original style of teaching that was rigorous yet also accessible to the non-specialist. Methodologically, he favored what has been termed \u201can ontological approach\u201d;Larson, 18. pedagogically, he incorporated Socratic dialogue and what, for lack of a better word, may be called \u201clecture.\u201d\"Some say a J\u00e1szi lecture is like a poem, others a prayer. His manner while lecturing often resembles a person protected from external reality by a trance-like shell. The intensity of his concentration is felt by everyone in the room.\" Larson, 18-19. In all this, he brought to his classes, and was capable of eliciting from his students, an exceptional degree of personal engagement. Among his former students who have credited his influence are W. Michael Blumenthal,W. Michael Blumenthal, In achtzig Jahren um die Welt. Mein Leben. (Berlin: Ullstein Buchverlage, 2012), p. 195. U.S. Secretary of Treasury under President Jimmy Carter (and later, Director of the Jewish Museum, Berlin); and philosopher and Jungian theorist Wolfgang Giegerich.Wolfgang Giegerich, \"Uma Conversa com Wolfgang Gieguerich,\" Cadernos Junguianos (Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Junguiana do Brasil), Issue 1 (2015). p. 59ff. J\u00e1szi was a well-known authority on Goethe. Other authors he specialized in were Kleist, ETA Hoffmann, Rilke, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, and Kafka. His scholarly research also extended more broadly, leading to courses on nineteenth- and twentieth-century poetry and drama, fairy tales, and psychological approaches to literature (especially Jung). In addition to teaching at Berkeley, J\u00e1szi held positions as visiting professor at the University of Washington (1959\u201360), Harvard (1960), University of Colorado (1963) and University of Michigan (1965). In recognition of his achievements, he was awarded the Berkeley Citation, one of the campus\u2019s highest honors, in 1984. == Philosophical work == Alongside his career as Professor of German Literature, J\u00e1szi spent much of his adult life working on a massive philosophical project dealing with fundamental questions of being and knowing, especially\u2014but not only\u2014in the area of aesthetics. These investigations, phenomenological in nature and method, treat such concepts as being, consciousness, time and space, change and motion, identity and difference, subject and object, part and whole. Portions of these investigations were published in essay form throughout the 1950s and 60s, followed by a book-length monograph in 1974. Titled Erkenntnis und Wirklichkeit. Grundlagenkritische Voruntersuchungen (\u201cKnowledge and Reality: Foundationally Critical Preliminary Investigations\u201d), it is a radical condensation of the first half of a manuscript of over five- thousand pages, his magnum opus. Left unfinished and unpublished at his death, it is presently in private hands.Seeba, 842. == Publications by Andrew J\u00e1szi == === Books === * Erkenntnis und Wirklichkeit.
