    "text": "Basalt (, )American Heritage DictionaryMerriam-Webster DictionaryCollins English DictionaryOxford Living Dictionaries is a mafic extrusive igneous rock formed from the rapid cooling of lava rich in magnesium and iron exposed at or very near the surface of a terrestrial planet or a moon. More than 90% of all volcanic rock on Earth is basalt, and the eruption of basalt lava is observed by geologists at about 20 volcanoes per year. Molten basalt lava has a low viscosity due to its relatively low silica content (between 45% and 52%), resulting in rapidly moving lava flows that can spread over great areas before cooling and solidifying. Flood basalts are thick sequences of many such flows that can cover hundreds of thousands of square kilometers and constitute the most voluminous of all volcanic formations.Philpotts and Ague 2009, pp. 52-59 Basaltic magmas are thought to have their origin in the Earth's upper mantle.Philpotts and Ague 2009, pp.16-17 The chemistry of basalts thus provides clues to conditions deep in the Earth's interior.Philpotts and Ague 2009, pp.356-361 Basalt is also an important rock type on other planetary bodies in the Solar System; for example, the lunar maria are plains of flood basaltic lava flows, and basalt is a common rock on the surface of Mars. == Definition == QAPF diagram with basalt/andesite field highlighted in yellow. Basalt is distinguished from andesite by SiO2 < 52%. Basalt is field B in the TAS classification. Columnar basalt flows in thumb Basalt is an aphanitic (fine-grained) igneous rock that is relatively low in silica and alkali metals. It has less than 10% feldspathoid by volume, with at least 65% of the rock consisting of feldspar in the form of plagioclase. This places basalt in the basalt/andesite field of the QAPF diagram. Basalt is further distinguished from andesite by its silica content of less than 52%.Philpotts and Ague 2009, pp.139-143 However, it is often not possible to determine the mineral composition of volcanic rocks, due to their very fine grain size, and basalt is then defined chemically as volcanic rock with a content of 45% to 52% silica and not more than 5% alkali metal oxides. This places basalt in the B field of the TAS classification. The average density of basalt is 2.9 g/cm3.Philpotts and Ague 2009, p. 22 Basalt is usually dark grey to black in colour, due to a high content of augite or other pyroxene minerals,Levin 2010, p.63 but can exhibit a wide range of shading. Some basalts are quite light- coloured due to a high content of plagioclase, and these are sometimes described as leucobasalts. Lighter basalt can be difficult to distinguish from andesite, but a common rule of thumb, used away from the laboratory, is that basalt has a color index of 35 or greater.Philpotts and Ague 2009, p. 139 Basalt is often porphyritic, containing larger crystals (phenocrysts) formed prior to the extrusion that brought the magma to the surface, embedded in a finer-grained matrix. These phenocrysts usually are of augite, olivine, or a calcium-rich plagioclase, which have the highest melting temperatures of the typical minerals that can crystallize from the melt and are therefore the first to form solid crystals. Basalt often contains vesicles, formed when dissolved gases bubble out of the magma as it decompresses during its approach to the surface, and the erupted lava then solidifies before the gases can escape. When vesicles make up a substantial fraction of the volume of the rock, the rock is described as scoria.Blatt and Tracy 1996, pp.27, 42-44 The term basalt is at times applied to shallow intrusive rocks with a composition typical of basalt, but rocks of this composition with a phaneritic (coarser) groundmass are more properly referred to as diabase (also called dolerite) or, when more coarse-grained (crystals over 2 mm across), as gabbro. Diabase and gabbro are thus the hypabyssal and plutonic equivalents of basalt. Columnar basalt at Szent Gy\u00f6rgy Hill, Hungary Vesicular basalt at Sunset Crater, Arizona. US quarter for scale. In the Hadean, Archean, and early Proterozoic eons of Earth's history, the chemistry of erupted magmas was significantly different from today's, due to immature crustal and asthenosphere differentiation. These ultramafic volcanic rocks, with silica (SiO2) contents below 45% are usually classified as komatiites.Philpotts and Ague 2009, pp. 399-400 === Etymology === The word \"basalt\" is ultimately derived from Late Latin basaltes, a misspelling of Latin basanites \"very hard stone\", which was imported from Ancient Greek \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (basanites), from \u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 (basanos, \"touchstone\") and perhaps originated in Egyptian bauhun \"slate\". The modern petrological term basalt describing a particular composition of lava-derived rock, originates from its use by Georgius Agricola in 1546 in his work De Natura Fossilium. Agricola applied \"basalt\" to the volcanic black rock beneath the Bishop of Mei\u00dfen's Stolpen castle, believing it to be the same as the \"basaniten\" described by Pliny the Elder in AD 77 in Naturalis Historiae. === Types === Large masses must cool slowly to form a polygonal joint pattern, as here at the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland Columns of basalt near Bazaltove, Ukraine On Earth, most basalt magmas have formed by decompression melting of the mantle. This can occur in a variety of tectonic settings. * Tholeiitic basalt is relatively rich in iron and poor in alkali metals and aluminium.Philpotts and Ague 2009, pp.143-146 Included in this category are most basalts of the ocean floor, most large oceanic islands, and continental flood basalts such as the Columbia River Plateau. **High and low titanium basalts. Basalt rocks are in some cases classified after their titanium (Ti) content in High-Ti and Low-Ti varieties. High-Ti and Low-Ti basalts have been distinguished in the Paran\u00e1 and Etendeka traps and the Emeishan Traps. ** Mid- ocean ridge basalt (MORB) is a tholeiitic basalt commonly erupted only at ocean ridges and is characteristically low in incompatible elements.Blatt and Tracy 1996, pp.156-158 ***E-MORB, enriched MORB ***N-MORB, normal MORB ***D-MORB, depleted MORB * High-alumina basalt may be silica-undersaturated or -oversaturated (see normative mineralogy). It has greater than 17% alumina (Al2O3) and is intermediate in composition between tholeiitic basalt and alkali basalt; the relatively alumina-rich composition is based on rocks without phenocrysts of plagioclase. These represent the low silica end of the calc-alkaline magma series.Philpotts and Ague 2009, pp.375-376 * Alkali basalt is relatively rich in alkali metals. It is silica-undersaturated and may contain feldspathoids, alkali feldspar, phlogopite, and kaersutite. Augite in alkali basalts is titanium-enriched augite, and low-calcium pyroxenes are never present.Blatt and Tracy 1996, p.75 * Boninite is a high-magnesium form of basalt that is erupted generally in back-arc basins, distinguished by its low titanium content and trace-element composition. * Ocean island basaltPhilpotts and Ague 2009, pp.368-370 == Petrology == Photomicrograph of a thin section of basalt from Bazaltove, Ukraine The mineralogy of basalt is characterized by a preponderance of calcic plagioclase feldspar and pyroxene. Olivine can also be a significant constituent.Levin 2010, p.62 Accessory minerals present in relatively minor amounts include iron oxides and iron- titanium oxides, such as magnetite,ulv\u00f6spinel, and ilmenite. Because of the presence of such oxide minerals, basalt can acquire strong magnetic signatures as it cools, and paleomagnetic studies have made extensive use of basalt.Levin 2010, p.185 In tholeiitic basalt, pyroxene (augite and orthopyroxene or pigeonite) and calcium-rich plagioclase are common phenocryst minerals. Olivine may also be a phenocryst, and when present, may have rims of pigeonite. The groundmass contains interstitial quartz or tridymite or cristobalite. Olivine tholeiitic basalt has augite and orthopyroxene or pigeonite with abundant olivine, but olivine may have rims of pyroxene and is unlikely to be present in the groundmass. Ocean floor basalts, erupted originally at mid-ocean ridges, are known as MORB (mid-ocean ridge basalt) and are characteristically low in incompatible elements. Alkali basalts typically have mineral assemblages that lack orthopyroxene but contain olivine. Feldspar phenocrysts typically are labradorite to andesine in composition. Augite is rich in titanium compared to augite in tholeiitic basalt. Minerals such as alkali feldspar, leucite, nepheline, sodalite, phlogopite mica, and apatite may be present in the groundmass. Basalt has high liquidus and solidus temperatures\u2014values at the Earth's surface are near or above 1200 \u00b0C (liquidus) and near or below 1000 \u00b0C (solidus); these values are higher than those of other common igneous rocks.Philpott and Ague 2009, p.252 The majority of tholeiitic basalts are formed at approximately 50\u2013100 km depth within the mantle. Many alkali basalts may be formed at greater depths, perhaps as deep as 150\u2013200 km. The origin of high-alumina basalt continues to be controversial, with disagreement over whether it is a primary melt or derived from other basalt types by fractionation. === Geochemistry === Relative to most common igneous rocks, basalt compositions are rich in MgO and CaO and low in SiO2 and the alkali oxides, i.e., Na2O + K2O, consistent with the TAS classification. Basalt generally has a composition of 45\u201352 wt% SiO2, 2\u20135 wt% total alkalis, 0.5\u20132.0 wt% TiO2, 5\u201314 wt% FeO and 14 wt% or more Al2O3. Contents of CaO are commonly near 10 wt%, those of MgO commonly in the range 5 to 12 wt%. High-alumina basalts have aluminium contents of 17\u201319 wt% Al2O3; boninites have magnesium (MgO) contents of up to 15 percent. Rare feldspathoid-rich mafic rocks, akin to alkali basalts, may have Na2O + K2O contents of 12% or more. The abundances of the lanthanide or rare-earth elements (REE) can be a useful diagnostic tool to help explain the history of mineral crystallisation as the melt cooled. In particular, the relative abundance of europium compared to the other REE is often markedly higher or lower, and called the europium anomaly. It arises because Eu2+ can substitute for Ca2+ in plagioclase feldspar, unlike any of the other lanthanides, which tend to only form 3+ cations.Philpotts and Ague 2009, p.359 Mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) and their intrusive equivalents, gabbros, are the characteristic igneous rocks formed at mid-ocean ridges. They are tholeiitic basalts particularly low in total alkalis and in incompatible trace elements, and they have relatively flat REE patterns normalized to mantle or chondrite values. In contrast, alkali basalts have normalized patterns highly enriched in the light REE, and with greater abundances of the REE and of other incompatible elements. Because MORB basalt is considered a key to understanding plate tectonics, its compositions have been much studied. Although MORB compositions are distinctive relative to average compositions of basalts erupted in other environments, they are not uniform. For instance, compositions change with position along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and the compositions also define different ranges in different ocean basins. Mid-ocean ridge basalts have been subdivided into varieties such as normal (NMORB) and those slightly more enriched in incompatible elements (EMORB).Philpotts and Ague 2009, p.312 Isotope ratios of elements such as strontium, neodymium, lead, hafnium, and osmium in basalts have been much studied to learn about the evolution of the Earth's mantle.Philpotts and Ague 2009, chapter 13 Isotopic ratios of noble gases, such as 3He/4He, are also of great value: for instance, ratios for basalts range from 6 to 10 for mid-ocean ridge tholeiitic basalt (normalized to atmospheric values), but to 15\u201324 and more for ocean-island basalts thought to be derived from mantle plumes. Source rocks for the partial melts probably include both peridotite and pyroxenite. === Morphology and textures === An active basalt lava flow The shape, structure and texture of a basalt is diagnostic of how and where it erupted\u2014for example, whether into the sea, in an explosive cinder eruption or as creeping p\u0101hoehoe lava flows, the classic image of Hawaiian basalt eruptions.Schmincke 2003 ==== Subaerial eruptions ==== Basalt that erupts under open air (that is, subaerially) forms three distinct types of lava or volcanic deposits: scoria; ash or cinder (breccia);Blatt and Tracy 1996, pp.27-28 and lava flows.Blatt and Tracy 1996, pp.22-23 Basalt in the tops of subaerial lava flows and cinder cones will often be highly vesiculated, imparting a lightweight \"frothy\" texture to the rock.Blatt and Tracy 1996, pp.43-44 Basaltic cinders are often red, coloured by oxidized iron from weathered iron-rich minerals such as pyroxene. \u02bbA\u02bb\u0101 types of blocky, cinder and breccia flows of thick, viscous basaltic lava are common in Hawai\u02bbi. P\u0101hoehoe is a highly fluid, hot form of basalt which tends to form thin aprons of molten lava which fill up hollows and sometimes forms lava lakes. Lava tubes are common features of p\u0101hoehoe eruptions. Basaltic tuff or pyroclastic rocks are less common than basaltic lava flows. Usually basalt is too hot and fluid to build up sufficient pressure to form explosive lava eruptions but occasionally this will happen by trapping of the lava within the volcanic throat and buildup of volcanic gases. Hawai\u02bbi's Mauna Loa volcano erupted in this way in the 19th century, as did Mount Tarawera, New Zealand in its violent 1886 eruption. Maar volcanoes are typical of small basalt tuffs, formed by explosive eruption of basalt through the crust, forming an apron of mixed basalt and wall rock breccia and a fan of basalt tuff further out from the volcano. Amygdaloidal structure is common in relict vesicles and beautifully crystallized species of zeolites, quartz or calcite are frequently found.Philpotts and Ague 2009, p.64 ===== Columnar basalt ===== The Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland jointed basalt in Turkey Columnar basalt at Cape Stolbchaty, Russia During the cooling of a thick lava flow, contractional joints or fractures form.Smalley, I.J. 1966. Contraction crack networks in basalt flows. Geological Magazine 103, 110-114. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0016756800050482 If a flow cools relatively rapidly, significant contraction forces build up. While a flow can shrink in the vertical dimension without fracturing, it cannot easily accommodate shrinking in the horizontal direction unless cracks form; the extensive fracture network that develops results in the formation of columns. These structures are predominantly hexagonal in cross-section, but polygons with three to twelve or more sides can be observed. The size of the columns depends loosely on the rate of cooling; very rapid cooling may result in very small (<1 cm diameter) columns, while slow cooling is more likely to produce large columns. ==== Submarine eruptions ==== Pillow basalts on the south Pacific seafloor ===== Pillow basalts ===== When basalt erupts underwater or flows into the sea, contact with the water quenches the surface and the lava forms a distinctive pillow shape, through which the hot lava breaks to form another pillow. This \"pillow\" texture is very common in underwater basaltic flows and is diagnostic of an underwater eruption environment when found in ancient rocks. Pillows typically consist of a fine-grained core with a glassy crust and have radial jointing. The size of individual pillows varies from 10 cm up to several meters.Schmincke 2003, p.64 When p\u0101hoehoe lava enters the sea it usually forms pillow basalts. However, when \u02bba\u02bb\u0101 enters the ocean it forms a littoral cone, a small cone-shaped accumulation of tuffaceous debris formed when the blocky \u02bba\u02bb\u0101 lava enters the water and explodes from built-up steam. The island of Surtsey in the Atlantic Ocean is a basalt volcano which breached the ocean surface in 1963. The initial phase of Surtsey's eruption was highly explosive, as the magma was quite fluid, causing the rock to be blown apart by the boiling steam to form a tuff and cinder cone. This has subsequently moved to a typical p\u0101hoehoe-type behaviour. Volcanic glass may be present, particularly as rinds on rapidly chilled surfaces of lava flows, and is commonly (but not exclusively) associated with underwater eruptions.Blatt and Tracey 1996, pp.24-25 Pillow basalt is also produced by some subglacial volcanic eruptions. == Distribution == As well as forming large parts of the Earth's crust, basalt also occurs in other parts of the Solar System. ===Earth=== Basalt is the most common volcanic rock type on Earth. The crustal portions of oceanic tectonic plates are composed predominantly of basalt, produced from upwelling mantle below the ocean ridges.Philpotts and Ague 2009, pp.366-368 Basalt is also the principal volcanic rock in many oceanic islands, including the islands of Hawai\u02bbi,Philpotts and Ague 2009, pp.365-370 the Faroe Islands,Schminke 2003, p.91 and R\u00e9union. Paran\u00e1 Traps, Brazil Basalt is the rock most typical of large igneous provinces. These include continental flood basalts, the most voluminous basalts found on land. Examples of continental flood basalts included the Deccan Traps in India, the Chilcotin Group in British Columbia, Canada, the Paran\u00e1 Traps in Brazil, the Siberian Traps in Russia, the Karoo flood basalt province in South Africa, and the Columbia River Plateau of Washington and Oregon.Philpotts and Ague 2009, pp.380-384 Basalt also is common around volcanic arcs, specially those on thin crust.Philpotts and Ague 2009, pp.374-380 Ancient Precambrian basalts are usually only found in fold and thrust belts, and are often heavily metamorphosed. These are known as greenstone belts,Philpotts and Ague 2009, pp.398-399 because low-grade metamorphism of basalt produces chlorite, actinolite, epidote and other green minerals.Blatt and Tracy 1996, pp.366-367 ===Other bodies in the Solar System=== Basalt commonly erupts on Io (the third largest moon of Jupiter), and has also formed on the Moon, Mars, Venus, and the asteroid Vesta. ====The Moon==== Lunar olivine basalt collected by Apollo 15 astronauts The dark areas visible on Earth's moon, the lunar maria, are plains of flood basaltic lava flows. These rocks were sampled by the manned American Apollo program, the robotic Russian Luna program, and are represented among the lunar meteorites. Lunar basalts differ from their Earth counterparts principally in their high iron contents, which typically range from about 17 to 22 wt% FeO. They also possess a wide range of titanium concentrations (present in the mineral ilmenite), ranging from less than 1 wt% TiO2, to about 13 wt.%. Traditionally, lunar basalts have been classified according to their titanium content, with classes being named high-Ti, low-Ti, and very-low-Ti. Nevertheless, global geochemical maps of titanium obtained from the Clementine mission demonstrate that the lunar maria possess a continuum of titanium concentrations, and that the highest concentrations are the least abundant. Lunar basalts show exotic textures and mineralogy, particularly shock metamorphism, lack of the oxidation typical of terrestrial basalts, and a complete lack of hydration. Most of the Moon's basalts erupted between about 3 and 3.5 billion years ago, but the oldest samples are 4.2 billion years old, and the youngest flows, based on the age dating method of crater counting, are estimated to have erupted only 1.2 billion years ago. ====Venus==== From 1972 to 1985, five Venera and two VEGA landers successfully reached the surface of Venus and carried out geochemical measurements using X-ray fluorescence and gamma-ray analysis. These returned results consistent with the rock at the landing sites being basalts, including both tholeiitic and highly alkaline basalts. The landers are thought to have landed on plains whose radar signature is that of basaltic lava flows. These constitute about 80% of the surface of Venus. Some locations show high reflectivity consistent with unweathered basalt, indicating basaltic volcanism within the last 2.5 million years. ====Mars==== Basalt is also a common rock on the surface of Mars, as determined by data sent back from the planet's surface, and by Martian meteorites. ====Vesta==== Analysis of Hubble Space Telescope images of Vesta suggests this asteroid has a basaltic crust covered with a brecciated regolith derived from the crust. Evidence from Earth-based telescopes and the Dawn mission suggest that Vesta is the source of the HED meteorites, which have basaltic characteristics. ====Io==== Lava flows represent a major volcanic terrain on Io. Analysis of the Voyager images led scientists to believe that these flows were composed mostly of various compounds of molten sulfur. However, subsequent Earth-based infrared studies and measurements from the Galileo spacecraft indicate that these flows are composed of basaltic lava with mafic to ultramafic compositions. This conclusion is based on temperature measurements of Io's \"hotspots\", or thermal-emission locations, which suggest temperatures of at least 1,300 K and some as high as 1,600 K. Initial estimates suggesting eruption temperatures approaching 2,000 K have since proven to be overestimates because the wrong thermal models were used to model the temperatures. == Alteration of basalt == === Weathering === Compared to other rocks found on Earth's surface, exposed surfaces of basalt outcrops weather relatively rapidly in water and air due to oxidation of iron-rich minerals into hematite or other iron oxides and hydroxides, staining the rock a brown to rust-red colour. Chemical weathering also releases readily water-soluble cations such as calcium, sodium and magnesium, which give basaltic areas a strong buffer capacity against acidification. Calcium released by basalts binds CO2 from the atmosphere forming CaCO3 acting thus as a CO2 trap. === Metamorphism === Metamorphosed basalt from an Archean greenstone belt in Michigan, US. The minerals that gave the original basalt its black colour have been metamorphosed into green minerals. Intense heat or great pressure transforms basalt into its metamorphic rock equivalents. Basalts are important rocks within metamorphic regions because they can provide vital information on the conditions of metamorphism that have affected the region. Metamorphosed basalts are important hosts for a variety of hydrothermal ores, including deposits of gold, copper and volcanogenic massive sulfides. == Life on basaltic rocks == The common corrosion features of underwater volcanic basalt suggest that microbial activity may play a significant role in the chemical exchange between basaltic rocks and seawater. The significant amounts of reduced iron, Fe(II), and manganese, Mn(II), present in basaltic rocks provide potential energy sources for bacteria. Some Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria cultured from iron-sulfide surfaces are also able to grow with basaltic rock as a source of Fe(II). Fe- and Mn- oxidizing bacteria have been cultured from weathered submarine basalts of Loihi Seamount. The impact of bacteria on altering the chemical composition of basaltic glass (and thus, the oceanic crust) and seawater suggest that these interactions may lead to an application of hydrothermal vents to the origin of life. == Uses == Basalt is used in construction (e.g. as building blocks or in the groundwork), making cobblestones (from columnar basalt) and in making statues. Heating and extruding basalt yields stone wool, which as potential to be an excellent thermal insulator. Carbon sequestration in basalt has been studied as a means of removing carbon dioxide, produced by human industrialization, from the atmosphere. Underwater basalt deposits, scattered in seas around the globe, have the added benefit of the water serving as a barrier to the re-release of CO2 into the atmosphere. == See also == * * * * Plutonism * Polybaric melting * * * * == References == ==Further reading== * * * * * * == External links == * Basalt Columns * Basalt in Northern Ireland * Lava\u2013water interface * PetDB, the Petrological Database * Petrology of Lunar Rocks and Mare Basalts * Pillow lava USGS ",
