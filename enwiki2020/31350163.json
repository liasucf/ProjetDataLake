Located in the north-east of the Aisne department, it also spills over into parts of the Nord and Ardennes departments and the Walloon provinces of Hainaut and Namur. Its overall location is the western foothills of the Ardennes massif. Historically, its capital was Guise, even though its largest settlement is now Fourmies. It is bisected by the route nationale 2 between Paris and Brussels, whilst another important local route is the route nationale 43 between Cambrai and Charleville-M\u00e9zi\u00e8res. == French sartorial heritage == The region was a pivotal centre of mulquinerie (linen weaving).
