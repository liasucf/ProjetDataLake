    "text": "A gentlewoman (from the Latin gentilis, belonging to a gens, and English 'woman') in the original and strict sense is a woman of good family, analogous to the Latin generosus and generosa. The closely related English word \"gentry\" derives from the Old French genterise, gentelise, with much of the meaning of the French noblesse and the German Adel, but without the strict technical requirements of those traditions, such as quarters of nobility. By association with gentleman, the word can refer to: *A woman of gentle birth or high social position; *A woman attending a great lady (as, for example, the character in William Shakespeare's Macbeth called only 'Gentlewoman', who attends Lady Macbeth). This might be a court appointment as the female equivalent to a valet de chambre. *A woman with good manners and high standards of behaviour.Gentlewoman at thefreedictionary.comGentlewoman at merriam- webster.com ==At Court== From the time of Queen Mary I and Queen Elizabeth I, the title Gentlewoman of Her Majesty's Bedchamber was borne by ladies serving the Queen of England, later becoming Lady of the Bedchamber. ==United States Congress== 'Gentlewoman' also has a local usage in the United States House of Representatives, referring to a female member of the House, as in \"the gentlewoman from [place name]\".Gentlewoman at capitolwords.org ==Some uses in literature== *Enitan Bereola II, Gentlewoman: Etiquette for a Lady, from a Gentleman (2014) *Isabella Whitney, The Copy of a Letter, Lately Written in Meter by a Young Gentlewoman: to her Unconstant Lover, ca. 1567Cox, Michael, editor, The Concise Oxford Chronology of English Literature, Oxford University Press, 2004, earliest known volume of English language secular poetry published by a woman *Jane Anger: Her Protection for Women to defend them against the scandalous reports of a late surfeiting Lover...
