    "text": "Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars is the debut album by the American alternative rock band Edie Brickell & New Bohemians, released in 1988. The album went 2x platinum in the United States. \"What I Am\" was the lead single and big hit from the album, reaching #7 on the Billboard Hot 100. The follow- up single, \"Circle,\" was about strained relationships. Although described by author Brent Mann as \"the perfect follow up single to 'What I Am'\" and which \"had 'smash' written all over it,\" it stalled at #48 on the Billboard Hot 100 and fared slightly better on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, reaching #32. Another song from the album, \"Little Miss S.\" was inspired by Edie Sedgwick and reached #38 on the Mainstream Rock chart and #14 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. ==Track listing== ==Song notes== Excerpted from a \"songbook\" included with a box set of the \"What I Am\" single, presumed to be annotated and illustrated by Brickell herself: What I Am \"What I Am is a smart-alec's way out of a deep discussion on the universe as it relates to the self.\" Little Miss S. \"Little Miss S. is just another one of those famous dead people.\" Air of December \"People change & affect you just like the weather.\" The Wheel \"Your kind's always gonna be a-round.\" Love Like We Do \"We're broke & we're ugly.\" Circle \"That weird lost feeling can get you even when you're hangin' round with friends.\" Beat the Time \"Time Divides.\" She \"She's just about a homegirl.\" Nothing \"There's something about nothing \u2013 but it's nothing I wanna talk about.\" Now \"When your heart occupies your head.\" Keep Coming Back \"Some people get right on your mind & just stay there.\" I Do \"I Do is a song for my cat.\" ==Personnel== NEW BOHEMIANS *Edie Brickell - vocals *Kenny Withrow - guitar *Brad Houser - bass guitar *Brandon Aly - drums (fired from the band by the label during the sessions) *John Bush - percussion with: *Robbie Blunt - guitar *Chris Whitten - drums *Paul \"Wix\" Wickens - keyboards *John Henry - background vocals Both Chris Whitten and Paul \"Wix\" Wickens were/are members of Paul McCartney's band; Whitten from 1989-1990 and Wickens from 1989-present. ==Production== *Producer: Pat Moran *Engineer: Pat Moran *Mastering: George Marino *Design: Terry Robertson *Cover illustration: Edie Brickell *Photography: Bob Cook *Tracks 6 & 8 published by Geffen Music- Withrow Publishing-Edie Brickell Songs.Publishing Information as found at discogs *Tracks 11 & 12 published by Geffen Music-Edie Brickell Songs. *All Other Tracks Published By Geffen Music-Strangemind Productions-Enlightened Kitty-Withrow Publishing-Edie Brickell Songs. ==Reception== \"Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars is almost impossible to be cynical about (I tried),\" remarked Time Out, \"and the band are so likeable it's almost unreal.\"Time Out, June 21\u201328, 1989 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !Chart !Position |- |align=\"left\"|Australian Albums Chart |31 |- |align=\"left\"|Austrian Albums Chart |12 |- |align=\"left\"|Dutch Mega Albums Chart |33 |- |align=\"left\"|German Media Control Albums Chart |29 |- |align=\"left\"|Italian Albums Chart |5 |- |align=\"left\"|New Zealand Albums Chart |10 |- |align=\"left\"|UK Albums Chart |25 |- |align=\"left\"|United States Billboard 200[ Allmusic - Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums] |4 |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Chart (1989) !Position |- |align=\"left\"|Australian Albums Chart |81 |- |align=\"left\"|Canadian Albums Chart |26 |- |align=\"left\"|Italian Albums Chart |16 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard 200 |18 |} ===Certifications=== ==References== Category:Edie Brickell & New Bohemians albums Category:1988 debut albums Category:Geffen Records albums Category:Albums produced by Pat Moran Category:Albums recorded at Rockfield Studios ",
