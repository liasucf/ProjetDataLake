    "text": "1798 was the twelfth season of cricket in England since the foundation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). It was by now commonplace for important matches to involve town clubs rather than county teams. == Matches == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=\"125\" | Date ! width=\"250\" | Match Title ! width=\"125\" | Venue ! width=\"50\" | Source ! width=\"200\" | Result |- | 2 & 3 May (W\u2013Th) | F Beauclerk v J Tufton | Lord's (Dorset Square) | SB230 | Beauclerk's XI won by 19 runs |- | colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:85%;border- color:#aaa #fff;background-color:#fff;\" | The above was excluded from a previous classification but the players are recognised so this has important match status.

Peregrine Maitland, (MCC and Surrey; amateur) - played 27 matches to 1808 * Charles Reed (Kent) - played 7 matches from 1798 to 1810 * Williams (MCC cricketer) (MCC; amateur) - played 6 matches in 1798 * J.

The \"runs scored\" are in fact the runs known. Fewer matches were recorded in 1798 than in previous years. The batsmen who scored over 100 runs were: :Lord Frederick Beauclerk \u2013 369 :Andrew Freemantle \u2013 217 :Benjamin Clifton \u2013 187 :John Tufton \u2013 185 :Thomas Ray \u2013 179 :Jack Small \u2013 177 :Tom Walker \u2013 164 :William Fennex \u2013 148 :Robert Robinson \u2013 147 :T A Smith \u2013 146 :Hampton \u2013 141 :William Beldham \u2013 136 :John Wells \u2013 135 :Harry Walker \u2013 127 :John Hammond \u2013 112 ==Leading bowlers== Note that the wickets credited to an 18th-century bowler were only those where he bowled the batsman out. The bowler was not credited with the wickets of batsmen who were caught out, even if it was \"caught and bowled\". In addition, the runs conceded by each bowler were not recorded so no analyses or averages can be computed. Thomas Boxall just led the bowlers with 42 wickets, beating Lord Frederick Beauclerk who took 40 Other leading bowlers were John Wells 30; William Fennex 23; Tom Walker 16; David Harris 15; Thomas Lord 15 ==Leading fielders== Note that many scorecards in the 18th century are unknown or have missing details and so the totals are of the known catches and stumpings only. Stumpings were not always recorded as such and sometimes the name of the wicket-keeper was not given. Generally, a catch was given the same status as \"bowled\" with credit being awarded to the fielder only and not the bowler. There is never a record of \"caught and bowled\": the bowler would be credited with the catch, not with the wicket. John Hammond with 9 ct, 9 st and John Wells with 10 ct, 8 st were the joint leading fielders in 1798 Lord Frederick Beauclerk took the most catches with 14, followed by William Fennex 11; Andrew Freemantle 8 ct, 2 st; William Beldham 7 ct, 1 st; Thomas Ray 7 ct. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * ==Further reading== * * * * * Britcher, Samuel, A list of all the principal Matches of Cricket that have been played (1790 to 1805), annual series * * * Category:1798 in English cricket Category:English cricket seasons from 1787 to 1815 ",
