    "text": "The Idle Class The Idle Class is a 1921 American silent comedy film written and directed by Charlie Chaplin for First National Pictures. ==Plot summary== The \"Little Tramp\" (Charlie Chaplin) heads to a resort for warm weather and golf. At the golf course, the Tramp's theft of balls in play causes one golfer (Mack Swain) to mistakenly attack another (John Rand). Meanwhile, a neglected wife (Edna Purviance) leaves her wealthy husband (also played by Chaplin) until he gives up drinking. When the Tramp is later mistaken for a pickpocket, he crashes a masquerade ball to escape from a policeman. There, he is mistaken for the woman's husband. Eventually, it is all straightened out, and the Tramp is once more on his way. ==Review== Helen Rockwell of the New York Telegraph wrote \"instead of going for a five-reel affair, he has returned to his first short love. But what there is of The Idle Class is so good and so funny that one realizes how much better is it to be entertained by two reels than bored in five.\" ==Cast== * Charles Chaplin as Tramp / Husband * Edna Purviance as Neglected Wife * Mack Swain as Her Father * Henry Bergman as Sleeping Hobo / Guest in Cop Uniform * Al Ernest Garcia as Cop in Park / Guest * John Rand as Golfer / Guest * Rex Storey as Pickpocket / Guest * Lita Grey as Guest ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1921 films Category:1921 comedy films Category:American comedy films Category:American silent short films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Short films directed by Charlie Chaplin Category:1921 short films Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Comedy short films Category:First National Pictures films ",
