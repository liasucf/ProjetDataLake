    "text": "FC Minyor () is a football club in Pernik, Bulgaria, that competes in the Second League, the second tier of Bulgarian football. Founded in 1919 as SC Krakra, the club's home ground since 1954 has been Stadion Minyor. The club's name comes from the fact that the area around the city of Pernik has had long traditions with mining and the mining industry. The club's highest league finish in the top division is fourth, which was achieved in the 1955 and 1960\u201361 seasons. Minyor played in the Bulgarian Cup Final in 1958, finishing runners-up to Spartak Plovdiv. == History == The origins of the club date back to 1919. Minyor came into existence with the merger of several football clubs from Pernik. In 1944, SC Krakra (founded in 1919), SC Svetkavitsa (founded in 1932), SC Benkovski (founded in 1936), and ZHSK (founded in 1941) merged to form SC Rudnichar. After World War II, as Bulgaria became a People's Republic, the club was renamed to Republikanets '46. The club finally came to be known as Minyor in 1952. The club joined the Bulgarian top division in 1951. That same year, they laid the foundations of a strong team, which, until the 1961\u201362 season, was among the top teams in Bulgaria. The first match in the division was on March 2, 1951 against Cherveno Zname Sofia. Minyor's best seasons in the top division were in 1955 and 1961, finishing both times at fourth place. In 1956, Minyor's forward and captain Pavel Vladimirov became the top scorer of the division with 16 goals. Vladimirov holds Minyor's overall appearance record - 305 matches. The former forward is also the all- time leading scorer for the club with 98 goals. In 1958, the club qualified for the final of the Bulgarian Cup, where the team lost to Spartak Plovdiv. In 1962, Minyor was relegated to the second division. Between 1962 and 2008, the club participated in the top and second divisions, regularly being promoted and relegated. Until the 2008\u201309 season, Minyor has played a total of 32 seasons in the first division. Minyor's biggest victory in A PFG to date is the 6-0 win against Torpedo Pleven in 1951. Minyor's largest defeat, 0\u20138, was against Beroe Stara Zagora in 1973. Minyor Pernik's latest spell in the top flight began in 2008. They managed to return to the elite rank by winning the 2007-08 promotion play-off, beating Kaliakra Kavarna after a penalty shootout. Their first season since returning to the elite was quite successful as they finished 11th, with 35 points, including an away draw to Levski Sofia. The next season, 2009-10, was better for the hammers, as they managed to finish in eight place, under the management of Anton Velkov. Minyor collected 45 points, and managed to beat CSKA Sofia 0-3 in Sofia, which was the latter's only defeat at home for the season. For the 2010-11 season, Minyor hired Stoycho Stoev, who replaced Anton Velkov due to poor results in the beginning of the season. Minyor eventually finished the season in 9th place, with 36 points. Minyor decided to extend Stoev's contract for the 2011-12 season. They had another relatively successful season, finishing in 9th place again, with 36 points. Highlights from the season included a home 2-0 win over CSKA Sofia and an away win against Levski Sofia, the two most decorated Bulgarian teams. Minyor also reached the quarterfinals of the Bulgarian cup for the 2011-12 season. They were, however, eliminated by Litex Lovech by a score of 2-0. Stoycho Stoev left the club at the end of the season and was replaced by Nikolay Todorov. However, Minyor dropped their form and eventually finished 14th, meaning they were relegated after a 5 year stay in the top level. The team was supposed to play in the 2013-14 B PFG, however due to very big financial problems, the owners of the club decided to abolish the current club and establish a new one, starting from V AFG. The new team, carrying the identity and traditions of the old one, started playing in the third tier from the 2013-14 season. Pernik played there in the following six seasons. Minyor finished first in the Southwest third league for the 2019-20 season and promoted to the Second League for the first time in seven years. == Honours == Bulgarian First League: * Fourth place (2): 1955, 1960\u201361 Bulgarian Cup: * Runner-up: 1958 * Semi-finalist: 2008\u201309 == Players == '''' :For recent transfers, see Transfers summer 2020. == Notable players == {| width=90% align=top || * Evlogi Banchev * Ivan Danchev * Velizar Dimitrov * Kiril Djorov * Lyudmil Evgeniev * Anton Evtimov * Dimitar Georgiev * Viktor Georgiev * Kiril Ivkov * Anjelo Kuchukov * Yanek Kuchukov || * Zdravko Lazarov * Georgi Lozanov * Slave Malinov * Oleg Pavlov * Krasimir Svilenov * Mario Valkov * Emil Varadinov * Pavel Vladimirov * Georgi Yordanov * Van\u010do Trajanov * Everton Fernando Gilio * Far\u00e8s Brahimi |} ==League positions== ===Previous names=== * Pernik - 1970\u201373 * Krakra - 1969\u201370 * Torpedo - 1948\u201352 * Republicanets '46 - 1946\u201348 ImageSize = width:800 height:60 PlotArea = left:10 right:10 bottom:30 top:10 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/07/2002 till:01/07/2021 ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:2003 Colors = id:bl1 value:rgb(0.5,0.8,0.5) id:bl2 value:rgb(0.9,0.9,0.3) id:rs value:rgb(0.8,0.6,0.6) id:rn value:rgb(0.9,0.1,0.1) PlotData= bar:Position width:16 color:white align:center from:01/07/2002 till:01/07/2003 shift:(0,-4) text:6 from:01/07/2003 till:01/07/2004 shift:(0,-4) text:13 from:01/07/2004 till:01/07/2005 shift:(0,-4) text:1 from:01/07/2002 till:01/07/2005 color:red shift:(0,14) text: \"V Group\" from:01/07/2005 till:01/07/2006 shift:(0,-4) text:12 from:01/07/2006 till:01/07/2007 shift:(0,-4) text:8 from:01/07/2007 till:01/07/2008 shift:(0,-4) text:2 from:01/07/2005 till:01/07/2008 color:white shift:(0,14) text: \"B Group\" from:01/07/2008 till:01/07/2009 shift:(0,-4) text:11 from:01/07/2009 till:01/07/2010 shift:(0,-4) text:8 from:01/07/2010 till:01/07/2011 shift:(0,-4) text:9 from:01/07/2011 till:01/07/2012 shift:(0,-4) text:9 from:01/07/2012 till:01/07/2013 shift:(0,-4) text:14 from:01/07/2008 till:01/07/2013 color:green shift:(0,14) text: \"A Group\" from:01/07/2013 till:01/07/2014 shift:(0,-4) text:4 from:01/07/2014 till:01/07/2015 shift:(0,-4) text:2 from:01/07/2015 till:01/07/2016 shift:(0,-4) text:5 from:01/07/2013 till:01/07/2016 color:red shift:(0,14) text: \"V Group\" from:01/07/2016 till:01/07/2017 shift:(0,-4) text:3 from:01/07/2017 till:01/07/2018 shift:(0,-4) text:4 from:01/07/2018 till:01/07/2019 shift:(0,-4) text:5 from:01/07/2019 till:01/07/2020 shift:(0,-4) text:1 from:01/07/2016 till:01/07/2020 color:red shift:(0,14) text: \"Third League\" from:01/07/2020 till:01/07/2021 shift:(0,-4) text: from:01/07/2020 till:01/07/2021 color:white shift:(0,14) text: \"Second League\" ==Statistics and Records== {| |valign=\"top\" width=33%| Most league appearances for the club {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !Rank!!Name!!Nat!!Apps |- |1||Pavel Vladimirov||||305 |- |2||Georgi Yordanov||||243 |- |3||Evlogi Banchev||||231 |- |4||Slave Malinov||||225 |- |} Most league goals for the club {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !Rank!!Name!!Nat!!Goals |- |1||Pavel Vladimirov||||98 |- |2||Georgi Yordanov||||68 |- |3||Ivan Danchev||||56 |- |4||Oleg Pavlov||||51 |- |} |valign=\"top\" width=33%| Bulgarian league top scorer with the club {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !Year!!Name!!Nat!!Goals |- |1956||Pavel Vladimirov||||16 |- |} |} Notes: *Bold signals active players *Correct as of 15 May 2008 ==Managers== * Anton Velkov (Jul 2009\u2013Sept 2010) * Stoycho Stoev (Sept 2010\u2013Sept 2012) * Nikolay Todorov (Sept 2012\u2013Jul 2014) * Valeri Damyanov (Jul 2014\u2013Dec 2014) * Hristo Yanev (Jan 2015\u2013Jul 2015) * Danail Bachkov (Jun 2017\u2013Nov 2017) * Nikolay Todorov (Dec 2017\u2013) ==Supporters== Minyor's fans are known as the hammers or the yellow-blacks. They are famous for their passion and for the violence they cause before, during and after the matches.

Minyor's fans are also infamous for their general hatred for Sofia. Their only friends are considered to be Botev Plovdiv, also yellow-black. The Minyor's rivals call them \"orcs\" due to the mining heritage of the town. ==References== == External links == * Official site Minyor Category:Pernik Category:1919 establishments in Bulgaria Category:PFC Minyor Pernik Minyor Pernik ",
