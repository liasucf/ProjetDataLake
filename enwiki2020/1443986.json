Following command of the destroyer and logistical work prior to World War II, he took command of Missouri in 1944. Callaghan is perhaps best known for ordering, despite disagreement from some of his crew, that an honorable funeral be held for an enemy pilot who died during a suicide attack on Missouri in 1945. Following World War II, he directed the US Navy's transportation service and filled senior command roles in eastern Asia, including leadership of the US Pacific Fleet's Amphibious Force during the Korean War.

() Despite protests from crewmen, who wanted the remains hosed over the deck, Callaghan insisted that the young Japanese airman had done his job to the best of his ability, with honor, and deserved a military funeral. Stephen Cromwell, a corpsman at the time, later recalled, \"I was able to recover his body and I called up to the bridge to ask if I should throw it overboard ... Captain Callaghan said, 'No, when we secure, take it down to the sick bay, and we'll have a burial for him tomorrow.'\"Yi, S.

Following examination, the remains were placed in a canvas bag with dummy shell casings to weigh it down. The following day, the Japanese pilot received a military funeral at sea. An improvised Japanese flag, sewn by one of the ship's bosun's mates, covered the bag holding the man's remains. The ship's chaplain committed the body to the sea and the six pallbearers let it slide overboard, accompanied by a volley of rifle fire. Fahr wrote, \"There was still much bitterness on the part of many in the crew, but now, the honorable thing was done.\" According to Lee Collins, visitor operations director for the Battleship Missouri Memorial, Callaghan said that the ceremony was simply a tribute to \"a fellow warrior who had displayed courage and devotion, and who had paid the ultimate sacrifice with his life, fighting for his country.\"Tsutsumi, C.

Leading up to the service, Callaghan's son said, \"My father believed a burial at sea for the pilot was the right thing to do. He felt it would set a good example for the crew in showing respect for the life of people, even for the people you are opposing.\" Junko Kamata, a niece of one of the Japanese pilots killed in the April 1945 battle, said, \"I want to thank Captain Callaghan for his humanitarian consideration for kamikaze soldiers.\" Minoru Shibuya, Japanese Consul General, called Callaghan's actions \"a glorious deed, to salute the [pilot's] bravery.\" Daniel Inouye, US Senator from Hawaii, reflected that \"from the dawn of civilization, warriors respected their adversaries; it was an unspoken code of honor. When Callaghan saw the broken body of his sworn enemy lying upon his ship, he saw him not as an enemy, but simply as a man.\" At a 1998 reunion of Missouri veterans, many of those present who had served during World War II felt that, on reflection, their captain had acted correctly. Robert Kihune, a retired US Navy vice admiral, said, \"In wartime, courage is measured as much by one's actions as their strength of leadership during the heat of battle ... I think the leadership qualities showed by Captain Callaghan illustrate the ideal of what we want our military leaders to follow.\" == See also == * Burial at sea * * * Sealift == Notes == a. Three volunteers from the USS Missouri Memorial Association narrowed the identity of the Japanese pilot to three possibilities: Lieutenant Junior Grade Shigeju Yaguchi, Petty Officer Second Class Takashi Sogabe, and Petty Officer Second Class .

Two sources state that Callaghan was promoted to the rank of vice admiral soon after his appointment to command the MSTS. Historian Salvatore Mercogliano (c. 2000) states that the initial commander of the MSTS was \"Rear Admiral William M. Callaghan (subsequently promoted to Vice Admiral)\"Mercogliano, S. R. (c. 2000): One hundred years in the making: The birth of Military Sea Transportation Service (MSTS) Retrieved on May 27, 2010. and a 1962 ship directory states that \"[MSTS's] first commander, Rear-Admiral William Callaghan, was soon promoted to vice-admiral, and the M.S.T.S. has been a ' three-star' command ever since\" (p. 41). Another article by Mercogliano (2000) states that Callaghan was still ranked a rear admiral in early July 1950. Two other sources, a later article by Mercogliano (2009) and Military Sealift Command's timeline, state that MSTS's first commander was Vice Admiral William M. Callaghan. It is not clear whether these last two sources were simply reporting Callaghan's rank at the time of writing, well after 1949, or whether they were implying that Callaghan was already a vice admiral before taking command of the MSTS. d. Commenting on the decision to hold a memorial service for the Japanese pilots aboard USS Missouri, US veteran Lloyd Prang said, \"If the Japanese want to memorialize their pilots and soldiers, let them do it on THEIR soil.\" Marine Corps veteran Rand Potts considered it \"a promotional deal to excite Japanese visitors into visiting the Missouri.\" == References == ==External links== * NavSource Naval History: Battleship Photo Index BB-63 USS Missouri August\u2013December 1944 includes photographs of Callaghan on the bridge of the Missouri in 1944. * NavSource Naval History: Battleship Photo Index BB-63 USS Missouri 1984\u20131987 includes a photograph of Callaghan at a Missouri reunion in Annapolis in 1985. * The Jerseyman (No. 63, 3rd Quarter 2009, p. 8) includes a photograph showing the dent in the side of the Missouri (resulting from the attack of April 1945), still visible as of May 16, 2009.
