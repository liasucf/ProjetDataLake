    "text": "The P\u00f6bel Valley railway (German: P\u00f6beltalbahn) was a narrow-gauge railway project intended to link Saxon Schmiedeberg on the Weisseritz Valley Railway (Wei\u00dferitztalbahn) with Moldava on the Most\u2013Moldava railway. The railway, climbing through the P\u00f6bel Valley (P\u00f6beltal) to the ridge of the Ore Mountains, was expected to transport lignite from Most Basin. Construction began on 10 March 1920. The railway station at Schmiedeberg was realigned and enlarged, however the additional railway tracks were not laid. By 1921 the intended trackbed had been marked out for . On 14 November 1923 its construction was abandoned. By that stage the line had been completed as far as the railway station of Niederp\u00f6bel and several other track sections were under construction. Some sections are still recognizable today, especially the one from Schmiedeberg to Niederp\u00f6bel and the track around the planned halt of Wahlsm\u00fchle. == External links == * Description, photos, map (German) Category:Railway lines in Saxony Category:750 mm gauge railways in Germany ",
