A week or so later he set to work on a rewrite of these notes with a preface (\u7b2c\u4e00\u518a\u8b58\u8a9e dai-issatsu shikigo). He died of illness in the fourth month of the following year, with his commentary incomplete. He was 58 years old, by Japanese reckoning. == Contents == The Man'y\u014d Shik\u014d records Haruki's views of various expressions and compositional circumstances over which the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b K\u014d (\u4e07\u8449\u96c6\u8003) and ' had expressed doubt. It contains views likely acquired by Haruki from his teacher Norinaga, as well as indicating the fountainhead of the Tosa school of Man'y\u014d scholarship. For these reasons (1919\u20131980), in his article on the work for the 1983 Nihon Koten Bungaku Daijiten, states that the it has attracted the attention of scholars interested in the history of Man'y\u014dsh\u016b research. == Textual tradition == A copy formerly in the holdings of had been published posthumously by Haruki's son and heir , but as of \u014ckubo's writing of the Nihon Koten Bungaku Daijiten article said copy's whereabouts were unknown. The edition printed in the Nihon Koten Zensh\u016b is based on a handcopied text made by Masamune Atsuo. == References == === Citations === === Works cited === * * Category:1785 books Category:Man'y\u014dsh\u016b Category:Edo-period works ",
