The park's star attraction is a weeping cherry tree (shidarezakura) which becomes lit up at night. It also becomes busy in the New Year's Eve Festivals. The main entrance to the park is through Yasaka Shrine, which sits at the eastern end of Shij\u014d Street in the Gion District. Directly to the north (and abutting the park) is the vast temple of Chion-in, followed by the smaller temple of Sh\u014dren-in.
