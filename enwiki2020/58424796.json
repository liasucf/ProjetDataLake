The property was sold in October 2011.The Sydney Morning Herald, 2011. == Description == ===Site=== Egglemont relates well to the adjacent house by Alexander Stuart Jolly and to other houses in the Cranbrook Avenue group. It is a significant element of the Cranbrook Avenue Group, relating well to the adjacent house by A. S. Jolly and other houses in the group. The area has unfortunately been degraded in the 1970s by red brick multi-storey flat developments.Branch Manager's report, November 2003 The house is sited on a sloping site on Cranbrook Avenue, Cremorne, with a low, stepped wall (plastered masonry) facing the footpath, stone walls flanking a low wide paired \"wide lattice\" form timber gate and crazy-paved sandstone path to the front door, large shrubs (Viburnum odoratissimum, pruned into a hedge) providing some screening from the street. To either side of the main pedestrian entry gate the name \"Esslemont\" is carved into the top course of sandstone boundary wall blocks.Stuart Read, from photographs, May 2012 A crazy paved sandstone pedestrian path approaches the front door, which is accessed up a flight of wide stairs. Planter beds are at the base of the stairs, and abut the base of the house's walls. A secondary pedestrian gate (Art Deco iron, flanked by stone pillars) is on the uphill side of the house. It abuts, (on its uphill side again) a paved tennis court and high (steel pipe and wire netting) fence which runs up to the house and to the street wall. At the rear of the tennis court fence is a lawn area and an outbuilding (a single garage) with a sloping roof, abutting the uphill side boundary. On the uphill side of the tennis court are a multi-storey late-mid-20th century block of flats (Rosz & Howard et al., 2001 photographs). As well as the tennis court the property has a swimming pool.Sydney Morning Herald, 8\u20139 October 2011 At the rear of the house is a small flat lawn area with shrubs and a ground cover of cast-iron plant (Aspidistra elatior) up against the house's rear wall. The garden contains an elevated tennis court. To the back of the house is a three- storey red brick mid-20th century block of flats. The garden is typical of the period.RNE, 1991. ===House=== The house was built -18 and is one of the best examples of an early Californian Bungalow style house in Australia.
