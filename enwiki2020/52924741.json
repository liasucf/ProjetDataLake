Originally known as Kairos Dance Theater, the organization was founded in 1999 by professional dancer and choreographer Maria Genn\u00e9. Ms. Genn\u00e9 (MEd, University of North Dakota) serves as the organization's artistic director. She is a proponent of intergenerational interactive participatory dance theater, who believes this type of activity has the power to \"nurture, heal, and create community among all ages, abilities and cultural backgrounds\". A story in the October 2011 issue of AARP Bulletin\"Artists Bring Creative Aging to Care Facilities - Long-term care residents, families, caregivers are fans\"; AARP Bulletin; October 2011 describes a study on the work of Kairos Alive! by researchers at St. Catherine University in St. Paul, Minnesota. In this study, researchers examined the effect of Kairos Alive! programming on the residents of long-term care facilities. According to the AARP article, researchers found \"the majority of residents' balance and memory either improved or remained the same \u2014 notable for this population \u2014 and social interaction increased\". The AARP article quotes St. Catherine University occupational therapist Catherine Sullivan as saying, \"People who normally would not pay attention for more than five minutes were engaged for an hour and a half. The program not only triggered memories from music, but allowed people to create new ones, learn new songs, retell one another's stories and recognize each other.\" The AARP article goes on to say \"Research suggests that creative expression programs can reduce pain and loneliness while increasing mobility, helping cognition and making participants feel valued.\" Karios Alive!'s programs include Intergenerational Dance Hall, Dancing Heart\u2122, Community Arts and Wellbeing\u2122, Moving Well\u2122, and the Kairos Alive! Performing Troupe. The work of Kairos Alive! was featured in \"Arts & The Mind\",PBS website: https://www.pbs.org/program/arts-mind/ a documentary written, produced, and directed by Leo Eaton.
