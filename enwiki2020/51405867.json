In March 2017 he became the number one ranked amateur golfer in the world, heading the World Amateur Golf Ranking. He held that ranking before turning professional in April. ==Golf career== Luck was runner-up at the 2014 Australian Amateur. He also won the 2016 Western Australian Open on the PGA Tour of Australasia. Luck won the 2016 U.S. Amateur. He had previously planned to turn professional in October 2016, but decided to wait in order to retain his invitations in the 2017 Masters, U.S. Open and Open Championship. He moved from seventh in the World Amateur Golf Ranking to third with the win. Luck was awarded the Emerging Athlete of the Year at the 2016 Australian Institute of Sport Performance Awards. Luck later decided to turn professional at the 2017 Valero Texas Open, meaning he forfeited his U.S. Open and Open Championship exemptions. In August 2020, Luck won the Nationwide Children's Hospital Championship in Ohio on the Korn Ferry Tour. ==Amateur wins (5)== *2012 Newman and Brooks Junior Championship *2014 Victorian Junior Masters, Western Australian Amateur *2016 U.S. Amateur, Asia- Pacific Amateur Championship Source: ==Professional wins (2)== ===PGA Tour of Australasia wins (1)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !Margin of victory !Runner-up |- |align=center|1 |1 May 2016 |Nexus Risk TSA Group WA Open (as an amateur) |\u201319 (67-64-62-68=261) |2 strokes | Travis Smyth |} ===Korn Ferry Tour wins (1)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" |Legend |- style=\"background:#D6E8FF;\" | Korn Ferry Tour Championship Series (1) |- | Other Korn Ferry Tour (0) |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No.!!Date!!Tournament!!Winning score!!Margin of victory!!Runners-up |-style=\"background:#D6E8FF;\" |align=center|1 |align=right|23 Aug 2020 |Nationwide Children's Hospital Championship |\u221211 (68-66-68-71=273) |1 stroke | Theo Humphrey, Taylor Montgomery, Cameron Young |} ==Results in major championships== Results not in chronological order in 2020. {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text- align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !2017!!2018 |- |align=left|Masters Tournament |T46 |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=left|U.S. Open |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=left|The Open Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=left|PGA Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |} {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text- align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !2019!!2020 |- |align=left|Masters Tournament |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=left|PGA Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=left|U.S. Open |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |CUT |- |align=left|The Open Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"|NT |} CUT = missed the half-way cut \"T\" = tied for place NT = No tournament due to COVID-19 pandemic ==Team appearances== Amateur *Eisenhower Trophy (representing Australia): 2016 (winners) ==See also== *2018 Web.com Tour Finals graduates ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Australian male golfers Category:PGA Tour golfers Category:PGA Tour of Australasia golfers Category:Korn Ferry Tour graduates Category:Sportspeople from Perth, Western Australia Category:1996 births Category:Living people ",
