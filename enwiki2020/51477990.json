The album was structured as sides of a vinyl record: \"On one side, it\u2019s as if you were having an upbeat day and wanted to try something a little hectic. But then, if you feel like things were slowing down and you wanted to be more reflective, then you listen to Side B.\" With regard to the album's themes, Olsen said that My Woman addresses \"the complicated mess of being a woman.\"Brodsky, Rachel.

Retrieved 26 September 2016. ===Music=== My Woman was Olsen's attempt to expand her musical style after 2014's Burn Your Fire for No Witness, with emphasis on avoiding being typecast as a lo-fi indie artist. With what she called a \"plurality of voices,\" Olsen \"wanted to use [her] vocal more and sing in the styles that [she] liked.\" Compared to Olsen's previous album, My Woman contains a poppier, more diverse sound. Musical genres and musicians that influenced the album includes Fleetwood Mac, The Shirelles, Crazy Horse, 1970s glam rock, 1960s country pop and grunge.Todd, Bella.

Club gave the album a grade of A-, writing \"When Olsen broke through with [..] Burn Your Fire For No Witness [..] she was quickly pigeonholed as the Sad Girl [..]. With My Woman, Olsen obliterates that narrow perception, raising the bar on her own multifaceted output and building new aspects of her artistic identity in the process.\" PopMatters' Colin Fitzgerald called My Woman \"a new watermark for Olsen,\" that \"elaborates on the disparate missions of both Half Way Home and Burn Your Fire For No Witness while reaching out into the unfamiliar spaces of dreamy synthpop and more hook-driven, pop-oriented songwriting.\" Fitzgerald continued, \"most remarkable thing about My Woman is that it all coheres (far better than Burn Your Fire For No Witness, as great as it was, ever did) into an expansive, all-encompassing vision.\"Fitzgerald, Colin. Angel Olsen: My Woman. Popmatters. 2 September 2016. Retrieved 25 September 2016. Record Collector gave the album a mixed review, writing \"My Woman is an odd, somewhat mismatched collection of good and then great songs that could have been more ghostly. When played simplest, or with the least traditional band structure buffeting them, they\u2019re at their best \u2013 but it\u2019s sadly not a constant.\"Kennedy, Jake. Angel Olsen - My Woman. Record Collector. Retrieved 25 September 2016. In November 2016, UK record chain HMV named My Woman as their album of the year, calling it \"an intuitively smart, warmly communicative and fearlessly generous record\". ===Accolades=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !
