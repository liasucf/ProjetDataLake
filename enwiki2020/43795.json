    "text": "Replica of the Stone of Scone, Scone Palace The Stone of Scone (; , )\u2014also known as the Stone of Destiny, and often referred to in England as The Coronation Stone\u2014is an oblong block of red sandstone that has been used for centuries in the coronation of the monarchs of Scotland, and later also when the monarchs of Scotland became monarchs of England as well as in the coronations of the monarchs of Great Britain and latterly of the United Kingdom following the treaties of union. Historically, the artefact was kept at the now-ruined Scone Abbey in Scone, near Perth, Scotland. It is also known as Jacob's Pillow Stone and the Tanist Stone, and in Scottish Gaelic, clach- na-cinneamhain. Its size is by by and its weight is approximately . A roughly incised cross is on one surface, and an iron ring at each end aids with transport. The Stone of Scone was last used in 1953 for the coronation of Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. ==Tradition and history== Replica of the Stone of Scone at Scone Palace ===Origin and legends=== In the 14th century, the English cleric and historian Walter Hemingford described the previous location of the Scottish coronation stone as the monastery of Scone, 3 km north of Perth: Various theories and legends exist about the stone's history prior to its placement in Scone: *One story concerns Fergus, son of Erc, the first King of the Scots in Scotland, whose transport of the Stone from Ireland to Argyll, where he was crowned on it, was recorded.Andree, p. 163 *Some versions identify the stone brought by Fergus with the Lia F\u00e1il used at Tara for the High King of Ireland. Other traditions contend the Lia F\u00e1il remains at Tara. (Inis F\u00e1il, The Island of Destiny, is one of the traditional names of Ireland.) *Legends place the origins of the Stone in Biblical times and consider the Stone to be the Stone of Jacob, taken by Jacob while in Haran, (Genesis 28:10\u201322). Geologists proved that the stone taken by Edward I of England to Westminster'The Stone of Destiny: Symbol of Nationhood' by David Breeze and Graeme Munro is a \"lower Old Red Sandstone\", which was quarried in the vicinity of Scone.John Prebble, The Lion in the North Doubts over the authenticity of the stone have existed for a long time: a blog post by retired Scottish academic and writer of historical fiction Marie MacPherson shows that they date back at least two hundred years. A letter to the editor of the Morning Chronicle, dated 2 January 1819, states: > On the 19th of November, as the servants belonging to the West Mains of > Dunsinane-house, were employed in carrying away stones from the excavation > made among the ruins that point out the site of Macbeth's castle here, part > of the ground they stood on suddenly gave way, and sank down about six feet, > discovering a regularly built vault, about six feet long and four wide. None > of the men being injured, curiosity induced them to clear out the > subterranean recess, when they discovered among the ruins a large stone, > weighing about 500lb [], which is pronounced to be of the meteoric or semi- > metallic kind. This stone must have lain here during the long series of ages > since Macbeth's reign. Beside it were also found two round tablets, of a > composition resembling bronze. On one of these two lines are engraved, which > a gentleman has thus deciphered.\u2014 'The sconce (or shadow) of kingdom come, > until Sylphs in air carry me again to Bethel.' These plates exhibit the > figures of targets for the arms. From time immemorial it has been believed > among us here, that unseen hands brought Jacob's pillow from Bethel and > dropped it on the site where the palace of Scoon now stands. A strong belief > is also entertained by many in this part of the country that it was only a > representation of this Jacob's pillow that Edward sent to Westminster, the > sacred stone not having been found by him. The curious here, aware of such > traditions, and who have viewed these venerable remains of antiquity, agree > that Macbeth may, or rather must, have deposited the stone in question at > the bottom of his Castle, on the hill of Dunsinane (from the trouble of the > times), where it has been found by the workmen. This curious stone has been > shipped for London for the inspection of the scientific amateur, in order to > discover its real quality. ===Westminster Abbey=== Illustration of the Stone of Scone in the Coronation Chair at Westminster Abbey, 1855 In 1296, the stone was taken by Edward I as spoils of war and removed to Westminster Abbey, where it was fitted into a wooden chair\u2014known as King Edward's Chair\u2014on which most subsequent English and then British sovereigns have been crowned. Edward I sought to claim his status as the \"Lord Paramount\" of Scotland, with the right to oversee its King.Arundell, Brian, of Wardour Howard. Judah Scepter: A Historical and Religious Perspective, iUnivers (2010) p. 3 Some doubt exists over the stone captured by Edward I. The Westminster Stone theory posits that the monks at Scone Palace hid the real stone in the River Tay, or buried it on Dunsinane Hill, and that the English troops were tricked into taking a substitute. Some proponents of the theory claim that historic descriptions of the stone do not match the present stone. In the Treaty of Northampton 1328, between the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England, England agreed to return the captured stone to Scotland; riotous crowds prevented it from being removed from Westminster Abbey.Brown, Christopher \"Bannockburn 1314\" The stone remained in England for another six centuries, even after James VI of Scotland assumed the English throne as James I of England. For the next century, the Stuart kings and queens of Scotland once again sat on the stone but at their coronation as kings and queens of England. On 11 June 1914, suffragettes protesting for women's rights placed a small explosive device nearby the Coronation Chair and Stone and the explosion caused visible damage to the chair. ===Removal=== On Christmas Day 1950, a group of four Scottish students (Ian Hamilton, Gavin Vernon, Kay Matheson, and Alan Stuart) removed the stone from Westminster Abbey for return to Scotland. During the removal process, the stone broke into two pieces. After burying the greater part of the Stone in a Kent field, where they camped for a few days, they uncovered the buried stone and returned to Scotland, along with a new accomplice, John Josselyn. According to one US diplomat who was posted in Edinburgh at the time, the stone was hidden for a short time in a trunk in the basement of the Consulate's Public Affairs Officer, unknown to him, before it was removed. The smaller piece was similarly brought north at a later time. The entire stone was passed to a senior Glasgow politician, who arranged for it to be professionally repaired by Glasgow stonemason Robert Gray. A major search for the stone was ordered by the British Government, but proved unsuccessful. The custodians left the stone on the altar of Arbroath Abbey on 11 April 1951, in the safekeeping of the Church of Scotland. Once the London police were informed of its whereabouts, the stone was returned to Westminster four months after it had been removed. Afterwards, rumours circulated that copies had been made of the stone, and that the returned stone was not the original. ===Return to Scotland=== In 1996, in a symbolic response to growing dissatisfaction among Scots at the prevailing constitutional settlement, the British Government decided that the stone should be kept in Scotland when not in use at coronations. On 3 July 1996, Prime Minister John Major announced to the House of Commons that the stone would be returned to Scotland. On 15 November 1996, after a handover ceremony at the border between representatives of the Home Office and of the Scottish Office, it was transported to Edinburgh Castle. An official handover ceremony occurred in the Castle on 30 November 1996, St Andrew's Day, to mark the arrival of the stone. Prince Andrew, Duke of York, representing Queen Elizabeth II, formally handed over the Royal Warrant transferring the stone into the safekeeping of the Commissioners for the Regalia.The ceremonial of the day: It currently remains alongside the crown jewels of Scotland, the Honours of Scotland, in the Crown Room. ===Future public display=== The public are to be asked for their views on the preferred future location for public display of the Stone of Scone. Two options have been proposed \u2013 featuring as the centrepiece of a proposed new museum in Perth, a \u00a323m redevelopment of the former Perth City Hall, or remaining at its present location at Edinburgh Castle in a major redevelopment of the existing display. This is currently the subject of a public consultation published by the Scottish Government. ==In popular culture== * The Stone of Scone's removal from Westminster Abbey and return to Scotland is the subject of the 2008 film Stone of Destiny, with Charlie Cox as Ian Hamilton, who also appears in a cameo role in the film. * The same incident appears in an episode of Highlander: The Series. * It also appears in the final two episodes of Hamish Macbeth, \"Destiny\" parts 1 and 2. * The Stone is prominently featured in a scene from the 2010 film The King's Speech before the coronation of George VI. * In Sir Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, The Fifth Elephant novel features the theft of the \"Scone of Stone\", an ancient bread on which a dwarf king takes seat for his coronation. *Andrew Greig's 2008 novel Romanno Bridge is about a quest for the real Stone of Scone. *August Derleth featured the removal and return of the stone in his short story \"The Adventure of the Stone of Scone\", included in one of the collections of his Sherlock Holmes pastiches, featuring his fictional detective Solar Pons.
