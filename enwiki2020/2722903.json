    "text": "Lobal Orning was a record and book store located in the mountains north of the Pacific Coast Highway in the small community of Topanga, California, United States. It sold a selection of music and books, from classic literature to pulp. The store was described by local press as \"one of Topanga\u2019s unfortunately best-kept secrets\". The store was run by rock musician Justin Chancellor of the band Tool, and his wife Shelee Dykman, who coined the phrase \"lobal orning\" which meant \"to decorate the mind\", in the sense of ornamenting the lobes of the brain. The store closed March 1, 2008. ==References== Category:Bookstores in California Category:Topanga, California Category:Independent bookstores of the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Los Angeles County, California Category:Music retailers of the United States Category:Retail buildings in California Category:Tool (band) Category:Retail companies established in 2003 Category:Retail companies disestablished in 2008 Category:2003 establishments in California Category:2009 disestablishments in California ",
