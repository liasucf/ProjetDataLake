    "text": ":In this name, the family name is Pretyman (before 1803), Pretyman Tomline (from 1803), but commonly called Tomline thereafter. Sir George Pretyman Tomline, 5th Baronet (born George Pretyman; 9 October 1750 \u2013 14 November 1827) was an English clergyman, theologian, Bishop of Lincoln and then Bishop of Winchester, and confidant of William Pitt the Younger. He was an opponent of Catholic emancipation. ==Early life== He was born George Pretyman in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk to a family claiming to have been influential in the region as far back as the fourteenth century. His father, also George Pretyman (1722\u20131810) was a landowner and wool merchant. His mother, George's wife, was Susan n\u00e9e Hubbard (1720/1721\u20131807). Pretyman attended Bury St Edmunds Grammar School and then Pembroke College, Cambridge, graduating in 1772 as senior wrangler and Smith's prizewinner. He was elected a fellow of Pembroke in 1773. He was ordained deacon in 1774 and priest in 1776: by Philip Yonge, Bishop of Norwich at his Palace's chapel on 14 August 1774 and by John Hinchliffe, Bishop of Peterborough at Trinity College, Cambridge on 16 June 1776. William Pitt the Younger was sent to Pembroke in 1773, at the age of fourteen, and Pretyman became his tutor and gradually his friend and confidant.Hague (2005) p27 When Pitt unsuccessfully stood for election as Member of Parliament for Cambridge University in the 1780 British general election, Pretyman supported him. Pitt became Prime Minister of Great Britain in December 1783 when the Fox-North Coalition fell but it remained for him to win the 1784 British general election. On his 1784 victory, Pitt made Pretyman his private secretary, though the title was thought inappropriate for a clergyman. Pretyman's mathematical ability was soon called upon in advising Pitt on the sinking fund and other technicalities of fiscal policy. On 3 September 1784, Pretyman married Elizabeth Maltby (died 13 June 1826), cousin of Edward Maltby, the future Bishop of Chichester and himself eighth wrangler, and appointed Edward his domestic chaplain.Varley, E. A. (2004) \"Maltby, Edward (1770\u20131859)\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, accessed 11 Aug 2007 (subscription required) George and Elizabeth were well-matched and he constantly consulted her on church and political issues. On 17 March 1785 Tomline was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. ==Bishop of Lincoln== In 1787, Pitt appointed Pretyman Bishop of Lincoln, having to overcome the opposition of George III who objected to Pretyman's youth. Having already become Dean of St Paul's (he was instituted to the Portpoole prebend by Robert Lowth, Bishop of London on 21 February 1787), his election was confirmed by John Moore, Archbishop of Canterbury, at St Mary-le-Bow on 10 March 1787 and he was consecrated a bishop by Moore (assisted by William Ashburnham, Bishop of Chichester; Shute Barrington, Bishop of Salisbury and Beilby Porteus, Bishop of Chester) at Lambeth Palace chapel on 11 March 1787. Pretyman maintained on close terms with Pitt, though Lincoln duties kept him from frequent visits to London, and shared Whig attitudes. In a sermon to the House of Lords on 30 January 1789, Pretyman condemned Charles I, executed by parliament in 1649, and praised his political opponents. John Wesley wrote to Pretyman in 1790 accusing him of driving the 'people called Methodists' out of the established church.http://wesley.nnu.edu/john-wesley/the-letters-of-john- wesley/wesleys-letters-1790a Pretyman continued to advise Pitt on finance and on Pitt's Ecclesiastical Plan. Pretyman was an opponent of Catholic emancipation and was against Pitt's 1801 decision to resign when he failed to effect the changes promised to the Irish Catholics in the compromises made over the passage of the Act of Union 1800. Henry Addington's regime was still less to Pretyman's taste and his anti-Catholic sentiments strengthened. However, he remained on good terms with Pitt and was ready to help him out of his debts. ==Pitt's second ministry== Already wealthy, in 1803 he inherited extensive property from the unrelated, Marmaduke Tomline, and took the name Tomline. Pitt returned to government in 1804 and, much to Tomline's satisfaction, promoted Tomline as Archbishop of Canterbury, even though there was an earlier provisional agreement with the King that Charles Manners-Sutton should be appointed. However, the King was not to be man\u0153uvred and exercised his royal prerogative to appoint Manners-Sutton. Tomline was offered the post of Bishop of London in 1813 but declined because he thought the duties too onerous. He was translated to Bishop of Winchester by the confirmation of his election (by Manners-Sutton) on 15 August 1820. ==Family and death== Memorial in Winchester Cathedral Tomline had inherited further property before he died of apoplexy at Kingston Hall, near Wimborne, Dorset and his estate was worth \u00a3200,000 (). He was buried in Winchester Cathedral. His monument was sculpted by Richard Westmacott (the younger).Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660\u20131851, Rupert Gunnis Tomline and his wife had three sons but they relinquished their claim to the baronetcy: *William Edward Tomline (1787\u20131836),Gooding (2003) MP for, successively, Christchurch, Truro, and Minehead. *George-Thomas Tomline, became Chancellor of Lincoln and prebendary of Winchester. *Richard Tomline, his third son, became precentor of Lincoln. ==Works== Tomline published the following works: *Elements of Christian Theology (1799), 2 vols., with the 12th and last edition printed in 1826. It was designed for candidates for ordination. Henry Stebbing published a revision, in 1843. *A Refutation of Calvinism (1803), the 8th and final edition printed in 1823. This was a controversial work, causing a debate that involved Thomas Scott, Edward Williams, John Chetwode Eustace, and some anonymous writers. *Memoir of the Life of the Right Honorable William Pitt, 2 vols. (John Murray, Albemarle- Street, London, 1821). It goes no further than 1793. ==Personality== He was an able administrator to his diocese, conducting eleven visitations during his thirty three years tenure. Though he appeared somewhat aloof in public, Tomline was a devoted family man and genial enough given the right company. From 1806, he was conservative as to his attitudes to church and state but was well respected by someone of as different an outlook as Samuel Parr. ==Offices and honours== *Sinecure rectory of Corwen, Merioneth, (1782); *Canon of Westminster, (1784); *Doctor of Divinity, University of Cambridge, (1784); *Rector of Sudbourn-cum-Offord, (1785); *Fellow of the Royal Society, (1785); *Dean of St Paul's, (1787\u20131820); *Charles I had originally conferred a Nova Scotia baronetcy on John Pretyman but it had been dormant since 1749. In February 1823, Tomline's claim to the baronetcy was confirmed and he became Sir George Pretyman Tomline, 5th Baronet. ==Styles and titles== *1750\u20131774: George Pretyman Esq. *1774\u20131784: The Reverend George Pretyman *1784\u20131787: The Reverend Canon Dr George Pretyman *1787\u20131787: The Very Reverend Dr George Pretyman *1787\u20131803: The Right Reverend Dr George Pretyman *1803\u20131823: The Right Reverend Dr George Pretyman Tomline *1823\u20131827: The Right Reverend Dr Sir George Pretyman Tomline, Baronet == References == ==Sources== *Obituary: **The Gentleman's Magazine, 1st ser., 98/1 (1828), 201\u20134 \\---- * * * (Accessed 27 July 2015) *\u2014 (2005) \"Sir George Pretyman-Tomline: Ecclesiastical Politician and Theological Polemicist\" in * * * *Payne, R.
