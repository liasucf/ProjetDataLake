    "text": "Francisco \"Paco\" Calder\u00f3n (born 1959 in Mexico City) is a Mexican political cartoonist. He currently draws for the newspapers that belong to the Grupo Reforma. Calder\u00f3n began his career in 1976 publishing in national newspaper El Heraldo de M\u00e9xico and later in Exc\u00e9lsior. From 1983 he was published in Monterrey's El Norte and later other newspapers belonging to Grupo Reforma as well as Mural (Guadalajara), Palabra (Saltillo) and other newspapers and magazines. Calder\u00f3n has participated in several radio and television programs, narrating the biographies of historical figures as well as giving political commentary. He was awarded the National Journalism Prize in 1992 in the cartoon category and in 2004 for his editorial column \"Calder\u00f3n en Reforma\". In 1994 Madrid's University of Alcal\u00e1 named him Honorary Professor \"Humoris Causa\"; that same year the United States' Library of Congress acquired ten of his books. He has published several books, the most notable of which are El Descontrol de Precios (\"The unbalance of prices\") and La Lata del Domingo (\"Sunday's Drag\"). Unlike most Mexican cartoonists, Mr. Calderon sternly supports free market economics and policies. Due to his criticism of the Mexican Left and its leader Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the latter dubbed him \"monero de la derecha\" (\"right-wing doodler\"). The artist Paco Calder\u00f3n is not related to Mexico's former ex-President Felipe Calder\u00f3n. ==External links== * Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Mexican cartoonists Category:Mexican editorial cartoonists Category:Mexican caricaturists Category:Mexican journalists Category:People from Mexico City ",
