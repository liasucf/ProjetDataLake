In Spain, it was called \"The Disaster of '98\"). The Siege of Baler lasted from 1 July 1898 to 2 June 1899. During these 11 months, the Spaniards were isolated in a church that became their fortified position. The Spanish troops were a small garrison of 50 soldiers from the \"2\u00ba de Cazadores\" under the charge of Lieutenant D. Juan Alonso Zayas. They faced approximately 800 rebel soldiers. The Spanish soldiers fortified the church and resisted the constant attacks of the rebels for 11 months without provisions. ==Cast== *Armando Calvo as Teniente Mart\u00edn Cerezo *Jos\u00e9 Nieto as Capit\u00e1n Enrique de las Morenas *Guillermo Mar\u00edn as Doctor Rogelio Vigil *Manolo Mor\u00e1n as Pedro Vila *Juan Calvo as Cabo Olivares *Fernando Rey as Juan Chamizo *Manuel Kayser as Fray C\u00e1ndido *Carlos Mu\u00f1oz as Santamar\u00eda *Jos\u00e9 Miguel Rupert as Mois\u00e9s *Pablo \u00c1lvarez Rubio as Herrero, el desertor *Nani Fern\u00e1ndez as Tala *Emilio Ruiz de C\u00f3rdoba as El Correo *C\u00e9sar Guzm\u00e1n as Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda Quijano *Alfonso de Horna as Marquiado *Manuel Arb\u00f3 as G\u00f3mez Ortiz ==See also== *Baler - A 2008 Philippine film. *1898, Our Last Men in the Philippines - A 2016 Spanish film. ==External links== * *Movie of Los \u00faltimos de Filipinas at Google videos *Los \u00faltimos de Filipinas Website (in English and Spanish) Category:1945 films Category:1940s historical films Category:Spanish films Category:Spanish historical films Category:Spanish- language films Category:Spanish biographical films Category:Spanish black-and- white films Category:Spanish\u2013American War films Category:Films set during the Philippine\u2013American War Category:Films set in the Philippines Category:Films shot in the Philippines Category:Philippine war films Category:Siege films Category:1940s biographical films ",
