It was unveiled by Renault at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show. The Fluence Z.E. is outfitted with a 22 kWh lithium-ion battery which allows a total all-electric range of measured on the NEDC combined cycle, with speeds up to . The Fluence Z.E. was the first electric car enabled with battery swapping technology and deployed within the Better Place network in Israel and Denmark in 2012. A total of 948 Fluence Z.E. cars were deployed in Israel and around 400 units sold in Denmark by May 2013, when Better Place filed for bankruptcy. The Fluence Z.E., called SM3 ZE in South Korea, was the most numerous electric car of the South Korean car parc at the time, with 1,604 SM3 ZE sold till December 2015. Global sales totaled 10,600 units through December 2019, including SM3 ZE models. ==Specifications== The lithium-ion battery had a capacity of 22 kWh and weighed . The Fluence Z.E. is longer than the internal combustion model to accommodate the battery behind the rear seats. The planned Renault battery plant near Paris that was to supply batteries for the vehicle was delayed due to technical constraints. Construction will start in the second quarter of 2012 and production of batteries is expected to be delayed to 2014 or 2015. Instead, Renault planned to buy batteries from a joint venture between Nissan Motor and NEC, and from LG Chem of South Korea. Battery charging capabilities included: * using 10 A 220-240 V household mains power from a standard electrical outlet in 10\u201312 hours * using 16 A with a 3 kW public charge spot or specifically installed home charging spot in 6\u20139 hours * the battery uses a \"QuickDrop\" system that allows it to be quickly switched for a charged battery at a dedicated battery exchange facility. The Fluence Z.E. used a synchronous electric motor with rotor coil, weighing . Its peak power is at 11,000rpm, while maximum torque is . The Fluences used a PRND gate selector as well as providing a small amount of creep in 'D' to emulate the behaviour of traditional internal combustion engine equipped automatic transmission cars. ===Safety=== This test drive of the Renault Fluence Z.E. demonstrates its quietness. ==Better Place battery swap== Parade of Renault Fluence Z.E. electric cars enabled with battery swapping technology to commemorate the first deliveries to Better Place employees in Israel in January 2012. Better Place and Renault announced the Fluence Z.E. was the first modern electric car with a swappable battery available on the Better Place electric vehicle network with (QuickDrop) battery swapping technology. Battery switching or swapping is a technology that enables the driver to swap a depleted battery with a fully charged one by going through a battery switch station. In a demonstration with electric taxi cabs run in Tokyo until the end of 2010, the trial battery switch station allowed drivers to exchange their car's depleted battery pack for a fully recharged one in 59.1 seconds on average. In August 2010 Better Place announced a non-binding order of 100,000 Renault Fluence ZE and four months later Better Place claimed to have sold 70,000 cars from that order, a year away from the public launch of the Better Place network. Better Place's battery switching Station in Israel Better Place customers needed only to drive up to the entrance of a battery switch station to start the switch process. The Oscar in-car navigation system uses a WiFi connection to communicate with the station's computers and an RFID tag on the windscreen of the subscriber's car identifies it. The barrier opens and the customer drives up to a mark. The dashboard screen and external monitors then give instructions to select Neutral and turn off the ignition. The remaining process is fully automated, similar to going through a car wash, so the driver never has to leave the car. In just a few minutes, a robot beneath the car removes the depleted battery and replaces it with a full one. Once complete, instruction is given to restart the car and an exit barrier lifts. After implementing the first modern commercial deployment of the battery swapping model in Israel and Denmark, Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel in May 2013. The company's financial difficulties were caused by the high investment required to develop the charging and swapping infrastructure, about million in private capital, and a market penetration significantly lower than originally predicted by Shai Agassi.Less than 1,000 Fluence Z.E.s were deployed in Israel and around 400 units in Denmark through May 2013. ==Markets== Fluence Z.E.
