    "text": "\"Gets Me Through\" is the first track from the 2001 album Down to Earth by heavy metal vocalist Ozzy Osbourne in which he thanks his fans and attempts to set the record straight that his stage persona is precisely that and nothing more, stating, \"I'm not the Anti-Christ or the Iron Man\". The single peaked at number eighteen on the UK Singles Chart and number two on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. In Metal Edge magazine's 2001 Readers' Choice Awards, it won \"Music Video of the Year\" and tied with Slipknot's \"Left Behind\" for \"Song of the Year.\"Metal Edge, June 2002 ==Music video== Two versions of the video exist. The first version was banned from MTV, due to it pictures featuring of flames, destruction, and a room of pigeons being killed and bleeding to death. After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, Osbourne made a cut version of the video, removing most of the flames and destruction, as well as the pigeon scene, though a clip featuring a television set exploding was still kept in. ==Personnel== *Ozzy Osbourne - vocals *Zakk Wylde - guitar *Robert Trujillo - bass *Mike Bordin - drums *Tim Palmer - keyboards Music Video Director: Jonas Akerlund == References == ==External links== * Category:Ozzy Osbourne songs Category:2001 singles Category:Songs written by Ozzy Osbourne Category:Songs written by Tim Palmer Category:2001 songs Category:Music videos directed by Jonas \u00c5kerlund ",
