    "text": "The term Dakshinachara (Right-Hand Path) is a technical term used to refer to Tantric sects that do not engage in heterodox practices. In contrast, Vamachara (Left-Hand Path) is used to describe particular tantric practices that are considered heterodox according to usual Hindu social norms. ==Etymology== N. N. Bhattacharyya explains the Sanskrit technical term ' as follows: > The means of spiritual attainment which varies from person to person > according to competence.... \u0100c\u0101ras are generally of seven kinds \u2013 Veda, > Vai\u1e63\u1e47ava, \u015aaiva, Dak\u1e63i\u1e47a, V\u0101ma, Siddh\u0101\u1e47ta, and Kaula, falling into two broad > categories \u2013 Dak\u1e63i\u1e47a and V\u0101ma. Interpretations vary regarding the nature and > grouping of the \u0101c\u0101ras.Bhattacharyya (1999) pp. 368-69. ' mans \"right\".Macdonell, A. A. (1996) p. 115. For this reason, the term Dak\u1e63i\u1e47\u0101ra is often translated \"Right-hand practice\". ==Practices== The Brahma Yamala, a Tantric text, says there are three currents of tradition (dakshina, vama, and madhyama) characterized respectively by the predominance of each of the three gunas (sattva, rajas, and tamas). According to this text, dakshina is characterized by sattva, and is pure; Madhyama, characterized by rajas, is mixed; and Vama, characterized by tamas, is impure. The Tantras of each class follow a particular line of spiritual practices.Bagchi, P. C. \"Evolution of the Tantras\" in: Prabhananda (2000) pp. 13-14. Dakshinachara consists of traditional Hindu practices such as asceticism and meditation. ==See also== * Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path * Pa\u00f1caratra * Tantra ==Notes== ==References== *Bhattacharya, N.
