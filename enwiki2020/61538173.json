During the 2018\u201319 season, Hamburg spent most of the first half of the season atop the 2.

Pierre-Michel Lasogga lead Hamburg in goals during the campaign scoring 19 goals across all competitions. == Players == == Transfers == === Transfers in === === Loans in === === Transfers out === === Loans out === == Non-competitive == === Pre-season exhibitions === === Midseason exhibitions === === Post-season exhibitions === == Competitive == === 2.
