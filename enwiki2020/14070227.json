    "text": "The Sunday Lecture Society was founded by T.H. Huxley and others. He, a self- styled \"scientific Calvinist,\" emerged in November 1869 to chair the Society, which was a broad coalition offering weekly uplift to London's working classes in St. George's Hall, Langham Place, London. However then within months a Christian Evidence Society was formed under the chairmanship of the second Earl of Harrowby. The society swiftly mobilized a phalanx of prelates to give apologetic lectures at the same venue, beginning with a deliverance by the Lord Archbishop of York on \"design in nature.\" To no avail.

Others who addressed the society included: * Karl Pearson * William Ralston Shedden-Ralston Category:Clubs and societies in London ",
