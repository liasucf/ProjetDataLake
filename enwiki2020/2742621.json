    "text": "The Celestial Church of Christ is an African Initiated Church founded by Samuel Bilewu Joseph Oshoffa on 29 September 1947 in Porto-Novo, Benin. It is mainly located in Africa and in the Afro-descendant communities in the world, particularly in Benin and Nigeria. ==History== The movement was founded by Samuel Bilewu Joseph Oshoffa, a former carpenter born in Dahomey (now Benin) in 1909. Raised as Protestant (Methodism), he had a divine revelation on 27 May 1947, during a solar eclipse, in a forest where he was lost. He felt called to pray, to heal the sick, and to raise the dead, and he founded his church in September 1947. Having appointed himself through the guidance the Prophet, Reverend, Pastor, and Founder, he occupied the highest office of the movement he had just founded. The hegemony he exercised on doctrine and discipline issues made succession difficult after his death in 1985 in Lagos, Nigeria. The Celestial Church of Christ (CCC) was recognized and authorized by the Republic of Dahomey (former name of Benin) in 1965. From 1976, the church launched an evangelistic campaign in the former colony of the French West Africa, which became independent in 1960. From the late 1990s, this church has shown its willingness to use the Internet as a privileged means of evangelization thus allowing the many existing branches of the church within the African Diaspora (United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, France, USA) to maintain contact with each other and with Nigeria, the country in which the church is the most popular. The movement has continued to grow since Oshoffa's death, but has also suffered setbacks\u2014the most immediate being severe difficulties related to the matter of succession. Oshoffa was succeeded by Alexander Abiodun Adebayo Bada, who was head of the church until his death on 8 September 2000. Bada was briefly followed as leader by Philip Hunsu Ajose, who died in March 2001. There was a dispute over the succession to Ajose, with some declaring Gilbert Oluwatosin Jesse the leader, while the majority recognised the Reverend Emmanuel Oshoffa, son of Samuel Oshoffa. Following Jesse's death, his faction declared that Superior Evangelist Paul Suru Maforikan was the new spiritual leader of the church. Contrary to the procedure of succession in Nigeria, Porto-Novo, the supreme headquarters, successfully chose Benoit Agbaossi (1931\u20132010) to the head of the church, who in his turn appointed Benoit Adeogun as the next Rev. Pastor shortly before his death in 2010. ==Imeko Convocation== Every December (usually, between 5-7 days preceding Christmas), the church hosts an international event called Imeko Convocation, held in spirit and belief of pilgrimage. It is mandated that every member of Celestial Church of Christ all over the word attends annually. The church believes the event attendance is a mandate, given through the founder of the church, Samuel Bilewu Joseph Oshoffa, after declarations that God had chosen Imeko as the New Jerusalem for the fold. ==Beliefs== The Celestial Church of Christ is prophetic with Christian background. The faithful are called \u201cCelestians\u201d, and the church is sometimes informally called \u201cCele\u201d. The official name of the church is inspired by a vision by which Jesus would have said that Church members adore him as do the angels in heaven. The name of the church comes from Deuteronomy 26:15 \"Look down from thy Holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel and the land which thou hast given us, as thou didst swear to our father, a land flowing with milk and honey\". The name signifies that they deem themselves as celestial or a representative of the heavenly on Earth. The church claims inspiration from God through the manifestation of the Holy Spirit among the faithful. Its doctrinal teachings are based on the Bible, and any superstition or animist belief from traditional African religions is excluded, as in other churches in the Aladura movement. The church is governed by twelve major recommendations, consisting several banned things, including food, common to other monotheistic religions. Tobacco, alcohol and eating pork are forbidden. The faithful must remove their shoes for prayer and in the places of worship. Men and women are separated at the church. Menstruating women and those who have recently given birth are unclean and cannot attend church events for seven days in the first case after which they would be \"sanctified\". Members of Celestial Church of Christ are forbidden to engage or participate in any form of idolatory, fetish ceremony or cults, black magic and charms. Only men who are \"anointed\" are allowed access to the altar. The church uses all English bibles and the Yoruba translated versions. Although the church takes elements from Gungbe and Yoruba thought, it also has strong similarities to the \"purification movements\" against paganism that are relatively common in African Christianity. Oshoffa believed he had a mission to combat \"'Satan', 'fetish priests' and other 'powers of darkness'.\"(Marburg colloquy) == Architecture == The temples of worship always face east. An altar stand has seven candle holders that represent the seven spirits of Jehovah as represented in Rev. 4:5. The church auditorium also has different rows for male and female seats. But on days that services are observed during the week like the Wednesday and the Friday services another alter is made which has 3 candles rather than 7. ==Reception== In 2001, it was the second largest church in Benin by the number of its practitioners (nearly half a million). ==Bibliography== * Pierre Ndjom, Lumi\u00e8re sur l'Eglise du Christianisme C\u00e9leste, Paris (France), 2016, 283 p. * Apollinaire Adetonah, Lumi\u00e8re sur le Christianisme C\u00e9leste, 1972, 85 p. * Christine Henry, Pierre-Joseph Laurent and Andr\u00e9 Mary, \u00ab Du vin nouveau dans de vieilles outres : parcours d'un dissident du Christianisme C\u00e9leste (B\u00e9nin) \u00bb, in Social Compass, 2001, vol. 48, no 3, pp. 353\u201368 * Christine Henry, La force des anges : rites, hi\u00e9rarchie et divination dans le Christianisme C\u00e9leste, B\u00e9nin, Brepols, Turnhout (Belgique), 2008, 280 p.
