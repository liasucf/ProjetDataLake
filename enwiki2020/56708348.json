He is the eldest son of Rabbi Moshe-Zvi Neria, a major figure in the religious-Zionist movement in Israel. Neriya was a candidate for Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem, and was awarded a Jerusalem Prize for his activities in Kiruv (Jewish outreach). A Torah scroll was dedicated to the yeshiva in his honor in 2013, where many major rabbinic figures from around Israel came to celebrate Neriya's life and work. ==References== Category:Israeli rabbis Category:Religious Zionist rosh yeshivas Category:1941 births Category:People from the West Bank Category:Living people Category:Jerusalem Prize recipients ",
