The grounds are open every day, sunrise to sunset, without charge. ==History== In 1902, Dr. Arthur Tracey Cabot (b. 1852 in Boston to Dr. Samuel Cabot III and Hannah Lowell Jackson Cabot) hired architect Charles A. Platt to design a country house with landscaping and outlying farm buildings. Its formal grounds include lawns, a walled garden, and a parterre. Dr. Cabot had seven siblings, but no children. The estate was passed on to his niece, Eleanor Cabot (daughter of his brother, Godfrey Lowell Cabot), who married Major Ralph Bradley in 1919. In 1945, she added ponds, a camellia house and greenhouse, and planted specimen trees. Additional land includes more than of meadows and woods, with some of walking trails. The property was acquired through a bequest of Eleanor Cabot Bradley in 1991. ==Gallery== File:Bradley Estate trail 133440326.jpg|Walking trail File:Kitchen Garden at Bradley Estate 134126707.jpg|Kitchen garden == References == ==External links== *The Trustees of Reservation: Bradley Estate Category:Cabot family Category:The Trustees of Reservations Category:Houses in Norfolk County, Massachusetts Category:Historic house museums in Massachusetts Category:Parks in Norfolk County, Massachusetts Category:Buildings and structures in Canton, Massachusetts Category:Protected areas established in 1991 Category:1991 establishments in Massachusetts Category:Gardens in Massachusetts ",
