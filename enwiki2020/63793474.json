Midway through the first round, Hearns had opened up a cut above Barkley's left eye, and by the end of the second Barkley had a cut above both his right eye and lower lip. In round three, Barkley got off to a quick start, but Hearns took control and hammered Barkley with body shots throughout the round. However, in the final minute of the round, Hearns threw a left jab and then briefly dropped his hands as he attempted to move to his left when Barkley caught him flush with a powerful right hand and then landed another as Hearns fell to the canvas. Clearly hurt from the exchange, Hearns struggled to get back up and barely answered the referee's 10-count. Hearns was allowed to continue, but was immediately met with a barrage from Barkley which sent him through the ropes. Referee Richard Steele would step in and stop the fight giving Barkley the victory at 2:39 of the round.Barkley Stuns Hearns in 3d, NY Times article, 1988-06-07, Retrieved on 2020-04-28 The Ring magazine named the fight their Upset of the Year for 1988.FROM THE ARCHIVE: ON THIS DAY: IRAN BARKLEY UPSETS THOMAS HEARNS FOR WBC MIDDLEWEIGHT TITLE, The Ring TV, 2019-06-06, Retrieved on 2020-04-28 ==Fight card== {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size: 85%;\" |- ! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Weight Class ! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Weight ! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| ! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| vs. ! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text- align:center;\"| ! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Method ! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Round ! style=\"background:#e6e8fa; color:#000; text-align:center;\"| Notes |- |Middleweight |160 lb |Iran Barkley |def. |Thomas Hearns (c) |align=center|TKO |align=center|3/12 | |- |Super Lightweight |140 lb |Roger Mayweather (c) |def. |Harold Brazier |align=center|SD |align=center|12/12 |- |Light Heavyweight |175 lb |Virgil Hill (c) |def. |Ramzi Hassan |align=center|UD |align=center|12/12 |- |Super Bantamweight |122 lb |Fabrice Benichou |def. |Efren Chavez |align=center|UD |align=center|8/8 |- |Light Heavyweight |175 lb |Michael Moorer |def. |Keith McMurray |align=center|TKO |align=center|2/4 |} ==References== Category:1988 in boxing Category:Boxing matches Category:1988 in sports in Nevada Category:Boxing on Showtime Category:Boxing in Las Vegas Category:June 1988 sports events in the United States ",
