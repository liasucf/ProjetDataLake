Yang returned to the New York stage in 1998 as Whizzer in NAATCO's non-traditional casting of William Finn's Falsettoland. The production was lauded for its universal appeal and The New York Times added that \"it's Mr. Yang as the cocky, athletic Whizzer who delivers the most smashing performance. He's persuasive from start to finish as the boy toy who becomes a man in the arms of Marvin and the hospital bed he's confined to after developing AIDS. His angry anthem You Gotta Die Sometime is equal parts fire and frustration and further confirmation that Mr. Finn's ethnically specific work can in fact be a moving, multicultural experience.\"Marks, Peter. \"THEATER REVIEW; It's Family That Matters, No Matter What Family.\" 'The New York Times. July 17, 1998. p. 2. Yang has also appeared in numerous television shows such as Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, As the World Turns, National Geographic Explorer and Ghostwriter.
