    "text": "Old Laund Booth is a civil parish in the Pendle district of Lancashire, England. It has a population of 1,459, and contains the villages of Fence and Wheatley Lane. Old Laund Booth was once a township in the ancient parish of Whalley. This became a civil parish in 1866, forming part of the Burnley Rural District from 1894 (until 1974). Until 1898 when the parish was enlarged, part of Goldshaw Booth and a detached area Higham with West Close Booth, divided the township into two parts with Fence in the eastern and Wheatley Lane and Old Laund hall in the western. In 1935 the civil parish of Wheatley Carr Booth was abolished and the area also joined this parish. The parish adjoins the Pendle parishes of Roughlee Booth, Barrowford, Nelson, Brierfield, Reedley Hallows, Higham-with-West Close Booth and Goldshaw Booth. Higher areas of the parish, north-east of the villages are part of the Forest of Bowland Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). According to the United Kingdom Census 2011, the parish has a population of 1,459, a decrease from 1,586 in the 2001 census.Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Pendle Retrieved 2009-09-18 ==Media gallery== Image:'Ye Old Sparrow Hawk', Barrowford Road, Wheatley Lane, Lancashire - geograph.org.uk - 687733.jpg|Ye Old Sparrow Hawk, Wheatley Lane Image:St Anne's Church, Fence - geograph.org.uk - 427402.jpg|St Anne's Church, Fence Image:Inghamite Church, Wheatley Lane - geograph.org.uk - 104361.jpg|Inghamite Church, Wheatley Lane Image:Wheatley Lane, Lancashire - The 'White Swan' - geograph.org.uk - 1732540.jpg|The White Swan, Wheatley Lane ==See also== *Listed buildings in Old Laund Booth ==References== Citations ==External links== *Map of modern parish boundary at Lancashire County Council website *Old Laund Booth township - British History Online *Wheatley Carr Booth township - British History Online Category:Civil parishes in Lancashire Category:Geography of the Borough of Pendle ",
