    "text": "\"Something to Talk About\" is a song written by Canadian singer-songwriter Shirley Eikhard and recorded by Bonnie Raitt in 1990, for her 1991 album Luck of the Draw. It was released to U.S. radio on June 3, 1991. Three single versions were released: the promo b/w the same song; the 7\" single b/w \"One Part Be My Lover\" a song written by Raitt with her then husband actor Michael O'Keefe, which was also off Luck of the Draw; and a 12\" single with these two songs and \"I Ain\u2019t Gonna Let You Break My Heart Again\" off her previous album Nick of Time. In turn, this song was included on the EP version of Raitt\u2019s 2000 single of \"The Fundamental Things\" taken from her 1998 album Fundamental. It was also included in 2003\u2019s greatest hits compilation The Best of Bonnie Raitt. Live versions also appeared on 1995\u2019s Road Tested and 2006\u2019s Bonnie Raitt and Friends. ==Background== Anne Murray wanted to record this song in 1986, but her producers did not think it would be a hit. She still called the album that she released that year Something to Talk About even though it did not include this song. ==Music video== The video for the song was directed by Matt Mahurin. It features Raitt with two guitarists performing the song at a community event, while other scenes show older couples dancing, people in silly wardrobe acting goofy for a film crew, and many people in a swimming pool. ==Chart performance== The song was popular on multiple formats of radio: it peaked at number 5 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart, number 12 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart, and number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100. It is one of Bonnie Raitt's most popular songs, along with \"I Can't Make You Love Me\". ==Track listing== 7\" Single (1991) # \"Something to Talk About\" \u2013 3:47 # \"One Part Be My Lover\" \u2013 5:06 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1991) !Peak position |- |Australia (ARIA) |align=\"center\"|57 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1991) !Position |- |Canada Top Singles (RPM) |align=\"center\"|18 |- |Canada Adult Contemporary (RPM) |align=\"center\"|33 |- |US Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|55 |} ==Nominations and awards== Raitt won the Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the Grammy Awards of 1992 for her recording of this song (Oleta Adams, Mariah Carey, Amy Grant and Whitney Houston were the other finalists).
