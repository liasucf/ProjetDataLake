It was released in the United States by Central Park Media. ==Plot== Set in the dawning of the 25th century, the earth has undergone changes and technology improved in leaps and bounds, with humanity now colonizing Mars. However, unknown to humanity, there is an ancient race of aliens known as 'The Gods' which have been patiently waiting and watching humanity's progress. They take action and try to halt man's progress into space with extreme force. Although humanity has some very advanced weaponry at their disposal such as highly advanced aircraft, orbital fighters and gigantic desert battleships full of the most amazing array of weapons, will it be enough to stop them? The aliens have impressive weapons of their own, including an unstoppable stealth carrier. Humanity's hope rests on the shoulders of Captain Akuh and the crew of the Battleship Aoba. They are to carry out a top-secret mission against the aliens which, if successful, could mean the end to the war. ==Cast== ===Japanese Cast=== *Hideyuki Tanaka as Captain Akuh *Isshin Chiba as Operator *Kouji Tsujitani as J.
