    "text": "The South Street barrow is a Neolithic long barrow in the English county of Wiltshire near Beckhampton. It lies around 130m (140 yds) south east of the cove of The Longstones and may therefore be connected with the Neolithic ritual landscape centred on Avebury. It was excavated between 1964 and 1966 by Paul Ashbee who found no evidence of burials beneath the barrow and conjectured that it was a kind of cenotaph. He found that it had been built around a number of wicker partitions using alternate layers of white chalk and darker earth. This material was probably excavated from flanking ditches that surrounded the site. Category:History of Wiltshire Category:Stone Age sites in England Category:Archaeological sites in Wiltshire ",
