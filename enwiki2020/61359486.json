    "text": "Wieslochia weissi is an extinct species of passerine bird from the early Oligocene (27.8 - 33.9 Ma) of Germany. Remains of this species have been found in a clay pit in Frauenweiler near Wiesloch, Germany. The holotype is a dissociated skeleton on two slabs. Another specimen consisting on a mandible and a cranium has been found in the same horyzon. The taxonomic affinities of Wieslochia are not well understood as it shares some similarities with suboscines but it seems more primitive in other features. ==References== Category:Passeriformes Category:Monotypic bird genera Category:Oligocene birds Category:Fossil taxa described in 2006 Category:Fossils of Germany Category:Prehistoric bird genera ",
