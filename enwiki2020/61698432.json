    "text": "In applied mathematics, the Morlely\u2013Wang\u2013Xu (MWX) element is a canonical construction of a family of piecewise polynomials with the minimal degree elements for any 2m-th order of elliptic and parabolic equations in any spatial-dimension \\mathbb{R}^n for 1\\leq m \\leq n. The MWX element provides a consistent approximation of Sobolev space H^m in \\mathbb{R}^n. ==Morley\u2013Wang\u2013Xu element== The Morley\u2013Wang\u2013Xu element (T,P_T,D_T) is described as follows. T is a simplex and P_T = P_m(T) . The set of degrees of freedom will be given next. Given an n-simplex T with vertices a_i, for 1\\leq k\\leq n, let \\mathcal{F}_{T,k} be the set consisting of all (n-k)-dimensional subsimplexe of T. For any F \\in \\mathcal{F}_{T,k}, let |F| denote its measure, and let u_{F,1}, \\cdots, u_{F,k} be its unit outer normals which are linearly independent. For 1\\leq k\\leq m, any (n-k)-dimensional subsimplex F\\in \\mathcal{F}_{T,k} and \\beta\\in A_k with |\\beta|=m-k, define : d_{T,F,\\beta}(v) = \\frac{1}{|F|}\\int_F \\frac{\\partial^{|\\beta|v}}{\\partial u_{F,1}^{\\beta_1} \\cdots u_{F,k}^{\\beta_k}}. The degrees of freedom are depicted in Table 1. For m=n=1, we obtain the well-known conforming linear element. For m=1 and n\\geq 2, we obtain the well-known nonconforming Crouziex\u2013Raviart element. For m=2, we recover the well-known Morley element for n=2 and its generalization to n\\geq 2. For m=n=3, we obtain a new cubic element on a simplex that has 20 degrees of freedom. Table 1: m <= n+1: diagrams of the finite elements ==Generalizations== There are two generalizations of Morley\u2013Wang\u2013Xu element (which requires 1\\leq m \\leq n). ===m=n+1: Nonconforming element=== As a nontrivial generalization of Morley\u2013Wang\u2013Xu elements, Wu and Xu propose a universal construction for the more difficult case in which m=n+1. Table 1 depicts the degrees of freedom for the case that n\\leq3, m\\leq n+1. The shape function space is \\mathcal{P}_{n+1}(T)+q_T\\mathcal{P}_1(T), where q_T = \\lambda_1\\lambda_2\\cdots\\lambda_n+1 is volume bubble function. This new family of finite element methods provides practical discretization methods for, say, a sixth order elliptic equations in 2D (which only has 12 local degrees of freedom). In addition, Wu and Xu propose an H^3 nonconforming finite element that is robust for the sixth order singularly perturbed problems in 2D. ===m,n \\geq 1: Interior penalty nonconforming FEMs=== An alternative generalization when m > n is developed by combining the interior penalty and nonconforming methods by Wu and Xu. This family of finite element space consists of piecewise polynomials of degree not greater than m. The degrees of freedom are carefully designed to preserve the weak-continuity as much as possible. For the case in which m>n, the corresponding interior penalty terms are applied to obtain the convergence property. As a simple example, the proposed method for the case in which m = 3, n = 2 is to find u_h\\in V_h, such that : ( abla^3_h u_h, abla^3_h v_h) + \\eta \\sum_{F\\in \\mathcal{F}_h} h_F^{-5}\\int_F [u_h][v_h] = (f,v_h) \\quad \\forall v_h \\in V_h, where the nonconforming element is depicted in Figure 1.
