    "text": "Karl Bermingham (born 6 October 1985 in Clondalkin) is an Irish footballer. He has represented the Republic of Ireland at schoolboy level. ==Career== ===Early career=== Bermingham played for the Irish-based club until moving to Manchester City's youth system. He made his league debut, however, for Lincoln City, where he spent three months on loan at the end of the 2004\u201305 season. At the start of the 2005\u201306 season he made a number of appearances in first team friendlies for Manchester City but did not play any competitive matches. During Autumn 2005 he was loaned out to Burnley, and was released by Manchester City at the end of the 2005\u201306 season. He had an unsuccessful trial with Dunfermline Athletic in July 2006 before signing with Newry City in October, scoring on his debut against Coleraine. ===Return to Ireland=== In early 2007, he was invited to join Derry City on trial prior to the impending kick-off of the 2007 League of Ireland season. Impressing in pre-season, he earned a one-year contract with the Candystripes on 2 February 2007. In July 2007 Bermingham joined Waterford United and made his first appearance for the Blues against Shamrock Rovers on 10 July 2007. He scored his first goal for the Blues during his home debut against Sligo Rovers in a 2\u20131 loss. Bermingham signed for Monaghan United for the 2009 First Division season. In his first season with the Mons, Bermingham scored 17 goals, equalling the club's single season record, held by Andy Myler. The 2010 season was not as successful for Bermingham, with manager Mick Cooke preferring a strikeforce of Sean Brennan and Philly Hughes, but Bermingham still managed to score 10 goals. Bermingham parted company with Monaghan United following the 2010 season. He scored 29 goals in 70 league and cup appearances for the club. On 20 February 2011, Bermingham signed for Shelbourne. Bermingham secured promotion with Shelbourne to the Premier Division in 2011 but struggled to score goals with one goal in 24 league and cup appearances. He also made an appearance for Shelbourne as a substitute during their 2011 FAI Cup final defeat to Sligo Rovers. Bermingham departed Shelbourne at end of 2011 and signed for Longford Town ahead of their First Division campaign in 2012. He was released by Longford at the end of the 2012 season. ==Career statistics== Correct as of 6 November 2011. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !rowspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Lincoln City (loan) |2004\u201305 |FL League 2 |2||0||0||0||0||0||-||-||2||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !2!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!-!!-!!2!!0 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Burnley (loan) |2005\u201306 |FL Championship |4||0||0||0||0||0||-||-||4||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !4!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!-!!-!!4!!0 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Newry City |2006\u201307 |Irish Premier League |5||4||0||0||0||0||-||-||5||4 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !5!!4!!0!!0!!0!!0!!-!!-!!5!!4 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Derry City |2007 |LOI Premier Division |0||0||0||0||1||0||1||0||2||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !0!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0!!1!!0!!2!!0 |- |rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"center\"|Waterford United |2007 |LOI Premier Division |12||1||4||1||0||0||0||0||16||2 |- |2008 |LOI First Division |30||7||1||0||0||0||1||0||32||7 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !42!!8!!5!!1!!0!!0!!1!!0!!48!!9 |- |rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"center\"|Monaghan United |2009 |LOI First Division |30||17||4||0||1||0||-||-||35||17 |- |2010 |LOI First Division |24||10||4||2||5||0||2||0||35||12 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !54!!27!!8!!2!!6!!0!!2!!0!!70!!29 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Shelbourne |2011 |LOI First Division |15||1||3||0||3||0||3||0||24||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !15!!1!!3!!0!!3!!0!!3!!0!!24!!1 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !122!!40!!16!!3!!10!!0!!7!!0!!155!!43 |} Competitions include Setanta Sports Cup, Leinster Senior Cup, Munster Senior Cup and League of Ireland Promotion/Relegation Play-offs ==References== ==External links== *Karl Bermingham's profile at www.shelbournefc.com Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:Association footballers from County Dublin Category:Association football forwards Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers Category:English Football League players Category:NIFL Premiership players Category:League of Ireland players Category:Manchester City F.C. players Category:Lincoln City F.C. players Category:Burnley F.C. players Category:Newry City F.C. players Category:Derry City F.C. players Category:Waterford F.C. players Category:Monaghan United F.C. players Category:Shelbourne F.C. players Category:Belvedere F.C. players Category:Republic of Ireland under-21 international footballers Category:People from Clondalkin ",
