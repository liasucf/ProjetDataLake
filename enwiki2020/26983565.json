    "text": "Gymnobela is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Raphitomidae. This genus can sometimes be hardly differentiated from species in the genera Spergo Dall, 1895, Theta Clarke, 1959 and Speoides yoshidae Kuroda & Habe in Habe, 1961 (a synonym of Gymnobela yoshidae (Kuroda & Habe, 1961) )Stahlschmidt P. & Chino M. (2012) A new species of Gymnobela (Gastropoda: Raphitomidae) from the Central Pacific. Miscellanea Malacologica 5(6): 95-98 This genus is highly diverse. It is rather an artificial assemblage of several unrelated genus-level lineages that are unrelated and mostly undescribed. Criscione, Francesco, et al. (2020) \"Where the snails have no name: a molecular phylogeny of Raphitomidae (Neogastropoda: Conoidea) uncovers vast unexplored diversity in the deep seas of temperate southern and eastern Australia.\" Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. ==Description== The rather solid shell is in form and general appearance like Bela. The spire is generally rather short. The body whorl is swollen. The whorls are often shouldered. The sculpture is rather strong. The protoconch has a fine cancellated sculpture. The subsutural band is not strongly marked. The posterior notch of the lip is shallow and usually not very distinct. The operculum is absent.Verrill A. E. (1884).
