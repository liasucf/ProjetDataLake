    "text": "Daniel Wilson is an American singer, songwriter and record producer from Ypsilanti, Michigan, United States. His debut EP, Young Rubbish, was released in 2014 by the London-based record label Zap Records, and featured production credits by Sam Billen and Ryan Pinkston. His latest release, Boy Who Cried Thunder, was released in November 2014 also on Zap Records. In 2015, he contributed with The Weeknd in co-writing and producing \"Sidewalks\", featuring vocals from Kendrick Lamar, which appears in his third album, entitled Starboy. He has also worked with notable artists, producers and musicians such as Miguel, Twin Shadow, Joe Goddard, ZHU, DJ Dahi, Leo Abrahams among many others. ==Biography== Growing up \"on a diet of gospel, Christian music, musicals and '90s MTV\", Daniel Wilson started his musical trajectory at the age of 13 in a gospel choir. His first solo compositions came to life in 2008 using his mother's old tape recorder and, eventually, switching to cheap computer software. The artist was signed by London-based music label Zap Records in 2013. ==Music== Wilson's music can be described as a sort of \"indie-ish synthetic R&B;, in parts electronic and ecclesiastic\", while his particular crooning skills grant him a \"rare, elastic falsetto\". Musical influences range from Michael and Janet Jackson, Prince, Mariah Carey, and gospel music, and his music can be compared to those recorded by acts including Blood Orange, Bloc Party, and TV on the Radio. ==Discography== ===EPs=== * Young Rubbish (2014), Zap Records * Boy Who Cried Thunder (2014), Zap Records * Sinner of The Week (2016), Zap Records ===Songwriting and production discography=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:160px;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Artist(s) ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:180px;\"| Album ! scope=\"col\" | Credits ! scope=\"col\" | Written with: ! scope=\"col\" | Produced with: |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Home\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2016 | Aurora | All My Demons Greeting Me as a Friend | Co-writer | Thomas Hull | - |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Sidewalks\" | The Weeknd | Starboy | Co-writer/Additional producer | Abel Tesfaye, Martin McKinney, Robert John Richardson, Kendrick Lamar Duckworth, Ali Shaheed Jones- Muhammad | Doc McKinney, Bobby Raps, Ali Shaheed Muhammad |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Home\" | rowspan=\"10\"| 2017 | Joe Goddard | Electric Lines | Co-writer/Featured artist | Joseph Goddard, Gerald Kent | - |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Ouch\" | rowspan=\"9\"| Phlake | rowspan=\"9\"| Weird Invitations | rowspan=\"9\"| Co-writer | Jonathan Elk\u00e6r, Mads Bo Iversen, Gisli Gislason | - |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Gone\" | Jonathan Elk\u00e6r, Mads Bo Inversen, Alina Baraz | - |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"IKEA Episodes\" | Jonathan Elk\u00e6r, Mads Bo Iversen, Gisli Gislason, Scott Effman | - |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"A Weird Invitation\" | Jonathan Elk\u00e6r, Mads Bo Iversen | - |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"The Rascal\" | Jonathan Elk\u00e6r, Mads Bo Iversen | - |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"I Don't Wanna Die Sane\" | Jonathan Elk\u00e6r, Mads Bo Iversen, Alina Baraz | - |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Brush\" | Jonathan Elk\u00e6r, Mads Bo Iversen, Gisli Gislason, JP Saxe, Robin Hannibal | - |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"maybeDOTcom\" | Jonathan Elk\u00e6r, Mads Bo Iversen | - |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Kerosome\" | Jonathan Elk\u00e6r, Mads Bo Iversen, Gisli Gislason | - |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Winnebago\" | rowspan=\"5\"| 2018 | Gryffin | | Featured artist/Co-writer | Daniel Griffith, Luke Niccoli, Justin Raisen, Jeremih Raisen | - |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Guilty Love\" | rowspan=\"2\"| Zhu | rowspan=\"2\"| Ringos Desert | Co-writer | Steven Zhu, Mitch Bell | - |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Burn Babylon\" | Featured artist/Co-writer | Steven Zhu, Mitch Bell, Kezmandi McDonald, Aron Leibowitz | - |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Paper Dreams\" | Jamie N Commons | rowspan=\"2\" | Co-writer | Jamie N Commons, Samuel de Jong | - |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"G.A.L.\" | Touch Sensitive | Featured artist/Co-writer | Michael Di Francesco, Ivan More, Angela Winbush, Margaret Rogers, Greg Kurstin | - |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Sanctuary\" |2019 |Joji |Non-album single |Co-writer |Justin Raisen, Luke Niccoli, George Miller | - |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Run\" |2020 |Joji |Non-album single |Co-writer |Justin Parker, George Miller | - |} ==References== Category:Living people Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American electronic musicians Category:21st-century American singers Category:1990 births ",
