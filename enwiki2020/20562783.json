    "text": "The Lokavibh\u0101ga is a Jain cosmological text originally composed in Prakrit by a Digambara monk, Vasumitra,Encyclopaedia of Jainism By Nagendra Kr Singh, Indo-European Jain Research Foundation, Published by Anmol Publications PVT. LTD., 2001 surviving in a later Sanskrit translation by one Si\u1e43has\u016bri. It was wrongly said by Ifrah to contain the oldest known mention of numeral zero (\"0\") as Khmer numerals from the seventh century also have 0 as a numerical value. However Khmer numerals have separate numerals for 10, 20 etc so are not a decimal positional system and he says it is the oldest known mention of such. Surviving manuscripts of the Lokavibh\u0101ga are listed in v.26 of the New Catalogus Catalogorum. Parts of the Bakhshali Manuscript on arithmetic, which does use a physically written symbol for zero, have been carbon-dated, but the results of this dating are puzzling and are still being debated. The printed edition of the Lokavibh\u0101ga states that the original Prakrit work was composed by Sarvanandin at Patalika in the Banarastra on a certain day the astronomical details of which are given. These correspond to 458 CE. The surviving text is a Sanskrit translation of Sarvanandin's work by one Simhas\u016bri, made \"some considerable time\" after that date of Sarvanandin. ==References== Category:Jain texts Category:Agamas Category:Ancient Indian literature Category:5th-century books Category:458 Category:Indian mathematics Category:5th century in India ",
