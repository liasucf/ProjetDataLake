    "text": "George Airport is an airport located in George, Western Cape, South Africa. It was formerly known as P.W. Botha Airport, named after the state president who lived in this part of the country. This airport was originally built in 1977 as an exact replica of the Keetmanshoop Airport in Namibia, but since its expansion and renovation, it now looks completely different. George Airport has won the award for Africa\u2019s best airport in the category under two million passengers per year six times, the last time 2017. The award is given by Airports Council International (ACI). In 2013, the airport served 560,432 passengers, substantially more than the 154,000 in 2003. From 2014 onwards continued increase in passenger numbers were witnessed, with 2017 recording a record number of passengers of 785,486, closing in on the design capacity of the airport which should necessitate further terminal expansion in the near future. ==Airlines and destinations== ===Passenger=== ===Cargo=== ==Traffic statistics== {| class=\"toccolours sortable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" |+ Annual passenger traffic !
