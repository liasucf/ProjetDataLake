Kresge Lodge. ==YMCA Camp Arbutus/Hayo-Went-Ha for Girls== During the 1980s, attempts were made by the state YMCA to include girls in camping activities. In the early 1990s, a girls' camp was formed at nearby Bows Lake. This facility, however, proved to be insufficient for long term use. The state YMCA then acquired Camp Arbutus (), a camp south of Traverse City, Michigan on Arbutus Lake, which became the new site of YMCA Camp Arbutus Hayo-Went-Ha for Girls. ==External links== *Official Hayo-Went-Ha Camps Website Category:Buildings and structures in Antrim County, Michigan Category:Buildings and structures in Grand Traverse County, Michigan Category:1904 establishments in Michigan Hayo- Went-Ha Hayo-Went-Ha ",
