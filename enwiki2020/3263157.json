    "text": "Bloodstar is an American fantasy comic book. Possibly the first graphic novel to call itself a \u201cgraphic novel\u201d in print (in its introduction and dust jacket), it was based on a short story by Robert E. Howard, the creator of Conan the Barbarian, and illustrated by fantasy artist Sackmann, Eckart (1987). Great Masters of Fantasy Art. Parkwest Pubns. .Garriock, P. R. (1978). Masters of Comic Book Art. Aurum Press, Ltd.. . Richard Corben. The book was published by The Morning Star Press in a limited signed and numbered edition. ==Status as first self-described graphic novel== The front flap of its dust jacket reads: \"BLOODSTAR is a new, revolutionary concept \u2014 a graphic novel, which combines all the imagination and visual power of comic strip art with the richness of the traditional novel.\"Corben, Richard (1976). Bloodstar. The Morning Star Press Ltd. Two other books published the same year (1976) also called themselves graphic novels, but one is a reprint collection of a serialized underground comic (George Metzger's Beyond Time and Again) and the other is really an illustrated novel (Jim Steranko\u2019s Chandler: Red Tide) Unlike Beyond Time and Again, Bloodstar is a long story that had not been previously published episodically. It was first printed as a luxury hardcover edition and subsequently reprinted in several trade paperback editions. ==Background and creation== The story is an adaptation of Robert E. Howard\u2019s original short story \"The Valley of the Worm\", which appeared for the first time in Weird Tales (February 1934 issue). This story had been previously adapted to comics in a version written by Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway, pencilled by Gil Kane and inked by Ernie Chan for Supernatural Thrillers #3 (1973). This version gave the name \"Helga\" to the unnamed character of a \"naked tousle-headed girl\" described by Howard. In Bloodstar she became \"Helva\" and is the romantic interest of the protagonist. Since he pencilled this first comics version, it may have been Gil Kane's idea to turn \"The Valley of the Worm\" into a longer format sequential adaptation. Originally Bloodstar was going to be titled \"King of the Northern Abyss\".Seuling, Phil (1975). \"The Fantasy Epic: Creating the Graphic Novel\". Mediascene #16: pages 8\u20139. The first chapter of Bloodstar appears to be inspired by H.G. Wells' short story, The Star. According to an interview with Corben in Heavy Metal magazine, Armand Eisen and Gil Kane Balfour, Brad (July 2001). \"The Richard Corben Interview, Part 2\". Heavy Metal #51: pages 13-4. contacted Corben and asked him if he wanted to work on the book. Gil Kane changed the hero's name from \"Niord\" to \"Bloodstar\" and the created design for a star mark on his forehead. Kane edited the book with Armand Eisen. Originally The Morning Star Press was going to publish adaptations of two other Robert E. Howard stories: Skull-Face and Swords of the Red Brotherhood. Roark, Byron L. (1975). \"Interview: Glenn Lord\". REH: Lone Star Fictioneer, Vol. 1, No. 1: 36. John Jakes expanded the story adding much material to it and then Richard Corben revised, rewrote it and added further content. A latter edition (1979) was rewritten by John Pocsik.Corben, Richard; Howard, Robert E., Jakes, John, Pocsik, John (1979). Bloodstar. Ariel Books. . Although Corben stated in 1981 that Bloodstar was his favorite story up to that point,Balfour, Brad (July 1981). \"The Richard Corben Interview, Part 2\". Heavy Metal #52: pages 13-4. he initially hesitated to take the assignment, finding the characters in \"The Valley of the Worm\" lacking in depth.Balfour, Brad (June 1981). \"The Richard Corben Interview, Part 1\". Heavy Metal #52: page 10 Corben\u2019s adaptation of the story adds humanity and romance to Howard\u2019s brutal fights and action sequences. Bloodstar is a post-apocalyptic sword and sorcery tale of the life of a mythical hero and his heritage. It is illustrated in black and white in mixed media in startlingly three-dimensional looking images rendered in airbrush, markers and colored pencils Richardson, John Adkins (1977).

Pioneer Books, Inc.. .pages 49-54 The artwork took about nine months to complete,Balfour, Brad (July 1981). \"The Richard Corben Interview, Part 2\". Heavy Metal #52: page 14. and according to Berni Wrightson, Corben painted the cover in less than 24 hours, while Wrightson and Bruce Jones were visiting him in Kansas City.Bharucha, Feshid (1981). Richard Corben: Flights Into Fantasy. Thumb Tack Books. . Page 193 Corben was later commissioned to color the story, but had assistants do it following his method, probably Herb and Diana Arnold. This color version appeared serialized in Heavy Metal 45-52, but was never collected in English.Synopsis: \"Bloodstar\" aka \"King of the Northern Abyss\" ==Critical reception== Some writers have commented that Bloodstar is the most successful adaptation of a Robert E. Howard story. James Van Hise wrote : \"\"...I believe that it is the only time someone has rewritten Howard and retained the atmosphere and the subtext while also transforming it in to something as good as the original, however different it is in substantial ways.\" Van Hise, James (1997). The Fantastic Worlds of Robert E. Howard. James Van Hise. Page 20 D. Aviva Rothschild agrees, calling Bloodstar \"pulp adventure fiction brought to life by a master illustrator... much more interesting, both textually and artistically, than the insipid Conan adaptations by Marvel.\" Rothschild, D. Aviva (1995). Graphic Novels: A Bibliographic Guide to Book-Length Comics. Libraries Unlimited. . Page 49 Comics historian Maurice Horn believes that Bloodstar is \"A bizarre commingling of Greek and Norse mythologies, with a light admixture of science fiction, it embodies the sum of Corben's fantasies and nightmares in its fantastic array of repulsive-looking monsters, incredibly muscled heroes and impossibly big-busted maidens. Bloodstar also embodies Corben's peculiar vision of heroic sex and heroic death as the twin saviors of mankind.\" Horn, Maurice (1985). Sex in the Comics. Chelsea House Publishers. . Pages 1321-2 In contrast, critic Agust\u00edn Oliver comments regarding Bloodstar that \u201c\u2026 sexual activity is infrequent in Corben\u2019s work; when it appears it is usually depicted as delicate and tender.\u201d Oliver, Agust\u00edn (2004). Richard Corben (Un rebelde tranquilo). Sinsentido. . Page 27 Alberto Garc\u00eda Marcos, who wrote a long analysis of Corben's career, considers Bloodstar his masterpiece.http://www.zonanegativa.com/?p=5759 ==Editions in English== * First edition: 1976.
