    "text": "Joseph Sylvio Theobald Mantha (April 14, 1902 - August 7, 1974) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player who played fourteen seasons in the National Hockey League for the Montreal Canadiens and Boston Bruins. ==Playing career== Born in Montreal, Mantha was a three-time Stanley Cup winner - 1924, 1930 (Captain), 1931 (Captain). He played fourteen NHL seasons from 1923\u201324 to 1936\u201337, with all but four games as a Montreal Canadiens player. He was the captain of the Montreal Canadiens from 1926\u201327 to 1931\u201332 and from 1933\u201334 to 1935\u201336. Mantha started as a right-winger for the Notre Dame de Grace Juniors in 1918\u201319 season, before playing for Verdun in the Intermediate Mount Royal Hockey League, Montreal Imperial Tobacco, and Montreal Northern Electric in the Montreal industrial league. He played briefly for the Montreal Nationales in the Quebec league. After scoring four goals in nine games with the Nationales, he was signed by the Montreal Canadiens. The Canadiens started Mantha as a forward, then moved him to right defence, because veterans Sprague Cleghorn and Billy Coutu were aging. When Cleghorn was traded just before the 1925\u201326 NHL season, Mantha gained a more prominent role. He scored the first- ever goal in Boston Garden on November 20, 1928, leading the Canadiens to a 1\u20130 win over the Boston Bruins. Mantha was named to the NHL Second All-Star Team in both the 1929\u201330 and 1930\u201331 seasons. In the 1935\u201336 NHL season, Mantha became the Canadiens' player coach. After a dismal season, the Canadiens fired him. The Boston Bruins were involved in a contract dispute with Eddie Shore so they signed Mantha at the start of the 1936\u201337 NHL season\u2014and gave him Shore's number 2 jersey. Four games into the season, Mantha admitted he could no longer play at a competitive level and retired. Mantha then worked as a linesman and referee for the AHL and NHL. He then coached the junior league Montreal Concordias, Laval Nationales (1943 to 1945), Verdun Maple Leafs (1945 to 1947), and St. Jerome Eagles (1947 to 1948). He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1960, and died in Montreal, in August 1974. The Georges and Sylvio Mantha Arenas are part of the Complexe R\u00e9cr\u00e9atif Gadbois in Montreal and named for him and his brother, Georges Mantha, who also played in the National Hockey League. ==Career statistics== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text- align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
