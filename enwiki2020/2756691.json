    "text": "Guillaume Coustou the Younger (19 March 1716 \u2013 13 July 1777) was a French sculptor of the late French Baroque or Style Louis XIV, and early neo- classicism. ==Life and career== The son of Guillaume Coustou the Elder and nephew of Nicolas Coustou, he trained in the family atelier and studied at the French Academy in Rome, 1736\u201339, as winner of the Prix de Rome (1735). He returned to Paris, where he completed the famous \"Horse Tamers\" (Chevaux de Marly) commissioned from his father in 1739 for Marly, when the elder Coustou was too infirm to actively carry out the commissions. They were completed and installed in 1745.Fran\u00e7ois Souchal, Les fr\u00e8res Coustou (Paris) 1980. He was accepted at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture (1742) and pursued a successful official career, working fluently in styles that ranged from the Late Baroque of his morceau de r\u00e9ception, a Seated Vulcan (illustrated) to the sentimental early neoclassicism of the Ganymede, whose affinities with Roman sculptures of Antinous have been suggested by Michael Worley.Michael Preston Worley, \"The Image of Ganymede in France, 1730-1820: The Survival of a Homoerotic Myth\" The Art Bulletin 76.4 (December 1994, pp. 630-643) p. 637. The sculpture was in the Hertford and Wallace collections before it was purchased for the Victoria and Albert Museum in 1964. He produced portrait busts as well as his religious and mythological subjects. His most prominent and ambitious official commission was the Monument to the Dauphin for the cathedral of Sens. The elaborate iconography of its somewhat overcharged design was worked up by the artist and connoisseur Charles-Nicolas Cochin.Christian Michel, Charles-Nicolas Cochin et l'Art des Lumi\u00e8res (Rome) 1993. His pupils included two minor neoclassical sculptors, Claude Dejoux and Pierre Julien, who were fellow pupils in the 1760s and went on to collaborate on sculptural projectsGuilhem Scherf, in Paul Rosenberg, ed. Julien de Parme, 1736-1799 (Skira) 1999. and the young Danish sculptor, Johannes Widewelt, who was placed in his workshop through the offices of the secretary of the Danish legation. In the process, Widewelt picked up some of Coustou's clarity and his language of rhetorical gesture.Else Marie Bukdahl, \"Wiedewelt, der Neuklassizismus und die Fr\u00fchromantik\" Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Kunstgeschichte 54.3 (1991, pp. 388-405) p 389. ==Works== Vulcain, Coustou's reception piece for the Acad\u00e9mie Royale, 1742 (Louvre) Bronze bust of Marguerite Le Comte, 1750 CE.
