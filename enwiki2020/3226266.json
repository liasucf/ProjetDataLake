    "text": "Kurtulu\u015f is a district of Istanbul, formerly known as Tatavla meaning \"horse stable\" (). It lies within the cosmopolitan neighborhood of \u015ei\u015fli. Its population is of Turks who moved there mostly after the Republic of Turkey was founded, Greeks (now almost completely emigrated), Armenians (who still live there in numbers), Kurds (who are relatively recent economic migrants), and Jews (who still live there in numbers). The Turkish name means \"liberation\", \"salvation\", \"independence\" or \"deliverance\". It was originally well known as an Armenian/Greek Christian neighborhood. ==History== The quarter was originally built in the 16th century as a residential area for Chian Greeks, settled here to work in the principal dockyards of the Ottoman Empire which were situated in the neighboring Kas\u0131mpa\u015fa quarter. In 1832, a fire swept and completely destroyed the neighborhood with 600 houses and 30 shops going up in flames. Tatavla emerged as an entirely Greek part of Istanbul, while during the 19th century reached a population of 20,000 and hosted several Orthodox churches, schools and tavernas. It was nicknamed Little Athens because of its Greek character. It was typically the residential area for Greeks of more modest income, as opposed to, for example, Tarabya on the Bosphorus, where richer Greeks as well as rich Turks and Europeans lived. Nevertheless, a number of beautiful houses were built in the late 19th century, some of which still stand today. A vivid description of pre-First World War Tatavla is to be found in Maria Iordanidou's 1963 novel Loxandra, which is based on the experiences of her grandmotherLoxandra, English translation 2017, by Maria Iordanidou, pub. Harvey, pp. e.g. 26-28. Kurtulu\u015f was also the place that ended the Baklahorani carnival, an annual event led by the Greek community of the city, which was banned by the Turkish authorities in 1943, but got revived in 2010. Six years after the Republic of Turkey was founded a fire swept through and largely destroyed the neighborhood on 13 April 1929, with 207 houses going up in flames. The neighborhood's name was changed to Kurtulu\u015f to mark its rebuilding and symbolizing its rejuvenation. Despite the turmoil of the Balkan War, followed by World War I and the following Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922) and the devastating fire, the neighborhood continued to retain a large Greek population and atmosphere, at least until the riots of 1955. ==References== ==External links== * \u015ei\u015fli Belediyesi (\u015ei\u015fli Municipality).
