Retrieved: July 21, 2019. Directed by Harry Revier, the film was heavily influenced by the exploits of Hall, who was featured in the film and took an active role in promoting and marketing A Romance of the Air.Pendo 1985, pp. 71\u201372. ==Plot== Flying with the French Lafayette Escadrille in World War I, American ace, Lieutenant Bert Hall (Bert Hall), is wounded in an aerial battle and forced to land behind enemy lines. After finding his German opponent dead, Hall exchanges uniforms with him and is taken to a German hospital to recover. In the hospital, Hall meets Edith Day (Edith Day), an old sweetheart from Kentucky. She was unable to escape Berlin when the war broke out. The pair are accompanied by Day's best friend, the Countess of Moravia (Florence Billings), who claims sympathy with the Allied cause. The countess, however, is actually a German spy. After stealing a German aircraft, the group escape to France. Once the true motives of the countess are revealed, Hall is accused of betraying the French government. After a trial by military tribunal, he is sentenced to be shot, but his American lover uncovers evidence that saves him at the last moment. Exonerated, Hall dedicates himself to destroying the network of spies run by the Countess. ==Cast== * Bert Hall as Himself (as Lieutenant Bert Hall) * Edith Day as American girl * Florence Billings as Countess of Moravia * Stuart Holmes as Archduke of Moravia * Herbert Standing as Maj.
