    "text": "{| |} The Thielert Centurion is a series of Diesel cycle aircraft engines for general aviation originally built by Thielert, which was bought by Aviation Industry Corporation of China's Tecnify Motors subsidiary and is currently marketed by Continental Motors. They are based on heavily modified Mercedes- Benz automotive engines. ==Design== All Centurion engines are water-cooled, turbocharged, and employ a single-lever power control (SLPC) associated with a Full Authority Digital Engine Control system (FADEC). This simplifies engine management for the pilot, as well as improving reliability as it prevents the engine being operated improperly. The series utilizes either jet fuel or diesel fuel. The high compression ratio of the engine combined with the digitally controlled fuel injection system mirrors similar advances in automotive technology. Centurion series engines are always fitted with constant speed propellers which allow the engine to be operated at optimum speed at all times. However, the normal operating speed is too high for any suitable propeller and so the propeller is driven through a reduction gearbox. The constant speed propeller and reduction gear result in a propeller tip speed that is 10-15% lower than comparable conventional avgas engines, reducing propeller noise. The Diesel engine's high compression results in better fuel efficiency and the higher operating rpm of the Centurion allows higher power to be developed from a smaller displacement, in comparison to conventional aircraft piston engines. A Centurion engine complete with CSU, reduction gearbox, turbocharger and FADEC engine management system is considerably heavier than the more conventional Continental and Lycoming engines with which it competes, but this weight disadvantage is compensated by the Centurion's lower fuel consumption. Even though they lack the magnetos and spark plugs of conventional petrol (gas) piston engines, Centurion engines are considerably more complex.\"Aero-TV: Doing It Diesel Style -- Glasair's New Diesel Offering\" 29 August 2014. Accessed: 3 September 2014. ==Variants== Centurion 1.7 installation in a Diamond DA42 ;Centurion 1.7 - Continental CD-135 (TAE 125-01): :The first product introduced by Thielert, a 1689 cm\u00b3 (103 in\u00b3) engine producing is an inline-four engine based on the Mercedes-Benz OM668 from Mercedes-Benz A-Class A 170 CDI (W168) with 80 mm bore and 84 mm stroke. :The engine produces more power than a Lycoming O-320 above 4,000 ft, can maintain 93 kW (125 hp) till FL120, and burns in cruise at FL175 for 72 kW (97 hp): . :More than 1,500 Centurion 1.7s had been built until the end of 2006 when it was replaced by the Centurion 2.0. The in-service record of the 1.7 has been poor. :A combination of design, service and support issues caused widespread customer dissatisfaction. :Diamond then designed its own Austro Engines as an alternative to Thielert. :The engines were later marketed as the CD-135 by Continental Engines and produced in St. Egidien, Germany before being granted final assembly in Fairhope, Alabama for the U.S. retrofit market in 2015. Centurion 2.0 ;Centurion 2.0 (TAE 125-02-99) :Introduced in late 2006. The main difference is a new Mercedes-Benz OM640 engine cylinder block from the Mercedes-Benz A 200 CDI (W169) with a displacement of 1991 cm3 (\u00d883 x 92 mm). Other improvements include a more compact FADEC, a lighter cast gearbox housing, interfaces for glass cockpits and a new service tool that allows the FADEC to be programmed in the field. Dimensions of the Centurion 2.0 and 1.7 are nearly identical and the install kits are compatible, so a 1.7 at the end of its life can be replaced with a 2.0. The Centurion 2.0 is rated for a power output of , the same as the 1.7, but is EASA and FAA certified for . It has accumulated more than 1,000,000 flight hours without mechanical failures as of April 2008. ;Centurion 2.0 S (TAE 125-02-114) :This 4-cylinder turbodiesel common rail direct injection with redundant FADEC control offers providing a significant power increase compared to the Centurion 2.0 for no additional weight. An engine kit may cost $89,000. ;Centurion 3.0 :Certified 20 June 2017 by Technify Motors GmbH (application: 19 December 2013), 2987 cm\u00b3 V6 four stroke Diesel piston engine with common rail high pressure direct fuel injection, turbocharger, 1:1.66 gearbox and electronic Engine Control Unit. 980 mm Length \u00d7 700 mm Height \u00d7 790 mm Width, 265 kg dry, 221 kW (300 HP) for 5 min, 202 kW (272 HP) Max. Continuous, both at 3880 rpm (2340 prop rpm) Same dimensions as the Mercedes-Benz OM642. ;Centurion 3.2 :Intended to fill the gap between the Centurion 2.0 and the 4.0 and designed to produce . Development is largely complete, but the project is on hold. A Centurion 4.0 on display ;Centurion 4.0 :The 75\u00b0 V8 DOHC 4 valves per cylinder was initially equipped with two turbochargers and weighting dry for 228 kW max (310 hp) till FL80 at 2300 rpm at the propeller, and 176 kW (250 hp) in cruise for /h and /h at best economy, for , it was planned for a production of 600 per year. :Designed as a larger engine to replace the gasoline engines and developed from the Mercedes-Benz OM629 automobile engine, it produced 350 hp (261 kW) later with a larger single turbocharger. :After the insolvency of Thielert in April 2008 all work on the Centurion 4.0 was frozen. ;Continental CD-155 :Is the Continental Motors, Inc. brand name of the Centurion 2.0S with . The engine must be replaced every 2,100 hours, the gearbox has to be replaced for an inspection at 900 hours, the high-pressure pump has a life limit of 600 hours, the alternator of 600 hours, friction disk of 900 hours, V-ribbed belt of 1,200 hours, alternator excitation battery of 12 months. Fuel, oil, and cooling lines are replaced at 60 months except for the Robin DR400 where these items are 'on condition' with no set life-limit. The dual mass flywheel, which is intended to have the same life as the engine, is tested in-situ at 1,200 hours. ; TAE 125-02-125 (Continental CD-170) :A four-cylinder, liquid-cooled diesel engine with FADEC, dual overhead camshafts and a common rail direct fuel injection system, weighting and certified by the EASA on 22 July 2020. ;Continental CD-300 :The Continental brand name of the six cylinder 3 liter Thielert Diesel, with an output of at 2300 rpm. The CD-300 should replace the Safran/SMA diesel engine for the five-seat, single-engine Diamond DA50 from the third quarter of 2020 after a first flight of the combination on 22 March 2019, with a cruise fuel burn of 34.8l/h (9.2USgal/h). ==Applications== ===Centurion 1.7=== * Diamond DA40-TDI Star * Diamond DA42 Twin Star * Apex Aircraft Robin DR400 135 CDI Ecoflyer * Cessna 172 (\"F\" and later models, modified under a Supplemental Type Certificate) * General Atomics MQ-1C Gray Eagle ===Centurion 2.0=== * Diamond DA42 Twin Star * Diamond DA40 * Cessna 172 (\"F\" and later models, modified under a Supplemental Type Certificate) * Robin DR400 Ecoflyer *TAI Anka Turkish Aerospace Industries MALE UAV *Piper PA-28 Cherokee (modified under a Supplemental Type Certificate) *Piper PA-28 Archer DX * Airbus Helicopters VSR700 naval UAV based on the Cabri G2 ===Centurion 3.2=== * Cessna 182 - Proposed STC ===Centurion 4.0=== *Cirrus SR-22 (STC) *Cessna 206 (STC) *Cessna 340 - Proposed STC *Cessna 414 - Proposed STC *Cessna 421 - Proposed STC *Hybrid Air Vehicles HAV 304 Airlander 10 ===Continental CD-155=== *Cessna Turbo Skyhawk JT-A - new production aircraft with engine installation under an STC *Glasair Sportsman 2+2 - experimental homebuilt aircraft ==See also== ==References== ==External links== * Centurion engines home page * EASA Type Certificate Centurion 1.7 / 2.0 * EASA Type Certificate Centurion 4.0 Category:Aircraft diesel engines Category:2000s aircraft piston engines de:Thielert Centurion 1.7 ",
