Marie Curie provides the largest number of hospice beds outside the National Health Service. ==History== Marie Curie Cancer Care was founded in 1948. When the Hampstead-based Marie Curie Hospital was transferred to the NHS, a group of committee members from the hospital decided to preserve the name of Marie Curie in the charitable medical field. This was the beginning of the Marie Curie Memorial Foundation \u2212 a charity dedicated to alleviating suffering from cancer today \u2212 today known as Marie Curie. Following the donation of an engagement ring to help raise funds for the charity, the very first appeal was launched and brought in a substantial \u00a34,000.The charity initially began as a hospital, opened in 1930 by the Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, which specialised in the radiological treatment of women suffering from cancer and other diseases. In 1944, the hospital was destroyed in the war by a direct hit in an air raid. In 1948, Bernard Robinson OBE set about re-establishing the hospital and decided to separate from the National Health Service (NHS). He set up the Marie Curie Memorial Foundation to perpetuate the name of the pioneering scientist, Marie Curie. By 1950 the ongoing appeal had raised a staggering \u00a330,000 and two years later the Marie Curie Memorial Foundation officially became a charity - number 207994. An extensive nationwide survey was undertaken to help identify medical, nursing and research needs in relation to cancer. The results formed the basis of the work of the Foundation and, largely, still do today. ==Executive Board== The Executive Board delegate the day-to-day management of Marie Curie to their Chief Executive, Matthew Reed , who appoints the Executive Board, made up of the charity\u2019s most senior managers.
