Requirements were developed by each council. The award was a three-inch circular cloth patch worn on the right pocket of the official uniform as a temporary insignia. The emblem is the universal emblem of the BSA encircled by a rope tied in a square knot on a field of blue. The rope and knot are taken from the emblem of the World Scout Emblem, the symbol of the World Organization of the Scout Movement. A five-inch \"back patch\" for wear on the back of the official jac-shirt and a neckerchief were also available. ===Origins=== The BSA used the World Scout Emblem\u2014 called the World Crest in the U.S. \u2014as an award for international activities from 1956 on. Policy was changed in 1991 and the World Crest can now be worn by all members as an emblem of worldwide Scouting. The International Activity Patch replaced the World Crest as an award. In 2012, the International Activity Patch was replaced by the International Spirit Award with specific requirements for each age level. ==References== Category:Advancement and recognition in the Boy Scouts of America ",
