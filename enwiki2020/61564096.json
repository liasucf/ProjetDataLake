Going into the game, \u00de\u00f3r had to win and they also needed Leiknir to lose in order to go into second place since Leiknir was 3 points clear of them. This was their last gasp to reach promotion to the top flight football of Iceland, \u00darvalsdeild. Even though \u00de\u00f3r already had a superior goal difference, they defeated Fjar\u00f0abygg\u00f0ar 9\u20131 in a thrashing. Leiknir played their match at the same time and so knew they needed to at least draw to earn promotion as the scoreline was always in \u00de\u00f3r's favor. However, only 5 minutes into the game Leiknir's opponent Fj\u00f6lnir scored on a strike from forward P\u00e9tur Georg Markan. Leiknir found a response in the 44th minute, but it would not be enough. Just before the half, P\u00e9tur added a second goal for Fj\u00f6lnir. Then, came the dagger, a 47th-minute strike by none other than P\u00e9tur to begin the second half left Leiknir stunned. He had completed his treble and although Leiknir was not out of it by any means, they would not be able to pull another goal back. In the first meeting of the season between the two Reykjav\u00edk teams, with five minutes remaining and Leiknir winning 3\u20132, Fj\u00f6lnir leveled in the 87th minute. Then in stoppage time, Aron J\u00f3hannsson completed his treble for Fj\u00f6lnir and Leiknir had lost. So, \u00de\u00f3r returned to top flight for the first time since 2002, finishing runner-up to V\u00edkingur Reykjav\u00edk. In 2011, \u00de\u00f3r lost to KR, 0-2, in the Icelandic Cup finals. ==Current squad== ===Former players=== For details of current and former players, see :Category:\u00de\u00f3r Akureyri players. ==Managers== * P\u00e1ll Vi\u00f0ar G\u00edslason (July 1, 2009 \u2013 October 4, 2014) * Halld\u00f3r J\u00f3n Sigur\u00f0sson (January 1, 2015 \u2013 September 24, 2016) * L\u00e1rus Sigur\u00f0sson (September 29, 2016 \u2013 October 5, 2018) * Gregg Ryder (October 5, 2018 \u2013 September 21, 2019) * P\u00e1ll Vi\u00f0ar G\u00edslason (October 18, 2019-) ==References== ==External links== *Official site Category:Football clubs in Iceland Akureyri Category:1915 establishments in Iceland ",
