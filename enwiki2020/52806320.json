Hospitality Jamaica. ==Early life== Abe Issa was born in Kingston, Jamaica to Mary Brimo (died 1953), daughter of Damascus, Syria merchant Joseph Brimo, and Elias Abraham Issa (May 29, 1876 - September 1, 1969), son of Bethlehem, Palestine merchant Abraham Issa who immigrated to Kingston, Jamaica in 1894 with his son Elias. Abe's parents Elias and Mary were married on Feb 25, 1900 and the union gave birth to four children, Bertha, Abe, Joseph, and Annie. The Issa family struggled to establish itself in Kingston. A small notions shop, opened at 32 Princess Street in 1894, failed and Abe's father and grandfather were reduced to peddling goods door to door until they could open a new shop at 27 Orange Street. By 1900 they succeeded in bringing Abe's grandmother Sara and his father's brothers John, Antonio and Joseph to Jamaica. In 1901 Abe's father Elias formed a partnership with his brothers as E.A. Issa & Bros. The enterprise thrived and in 1905 moved to 132 Harbour Street. The shop was destroyed in the January 14, 1907 Kingston earthquake which also took the life of Abe's Uncle Joseph. With their goods only half insured and their books destroyed the brothers strove to recover and managed to reopen business at Penchon and Barry streets on April 4, 1907. The business flourished and in 1911 moved to the more advantageous 135 Harbour Street then, as business grew, to the larger 153-157 Harbour Street. Abe Issa began his elementary education at St. Aloysius School in 1910 then went on to high school studies at St. George's College from 1918-1922. Following a nine-month stint teaching English to South American students, he departed for Worcester, Massachusetts to begin his university education at College of the Holy Cross. In 1926 he graduated summa cum laude and delivered his valedictory address in Latin.Issa, Suzanne. Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa Suzanne Issa, 1994. p. 8-24 ==Career== Abe returned to Kingston in 1926 and entered the family business. On Dec. 1930 he opened the family's first retail store, Issa's of King Street, that featured international luxury goods. By force of his personality and his insistence on quality service the business thrived. He and his family would go on to expand their retail business opening three more shops on King Street while expanding the original store from two to four stories and introducing the first escalator in Jamaica. In 1958 he would purchase Nathan's, the leading competitor department store. In the early 1930s Abe traveled extensively on the business\u2019 behalf to North America and Europe. In 1934 he traveled Japan via Russia and the Trans-Siberian Railroad and worked 14 months in Yokohama operating a factory that manufactured rubber-soled shoes.Issa, Suzanne. Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa Suzanne Issa, 1994. p. 28 Abe's international experiences and knowledge of luxury quality merchandise combined with his outgoing and effusive personality served him well in the family's first move outside the retail trade. On March 14, 1943 the Issa's bought the Myrtle Bank Hotel and a next door laundry from United Fruit Company for \u00a335,000. Under Abe's guidance the hotel gained renown as a favored gathering spot of celebrities and distinguished visitors. Its guests included actor Errol Flynn, jazz great Louis Armstrong, actress Joan Crawford, Walt Disney, future Jamaican prime minister Norman Manley, future United States presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson II and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.Issa, Suzanne.

Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa Suzanne Issa, 1994. p. 34 The following year he made a foray into politics by forming the Jamaica Democratic Party. While the party failed to win any legislative seats in the 1944 election it began Abe's long involvement in the affairs of the soon-to-be independent nation.Issa, Suzanne. Mr. Jamaica Abe Issa Suzanne Issa, 1994. p. 59 Abe's boldest move came in 1948 when he built Jamaica's first all-season resort outside the then undeveloped fishing port town of Ocho Rios. Built on a north coast cove with a small barrier reef island Tower Isle Hotel became an immediate sensation and a destination for the well-heeled and glitterati of those days. Abe was pictured with actress Ava Gabor, boxing champion Joe Louis, actresses Debbie Reynolds, Jane Russell and Mary Martin, playwright No\u00ebl Coward, film director Cornel Lumiere, Britain's Princess Margaret, singer Lena Horne, travel writer Eugene Fodor, actor Errol Flynn and comedian Norman Wisdom.

Frequently ahead of his time Abe rebranded Tower Isle as Couples Hotel in 1978 converting it from an all-comers hotel to Jamaica's first all-inclusive and couples-only resort, creating a business model that would be widely imitated. The hotel remains a part of the Issa family properties as Couples Tower Isle and became the foundation property of Couples Resorts. The barrier reef island upon which a tower stands and from which the property's name derives serves as the resort's au naturel beach. In 1955 Abe became the first President of the newly formed Jamaica Tourist Board serving in that post until 1963. He led an aggressive international marketing campaign. Jamaican tourism grew from 86,000 tourists and \u00a34 million in revenue in 1955 to 227,000 tourists with \u00a338 million in revenue in 1962.Jamaica Tourist Board \"Come to Jamaica 1955-1963.\u201d Jamaicans.com, October 27, 2014. http://www.jtbonline.org/jtb/come-to-jamaica/ In 1958 he was appointed to Jamaica's legislative council on approval by the Queen.\u201cAbe Issa Appointed to Jamaica Post.\u201d Pittsburgh Press, June 29, 1958, sec. 5, p. 12 In 1959 he was elected President of the Caribbean Tourist Association.
