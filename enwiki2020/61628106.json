Notably, Manet depicts the two angels with the body of the dead Jesus still visible. The painting also depicts Jesus' spear wound on the wrong side of his body; this is a fact that Manet realized only after he had submitted the painting to the Salon. Manet also made etchings of the same subject, which are held by museums such as the Art Institute of Chicago and the Cleveland Museum of Art.
