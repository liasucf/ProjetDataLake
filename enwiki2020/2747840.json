    "text": "The Eparchy of Gornji Karlovac (, ; \"Eparchy of Upper Karlovac\") is an eparchy of the Serbian Orthodox Church seated in the city of Karlovac, Croatia. It covers the area of Banovina, Kordun, Lika, Krbava, Gorski Kotar, as well as northern Croatia and Istria. The important Orthodox Christian monasteries in the region are Gomirje near Ogulin and Komogovina Monastery between Glina and Kostajnica. ==History== The Serbian Orthodox Li\u010dko-Krbavska and Zrinopoljska Eparchy was established in 1695 by the Metropolitan Atanasije Ljubojevi\u0107 and certified by Emperor Joseph I in 1707. This eparchy (from the 19th century known as the Eparchy of Upper Karlovac) was the ecclesiastical centre of the Serbian Orthodox Church in this region, populated by Serbs, the community known at the time as \"Rascians\". This eparchy was under jurisdiction of the Metropolitan of Dabro-Bosna, directly under the restored Serbian Patriarch in Pe\u0107 and after 1766 under the new Serbian Metropolitanate of Karlovci, comprising Lika, Banija and Kordun. In 1993 the old Cathedral Church of Saint Nicholas and the eparchy's diocesan residence were destroyed by Croatians during the Croatian war of Independence. ==Monasteries== *Gomirje Monastery *Komogovina Monastery *Medak Monastery *Gorica Monastery *Donji Buda\u010dki Monastery ==Metropolitans== *Atanasije Ljubojevi\u0107 (1688\u20141712) *Danilo Ljubotina (1713\u20141739) *Pavle Nenadovi\u0107 (1744\u20141749) *Danilo Jak\u0161i\u0107 (1751\u20141771) *Josif Stojanovi\u0107 (1771\u20141774) *Petar Petrovi\u0107 (1774\u20141784) *Jovan Jovanovi\u0107 (1783\u20141786) *Genadije Dimovi\u0107 (1786\u20141796) *Stefan Avakumovi\u0107 (1798\u20141801) *Petar Jovanovi\u0107 Vidak (1801\u20141806) *Mojsije Miokovi\u0107 (1807\u20141823) *Lukijan Mu\u0161icki (1828\u20141837) *Evgenije Jovanovi\u0107 (1839\u20141854) *Sergije Ka\u0107anski (1858\u20141859) *Petar Jovanovi\u0107 (1859\u20141864) *Lukijan Nikolajevi\u0107 (1865\u20141872) *Teofan \u017divkovi\u0107 (1874\u20141890) *Mihailo Gruji\u0107 (1891\u20141914) *Ilarion Zeremski (1920\u20141931) *Maksimilijan Hajdin (1931\u20141936) *Sava Trlaji\u0107 (1938\u20141941) *Nikanor Ili\u010di\u0107 (1947\u20141951) *Simeon Zlokovi\u0107 (1951\u20141990) *Nikanor Bogunovi\u0107 (1991\u20141999) *Fotije Sladojevi\u0107 (2000\u20142004) *Gerasim Popovi\u0107 (2004\u2014). ==See also== * Serbs of Croatia * Eastern Orthodoxy in Croatia * List of the Eparchies of the Serbian Orthodox Church ==Sources== * * * * ==External links== *Official website *The diocese of Upper Karlovac - history and destruction in war * The Serbs in the Former SR of Croatia Category:Serbian Orthodox Church in Croatia Category:Religious organizations established in the 1690s Category:Dioceses established in the 17th century Category:Religious sees of the Serbian Orthodox Church Category:Serbian minority institutions and organizations in Croatia Category:1695 establishments in Europe Category:17th- century establishments in Croatia ",
