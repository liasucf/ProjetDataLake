It is relatively short and heavy and has two \"lugs\" or \"wings\" on the spearsocket behind the blade, which act as a barrier to prevent the spear from penetrating too deeply into the quarry where it might get stuck or break, and to stop an injured and furious boar from working its way up the shaft of the spear to attack the hunter. ==See also== *Bear spear *Bohemian earspoon *Ahlspiess ==References== ==External links== *Sunrise River Custom Knives\u2014Jim Casselman's account of a boar hunt with spears.
