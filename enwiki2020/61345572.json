    "text": "Reactions to the 2019 UK Conservative Party leadership election emerged from around the world, including from states, other institutions, and people. The result of the election, held following the resignation of Theresa May as Leader of the Conservative Party, was announced on 23 July, with Boris Johnson chosen by party members to succeed May. Johnson consequently also succeeded May as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom the following day. == Domestic == === Conservative Party === Outgoing party leader and British prime minister Theresa May pledged her full support for her successor and called for the rest of the party to unite behind Johnson. Johnson's opponent Jeremy Hunt commended Johnson on his victory and praised his 'optimism, energy and unbounded confidence [in Britain].' In an interview following the announcement of the result, Hunt said that he believed that his support for Remain during the 2016 Brexit referendum was the main reason for his defeat. ==== Ministerial resignations ==== In anticipation of Johnson's election, a number of ministers announced that they would resign from office, due to his willingness to leave the EU without a deal. On 22 July, Foreign Minister Alan Duncan tendered his resignation; prior to the leadership election result announced on the following day, Education Minister Anne Milton stood down from her post, citing 'grave concerns' over the new Prime Minister's Brexit policies. On 24 July, the Chancellor Philip Hammond, Justice Secretary David Gauke and International Development Secretary Rory Stewart all resigned from the May government, just hours before Boris Johnson became Prime Minister. This was done in protest against Johnson's position on withdrawing from the European Union, and in anticipation of their dismissal from office during the formation of a new cabinet. === Democratic Unionist Party === DUP leader Arlene Foster welcomed Johnson's election, reaffirming the continuity of the Conservative\u2013DUP agreement. === Opposition parties === ==== Labour ==== Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised Johnson's mandate and priorities for government.
