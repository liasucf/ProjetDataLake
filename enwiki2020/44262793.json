    "text": "John Warvelle Harbaugh was an American geologist who spent most of his professional career at Stanford University devoted to research on mathematical modeling of dynamic systems, sedimentary basin simulation and oil exploration risk analysis. Since 1999, he is Professor Emeritus both at the Geological and Environmental Sciences Department and at the Energy Resources Engineering Department. He received numerous honors and awards for his accomplishments and service to the profession that include the Haworth Distinguished Alumni Award of University of Kansas (1968), the A.I. Levorsen Award (1970) from the Pacific Section of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG), the Distinguished Service Award also from AAPG (1987), the William Christian Krumbein Medal from International Association for Mathematical Geosciences (1986),http://iamg.org/images/File/documents/bios/Krumbein%20recipients%20pdfs/1985Harbaugh.pdf and the Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Wisconsin-Madison (2003). In 2001, his colleagues and friends presented him with a festschrift. In 2013, the International Association for Mathematical Geosciences elected him as Honorary Member.http://iamg.org/images/File/documents/Newsletters/NewslettersHSP/NL87med.pdf ==Education== *Ph.D. in Geology, University of Wisconsin-Madison *M.S. in Geology, University of Kansas *B.S. in Geology, University of Kansas ==Books== * John W.
