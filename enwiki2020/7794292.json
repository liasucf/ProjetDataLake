    "text": "State Route 516 (SR 516) was a state highway following Ormsby Boulevard and Winnie Lane in Carson City, Nevada. The route was turned over to local control in 2010. ==Route description== The highway began at the intersection of Ormsby Boulevard and West King Street (SR 512) in a residential area of western Carson City. From there, the route went north on Ormsby Boulevard through residential areas and fields before curving west. After approximately one mile (1.6 km), the route intersected Winnie Lane. SR 516 followed Winnie Lane north and east from this intersection, passing about through more neighborhoods before ending at North Carson Street (U.S. Route 395 Business/SR 529). ==History== State Route 516 was designated a state highway in 1983. A transfer of ownership of several state highways to Carson City's control was proposed by 2007. The shift in ownership, which included SR 516, was proposed in order to reduce the amount of money the city was supposed to pay to the Nevada Department of Transportation for the construction of the Carson City Freeway (future Interstate 580). State Route 516 was removed from the state highway system by January 2010. ==References== 516 ",
