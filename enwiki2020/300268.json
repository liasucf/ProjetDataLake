He served as the lead singer and multi- instrumentalist of alt-rock band Pop Will Eat Itself before embarking on a career as a film score composer. Mansell moved to the United States after the dissolution of the group and started working with filmmaker Darren Aronofsky. He has subsequently become an award-winning, Golden Globe and Grammy-nominated film composer, collaborating extensively with Aronofsky, and also writing scores for dozens of other films (both shorts and features), TV series and video games. Mansell resides in Los Angeles, composing and occasionally touring live versions of his work. A pioneer of sampling in his own work, Mansell's work is now a favourite with sampling musicians. ==Career== ===Pop career=== Mansell was raised in Coventry, West Midlands. For a decade from their foundation in 1986, Mansell was a member of Pop Will Eat Itself, as a lead vocalist, multi-instrumentalist, producer and writer or co-writer of many of the band's songs.

In the United States, PWEI were signed in 1994 to Nothing Records the label owned by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. Mansell and Reznor, a long time fan of PWEI, became friends after Mansell moved to New York, and Mansell subsequently performed backing vocals on nine Inch Nails' 1999 album The Fragile. ===Soundtrack composer=== Mansell started composing film soundtracks when director Darren Aronofsky hired him to score his debut film, Pi, in 1996.Pete Paphides Clint Mansell: pop ate itself, and out popped Hollywood The Times Retrieved 14 May 2010 He also wrote the score for Aronofsky's next film, Requiem for a Dream, which became a cult hit.Requiem for a Dream \u2013 Clint Mansell AllMusic Retrieved 31 January 2011 The film's primary composition \"Lux Aeterna\" was popular, appearing in adverts, film trailersSundance 2009 Composers \u2013 Clint Mansell BMI Retrieved 31 January 2011 and YouTube videos labelled as Epic Music.
