He is, as of 2016, a professor of political history in the University of Cyprus, specialising on the political history of Turkey and Cyprus, and the Dean of the School of Humanities there. ==Biography== Niyazi K\u0131z\u0131ly\u00fcrek born in Potamia , fled to Louroujina along with his family due to the intercommunal violence of 1964. After completing high school in Northern Cyprus, he went to University of Bremen, where he graduated with a BA and MA in Sociology, Politics and Economics in 1983. He completed his PhD at the same university, with a thesis on the Cyprus dispute. He produced a documentary called Our Wall with Panicos Chrysanthou, later winning the Apdi \u0130pek\u00e7i Peace Award for the documentary in 1997. In 1995, he entered the University of Cyprus as a lecturer. Upon his entry, he was targeted by fascists, nationalist politicians and media, facing a year-long campaign for his expulsion from the university. He resisted with the support of his co-workers and the university and remained there. He related that over the years, the working environment became much less hostile. In 2013, he was elected Dean of the School of Humanities. In 2014, K\u0131z\u0131ly\u00fcrek became one of the advisers of President Nicos Anastasiades on Turkey in the Geostrategic Advisory Council. K\u0131z\u0131ly\u00fcrek has authored around 20 books, including Glafkos Clerides: The Path of a Country. He is a columnist in the Turkish Cypriot left-wing newspaper Yeni D\u00fczen and the right-wing Greek Cypriot newspaper Simerini. He commands five languages, Turkish, Greek, English, German and French. ==Politics== K\u0131z\u0131ly\u00fcrek entered politics in 2019, as a candidate for the 2019 European Parliament election with the left-wing Progressive Party of Working People (AKEL). His candidacy has proved controversial; Averof Neofytou and Eleni Stavrou of the centre- right Democratic Rally claimed that it only serves to reward Turkish intransigence and to normalize the presence of the occupying Turkish Army in Cyprus.\u0391\u03c0\u03b1\u03c3\u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03b5 \u03b7 \u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac \u039a\u03b9\u03b6\u03b9\u03bb\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ad\u03ba \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u0391\u039a\u0395\u039b - H \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 Sigmalive.com, May 4, 2019\u0391\u03b2\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03c6 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u0391\u039a\u0395\u039b: \u039d\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c8\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b9 \u03c4\u03ac\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03a4/\u03ba Kathimerini.com.cy, May 4, 2019 He was elected to the European Parliament with 25,051 votes, coming second among AKEL's candidates, behind Giorgos Georgiou.Turkish Cypriot poised to win seat in European parliament elections theguardian.com, April 21, 2019 First Turkish Cypriot MEP envisions himself as division healer ekathimerini.com, June 3, 2019 \u039f\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03af \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03af\u03bc\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03cc\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c8\u03b7\u03c6\u03af\u03c9\u03bd \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c5\u03c1\u03c9\u03b5\u03ba\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03ad\u03c2 Politis.com.cy, May 27, 2019 His election led to renewed controversy because he said that he will promote the Turkish language as an official language of the European Parliament (because it is an official language of the Republic of Cyprus).\u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b7 \u03a4\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7-\u039d\u03b9\u03b1\u03b6\u03af:\u0395\u03bd\u03bf\u03c7\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b5\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 & \u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b7 \u03b3\u03bb\u03ce\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 Sigmalive.com, May 27, 2019 On the other hand, his supporters have repeatedly praised K\u0131z\u0131ly\u00fcrek's positions about a peaceful reunification of Cyprus and his explicit condemnation of the Turkish invasion and military occupation, as well as the ethnic cleansing and theft of property committed against Greek Cypriots since 1974.\u039d\u03b9\u03b1\u03b6\u03af: \u0388\u03c7\u03c9 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03a4\u039c\u03a4 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03bb\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7 \u2013 \u0388\u03c7\u03c9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u0394\u0397\u03a3\u03a5 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b8\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03bd\u03b1 \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03ae\u03c3\u03c9 Dialogos.com.cy, May 6 2019 == References == == Books == * Glafkos Clerides: The Path of a Country, Rimal Publications, Nicosia, 2008, 278 p.
