Of Ballymacane (or Ballymacain) townland in the parish of Moynalty, Kilmainhamwood, Kells, County Meath, \u00d3 Gealac\u00e1in was by 1814 a hedge school master, Peadar \u00d3 Gealac\u00e1in, ainm.ie being educated in Irish, English, and mathematics. In 1824 average attendance at his school was thirty-five boys, six girls. He taught reading, writing, arithmetic, geography and Catholic catechism (though himself a member of the Established church). \u00d3 Gealac\u00e1in transcribed Irish manuscripts and collected ancient songs, but his main interest was in mathematics and general literature. His surviving manuscripts were compiled between 1823 and 1858. One, Royal Irish Academy MS. 3.B. 39, contains his genealogy, which reads: He was also a contributor to several almanacs. He was married to Jane Tennison, and their children are believed to have included Margaret (fl. 1837) and Peter (fl. 1840). His mother's name was Margaret Williams Peadar \u00d3 Gealac\u00e1in, ainm.ie of Munterconnacht parish, Lough Ramor, who died in 1837. Her sister was a Mary Cunnigan, who died in 1829; her daughter, Anne, died in 1842. All of the family are interred in the graveyard of Munterconnacht, but without any tombstones. Due to clearances and emigration, by the early 20th century many of his relatives and their descendants left the area. ==Sources== * The Schools and Scholars of Breiffne, Phillip O Connell, Dublin, 1942 ==References== Category:1793 births Category:19th-century Irish writers Category:Irish schoolteachers Category:People from County Meath Category:Irish book and manuscript collectors Category:1860 deaths ",
