    "text": "The Wall () by Jean-Paul Sartre, a collection of short stories published in 1939 containing the eponymous story \"The Wall\", is considered one of the author's greatest existentialist works of fiction. Sartre dedicated the book to his companion Olga Kosakiewicz, a former student of Simone de Beauvoir. ==\"The Wall\"== The eponymous story coldly depicts a situation in which prisoners are condemned to death. Written in 1939, the story is set in the Spanish Civil War, which began July 18, 1936, and ended April 1, 1939, when the Nationalists (known in Spanish as the Nacionalistas), led by General Francisco Franco, overcame the forces of the Spanish Republic and entered Madrid. The title refers to the wall used by firing squads to execute prisoners. The Wall itself symbolises the inevitability and unknowing of one's death. The protagonist, Pablo Ibbieta, along with two others in his cell, is sentenced to death. He is offered a way out if he reveals the location of his comrade, Ram\u00f3n Gris. Pablo begins thinking to himself and finds that he no longer cares about his cause or his life. Pablo continues to refuse to cooperate until just before his scheduled execution, when, seeing no harm in it, he gives the authorities what he believes to be false information on Ram\u00f3n Gris' whereabouts. Ram\u00f3n Gris moved from his previous hiding place to the very spot where Pablo tells the authorities he may be found. Thus Ram\u00f3n Gris is shot and Pablo's life is, at least temporarily, spared from death. ==\"The Room\"== In La Chambre (\"The Room\"), Mme Darb\u00e9dat is confined to her room by an unknown illness, where she spends her bedridden days reminiscing about the past and eating rahat-loukoums. She receives weekly visits from her husband, M. Darb\u00e9dat; that day, during their conversation, it is revealed that the Darb\u00e9dats' daughter, \u00c8ve, refuses to allow her husband Pierre \u2013 who suffers from apparent insanity \u2013 to be put away into an asylum. Mme Darb\u00e9dat hints at \u00c8ve and Pierre's continued romantic intimacy, further angering her husband. M. Darb\u00e9dat decides to pay \u00c8ve a visit, and the narrative shifts from the \u201csane\u201d world of the Darb\u00e9dats into the \u201csick,\u201d perverse world of Pierre. After witnessing some of Pierre\u2019s eccentric, abnormal behavior, M. Darb\u00e9dat, unable to convince \u00c8ve to send the \"madman\" to Dr Franchot's clinic, finally leaves the apartment in helpless frustration. In the second part of the story, the nature of Pierre\u2019s bizarre psychosis is explored more fully: he remains locked in a room that he has painted in black, calls his wife \u201cAgatha\u201d and recounts delusions about a time spent with her in Hamburg, and keeps a talisman (which he calls a \u201cziuthre\u201d) to deal with his hallucinations. Nevertheless, \u00c8ve wishes to understand and engage in Pierre's psychotic world, which she finds authentic (in so doing, \u00c8ve has cut herself off from \"normal\" society). \u00c8ve watches as Pierre hallucinates a group of flying, buzzing statues, after which he goes to sleep. As she watches him sleep, \u00c8ve wonders how soon it will be before he shows signs of degeneration, bestialization, and utter dementia; the story ends with her chilling resolution to the sleeping Pierre: \u201cJe te tuerai avant\u201d (I\u2019ll kill you before that.) ==\"Erostratus\"== A story about a misanthropic man who resolves to follow the path of Herostratus and make history by means of an evil deed\u2014in this case, by killing six random people (one for each bullet in his revolver). The man is exhilarated by the sense of power he receives when carrying his revolver on the streets within his pocket. \"But I no longer drew assurance from that [the revolver], it was from myself: I was a being like a revolver, a torpedo or a bomb.\" Sartre gives the reader an insightful account about how a man's nature changes with the objects of his possession, but the object itself is unable to change the internal man, as seen in the conclusion. ==\"Intimacy\"== Young Lulu struggles with authenticity as she seeks to liberate herself from social stereotypes. She decides to leave her husband Henri and run off with her lover Pierre at the insistence of her friend Rirette. She goes through several stages of realisation as she sees that the roles of wife, friend, and even lover are meaningless. However, she does not have enough strength to use the resulting angst to become an authentic being, so she finally decides to remain with her husband. ==\"The Childhood of a Leader\"== A tale of the mental progress of a boy named Lucien Fleurier from around age 4 to his early adulthood. Lucien, the son of a rich industrialist, searches for identity and meaning in order to find out \"what's wrong\" with him. He journeys from Freudian psychoanalysis and being a one-time sexual partner of a paederast poet, to finally becoming part of a Fascist youth organisation and attacking/punching a Jewish man who is reading l'Humanit\u00e9, with his friends. ==Adaptations== The 1967 film The Wall is based on the story of the same name. The 2016 film The Childhood of a Leader is based on the story of the same name. Category:1939 short story collections Category:Short story collections by Jean-Paul Sartre ",
