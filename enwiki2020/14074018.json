The club's ShawholmCricket Grounds, from CricketArchive, retrieved 4 November 2007 ground encompasses the cricket oval, three all-weather tennis courts, and used to have the world's only six-hole golf course approved by The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews. The clubhouse also hosted pool, table tennis, darts and poker tournaments in the winter months. Poloc Cricket Club's two principal senior cricket teams play under the names \"Poloc\" and \"Shawholm\". Poloc play in the Cricket Scotland organised Cricket Scotland League, administered by the Western District Cricket Union (\"WDCU\"), whilst Shawholm play in WDCU's West Cricket Scotland Reserve League. Another XI - the Poloc Panthers - plays in the WDCU Evening League, whilst a tapeball team, the Poloc Pythons, competes in the Cricket Scotland organised Tapeball League. ==History== Scotland's first televised cricket match Founded in 1878, Poloc Cricket Club spent its first season on the site of the old Pollokshaws Race Course and in 1880 moved to its current location at Shawholm. A pavilion was acquired by the club from the now-defunct Pollokshields Athletic Club, also located on Pollok Estates, and the building was moved to Shawholm on rollers. In the same year, the main avenue from Pollokshaws Road to Pollok House was opened, running past the north side of the ground in what is now Pollok Park. This avenue still provides the approach to Shawholm with the River Cart to the left. The club's winter golf section was formed in 1889, with bowls, putting and archery being added in the years following. Full tenancy of the current site was granted to the club in 1888 by Sir John Stirling-Maxwell, 10th Baronet who continued to be involved in Poloc's affairs until his death in 1956. In 1908 the Pollokshaws Working Lads Club decided to form a football team from amongst their ranks. Sir John Stirling Maxwell also allotted that club an area of land on the estate, rent-free. The footballers, to show their appreciation, took the name of Pollok Juniors FC, (later Pollok F.C.) and Sir John became their first Honorary President. The ground allocated became known as Haggs Park and was adjacent to Poloc Cricket Club; in fact, the different spellings of the two names \"Pollok\" and \"Poloc\" were adopted at this time, deliberately, to avoid confusion. Membership at Poloc reached a peak of 600 in the late 1940s. Scotland's first televised cricket match also took place at Shawholm on 7 May 1955 when West of Scotland Cricket Club were Poloc's visitors. Poloc batted first making 110 for 9. In reply, West made 120 for 6. ==Junior cricket== Poloc runs junior cricket teams at four age-group levels: under 10, 11, 12 and 16 and compete in West District Junior Cricket Union (\"WDJCU\") as well as Cricket Scotland-organised competitions. Under 10 and 11 players predominantly compete in \"Kwik cricket\" competitions. The club's junior sides won the WDCJU Under 11, 13 and 15 leagues in 2007, and were beaten finalists in the Under 18 Frank Smith Trophy. 2008 saw the Under 18s league champions, the Under 15s unbeaten and the Poloc Academy Strathclyde League winners, whilst 2009 saw a league championship for the Under 13Bs, another Frank Smith Trophy Final appearance and the Under 15s winning the Scottish Cup. 2010 brought the Under 18 league trophy to the club, and appearances at both the Under 18 Scottish Cup, and Under 18 Frank Smith Trophy, Finals Days. Success at junior level continued, with season 2015 seeing another Frank Smith Trophy win, the Under 11 league title and a win in the Under 12 WDJCU Indoor Super 8s tournament, and 2016 bringing another Under 18 league championship. The Under 19 WDJCU Indoor Super 8s tournament title was secured for the first time since the late 1980s in 2017. ==The Community Coaching Initiative== Poloc Cricket Club has been providing cricket coaching in its local community under the auspices of the \"Community Coaching Initiative\" since 2002. Working predominantly in the Glasgow City Council area coaching has been provided to local Primary and Secondary Schools. In addition, the club, under the umbrella of the Initiative and in partnership with the WDJCU, regularly hosts \"Kwik cricket\" festivals. In addition to the work in local schools, the club's Community Coaching Initiative also works with other community groups in providing sports coaching in and around the club's locality.
