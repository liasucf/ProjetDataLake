The current bishop is Giacinto-Boulos Marcuzzo who resides in Nazareth. ==History== Emmaus was very early associated with early Christianity, mentioned in 1 Maccabees1 Maccabees 3:55-4:22 SozomenSozomen Lib 5.c.xxi. and EusebiusChron Ann 2237. and in Book of Luke 24:13-35, of the New Testament. Being a small town only from Jerusalem, the village of Emmaus was not initially a bishopric, but rather part of the bishopric of Jerusalem.Joseph Bingham, Origines Ecclesiasticae; Or the Antiquities of the Christian, Volume 3 (Straker, 1843), p16. In 131 CE, Christian scholar and writer Julius Africanus of Jerusalem, headed an embassy to Rome and had an interview with the Roman emperor Elagabalus on behalf of Emmaus. Soon after it was refounded to become a \"city\" (\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2), which quickly became famous, and was given the qualification of \"Nicopolis\".William Adler, 'The Kingdom of Edessa and the Creation of a Christian Aristocracy,' in Natalie B. Dohrmann, Annette Yoshiko Reed (eds.), Jews, Christians, and the Roman Empire: The Poetics of Power in Late Antiquity, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2013 pp.43-61 p.58. Eusebius a century latter writes > Emmaus, whence was Cleopas who is mentioned by the Evangelist Luke. Today it > is Nicopolis, a famous city of Palestine.Eusebius, \"Onomasticon\", 90:15-17, > a text written in 290-325 A.D., G. S. P. Freeman-Grenville, trans., > Jerusalem, 2003 Jerome described how the towns congregation \"consecrated the house of Cleopas as a church.\"Pringle, Denys (1993). The Churches of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem: A-K (excluding Acre and Jerusalem). Cambridge University Press. . p53 Emmaus Nicopolis on Madaba map Emmaus, early 20th century The bishopric of Emmaus was mentioned by St. Jerome,Letter 108, PL XXII, 833 and other texts Hesychius of Jerusalem,Quaestiones \u00bb, PG XCIII, 1444 Theophanes the Confessor,\"Chronografia\", PG CVIII, 160 Sozomen,\"Ecclesiastical History\", PG LXVII, 180 and Theodosius.Theodosius, \"De situ Terrae sanctae\", 139. In 222 CE, a basilica was erected there, which was rebuilt first by the Byzantines and later modified by the Crusaders.Sharon, 1997, p. 80 This Diocese, however, must not have been of significance, being represented at only one of the first four councilsThe Canons of the First Four General Councils of Nicaea, Constantinople, Ephesus and Chalcedon (Clarendon Press, 1892) nor mentioned by Michel Le QuienMichel Le Quien ((O.P.)), Imprimerie Royale (Par\u00eds), Oriens christianus (ex Typographia Regia, 1740). but was in the Notitiae Ecclesiastica.Joseph Bingham, Origines Ecclesiasticae; Or the Antiquities of the Christian ..., Volume 3 (Straker, 1843) p16. The ancient bishopric ended when the Islamic armies entered the city. At the time of the Muslim conquest of Palestine, the main encampment of the Arab army was established in Emmaus, when a plague struck, killing as many as 25,000 of the army. In the 7th century both Willibald of Eichst\u00e4ttThiede, Carsten Peter; D'Ancona, Matthew (2005). The Emmaus Mystery: Discovering Evidence for the Risen Christ. Continuum International Publishing Group. . p59. and Hugeburc von Heidenheim, in her The Life of St. Willibald both describe the town church and \"holy well\". The church was one of 30,000 Christian buildings destroyed in 1009AD by al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, the Fatimid caliph of Egypt. In the 12th century William of Tyre, described the abundance of water and fodder in the area around the town, and Daniel Kievsky wrote of the site, \"but now all is destroyed by the pagans and the village of Emmaus is empty.\" John Phocas (ca.1185) also described the town. The Bishopric was re-established in 1099 when the army of the First Crusade, arrived in the town. But came under the rule of the Ottoman Empire in the early 16th century and, the church built by the Crusaders converted into a mosque. In 1930, the Carmelite Order built a monastery, the House of Peace, on a tract of land purchased in the town in 1878. and three years latter it was established as a titular see in the Roman Catholic Church. ==Known bishops== Adam Naruszewicz Kajetan So\u0142tyk ===Ancient diocese=== *Petros Longius, bishop of Nikopolis attendee at the Council of Nicaea.Carsten Peter Thiede, The Emmaus Mystery: Discovering Evidence for the Risen Christ (A&C; Black, 2006) p57. ===Titular Catholic see=== *Giacinto-Boulos MarcuzzoLe Petit Episcopologe, Issue 136, Number 12,162Emma\u00fcs at catholic-hierarchy.org. *Franco Costa (1963.12.18 \u2013 1977.01.22) * Carlo Maccari (1961.06.10 \u2013 1963.10.31) * Jolando Nuzzi (1959.08.08 \u2013 1961.05.20) * Joseph Patrick Donahue (1945.01.27 \u2013 1959.04.26) *Giuseppe Signore (1928.12.01 \u2013 1944.08.11) * Algernon Charles Stanley (1903.02.12 \u2013 1928.04.23) * James Laird Patterson (1880.04.20 \u2013 1902.12.03) *Henricus den Dubbelden (1842.01.14 \u2013 1851.10.13) * Jean-Denis Gauthier (1839.12.10 \u2013 1877.12.08) *Johann Maximilian von Haunold (1792.06.18 \u2013 1807.01.20) * Adam Stanis\u0142aw Naruszewicz (1775.03.13 \u2013 1788.11.28) * Franciszek Kobielski (1760.01.28 \u2013 1766.05.01) * Kajetan Ignacy So\u0142tyk (1749.09.22 \u2013 1756.04.19) * Lothar Friedrich von Nalbach (1730.10.02 \u2013 1748.05.11) * Bartolomeo Fargna (1729.02.07 \u2013 1730) ==Church buildings== *Emmaus Nicoplis, Latrun, Betharram/Beatitudes *Emmaus Qubeibeh, Qubeibeh, Franciscans ==See also== * Catholic Church in Israel * Custody of the Holy Land. ==External links== *Emmaus-Nicopolis, official site ==References== Category:Titular sees in Asia Category:Roman Catholic dioceses in the Crusader states Category:Former Roman Catholic dioceses in Asia ",
