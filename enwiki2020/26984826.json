    "text": "The United States Senate elections of 1892 and 1893 were elections which, corresponding with former Democratic President Grover Cleveland's return to power, had the Republican Party lose nine seats in the United States Senate and lose its majority to the Democratic Party. The Democratic majority, however, was minimal and didn't last past the next Congress. As these elections were prior to ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment, Senators were chosen by state legislatures. == Results summary == Senate Party Division, 53rd Congress (1893\u20131895) * Majority Party: Democratic (43) * Minority Party: Republican (38) * Other Parties: Populist (3); Silver (1) * Total Seats: 88 * Vacant: 3 == Change in Senate composition == === Before the elections === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=100% |- | colspan=6 | | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | P | | P | | R | | R |- | colspan=9 align=right | Majority \u2192 | rowspan=2 | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | colspan=6 | | | R | | R | | R | | R |} === Result of the elections === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=100% |- | colspan=6 | | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | V |- | colspan=9 align=right | Majority with vacancies \u2191 | rowspan=2 | V |- | | R | | R | | R | | SR | | P | | P | | P | | V | | V |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | colspan=6 | | | R | | R | | R | | R |} === Beginning of the next Congress === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=100% |- | colspan=6 | | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D | width=10% | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D |- | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | | D | rowspan=2 | D |- | colspan=9 align=right | Majority with vacancies \u2192 |- | | R | | R | | R | | SR | | P | | P | | P | | V | | V | | V |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R | | R |- | colspan=6 | | | R | | R | | R | | R |} {| |- valign=top !

Republican Frank Hiscock had been elected to this seat in 1887, and his term would expire on March 3, 1893. At the controversial State election in November 1891, 17 Democrats, 14 Republicans and 1 Independent were elected for a two- year term (1892-1893) in the State Senate. This was the only time a Democratic majority was seated in the State Senate between 1874 and 1910. At the State election in November 1892, 74 Democrats and 54 Republicans were elected for the session of 1893 to the Assembly. The 116th New York State Legislature met from January 3 to April 20, 1893, at Albany, New York. The Democratic caucus met on January 10. 90 State legislators attended, only Assemblyman John Cooney, of Brooklyn, was absent due to illness. State Senator Amasa J. Parker, Jr. presided. Edward Murphy, Jr., a wealthy brewer of Troy, and Chairman of the Democratic State Committee, was nominated by a large majority. The New York Times had suggested earlier to nominate Carl Schurz, a former Republican U.S. Senator from Missouri and U.S. Secretary of the Interior, who lived now in New York City, but the political machines of upstate boss David B. Hill and Tammany Hall chose a loyal party machine man rather than an Ex-Republican advocate of civil service reform. Even President-elect Grover Cleveland had voiced his disapproval of Murphy, to no avail. {| class=wikitable |+1893 Democratic caucus |- bgcolor=lightgrey ! Candidate !

State Senator James T. Edwards (32nd D.), of Randolph, voted for the defeated Republican vice presidential candidate of 1892, Whitelaw Reid. {| class=wikitable |+1893 United States Senator election |- bgcolor=lightgrey !

When Murphy took his seat, for the first time since 1849 New York was represented by two Democrats in the U.S. Senate. Murphy served a single term, remaining in the U.S. Senate until March 3, 1899. In January 1899, Murphy was defeated for re-election by Republican Chauncey M. Depew. == North Dakota == == Ohio == == Pennsylvania == The election in Pennsylvania was held January 17, 1893.
