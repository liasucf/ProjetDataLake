    "text": "Major League Fishing (MLF) is a professional bass fishing league and television show that airs on Outdoor Channel, World Fishing Network and Discovery Channel. The league was established in partnership between the Professional Bass Tour Anglers' Association (PBTAA) and Outdoor Channel as an answer to other professional fishing tournaments that the anglers compete in. The show focuses on personalities and struggles of anglers in competition rather than purely on results. Major League Fishing was the top-rated show on Outdoor Channel and is different from other professional fishing tournaments in that the events are catch and release and fisherman have a constant update on how fellow competitors are doing through iPads on their boats. Additionally, anglers do not know where they are going before the day of the competition. The new style of tournament fishing was designed with conservation in mind, which is why fish are weighed and instantly released, anglers are not allowed to land fish or cradle them to their body and fish are never kept in the boat's live well. The shows are fished without revealing results instantly, as the results are shown when the television program airs. Major League Fishing headquarters are located in Tulsa, Oklahoma. == History == In 2010, the anglers of the PBTAA met with the Outdoor Channel to outline the first Major League Fishing competition\u2014the 2012 Challenge Cup was filmed at Amistad Reservoir, Texas, in 2011 and aired on the Outdoor Channel in 2012. Professional Anglers Boyd Duckett and Gary Klein represent the anglers and originally came up with the idea of Major League Fishing. Major League Fishing is sponsored by a number of fishing-related companies and external organizations including Bass Pro Shops, General Tire, Lowrance, Sig Sauer and Geico. Many other fishing clubs around the country now use the MLF format for their tournaments, including the Brecknell digital scales used in competition and the SCORETRACKER LIVE! scoring system, as MLF continues to grow. == Anglers == Professional anglers who currently compete in Major League Fishing are B.A.S.S. or Fishing League Worldwide current or retired pros, including Edwin Evers (fisherman), Kevin VanDam, Mike Iaconelli, Skeet Reese, Casey Ashley, Ott DeFoe and Gabriel Kilgore . == Events == Major League Fishing has two independent competitions, the Selects and Cups, which are each fished by a different set of anglers. The Cup anglers also compete for a chance to fish the MLF World Championship, which airs on CBS. MLF Cup events feature 3 days of competitions between 10 anglers, with the top 4 advancing from each day of competition into a Sudden Death Round. In the Sudden Death Rounds, the first 3 anglers to hit a designated \"cut weight\" receive a spot in the Championship Round, which is winner-take-all.
