    "text": "Gath is the name of a Scottish Gaelic language magazine that was published by Gath Earranta. The first edition was published in August 2003, intending to replace the older Gairm magazine, which had closed. Gath aimed to reproduce the mainstream appeal of its predecessor, whilst attracting a younger audience with fresh topics, such as contemporary music and current events. Each issue contained a number of short stories, essays, and poems; over 500 short stories were published in the magazine. B\u00f2rd na G\u00e0idhlig provided a \u00a35000 foundational grant and ongoing support, and Gath was published biannually from 2003 until at least 2008. The reception was generally positive.Mac Neacaill, Aonghas. \"A YEAR IN SCOTTISH GAELIC WRITING.\" Transcript: Europe's Online Review of International Writing. Originally published Dec 29, 2003.
