Tawfik played in the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship in the Netherlands. He is the elder brother of Egyptian Premier League footballers Ahmed Tawfik of Zamalek and Akram Tawfik of Al Ahly. ==Club career== Tawfik's good spell at El Mansoura convinced ENPPI to lay an offer to win his services, although he was of little to no significance. The young midfielder quickly established himself in his new club and as a result joined the Egypt national football team squad. His good performances did not go unnoticed in Europe. Then he transferred to Al-Masry since the beginning of season (2011\u20132012).Coerts, Stefan \"Anderlecht Keeping Tabs On Egyptian International Abdelaziz Tawfik - Report\", Goal.com, 11 February 2010.
