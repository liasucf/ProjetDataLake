At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on five reviews. Fred Thomas of AllMusic said, \"The rapper's skills aren't in question on The Lost Boy, but the album sometimes overshoots in its ambition, aiming for too many styles to hit them all with excellence. It's still a strong collection, and when Cordae strikes a perfect balance of mellow production and lyrical power on standout tracks like \"We Gon Make It,\" it points to even more fully formed work ahead from a strong talent just getting started.\" Nicolas Tyrell of Clash stated \"Both bold and filled with bravado, yet layered and emotional, YBN Cordae is able to convey his desires, hopes, and fears in an ambitious and well-thought out format. A strong debut from an artist who knows that he is capable of long-term success.\" Jacob Carey of Exclaim! said, \"If The Lost Boy was the new wave rapper's most substantial test of talent and longevity, YBN Cordae passed with flying colours.\" Scott Glaysher of HipHopDX stated \"Encapsulates everything a Gen Z rapper should be aiming for; young gun energy mixed with traditional skill.\" Will Schube of Pitchfork said, \"Despite the glossy guestlist, The Lost Boy remains Cordae\u2019s show. At 15 songs, it could have used an edit, another voice in the room telling him to tone it down. But still, it\u2019s an assured debut.\" ==Commercial performance== The Lost Boy debuted at number 13 on the Billboard 200 for the chart dated August 10, 2019. The album also debuted on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart at number eight. ==Track listing== Credits adapted from Tidal.
