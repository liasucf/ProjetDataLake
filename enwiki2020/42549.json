    "text": "The Volta River is the main river system in the West African country of Ghana. It flows south into Ghana from Bobo-Dioulasso highlands of Burkina Faso. The main part of the river are the Black Volta, the White Volta, and the Red Volta. In the northwest, the Black Volta forms the international borders between the Ivory Coast, Ghana, and Burkina Faso. The Volta flows southward along Akwapim-Togoland highlands, and it empties into the Atlantic Ocean at the Gulf of Guinea at Ada Foah. It has a smaller tributary river, the Oti, which enters Ghana from Togo in the east. The Volta River has been dammed at Akosombo for the purpose of generating hydroelectricity. The reservoir named Lake Volta stretches from Akosombo Dam in the south to the northern part of the country, and is the largest man-made reservoir by area in the world. ==The reservoir== Lake Volta is a reservoir impounded by the Akosombo Dam on the lower Volta River in southern Ghana. It is one of the largest reservoirs in the world. It extends from the Akosombo Dam in southeastern Ghana to the town of Yapei in the Central Gonja District, Northern Region of Ghana, some to the north. The dam's power plant generates electricity for the Volta River Authority, and the reservoir also provides water transport routes. It may be a resource for irrigation and fish farming. The depth of the river is about below Lake Volta. The Volta River is crossed by the Adome Bridge just below the Akosombo Dam. ==History== The Volta River was named by Portuguese gold traders in Ghana. It was their farthest extent of exploration before returning (volta is Portuguese for \"twist\" or \"turn\"). \"River of return\" (perhaps because it was where ships turned around and headed for home) or \u201criver of the bend\u201d, in reference to its curved course.Volta - etymology ==See also== *Impacts of the Akosombo Hydroelectric Project \u2014 environmental and human health issues from the Akosombo Dam and Lake Volta. == References == Category:Rivers of Ghana Category:Rivers of Burkina Faso Category:Gulf of Guinea Category:Rivers of Ivory Coast ",
