In the film, a villainous squire and Justice of the Peace conspires to have his rival in love arrested on false charges. It is based on the novel It Is Never Too Late to Mend by Charles Reade. The film was made at Shepperton Studios as a quota quickie for release by Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer. It was popular enough to be re-released in 1942. The novel was adapted once before, as a British silent film in 1922, starring Russell Thorndike as Squire Meadows.Workman, Christopher; Howarth, Troy (2016). \"Tome of Terror: Horror Films of the Silent Era\".
