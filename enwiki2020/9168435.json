    "text": "Tamanoumi Masahiro (\u7389\u306e\u6d77 \u6b63\u6d0b, February 5, 1944 \u2013 October 11, 1971), was a sumo wrestler, born in Aichi, Japan. He was the sport's 51st yokozuna. Making his professional debut in 1959, he reached the top makuuchi division in 1964. He won six tournament championships and was runner-up in 12 others. Earlier in his career he also earned six special prizes and four gold stars. He was promoted to yokozuna simultaneously with his friend and rival Kitanofuji in January 1970 and the two men represented the dawning of a new era after the dominance of Taih\u014d. He died suddenly in October 1971 after a delayed appendectomy. ==Career== He was born in Osaka, but due to the bombing raids of that city he was evacuated to Gamanori where he grew up. He excelled at judo in junior high school. The future Katsuhikari was one year senior to him in his judo club. Tamanoumi began his professional career in March 1959, joining Nishonoseki stable, the same stable as the great yokozuna Taih\u014d. At that stage he used a different shikona, or fighting name: Tamanoshima. In 1962 his coach, former sekiwake Tamanoumi Daitaro, set up his own Kataonami stable and Tamanoshima joined it. He reached the top makuuchi division in March 1964. In 1965 a change in the rules meant that wrestlers from the same group of stables could meet each other in tournament competition, and Tamanoshima defeated Taih\u014d in their first official match. He was promoted to sumo's second highest rank of \u014dzeki in November 1966 at the age of 22. At first, he was unable to reach a score in double figures at \u014dzeki rank, but his results began to improve significantly from November 1967. In May 1968, after three runner-up performances in a row, he finally captured his first y\u016bsh\u014d, or tournament title, with a 13\u20132 record. The Yokozuna Deliberation Committee decided against promotion to yokozuna after this result due to the absence of both Taih\u014d and Kashiwado from the tournament and his two losses to low-rankers in the first week. His second title came in September 1969. In November 1969 he posted a 10\u20135 record, and in January 1970 he took part in a playoff for the title with fellow \u014dzeki Kitanofuji. Tamanoshima lost the match, but after the tournament both Kitanofuji and Tamanoshima were promoted to the yokozuna rank. With Kashiwado already retired, and Taih\u014d soon to follow, the two ushered in a new Kita-Tama era. Tamanoumi's handprint displayed on a monument in Ry\u014dgoku, Tokyo Upon reaching yokozuna Tamanoshima changed his name to Tamanoumi, his coach's old shikona. His first tournament championship as a yokozuna came in September 1970 and he followed it up with another victory in November, defeating Taih\u014d in a playoff. In July 1971 Tamanoumi won his sixth and final championship, his first with a perfect 15\u20130 record. ==Fighting style== At and Tamanoumi was not particularly large, but he had great strength and agility. His favoured kimarite were yori kiri (force out), uwatenage (outer arm throw) and tsuri dashi (lift out). He preferred a migi yotsu (left hand outside, right hand inside) grip on his opponent's mawashi. ==Death== Tamanoumi had needed an appendectomy since at least July 1971, but he felt the responsibility of a yokozuna's duties and had not wanted to withdraw from the September 1971 tournament. After competing there taking pain-killers and remarkably managing a 12-3 record, he went into hospital only after being an attendant at Taih\u014d's retirement ceremony on October 2. Due to the delay in having the operation he was on the brink of peritonitis. The procedure seemed to have gone well and he was due to leave hospital on October 12, but on the morning of the 11th he collapsed and could not be saved. It emerged he had suffered a pulmonary embolism. He was only the fourth man in history to die whilst an active yokozuna. Kitanofuji was a good friend of Tamanoumi as well as a rival and was shocked by his death. He was just 27 years old and considered to be in his prime and likely to have won many more championships had he lived. In his last seven tournaments he had won four and been runner-up in the other three, and had lost only nine out of 105 bouts. His winning percentage as a yokozuna was .867, second only to Futabayama in the 20th century, and he gave away only three kinboshi in that time. ==Career record== ==See also== *Glossary of sumo terms *List of past sumo wrestlers *List of sumo tournament top division champions *List of sumo tournament top division runners-up *List of yokozuna ==References== ==External links== *Japanese Sumo Association Biography Category:1944 births Category:1971 deaths Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Aichi Prefecture Category:Yokozuna Category:Sumo wrestlers who died while active ",
