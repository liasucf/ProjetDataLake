    "text": "Titans of Mavericks poster Titans of Mavericks was a big wave surfing action sports event that took place south of San Francisco, at the surfing site of Mavericks, California. Athletes competed annually in conditions that can reach up 60 feet in wave height. The contest was initiated in 1999 and last held in 2016. The 2017 contest was cancelled after the organizing company filed for bankruptcy and a deal was made with World Surf League to take over the event. In 2019, the World Surf League ended the event indefinitely, citing \"various logistical challenges\" and \"the inability to run the event the last two seasons.\" ==History== 2010 Mavericks surfing competition. Spectators of Mavericks contest in 2010. The first surfing contest at Mavericks, now known as Titans of Mavericks, was held in 1999, and has been held nine times through 2014. The organizers invite 24 big wave surfers annually to compete in the one-day event, but it is only held if wave conditions are favorable during the competition season. Darryl Virostko (\"Flea\") won the initial contest in 1999, while Richard Schmidt, Ross Clarke-Jones and Peter Mel took second, third and fourth places, respectively. The following year put Virostko, Kelly Slater, Tony Ray, Peter Mel, Zach Wormhoudt, and Matt Ambrose in first through sixth places. In 2004, Virostko, Ambrose, Evan Slater, Anthony Tashnick, Mel and Grant Washburn placed in spots first through sixth. Tashnick came first in 2005. In 2006, Grant Baker, from South Africa, won first place, with Tyler Smith and Brock Little in second and third. The 2007 contest was called off because unusually mild weather resulted in no days with suitable waves by the end of March, the usual cutoff time for holding the competition. In 2008, Greg Long was crowned Mavericks Champion, Baker won second and Jamie Sterling won third place, followed by Smith in fourth, Washburn in fifth and Evan Slater in sixth. The contest was canceled again in 2009. In 2010 South Africa's Chris Bertish took first place; winning a surfing prize purse of US$150 000, sponsored by Moose Guen, Jane Sunderland and Barracuda Networks. In the fall of 2010 a group of surfers, community leaders and contest organizers formed the Half Moon Bay Surf Group, Inc., with the aim of controlling the contest. In October, the San Mateo Harbor Commission granted them the permit and official planning of the inaugural \u201cThe Jay at Maverick\u2019s Big Wave Invitational\" (as it was then called) began. Invited competitors included 11-time ASP World Champion Kelly Slater and 23 others. However, the contest was not held due to lack of waves in 2011 and 2012. The 2013 contest was won by Peter Mel and the 2014 one was won by Grant Baker. The contest was rebranded \"Titans of Mavericks\", with governance by five Mavericks riders known as the \"Committee 5\" . The last Mavericks Surf contest was held on February 12, 2016. AT&T; Park in San Francisco hosted live broadcasts of the event on its giant (110 foot wide) video display. In October 2006, the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary proposed banning personal watercraft from Mavericks, which led to disputes within the sport. ===Mavericks contest results=== The following is a list of past Mavericks invitational competitions and winners. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\" !Season(s) !Date Held !Champion !2nd Place !3rd Place !4th Place !5th Place !6th Place |- |1998-1999 |February 17, 1999 | Darryl Virostko | Richard Schmidt | Ross Clarke-Jones | Peter Mel | | |- |1999-2000 |March 3, 2000 | Darryl Virostko | Kelly Slater | Tony Ray | Peter Mel | Zach Wormhoudt | Matt Ambrose |- |2000-2003 |colspan=7 | No contest held |- |2003-2004 |February 7, 2004 | Darryl Virostko | Matt Ambrose | Evan Slater | Anthony Tashnick | Peter Mel | Grant Washburn |- |2004-2005 |March 2, 2005 | Anthony Tashnick | Greg Long | Tyler Smith | Zach Wormhoudt | Shane Desmond | Matt Ambrose |- |2005-2006 |February 8, 2006 | Grant Baker | Tyler Smith | Brock Little | Matt Ambrose | Grant Washburn | Evan Slater |- |2006-2007 |colspan=7 | No contest held |- |2007-2008 |January 12, 2008 | Greg Long | Grant Baker | Jamie Sterling | Tyler Smith | Grant Washburn | Evan Slater |- |2008-2009 |colspan=7 | No contest held |- |2009-2010 |February 13, 2010 | Chris Bertish | Shane Desmond | Anthony Tashnick | Dave Wessel | Carlos Brule | Kenny Collins |- |2010-2012 |colspan=7 | No contest held |- |2012-2013 |January 20, 2013 | Peter Mel | Zach Wormhoudt | Greg Long | Alex Martins | Mark Healey | Shawn Dollar |- |2013-2014 |January 24, 2014 | Grant Baker | Shane Dorian | Ryan Augenstein | Tyler Fox | Greg Long | Anthony Tashnick |- |2014-2015 |colspan=7 | No contest held |- |2015-2016 |February 12, 2016 | Nic Lamb | Travis Payne | Greg Long | Tyler Fox | Jaime Mitchell | Carlos Brule |} ==References== == External links == *titansofmavericks.com Category:Surfing competitions Category:Surfing competitions in California ",
