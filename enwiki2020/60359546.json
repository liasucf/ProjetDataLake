Through talent and hard work he has attained his dream job as an assistant to Francesca, a celebrity fashion stylist. One day Francesca assigns Ryan to style Ning, an actor who has just arrived from Beijing, for a top magazine photo shoot. Ning dismisses Ryan's initial Western styling and demands Ryan creates an image for him which represents the power of the new China. Their opinions clash resulting in a strained working relationship. Over the following days, they socialize whilst working together and discover not only do they share a lot in common, a mutual attraction begins to develop. As they get closer Ryan reveals that he detests his Chinese heritage because he is ashamed of his impoverished upbringing. Ning also opens up and confesses that he is closeted. As they fall in love, a Chinese tabloid magazine exposes Ning as gay. Terrified of the impact it will have on his career, Ning begs Ryan to lie for him at a press conference. Ryan must now decide whether to help Ning or stay true to himself. == Cast == * Jake Choi as Ryan Fu *James Chen as Qi Xiao Ning * Elizabeth Sung as Yen Fu *Jennifer Neala Page as Janet * Sonia Villani as Francesca *Li Jun Li as Miao *Ming Lee as Ba *Benjamin Thys as James *Tom Ligon as Gus LaMar == Release == Front Cover premiered in 2015 at the Seattle International Film Festival.
