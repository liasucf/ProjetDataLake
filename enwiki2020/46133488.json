They hosted a podcast on the Earwolf network from 2011 until 2017 wherein they interviewed/interrogated a celebrity guest, interacted with one another, and dispensed advice to listeners. Chaffin and Denbo developed their characters in 2006 when they were asked to host an all-Jewish 'Kosher Christmas Show' at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre. Live performances from the pair are frequently advertised as \"seminars\" in which their characters discuss the fictional book they co-authored, \"You'll Do a Little Better Next Time: A Guide to Marriage and Re-marriage for Jewish Singles.\" After introducing the book, either Chaffin or Denbo will often add the clarification, \"It says Jewish in the name, but it's for everyone!\"https://www.earwolf.com/show/ronna-beverly/, Retrieved February 5 2020 == Podcast == Episodes of their eponymous podcast, Ronna and Beverly, were released every two weeks by Earwolf. Guests included people working in comedy, as well as actors, authors, and filmmakers. The podcast premiered on May 25, 2011.Earwolf Show Page In episode 161 on June 15, 2017 (not long after they started teasing the possibility of releasing weekly episodes), Ronna and Beverly suddenly announced they were taking off \"for the summer.\" Since then, no new episodes have been released and the actresses have not appeared together in character. Jessica Chaffin has kept Ronna alive by appearing in character as a guest on other podcasts and by maintaining an Instagram account. On the April 16, 2018 episode of the Why Mommy Drinks podcast, guest Jamie Denbo confirmed that she \"used to\" have a podcast called Ronna and Beverly, ostensibly indicating the conclusion of the series. On March 11, 2019 Denbo announced she will be launching a spinoff podcast titled Beverly In LA on Stitcher Premium. ===Spinoff Podcasts=== ==== Beverly in LA==== Denbo currently hosts a solo spin-off podcast on the Stitcher network titled Beverly in LA chronicling the life of Beverly Ginsberg as she pursues wellness and explores various means of living a healthier, more mindful life in Los Angeles. ====Ask Ronna==== In November, 2019 Chaffin and co-host Bryan Safi premiered a new podcast called Ask Ronna, in which Chaffin continues to appear as Ronna Glickman.
