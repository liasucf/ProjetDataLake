    "text": "The 20th National Hockey League All-Star Game was played in Montreal Forum on January 18, 1967, where the host Montreal Canadiens defeated a team of all- stars from the remaining NHL teams 3\u20130. It was the first, and to date, only time a shutout occurred in an All-Star Game. It was the first All-Star Game held in mid-season. The previous Game was held in October 1965. ==The game== The game was considered a dull affair by the writers. Only three minor penalties were called. Montreal's John Ferguson scored two goals and punched Norm Ullman to earn a penalty. The All-Stars' coach, Sid Abel, chose New York's Ed Giacomin over his own goalie Roger Crozier, who had been playoff MVP in the previous playoffs. Bobby Orr was not chosen to the game, as the selections were to be based on the previous season's performance. ===Game summary=== {| cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"1\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: gray solid 1px; text-align:center; border-collapse: collapse; width:60%\" |- bgcolor=\"B2B2B2\" ! width=\"15\" |# !! width=\"25\" | Score !!
