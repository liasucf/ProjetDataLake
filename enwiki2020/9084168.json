These include: the three main female and two main male characters in the series along with four other supporting female characters. The first three released included songs by Aya Hirano as Haruhi Suzumiya, Minori Chihara as Yuki Nagato and Yuko Goto as Mikuru Asahina. Moreover, two additional character CDs were released on December 6, 2006, sung by Yuki Matsuoka as Tsuruya and Natsuko Kuwatani as Ryoko Asakura. Two more character CDs were released on January 24, 2007, sung by Sayaka Aoki as Kyon's Sistercdjapan.co.jp for Kyon's Sister's CD and Yuri Shiratori as Emiri Kimidori.cdjapan.co.cp for Emiri Kimidori's CD Finally, the CDs for Itsuki Koizumi and Kyon were released on February 21, 2007. Each of the nine albums feature the ending theme song \"Hare Hare Yukai\". Other than the three main female character's versions which are solo cover versions of the original, there are some alterations. For Tsuruya's version as well as Ryoko's version, the lyrics were changed to fit the character; Tsuruya's version contains her catch phrase \"nyoro\", while Ryoko reverses the optimistic lyrics to convey futility and destruction. However, while Tsuruya's and Ryoko's versions have the same arrangements as the original version, the last four released have their arrangements changed along with the lyrics. Kyon's Sister's version is very upbeat; Emiri's version is very fact-based; Itsuki's version talks about his ESP; and Kyon reflects about his now-disturbed life in his version. ==References== *Amazon.co.jp for Saikyo Pare Parade *Amazon.co.jp for radio drama vol. 1 *Amazon.co.jp for radio drama vol. 2 *Amazon.co.jp for radio drama vol. 3 *Haruhi.tv for radio drama vol. 3 ===Notes=== ==External links== * * Suzumiya Haruhi no Y\u016butsu CD listing at Lantis' site * * * Category:Anime soundtracks Category:Film and television discographies Albums Category:Discographies of Japanese artists Category:Lantis (company) albums Category:Lantis (company) soundtracks ja:\u30cf\u30ec\u6674\u30ec\u30e6\u30ab\u30a4 ",
