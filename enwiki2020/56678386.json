    "text": "Charles Rudolf Leg\u00e9ndy (Hungarian: Leg\u00e9ndy K\u00e1roly Rudolf, born November 2, 1936), is a Hungarian-born American engineer, theoretical physicist, and neuroscientist. In physics, Leg\u00e9ndy is known for his theoretical work on the helicon phenomenon,Boswell, R. W. and Chen F. F. (December 1997) \"Helicons \u2013 the early years\". IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science 25 (6): 1229\u20131244. DOI: 10.1109/27.650898. In neuroscience, he is known for introducing the \"Poisson surprise\" test used for burst detection in neuronal spike trains,Gour\u00e9vitch, B. and Eggermont, J. J. (2007) \u201cA nonparametric approach for detection of bursts in spike trains.\u201d Journal of Neuroscience Methods 160:349-358. DOI:10.1016/j.jneumeth.2006.09.024 and for his calculations of brain capacity. == Biography == Leg\u00e9ndy began his university studies at the Budapest University of Technology (M\u00fcegyetem). After emigrating to the United States in 1956, he obtained a bachelor's degree in engineering physics from Princeton University (1959) and a PhD in theoretical physics from Cornell University (1964). In his postdoctoral years, Leg\u00e9ndy switched from physics to neuroscience and took a series of research positions in the US and overseas, publishing both theoretical and experimental papers. In 1985 he lost his research funding and returned to engineering, working in aerospace design (ITT Avionics, Singer-Kearfott), and in database management, until his retirement (2001). In retirement, Leg\u00e9ndy joined the Psychology Department at Columbia University in an unpaid position as an adjunct researcher,https://psychology.columbia.edu/content/charles-legendy and (after a 26 year hiatus in publications) resumed work in theoretical neuroscience. While in Germany, Leg\u00e9ndy met his future wife Annemarie; they married in 1977, and settled down to raise their children in New York City. == Physics: helicon waves == As a graduate student at Cornell, Leg\u00e9ndy joined an experimental team which had just discovered an electromagnetic resonance phenomenon at unexpectedly low frequencies (32 Hz and below) inside a metal sample in a magnetic field. Leg\u00e9ndy showed that the resonance was the manifestation of solid-state plasma wave propagation inside the metal,Bowers, R., Leg\u00e9ndy, C. R., and Rose, F. E. (November 1961) \"Oscillatory galvanomagnetic effect in metallic Sodium\". Physical Review Letters 7 (9): 339-341. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.7.339. mathematically comparable to radio whistlers Storey, L. R. O. (9 July 1953) \"An investigation of whistling atmospherics\".

DOI: 10.1098/rsta.1953.0011. in the ionosphere. == Neuroscience: general design of data processing in the brain == Leg\u00e9ndy\u2019s theory of the brain develops certain additions to the Hebbian theory; in particular, to the theory of cell assemblies.Palm, G. (February 1981) \u201cTowards a theory of cell assemblies\u201d Biological Cybernetics 39 (3): 181-194. DOI: 10.1007/BF00342771 He estimated the maximum number of stable cell assemblies that could fit into the network. Under the most optimistic set of assumptions available at the time, the brain model could contain up to 109 \"mental entities,\" the figure later used by HebbHebb, D. O. (December 1976) \"Physiological learning theory\". Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology 4 (4): 309-314. DOI: 10.1007/BF00922529, , print ISSN 0091-0627, online ISSN 1573-2835. in illustrating the large capacity of the brain. (Recent data shows that the estimate must be greatly reduced; and Leg\u00e9ndy now believes that the large capacity of brains cannot be explained in terms of synaptic weights alone; synapse-based memory must be supplemented by a molecular backup system.Leg\u00e9ndy, C. R. (August 2016) \"Synaptic and extrasynaptic traces of long-term memory: the ID molecule theory\". Reviews in the Neurosciences 27 (6): 575-598. DOI: 10.1515/revneuro-2016-0015.) Leg\u00e9ndy\u2019s work on brain circuitry and ignitions led to the \u201cPoisson surprise\u201d analysis of neuronal spike trainsLeg\u00e9ndy, C. R. and Salcman M. (April 1985) \"Bursts and recurrences of bursts in the spike trains of spontaneously active striate cortex neurons\". Journal of Neurophysiology 53 (4): 926-939. DOI: 10.1152/jn.1985.53.4.926. . a method of burst detection.Cotterill, E. and Eglen, S. J. (February 2018) \u201cBurst detection methods\u201d. q-bio.NC (Quantitative Biology - Neurons and Cognition) arXiv:1802.01287v1 (Poisson surprise is defined as \u2013log P, where P is the probability of a spike pattern under the assumed baseline distribution of spiking \u2014 in this case the Poisson distribution.) The test can quickly detect and quantify bursts in neuronal spike trains; and it is used, for instance, as a way to detect loss of functionality in certain brain regions. The critique of the Poisson surprise test is that actual spike distributions differ from the Poisson distribution to varying degrees (for instance for interspike intervals smaller than the refractory period); the critique generally suggests changing the underlying probability distribution, not the principle of surprise-based burst detection. The concept of surprising events in neuronal spike trains was originally introduced on theoretical grounds,Palm, G. (November 1981) \u201cEvidence, information, and surprise\u201d Biological Cybernetics 42 (1): 57-68. , DOI: 10.1007/BF00335160 in view of the large number of unplanned contacts present in the brain which necessitate statistical methods for distinguishing the useful signals from random firing. (The connection to the cell assembly theory is through the ignition phenomenon \u2013 ignitions create surprising events at distant locations.Leg\u00e9ndy, C. R.
