    "text": "The Saxon Charm is a 1948 film noir drama film written and directed by Claude Binyon based on the novel of the same name by Frederic Wakeman Sr.. It starred Robert Montgomery, Susan Hayward, John Payne and Audrey Totter. ==Plot== In a hospital, theatrical producer Matt Saxon is introduced to writer Eric Busch, and ends up offering to produce Eric's new play with financing from millionaire Zack Humber. Alma Wragg, a singer, is Saxon's girlfriend, but she warns Eric's wife Janet about the producer's notorious \"Saxon charm\" that coaxes others into doing his bidding, only to end up badly for everyone involved. Sure enough, Saxon's behavior soon ruins Alma's nightclub audition. It isn't long before Saxon makes a pest of himself, interrupting a beach vacation Eric and Janet take, closing the show after a poor review, then persuading Eric to go off by himself to do rewrites. Saxon loses the financial backing of Humber so he works on his ex-wife to put up the money, not knowing she is broke. Alma gets a chance to be in a Hollywood movie, but Saxon interferes with that as well. Janet, upset by Eric's absences, begins drinking and threatens to leave him. Eric finally punches Saxon, who is so oblivious to his destructive nature, he even contributes to his ex-wife's suicide. Eric and Janet get away from him just in time. ==Cast== * Robert Montgomery as Matt Saxon * Susan Hayward as Janet Busch * John Payne as Eric Busch * Audrey Totter as Alma Wragg * Harry Morgan as Hermy (as Harry Morgan) * Harry von Zell as Zack Humber * Cara Williams as Dolly Humber * Chill Wills as Captain Chatham * Heather Angel as Vivian Saxon ==See also== * List of American films of 1948 ==External links== * * Category:1948 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:1948 drama films Category:Films directed by Claude Binyon Category:American drama films Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films scored by Walter Scharf Category:American black-and-white films ",
