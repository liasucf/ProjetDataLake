The largest taajama in Finland is the Helsingin keskustaajama (\"Helsinki central urban area\") with approximately 1,200,000 inhabitants in 2014. It extends across Helsinki as well as 10 other municipalities in the Greater Helsinki area. The second largest is the Tampereen keskustaajama with almost 320,000 inhabitants in 2012.

Each major road leading in or out of a taajama is marked with a road sign. ==See also== *List of urban areas in Finland by population *List of cities and towns in Finland *Urban areas in the Nordic countries *Dispersed settlement ==References== Category:Types of country subdivisions Category:Geography of Finland ",
