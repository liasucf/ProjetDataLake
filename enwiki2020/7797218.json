Both albums were a tribute to his late mother. Songs from these albums featured heavily in the setlist of Vitas' extensive world tour The Songs of My Mother, performed at hundreds of venues in several countries from 2004-2006.Press release The opening track, The Star won a Russian People's HIT prize in 2003 and is one of Vitas' most popular songs worldwide. Like Opera No. 2, it is still a staple of Vitas' live performances. Vitas sang the song as a duet with Alexander Kireev for his entry into the Star Factory in 2006. He performed the song Starry River accompanied by its composer Aleksandra Pakhmutova on piano at a concert in honour of the composer. He covered the song The Unknown Friend Song (\u041f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044f \u043e \u043d\u0435\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0435, also known as Extraterrestrial Friend) composed in 1985 by Aleksandra Pakhmutova and Rasul Gamzatov (the poem is translated by Yunna Morits) for the song cycle The Earth Globe (\u0428\u0430\u0440 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043d\u043e\u0439, 1985\u20131987). The song is about an unknown friend that realizes that there is an unknown circle of \"invisible and unknown\" friends and enemies, as well as \"lovable planets\" (as per the lyrics), in addition to interstellar and general awareness, brotherhood to the next and an existence of an extraplanetary cycle. (The song addresses the topic of science fiction: brotherhood for humanity in the 3rd millennium and beyond.) It is also subsequently re-edited on Vitas' 2006 CD Return Home. There's also the music score of the song (available on the composer's website) to download.Download the score of the song Extraterrestrial Friend (\u041f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044f \u043e \u043d\u0435\u0438\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u043c \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433\u0435) In concert, Vitas often dons an alien robot costume while performing this song. ==Track listing== ==References== ==External links== * Official site * Vitas on Facebook * Vitas' producer on Facebook * Amazon reviews * English translations of lyrics Category:2003 albums Category:Vitas albums ",
