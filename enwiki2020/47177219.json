After winning their placement round games Latvia and Hungary competed in the relegation game with Latvia being relegated to the European Qualification after losing 3-4.

The change means that three qualification tournaments will be held in the even years, starting in 2016, and the World Championships will be held in the odd years, starting in 2017. The qualification tournaments have been restructured into three regions to lower travel costs with the regions now being Africa / South America, Asia / Oceania, and Europe / North America. In the semifinals Australia defeated Great Britain and Croatia beat Argentina, both advancing to the gold medal game.
