    "text": "is a combat flight video game developed and published by Sega. The game is a part of the After Burner series, and was first released in arcades in 2006 and was later ported to Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network in April 2010. Like previous incarnations of After Burner, the \"Deluxe\" After Burner Climax cabinet has a servo-equipped chair; a new function is a button that locks the chair into a static upright position. Two other cabinet versions include a \"Commander\" version, which only tilts side to side, and the \"Standard\" version, which doesn't move at all. The \"Deluxe\" version cabinet has a widescreen LCD monitor, while the \"Standard\" and \"Commander\" models have a 29\" CRT. The game was delisted from both Xbox Live and PSN in December 2014, and was removed from the mobile storefronts in May 2015. However, the mobile version was re-released via the Sega Forever service in April 2019. ==Gameplay== In-game screenshot. After Burner Climax introduces two new flyable aircraft to the series: the F/A-18E Super Hornet and F-15E Strike Eagle. The iconic F-14 Tomcat from previous games has been replaced with the F-14D Super Tomcat. The player selects the aircraft at the start screen. While choosing their plane, the player can use the throttle to choose between four different paintjobs for each of the three planes. These paint jobs consist of a \"Standard\" scheme, \"Camouflage\" scheme, \"Special\" scheme, and \"Low Visibility\" scheme. After choosing their plane, the player can also choose to listen to After Burner Climax's music or the original soundtrack from After Burner II by holding the throttle back and hitting the missile button. ==Reception== The Australian video game talk show Good Game two reviewers gave the game a 6/10 and 8/10. ==References== ==External links== *Official website *After Burner Climax at SEGA Amusements U.S.A. website *After Burner Climax at Arcade History *Xbox Page Category:2006 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Arcade games Category:Flight simulation video games Category:IOS games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:Sega-AM2 games Category:Sega arcade games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Hiroshi Kawaguchi Category:Xbox 360 Live Arcade games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:Single- player video games Category:Shoot 'em ups ",
