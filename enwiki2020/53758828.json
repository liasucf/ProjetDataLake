Acta Mathematicae Applicatae Sinica. 4, 366\u2013377 It is defined as The geometric process. Given a sequence of non- negative random variables : \\\\{X_k,k=1,2, \\dots\\\\} , if they are independent and the cdf of X_k is given by F(a^{k-1}x) for k=1,2, \\dots , where a is a positive constant, then \\\\{X_k,k=1,2,\\ldots\\\\} is called a geometric process (GP).

A stochastic process \\\\{Z_n, n = 1,2, \\ldots\\\\} is said to be a threshold geometric process (threshold GP), if there exists real numbers a_i > 0, i = 1,2, \\ldots , k and integers \\\\{1 = M_1 < M_2 < \\cdots < M_k < M_{k+1} = \\infty\\\\} such that for each i = 1, \\ldots , k, \\\\{a_i^{n-M_i}Z_n, M_i \\le n < M_{i+1}\\\\} forms a renewal process. * The doubly geometric process.Wu, S.
