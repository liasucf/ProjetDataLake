    "text": "Franz Xaver Kroetz (; born 25 February 1946 in Munich) is a German author, playwright, actor and film director. His plays have been translated and performed internationally. ==Life== Kroetz attended an acting school in Munich and the Max-Reinhardt-Seminar in Vienna. He worked as a day-laborer and was active in the German political party DKP, Germany Communist Party, from 1971 to 1980. He became famous when in 1971 the premiere of his plays Heimarbeit (House-work) and Hartn\u00e4ckig (Persistent) were disrupted by neo-fascists. His plays in the 1970s portrayed people who had been rendered speechless by their own social misery. In the play Das Nest (The Nest), the protagonist is a truck driver. His boss orders him to dump toxic waste into a lake, thus soiling his \"nest.\" He wrote a libretto based on his play Stallerhof (1971) for an opera of the same name which Gerd K\u00fchr composed in 1987/88. It was premiered at the first Munich Biennale in 1988. The play was staged at the Burgtheater in 2010 by David B\u00f6sch.Georg Petermichl: Fantasievolle Pirouetten nachtkritik.de 10 December 2010 In her book Franz Xaver Kroetz The Construction of a Political Aesthetic, Michelle Mattson of the Columbia University summarizes: > Franz Xaver Kroetz \u2013 banana-cutter, hospital orderly, fledgling actor and, > more significantly, Germany's most popular contemporary dramatist of the > seventies and early eighties.
