    "text": "The Abominable Man (, meaning \"The abominable man from S\u00e4ffle\") is a 1971 police procedural novel by Swedish writers Maj Sj\u00f6wall and Per Wahl\u00f6\u00f6. It is the seventh book in their series about Martin Beck. The plot follows Martin Beck and his colleagues trying to solve a murder on a senior policeman, known for his brutality against others. While the investigation is ongoing, a well armed man climbs up on a roof in Stockholm. One of Donald Knuth's favourite novels, he described it as \"one of Sj\u00f6wall and Wahl\u00f6\u00f6's brilliantly Swedish detective novels\".Knuth: Retirement == Plot == A senior policeman known for brutality is violently knifed while in his hospital bed (in Sabbatsberg Hospital). Within a 24-hour period, Martin Beck investigates the policeman's many enemies in an attempt to identify the killer, for whom the murder was only a precursor to a Charles Whitman-style attack on Stockholm. Since they cannot find a starting clue, the police go in the archives of the police ombudsman where they find many old complaints about Nyman. They encounter the entry of their former colleague \u00c5ke Eriksson; Eriksson's wife was in diabetic coma but she was considered drunk by Nyman and locked in the drunk cell, where she died. Finally, on the roof of a skyscraper in downtown Stockholm, it comes to a showdown with Eriksson, who has lost everything, at which point the novel ends with Martin Beck seriously injured by a gunshot. == Characters and their development == Martin Beck and his now grown-up daughter Ingrid develop their friendship; they eat out together. Police officer Kurt Kvant is killed in this book by the crazed killer on the roof. == Film adaptation == The book was adapted to film in 1976 and directed by Bo Widerberg. It was renamed The Man on the Roof (), and stars Carl-Gustaf Lindstedt, Sven Wollter, Thomas Hellberg and H\u00e5kan Serner. It was awarded with two Guldbagge Awards. == References == Category:1971 Swedish novels Category:Novels by Sj\u00f6wall and Wahl\u00f6\u00f6 Category:Swedish detective novels Category:Pantheon Books books Category:Norstedts F\u00f6rlag books Category:Swedish novels adapted into films ",
