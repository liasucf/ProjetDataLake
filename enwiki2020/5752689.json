    "text": "\"Vi\u0161e nisam tvoja\" (\"I'm not yours anymore\") was the Croatian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003, performed bilingually in Croatian and English by Claudia Beni although there is not a bilingual version on record. The English version of the song is called \"I Can't be Your Lover\". The song was performed eighth on the night, following Portugal's Rita Guerra with \"Deixa-me sonhar\" and preceding Cyprus' Stelios Constantas with \"Feeling Alive\". At the close of voting, it had received 29 points, placing 15th in a field of 26. For her Eurovision performance, Claudia wore coloured dress, and was accompanied by four backing singers. On the last note of the song, the backing singers lifted Claudia into the air. The song is an up-tempo number, with Beni telling a former lover that she does not need him anymore. It was succeeded as Croatian representative at the 2004 contest by Ivan Mikuli\u0107 with \"You Are The Only One\".
