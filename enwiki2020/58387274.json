    "text": "Newspaper Row in San Francisco referred to the five-point intersection of Market Street, Kearny Street, Third Street and Geary Street, where three of San Francisco's largest daily newspapers were headquartered, across the street from each other. By 1902, The San Francisco Call, The San Francisco Examiner and the San Francisco Chronicle were in buildings on corners, with the Chronicle in the Chronicle Building, the Call in the Spreckels Building and the Examiner in the Examiner building. The intersection became known as the \"Times Square of the West\". ==1906 Earthquake and Fire== Newspaper Row was partially destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco Fire. The Call's Spreckles building and the Examiner's Hearst building were slowly gutted over two hours, and the Chronicle's building was similarly gutted, but the brick remained and was rebuilt. The three newspapers published a combined issue from the office of the Oakland Tribune. == Relocated == The two surviving papers later relocated to near the intersection of Fifth Street and Mission Street, The San Francisco Examiner (Fifth) and the San Francisco Chronicle (Mission) across from the San Francisco Mint. ==References== Category:Newspaper row ",
