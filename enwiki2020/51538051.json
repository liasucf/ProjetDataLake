    "text": "Killamery Cross is a 9th-century high cross and National Monument in Killamery, County Kilkenny, Ireland. It is located in the north of Killamery graveyard. ==History== A monastery was established at Killamery by St Gobhan, a disciple of Saint Fursey, in AD 632. The Killamery High cross is part of the western Ossory group of crosses, used as a model for many of the small high crosses sold across the world as an Irish symbol. Locals formerly touched the cross's capstone to cure headaches. ==Description== The cross stands high. It is richly sculptured on the shaft with marigold flowers carved on it. There is a boss in the middle of the wheel-head that is surrounded by interlacing snakes and, above the boss, an open-mouthed dragon, giving it the name of the Snake-Dragon Cross. The western face has a sun swastika at the centre and also depicts Adam and Eve, a stag hunt and a chariot procession. On top of the cross is a gabled cap-stone. Noah and John the Baptist are depicted. On the base an inscription reads OR DO MAELSECHNAILL, \"a prayer for M\u00e1el Sechnaill\", who was high king of Ireland in 846\u2013862. ===Other artefacts=== There is also a cross-slab of an earlier date the inscription OROIT AR ANMAIN N-AEDAIN, \"Pray for the soul of \u00c1ed\u00e1in\". Two bullaun stones can also be seen. There is also a holy well, St Goban's Well. ==References== Category:National Monuments in County Kilkenny Category:High crosses in the Republic of Ireland Category:Religion in County Kilkenny Category:9th-century sculptures ",
