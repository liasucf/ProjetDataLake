In Britain, she was known for playing Fiona Carter in series 3\u20134 of the popular series Spooks, which she left mid-series owing to her first pregnancy in 2005. She is married to the actor Sendhil Ramamurthy (of TV series Heroes fame) and they have one daughter, Halina (b. 2005), and one son, Alex (b. 2008). Sosnovska played a small role in a third-season episode of Heroes.
