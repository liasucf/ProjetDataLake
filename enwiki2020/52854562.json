Lyrically, Michaels has described the song as a raw ode to her own anxieties. ==Critical reception== The song received generally positive reviews from music critics. A writer for Billboard praised the song, writing, \"with blunt, honest lyricism and razor-sharp songwriting, Michaels' decision to choose minimal production proves to be wise, helping to frame her intriguing vocals expertly in order to give fans a delicious first taste of what is yet to come\". Writing for Idolator, Mike Wass stated \"it can be hard for songwriters to carve out a unique voice when they step out on their own, but it doesn\u2019t look like that will be a problem for Julia\". ==Music video== The official music video for the song, directed by Tabitha Denholm, was released on March 7, 2017.
