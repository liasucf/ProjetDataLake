    "text": "Queensborough Bridge is a highway bridge in New Westminster, British Columbia. It was built in 1960 by the City of New Westminster, costing $4 million. The bridge spans the north arm of the Fraser River for road access from the main part of New Westminster to the suburb of Queensborough at the east end of Lulu Island, giving the bridge its name. It has since become a part of Highway 91A feeder to Highway 91 to the south. Queensborough was a toll bridge until bought by the provincial government in November 1966. In 2008, the northern exit has been upgraded into a better intersection with Marine Way and Stewardson Way. ==See also== * List of crossings of the Fraser River ==References== * Bridges of Greater Vancouver * Category:Bridges in Greater Vancouver Category:Bridges completed in 1960 Category:Bridges over the Fraser River Category:Buildings and structures in New Westminster Category:Road bridges in British Columbia Category:Former toll bridges in Canada ",
