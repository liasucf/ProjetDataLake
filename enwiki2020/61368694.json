    "text": "Roger Lau (born in 1977) is an American political consultant, who served as the campaign manager for Elizabeth Warren's 2020 presidential campaign. He and Faiz Shakir (campaign manager for Bernie Sanders' 2020 campaign) share the distinction of being the first Asian Americans to manage the campaigns of a major American presidential candidate. == Early life == Lau was born in Woodside, Queens, New York to parents from Guangzhou, China. He has two brothers. His parents worked many jobs including driving instructors, takeout restaurant owners, etc. He attended the Bronx High School of Science but dropped out due to truancy. After receiving a GED, he went to the University of Massachusetts Amherst where he majored in political science and minored in Chinese. While at UMass, he interned for John Kerry. Lau graduated in 2000, and planned to return to New York; instead he was hired by John Kerry's staff and asked for a job working with constituents. == Career == Lau started his career working with Kerry, including his 2004 presidential campaign. While working on the campaign, he met former United States president Bill Clinton and United States Senator Hillary Clinton, for whom he now provides consultancy on Massachusetts-related politics. He also worked on Kerry's Senate 2008 re-election campaign. Lau briefly worked in the United States Department of Commerce for President Barack Obama. After the death of Ted Kennedy who served in the Senate for 48 years, a series of losses led Lau to the Senate campaign of Elizabeth Warren. He later became the manager of her presidential campaign. == Personal life == Lau is partnered with Amanda Coulombe, a political field organizer who emphasizes technology, and they reside in Somerville, Massachusetts. == References == Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:People from Woodside, Queens Category:American people of Chinese descent Category:People from Somerville, Massachusetts Category:University of Massachusetts Amherst alumni Category:American campaign managers Category:Elizabeth Warren Category:The Bronx High School of Science alumni ",
