    "text": "Erez Daleyot is a Belgian-Israeli diamond dealer, who may have once controlled one-third of all trade in diamonds. In 2006, after the arrest of New York- based diamond dealer Jacob Arabo (known as \"Jacob the Jeweler\") on charges of laundering $270 million in drug money, it was reported that Daleyot was one of his financiers and owned 50% of his jewellery business. In December 2015, Daleyot was arrested in Johannesburg on fraud charges, and released on bail. In February 2016, the Antwerp Court of Appeals declared his former company, D.D. Manufacturing, bankrupt, owing about $230 million, while Daleyot is allegedly \"hiding out in Israel or South Africa\". ==References== Category:Living people Category:Diamond dealers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
