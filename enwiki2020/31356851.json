    "text": "Sound Pieces is an album by American jazz composer, conductor and arranger Oliver Nelson featuring performances recorded in 1966 for the Impulse! label.Impulse! Records discography accessed April 1, 2011 ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4 stars, stating: \"Although best-known as an altoist and a tenor-saxophonist, Nelson sticks exclusively to soprano throughout the set. He leads a 20-piece big band on three of his compositions. Although one would not think of Nelson as a soprano stylist, his strong playing actually put him near the top of his field\".Yanow, S.
