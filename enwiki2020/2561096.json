    "text": "The Principle of Moments is the second solo studio album by the English singer Robert Plant, formerly of Led Zeppelin. It was Plant's second Top 10 album in the US and UK. It also gave him his first solo Top 40 hit with \"Big Log\". The most popular track on album-oriented rock radio in the US was \"Other Arms\", which reached number-one on the Billboard Top Tracks chart. Genesis' drummer Phil Collins played drums for six of the album's eight songs (as he did on Pictures at Eleven). On the other two tracks former Jethro Tull drummer Barriemore Barlow performed. Like Plant's first solo album, Pictures at Eleven, the songs departed from the hard rock sound of Led Zeppelin. Following the strength of these albums, Plant launched a successful tour in 1983. Phil Collins was the drummer for Plant's band for the North American portion of the tour. Collins was content to perform in the background, despite his own enormous success as a solo artist and with Genesis at the time. Little Feat's Richie Hayward played drums for the remaining dates. Rhino Entertainment released a remastered edition of the album, with bonus tracks, on 3 April 2007. ==Promotional music videos== The music video for \"Big Log\" was shot at the following locations: Crystal Road, Crystal, Nevada (gas station sequences), the Amargosa Opera House, Death Valley Junction, California (driving and \"feather\" sequence), Calico School House (Calico Ghost Town) Yermo, California (schoolhouse sequence), Glass Pool Inn, Las Vegas, Nevada (pool sequence). The bar sequence is believed to have been shot at a small bar in Shoshone, California (now the Crow Bar Cafe & Saloon), though this is unconfirmed. A video for \"In the Mood\" was also produced. ==Tour== In 1983, Robert Plant went on a tour to promote the album, starting on August 26 in Peoria, Illinois, and ending on October 1 in Vancouver, British Columbia. {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" ! colspan=4 width=\"1090\" | Tour dates |- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\" | colspan=4 align=center | *August 26, 1983: Peoria, Illinois \u2013 Peoria Civic Center *August 27, 1983: Kalamazoo, Michigan \u2013 Wings Stadium *August 29, 1983: Rosemont, Illinois \u2013 Rosemont Horizon *August 30, 1983: St. Louis, Missouri \u2013 Kiel Auditorium *August 31, 1983: Milwaukee \u2013 MECCA Arena *September 3, 1983: Detroit \u2013 Joe Louis Arena *September 4, 1983: Cleveland, Ohio (Richfield) \u2013 Richfield Coliseum *September 6, 1983: Worcester, Massachusetts \u2013 The Centrum *September 8, 1983: Montreal \u2013 Montreal Forum *September 9, 1983: Buffalo, New York \u2013 Buffalo Memorial Auditorium *September 10, 1983: Toronto \u2013 Maple Leaf Gardens *September 12, 1983: New York City \u2013 Madison Square Garden *September 13, 1983: Hartford, Connecticut \u2013 Hartford Civic Center *September 14, 1983: Philadelphia \u2013 The Spectrum *September 16, 1983: Memphis, Tennessee \u2013 Mid-South Coliseum *September 18, 1983: Biloxi, Mississippi \u2013 Mississippi Coast Coliseum *September 20, 1983: Houston, Texas \u2013 The Summit *September 21, 1983: Austin, Texas \u2013 Frank Erwin Center *September 22, 1983: Dallas \u2013 Reunion Arena *September 24, 1983: Denver, Colorado \u2013 McNichols Arena *September 27, 1983: Los Angeles (Inglewood) \u2013 The Forum *September 28, 1983: Oakland, California \u2013 Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum *September 30, 1983: Seattle \u2013 Seattle Center Coliseum *October 1, 1983: Vancouver, BC \u2013 Pacific Coliseum |} ==Track listing== *Live tracks: recorded in Houston, Texas in 1983. ==Personnel== *Robert Plant: lead vocals and backing vocals *Robbie Blunt: guitars *Gerald Woodroffe: synthesizers *Paul Martinez: basses *Phil Collins: drums, except 4 and 7 (incl. bonus tracks) *Barriemore Barlow: drums on tracks 4 and 7 *John David: backing vocals *Ray Martinez: backing vocals ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Chart !Peak Position |- |align=\"left\"|Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart |10 |- |align=\"left\"|New Zealand Albums Chart |1 |- |align=\"left\"|Swedish Albums Chart |41 |- |align=\"left\"|UK Albums Chart |7 |- |align=\"left\"|US Billboard 200 |8 |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\"|Chart (1983) ! scope=\"col\"|Position |- |Australian Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|83 |- |} {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\"|Chart (1984) ! scope=\"col\"|Position |- |Australian Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|41 |- |} ==Certifications== ==References== ==External links== * *Rockfield Studios *Discography on the Robert Plant Homepage (not an official site) *Big Log video Category:Robert Plant albums Category:1983 albums Category:Atlantic Records albums Category:Albums recorded at Rockfield Studios Category:Albums with cover art by Hipgnosis ",
