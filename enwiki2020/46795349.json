Many of the people were in their 80s and 90s but looked years younger. The World Health Organization conducted research of 990 villages and towns in Japan; it was found that there were 10 times more people living beyond the age of 85 in Yuzurihara than there were in North America.Japonica, 2011 The villagers of Yuzurihara were found to have high levels of hyaluronic acid in their diet, which is the main reason why their skin appeared wrinkle free and their hair grew thick.( Babel, 2011 Hyaluronic acid is used in many topical skin serums and creams for anti-aging. This is chemically related to naturally occurring hyaluronan, the purpose of which is to hold moisture the skin and can increase moisture absorption by up to 1000 times. ==References== *Davids, K (2015).
