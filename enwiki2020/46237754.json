Tournament matches were played at the Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach, California during December 1973. California defeated UC Irvine in the final, 8\u20134, to win their first national title. The leading scorer for the tournament was Bruce Kocsis from USC (8 goals). The award for Most Outstanding Player was not given out this year, but an All-Tournament Team was named. ==Qualification== Since there has only ever been one single national championship for water polo, all NCAA men's water polo programs (whether from Division I, Division II, or Division III) were eligible. A total of 8 teams were invited to contest this championship. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Team ! Appearance !
