Sporting Anderlecht became champions on 24 April 2004. ==Promoted teams== These teams were promoted from the second division at the start of the season: *Cercle Brugge K.S.V. (second division champions) *K. Heusden-Zolder (playoff winner) ==Relegated teams== These teams were relegated to the second division at the end of the season: *K. Heusden-Zolder *R. Antwerp F.C. ==Anderlecht's title success== The battle for the title was not great as Anderlecht had a big lead over their opponents (mainly Club Brugge). However, a bad finish from Anderlecht kept the suspense until the 31st matchday when Club Brugge drew with Mouscron while the team from Brussels also drew (1-1) at Herman Vanderpoortenstadion, the homeground of Lierse. ==Battle for Europe== The next week, Club Brugge was sure to enter the UEFA Champions League Preliminary Round with a 1-0 win against Standard Li\u00e8ge, then lying third. In spite of this defeat, Standard managed to qualify for the UEFA Cup as they were 6 points ahead of Mouscron after the 32nd matchday. The suspense was killed after a 1-1 draw against Charleroi the next Saturday. ==The relegation dog fight== The end of the league was thus centered on the battle against relegation. Four teams were concerned : R.A.E.C. Mons and Charleroi, which finally saved themselves, R. Antwerp F.C. and K. Beringen-Heusden-Zolder finishing respectively 6 and 5 points adrift. ==Final league table== ==Top goal scorers== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Scorer !Goals !Team |- | Luigi Pieroni |style=\"text-align:center;\"|28 |Mouscron |- | \u00c9mile Mpenza |style=\"text- align:center;\"|21 |Standard Li\u00e8ge |- | Tosin Dosunmu |style=\"text- align:center;\"|16 |Westerlo |- | Aruna Dindane |style=\"text-align:center;\"|15 |Anderlecht |- | Gert Verheyen |style=\"text-align:center;\"|15 |Club Brugge |- | Andr\u00e9s Mendoza |style=\"text-align:center;\"|14 |Club Brugge |- | C\u00e9dric Roussel |style=\"text-align:center;\"|14 |Racing Genk |} ==See also== *2003\u201304 in Belgian football ==References== * Sport.be website - Archive Category:Belgian First Division A seasons Belgian 1 ",
