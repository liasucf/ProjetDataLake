She completed her basic studies and then earned a Bachelor's Degree in Humanities from the Universidad Mayor de San Sim\u00f3n in 1965. Completing her Law Degree at the same university in 1972, Monta\u00f1o earned Master's Degrees in human rights and political science at the Universidad Mayor de San Sim\u00f3n and University of Huelva, Huelva, Spain and went on to work on her doctorate in human rights at the Universidad Pablo de Olavide in Seville, Spain. ==Biography== Monta\u00f1o has served as Vice President of the Human Rights Assembly of Bolivia and as the Comptroller of Cochabamba, Bolivia. From 1997 to 2002 she served in the Chamber of Deputies representing the Cochabamba Department. In 1981, during the Bolivian Cocaine Coup, Julieta Monta\u00f1o, who was at that time heading the Union de Mujeres de Bolivia (UMBO) (Union of Bolivian Women) was placed under house arrest. The dictatorship ended on 4 August 1981 and Monta\u00f1o returned to her legal practice. On 11 April 1985 Monta\u00f1o founded the Oficina Jur\u00eddica para la Mujer (OJM) (Legal Office for Women) to promote women\u2019s rights and work towards the elimination of and protection from sexual exploitation and violence against women. Through education and public policy creation as well as social, psychological, and legal assistance, the organization promotes gender equality. Since its founding, the organization has provided legal aid for rape, sexual harassment and domestic violence to more than 30,000 women and has worked with the Bolivian legislature in drafting laws to protect women from these kinds of issues. As just one such example, in 2013, the Bolivian Government passed a femicide regulation punishing perpetrators with a maximum sentence of thirty years without the possibility of parole. It is the harshest penalty allowed under the law of the country. Despite being jailed during the era of the Bolivian dictatorship, Monta\u00f1o has continuously worked to change public policy. According to the US State Department, she has \"influenced nearly every piece of legislation that advanced women\u2019s rights over the past 30 years\" in Bolivia. ==Associations== *1994-1999: Representative of the Committee for Latin America and the Caribbean for the Defense of Women's Rights (CLADEM). *2002\u2013present: Serves on the Board of Directors of Center for Justice and International Law (CEJIL). *2004\u2013present: Consultative Honorary Council for CLADEM and she continues to serve as their legal council. *2007 General Assembly of the Organization of American States (OAS) appointed Monta\u00f1a as one of the 7 members of the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IACHR). ==Selected works== *Sistematizaci\u00f3n de Experiencias en Respuestas Sociales en Cuesti\u00f3n de Vida: Balance Regional y Desaf\u00edos sobre el Derecho de las Mujeres a una Vida sin Violencia.
