    "text": "In futurology, political science, and science fiction, a post-work society is a society in which the nature of work has been radically transformed. Some post-work theorists imagine the complete automation of all jobs, or the complete automation of all boring and unpleasant work. Other theories of post- work society focus more on challenging the priority of the work ethic, and on the celebration of nonwork activities. Near-term practical proposals closely associated with post-work theory include universal basic income and the reduction of the working day and the working week. Increase focus the details of what post-work society would look like has been driven by reports such as one that 47% of jobs in the United States have the potential to be automated. Because of increasing automation and the low price of maintaining an automated workforce compare to one dependent on human labour it has also been suggested that post-work societies would also be ones of post-scarcity. ==See also== * Universal basic income * Automation * Post-scarcity * Refusal of work ==References== Category:Automation Category:Futures studies ",
