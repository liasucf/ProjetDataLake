    "text": "Morning, just after sunrise on a farm in Namibia (2014) Morning is the period of time from sunrise to noon. There are no exact times for when morning begins (also true for evening and night) because it can vary according to one's lifestyle and the hours of daylight at each time of year.Learner's Dictionary However, morning strictly ends at noon, which is when afternoon starts. Morning can be defined as starting from midnight to noon. Morning precedes afternoon, evening, and night in the sequence of a day. Originally, the term referred to sunrise.Online Etymology Dictionary ==Etymology== The Modern English words \"morning\" and \"tomorrow\" began in Middle English as morwening, developing into morwen, then morwe, and eventually morrow. English, unlike some other languages, has separate terms for \"morning\" and \"tomorrow\", despite their common root. Other languages, like German, may use a single word \u2013 Morgen \u2013 to signify both \"morning\" and \"tomorrow\".Origin of the phrase \"Good Morning Etymology of the word \"morning ==Significance== === Greeting === Some languages that use the time of day in greeting have a special greeting for morning, such as the English good morning. The appropriate time to use such greetings, such as whether it may be used between midnight and dawn, depends on the culture's or speaker's concept of morning. The use of 'good morning' is ambiguous, usually depending on when the person woke up. As a general rule, the greeting is normally used from 3:00a.m. to around noon. Many people greet someone with the shortened 'morning' rather than 'good morning'. It is used as a greeting, never a farewell, unlike 'good night' which is used as the latter. To show respect, one can add the addressee's last name after the salutation: Good morning, Mr. Smith. === Activities === Morning typically encompasses activities such as bathing, eating breakfast and possibly elevenses, getting dressed, and, for some people, planning the day's schedule or reading a morning newspaper. === Cultural use === For some, the word morning may refer to the period immediately following waking up, irrespective of the current time of day. This modern sense of morning is due largely to the worldwide spread of electricity, and the independence from natural light sources. === Genealogy === The morning period may be a period of enhanced or reduced energy and productivity. The ability of a person to wake up effectively in the morning may be influenced by a gene called \"Period 3\". This gene comes in two forms, a \"long\" and a \"short\" variant. It seems to affect the person's preference for mornings or evenings. People who carry the long variant were over-represented as morning people, while the ones carrying the short variant were evening preference people.Gene determines sleep patterns == Liturgy of the Hours == In the morning period are also included specific phases of the Liturgy of the Hours. == Gallery == File:The bay of Sorrento during the morning.jpg|The bay of Sorrento during the morning File:Misty morning02.jpg|Morning mist File:Yosemite Morning.jpg|Yosemite Valley in the morning File:Oxford Circus tube station - Rush hour.jpg|The first rush hour of the day is during the morning, London, April 2012 File:Udusse mattuv harilik vaher, punaste s\u00fcgislehtedega.
