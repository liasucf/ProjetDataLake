They maintain reserves at Cliffe pools, Northward hill, High Halstow and Elmley Marshes, Sheppey. The Medway Council's Riverside park at Gillingham is another example of managed open public access to the marshes. The North Kent Marsh with its stable water level is an important habitat for the water vole. There are thirteen key sites throughout Britain. Shorne and Higham marshes, with parts of Cliffe and Cooling marsh, Allhallows and Grain marshes and the Isle of Sheppey among them. The marshes are protected by the Kent and Medway Structure Plan, and a strong local environmental pressure group. The marshes also offer invaluable natural flood protection for London. ==Governance== The Marshes are in the districts of Dartford, Gravesham, Medway, Swale and Canterbury. ==In popular culture== Charles Dickens' novel Great Expectations is partly set in the marshes.
