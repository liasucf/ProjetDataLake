    "text": "Awarded during the Australian Cricket Awards, the Allan Border Medal is considered to be the most prestigious individual prize in Australian men's cricket. First awarded in 2000, the medal is named after former Australian men's captain Allan Border and recognises the most outstanding male Australian cricketer of the past season as voted by his peers, the media and umpires. Votes are cast after each game on a 3\u20132\u20131 basis, with a weighting applied to give both One Day International and Test players an equal chance of winning the award. ==Media == The award ceremony itself is a major publicity event and usually takes place at the Crown Casino in Melbourne, towards the end of January or the start of February each year. The 2014 and 2017 ceremonies however, were both held in Sydney. The award ceremony itself, prior to 2019 was broadcast live and screened on the digital channel Nine (2000 to 2010) and 9Gem (2011 to 2018). Since 2019, the event has been televised live on both Fox Cricket and 7mate channels. ==Allan Border Medallists== Five cricketers have won the award more than once. Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke won the award four times, sharing the award in 2009. The other multiple winners include David Warner who has won the award three times, as well as Shane Watson and Steve Smith, who have won the award twice. Watson also has the highest vote count of 296, with a huge margin of 100 votes in 2011. *2000: Glenn McGrath *2001: Steve Waugh *2002: Matthew Hayden *2003: Adam Gilchrist *2004: Ricky Ponting *2005: Michael Clarke *2006: Ricky Ponting *2007: Ricky Ponting *2008: Brett Lee *20091: Ricky Ponting and Michael Clarke *2010: Shane Watson *2011: Shane Watson *2012: Michael Clarke *2013: Michael Clarke *2014: Mitchell Johnson *2015: Steve Smith *2016: David Warner *2017: David Warner *2018: Steve Smith *2019: Pat Cummins *2020: David Warner Ref: 1No count-back is used in the Allan Border Medal. ===Multiple winners=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |- !

Like the Allan Border Medal, it is presented annually and determined by matches played in the previous twelve-month period (for example: Ellyse Perry was the winner of the 2020 award, based on her performances predominantly taking place in 2019). The award is named after former national team captain Belinda Clark, whom the similarly-titled Belinda Clark Medal\u2014given to the New South Wales Breakers Player of the WNCL Season\u2014also honours. *2002: Karen Rolton *2003: Karen Rolton *2004: Cathryn Fitzpatrick *2005: Karen Rolton *2006: Karen Rolton *2007: Lisa Sthalekar *2008: Lisa Sthalekar *2009: Shelley Nitschke *2010: Shelley Nitschke *2011: Shelley Nitschke *2012: Shelley Nitschke *2013: Jess Cameron *2014: Meg Lanning *2015: Meg Lanning *2016: Ellyse Perry *2017: Meg Lanning *2018: Ellyse Perry *2019: Alyssa Healy *2020: Ellyse Perry Ref: === Multiple winners === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |- !
