    "text": "{| |} Luna is the second-largest expedition yacht and is currently at the centre of a dispute between Farkhad Akhmedov and Tatyana Akhmedova after ownership was awarded to her by the UK High Court. ==Ownership history== Luna was delivered to Russian businessman Roman Abramovich on 10 April 2010. Its exterior was designed by NewCruise of Germany and its interior by Donald Starkey.The yacht's cost has been estimated at over \u20ac400m. Luna was sold to a company related to Roman Abramovich's close friend, Farkhad Akhmedov, for US$360m in April 2014. In October 2014 the yacht was sent to Bremerhaven, Germany, for an extensive refit costing $50m. The yacht was delivered in March 2016 after a 16-month extensive refit. In October 2017, the yacht entered Port Rashid, Dubai, for maintenance, where it was \"effectively impounded\" by court order due to an ongoing legal dispute between Farkhad Akhmedov and Tatiana Akhmedov over their divorce settlement. A UK court ruled in April 2018 that the yacht should be transferred to Ms Akhmedov, sending the decision to Dubai for further proceedings. In the April ruling, the judge concluded that Mr Akhmedov had deliberately attempted to hide his ownership of Luna to evade the enforcement of the judgement. * * In June 2018, Dubai's Joint Judicial Committee ruled that the Luna case should be immediately transferred from the Dubai International Finance Centre commercial courts to the civil courts, in a move that was widely interpreted as a major blow to Tatiana Akhmedova and her financial backers.http://www.arabnews.com/node/1345281/business-economy In August 2018, a Dubai court rejected an appeal filed by Farkhad Akhmedov to lift a freezing order on Luna. ==Features== Luna and Eclipse have the only multipurpose custom made lifeboat-limousines in the world at a cost of over $4m each.
