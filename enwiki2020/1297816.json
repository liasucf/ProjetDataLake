    "text": "Mummerset is a fictional English dialect supposedly spoken in a rustic English county of the same name. Mummerset is used by actors to represent a stereotypical English West Country accent while not specifically referencing any particular county. The name is a portmanteau of mummer (an archaic term for a folk actor) and Somerset, a largely rural county. Mummerset draws on a mixture of characteristics of real dialects from the West Country, such as rhoticism, forward-shifted diphthongs, lengthened vowels, and the voicing of word-initial consonants that are voiceless in other English dialects. Word- initial \"S\" is replaced with \"Z\"; \"F\" is replaced with \"V\". It also uses perceived dialect grammar, replacing instances of \"am\", \"are\" and \"is\" with \"be\". The sentence \"I haven't seen him, that farmer, since Friday\" could be parsed in Mummerset as \"Oi ain't zeen 'im that be varmer since Vroiday\". Some speakers of East Anglian English have objected to media portrayals of characters from that area speaking in \"a strange kind of stage Mummerset\", as in the TV adaptation of P.D. James' Adam Dalgliesh novel Devices and Desires.See for example \"Television Diary: A broad question of a proper accent\", The Stage and Television Today, 28 February 1991 ==In literature== In Shakespeare's King Lear, Edgar speaks in Mummerset before he fights Oswald in Act IV, scene 6: > Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volk pass. An \u2019chud ha\u2019 bin > zwagger\u2019d out of my life, \u2019t would not ha\u2019bin zo long as \u2019tis by a > vortnight. Nay, come not > near th\u2019 old man; keep out, \u2019che vor ye, or Ise try whether your costard or > my > ballow be the harder. \u2019Chill be plain with you. ==See also== *Farmer Palmer *Mid-Atlantic English *Mockney *West Country dialects ==References== Category:Acting Category:England in fiction Category:English language in England Category:Phonology Category:West Country Category:Fictional counties ",
