She attended primary classes in a French school there and then went to the University of Perpignan in nearby France, where she continued her education at the Lyc\u00e9e Jean Lur\u00e7at. She graduated from the Spanish section of Letters in 1971. The following year she obtained her master's degree (Ma\u00eetrise d'Enseignement) at the same university. In 1978, she received the Diploma of Advanced Studies (DEA) in the specialty of Andorran Studies at the University of Perpignan. In 1984, she took a course in historical demography at the \u00c9cole d'Hautes \u00c9tudes de Sciencies in Paris, France. === Government service === According to writer Antoni Pol, \"Her contribution has been twofold, in two dimensions, politics and culture.\" Armengol was a promoter of the \"Andorranization Program,\" which she proposed in 1970 when she was about 22 years of age. The program became the basis of the country's public school system which, in turn, led to widespread culture awareness. > \"These were years in which the institutionalisation of culture was framed as > part of a process of reform directed at the country's political > institutions, resulting, twenty years later in a constituent process and the > passing of the Constitution of 14 March 1993, making Andorra an independent > state that followed the rule of law and enjoyed a social welfare system.\" On 1 March 1973, she was appointed co-head of the country's Pedagogical Department, with Antoni Morell i Mora, and was later appointed General Secretary of the Department of Social Affairs, eventually heading the Department of Education, Culture and Sports.

In 1975 she created the National Library of Andorra and then the National Archives. Then, a year later, the General Counsel created the Institute of Andorran Studies and put Armengol in its leadership position. The Institute's aim was, > \"to promote the historical research and the dissemination of scientific > knowledge. The person put in charge of the new institute's organization of > historical and cultural knowledge was the historian Lidia Armengol. ... > Armengol published collections of key materials for research and prepared > historical overviews that laid the groundwork for writing the history of the > country and encourage young people to take an interest in their roots and in > their own language and culture. The mythologised history of this Pyrenean > enclave began to give way to a rigorous and critical historical account > within a framework that generated many more studies, which were also aimed > at the internationalisation of knowledge on Andorra.\" During the government of prime minister \u00d2scar Ribas Reig (1982 \u20131984), Armengol was appointed Director of Culture and Fine Arts. When the next government took over, the new prime minister, Josep Pintat i Solans, appointed her to the position of General Secretary of the Ministry of Education and Culture.
