WCIR-FM is owned and operated by Southern Communications. ==Coverage area== The station has an effective radiated power of 5,000 watts, but the height above average terrain of the station is 452 meters (1484 feet), meaning the station broadcasts farther than a typical 5,000 watt radio station that broadcasts at normal height. As a result, the station can be heard as far as Charleston, West Virginia. ==History== WCIR-FM was named after WCIR-AM (Now WBKW) in 1971. WCIR-AM was a former Christian Contemporary radio station, hence the Christianity In Radio call letter meaning. The station is owned by Southern Communications.
