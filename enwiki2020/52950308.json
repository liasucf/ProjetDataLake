    "text": "Robert de Todeni was a Norman nobleman who held lands in England after the Norman Conquest. Robert held lands in Guerny and Vesly in Normandy.Keats-Rohan Domesday People pp. 380\u2013381 The family was probably a branch of the Tosny family that originated near Eure in Normandy.Loyd Origins of Some Anglo-Norman Families p. 104 In Domesday Book Robert is listed as the lord of Belvoir, Lincolnshire. This lordship is considered a feudal barony, making Robert the first baron of Belvoir. Besides the lands around Belvoir, Robert also received lands in Yorkshire and Leicestershire. These lands had been held prior to the Conquest by Thorgautr Lagr, and others. Robert's son Berengar was given Thorgautr's lands in Oxfordshire and Nottinghamshire, which he may have held from his father.Fleming Kings & Lords p. 167 and footnote120 Robert also had lands in Northamptonshire, located south of Rockingham. Three of these manors were previously owned by Oswulf, probably Oswulf son of Fran.Green Aristocracy of Norman England pp. 86\u201387 Robert may have been the first castellan of Rockingham Castle. Robert and his wife founded Belvoir Priory, sometime between 1076 and 1088 as a priory of St Albans Abbey.Knowles, et al. Heads of Religious Houses p. 85 The choice to make Belvoir a dependent priory of St Albans may have been because Oswulf, previous owner of some of his lands, had also given lands to St Albans.Green Aristocracy of Norman England p. 397 Robert married Adelais. They had three sons \u2013 Berengar, William, and Geoffrey \u2013 as well as Albreda, Adelisa, and Agnes. Berengar inherited the Norman lands and William inherited the English lands. All three sons died without offspring, leaving their sisters as the eventual heiresses. Albreda was the eldest daughter and married Robert de Insula and died before 1129 without issue. Adelisa married Roger Bigod,Keats-Roham Domesday People pp. 396\u2013398 and died after August 1127. Agnes, the youngest daughter, married first Ralph de Beaufour and second Hubert de Ryes. Belvoir eventually went to Cecilia Bigod, the youngest daughter of Adelisa and Roger and the Norman lands going to Hugh Bigod, son or Adelisa and Roger. Agnes is not recorded as having inherited any of lands connected with the barony of Belvoir. The historian Judith Green speculates that because Berengar did not inherit any of the English lands, he may have been the son of an earlier marriage of Robert's.Green Aristocracy of Norman England pp. 374\u2013375 footnote 63 Robert died around 1093, although some older sources give a date of 1088.Sanders English Baronies p. 12 He was buried at Belvoir Priory,Fleming Kings & Lords pp. 172\u2013173 according to the priory's own history.Green Aristocracy of Norman England p. 425 ==Citations== ==References== * * * * * * ==External links== * Robert of Tosny's holdings in Open Domesday Project Category:1090s deaths Category:Normans in England Category:English feudal barons ",
