It is distributed most Wednesdays of the regular school year. It is printed at the Anaheim, California facility of The Orange County Register, where 5,000 copies are made. During the fall 2005 semester, the Lariat chose to change its masthead to include Saddleback's sister college in Irvine, Irvine Valley College, to appeal to a broader reader base and increase circulation. The change was met with opposition from members of Saddleback's administration as well as from the Associated Student Government since Irvine Valley College did not contribute funds to the Lariat. Irvine Valley College now gives an allotted sum and the masthead continues to include both colleges.
