His father's family had become wealthy through engaging in commerce, which opened the possibility of higher education for its members.Nastas\u0103, pp. 92-3, 188, 321 He attended primary school and one year of high school in his native town, completing his secondary education at Saint Sava High School in Bucharest in 1900. That year, he enrolled in the literature and philosophy faculty of the University of Bucharest, which he attended intermittently: in 1902, he was working as a clerk at the court of auditors, abandoning his studies for a time; in 1905, he married Lucia Walter of Ia\u0219i, which likely further detained him from educational pursuits. She came from an eminently respectable family and was a university graduate in literature; she was some three years his junior, and the couple were classmates. The marriage would result in two children. Only in 1906 did he return to university, and graduated first in his class in 1908.Dumitru Caracostea, Mircea Anghelescu (ed.), Scrieri alese, p. ix. Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1986. His professors included Titu Maiorescu, Ioan Bianu and Ovid Densusianu; their influence on his intellectual development was decisive. In 1909, he obtained a scholarship for Vienna University, where he studied under the direct supervision of Wilhelm Meyer-L\u00fcbke. He successfully defended two doctoral theses in 1913: one on philosophy, the other on Romance philology. He returned home upon the outbreak of World War I. From 1914 to 1925, he was a high school teacher. In 1920, he began offering courses at Bucharest University, first as associate professor in Bianu's department and, from 1930, as full professor at the department of modern Romanian literature and folklore. Thanks to his efforts, the Institute of Literary History and Folklore was founded in 1933; among other publications, a series of \"literary confessions\" by contemporary Romanian writers appeared under its aegis. ===Wartime activity and downfall=== Caracostea was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy in 1938, Membrii Academiei Rom\u00e2ne din 1866 p\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een prezent at the Romanian Academy site and presided over the forum's literary section for a time. During the summer of 1940, he served as Minister of National Education in two successive cabinets: under Ion Gigurtu from July 4 to September 4,Neagoe, p. 135 and under Ion Antonescu from September 4 to 14, until the establishment of the National Legionary State.Neagoe, p. 137 That autumn, the new regime appointed him head of Revista Funda\u021biilor Regale; as such, he suspended contributions from critics whom he deemed sympathetic toward Jewish literature. Nicoleta S\u0103lcudeanu, \"Genera\u021bie prin lustra\u021bie\", in Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103, Nr. 12/2008 From April 1941 to May 1944. three months before the King Michael Coup, he headed the amalgamated Royal Foundations.Nastas\u0103, p. 372 His ascendancy under Romania's wartime regimes was not due to politics: he had participated neither in the main parties nor in pro-fascist groups, but remained loyal to the ideas of Nicolae Iorga. Instead, it stemmed from the Germanophilia that had begun during his Vienna days. Caracostea's activity at the magazine was curtailed by the fact that he had to issue a monthly report both to the Anglophile Royal House and to the pro-German Antonescu. Its situation was precarious: circulation had dropped to 800, issues appeared at delayed intervals and mobilization made contributors difficult to find.Mioara Apolzan, Aspecte de istorie literar\u0103: destinul unei publica\u021bii, R.F.R., p. 100. Cluj-Napoca: Editura Minerva, 1983. In 1948, the new communist regime stripped him of Academy membership.

His release certificate does not feature an arrest warrant record or the motive for his detention, an implicit admission that there was no legal basis for his arrest or detention.Dennis Deletant, Teroarea comunist\u0103 \u00een Rom\u00e2nia: Gheorghiu-Dej \u0219i statul poli\u021bienesc, 1948-1965, p. 106. Bucharest: Editura Polirom, 2001. In June 1964, aged 85, he was at home discussing with a former student about the latter's thesis. Suddenly feeling unwell, he died of an internal hemorrhage after half an hour.Nastas\u0103, p. 437 Magazines that published his work include Adev\u0103rul literar \u0219i artistic, Convorbiri Literare, Drum drept, Flac\u0103ra, G\u00e2ndirea, Langue et litt\u00e9rature, Mitteilungen des Rum\u00e4nische Instituts und der Universit\u00e4t (Vienna), Revista Funda\u021biilor Regale, Viea\u021ba nou\u0103 and Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103. His literary and scientific activity had two main directions: studies of folklore (Miori\u021ba \u00een Moldova, Muntenia \u0219i Oltenia, 1924) and exegeses of Mihai Eminescu's work (Arta cuv\u00e2ntului la Eminescu, 1938; Creativitatea eminescian\u0103, 1943). His writings on folk ballads (Balada poporan\u0103 rom\u00e2n\u0103, 1932-1933) laid the groundwork for geographic-based folklore studies, then a new concept. His commentary on Eminescu was marked by a binary perspective: dynamic (the poems' genesis) and static (the poet's artistic use of language).Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic\u021bionarul biografic al literaturii rom\u00e2ne, vol.
