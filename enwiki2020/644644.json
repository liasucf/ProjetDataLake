Some paintings are at least 1500 years old, while others may only date back to the 1800s. \"Aagawaa\" means \"sheltered place\" in the Ojibwe language. The scenery of this region inspired a number of paintings by the Group of Seven. ==Economy== The Algoma Central Railway runs an excursion train which leaves Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario and travels through the Agawa Canyon. Agawa Bay and the lower parts of the river are located in Lake Superior Provincial Park. ==Tributaries== *Little Agawa River *Eleven Mile Creek *Blackspruce Creek *Weichel Creek *Parch Creek *Regan River *Sane Creek ==Settlements== *Agawa Bay *Canyon *O'Connor *Eton *Millwood ==See also== *List of Ontario rivers ==References== * * Category:Rivers of Algoma District Category:Tributaries of Lake Superior ",
