The museum displays bank notes dating back to the reign of King Rama IV in 1853 and documenting the late 1850s, when Queen Victoria of Great Britain gave Thailand the gift of a minting machine and the minting of Thai coins followed in 1858. In the royal reception room, there are also portraits and photographs surrounded by lavish furnishing commemorating the visit by Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, in 1996. On 28 December 2006, Bang Khun Phrom Palace celebrated its centenary which conducted traditional Thai performance in celebration. ==References== ==External links== * Bank of Thailand Museum * Bank of Thailand Museum, Northern Region (Chiang Mai) Category:Museums in Bangkok Category:Numismatic museums Category:Bank museums ",
