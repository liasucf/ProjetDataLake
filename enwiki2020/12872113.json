In 1676, she married the Grand Treasurer Rafa\u0142 Leszczy\u0144ski, son of Deputy Chancellor Bogus\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski. Her son Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski became King of Poland with Swedish support in 1704 and reigned until 1709. During his first reign her brother Jan served as Crown Chancellor. Anna Leszczy\u0144ska reportedly lived with her son and his family in his exile after the deposition of 1709, when he moved from Poland to Sweden, in 1714 to Zweibr\u00fccken in Germany, and finally, in 1718, to France. Her relationship with Stanislaw was reportedly not happy at this point, as she felt disappointment over the loss of his royal position and exile and blamed this on the actions of Stanislaw, in which she was joined by her daughter-in- law Catherine Opali\u0144ska.Latour, Louis Therese, Princesses Ladies And Salonnieres of The Reign of Louis XV, 1927 Through her son she was the grandmother of Maria Leszczy\u0144ska, who became queen of France by marriage to Louis XV in 1725, and therefore the great-great-grandmother of Louis XVI, Louis XVIII, and Charles X. ==References== Category:1660 births Category:1727 deaths Anna Leszczynska ",
