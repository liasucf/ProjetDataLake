He moved to Copenhagen in 1814 and graduated in theology in 1819. That same year he returned to Iceland and taught children in Reykjavik the following winter. In 1820, he was ordained a priest in Hallgr\u00edmskirkja (Hvalfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur). In 1836 he became a cathedral priest in Reykjavik and was bishop of Iceland from 1846 to 1866 as successor to Steingr\u00edmur J\u00f3nsson. He had no great importance in political life, but had a certain influence on the church legislative work during the first meetings, as well as in the relocation of the Latin school from Bessasta\u00f0ir to Reykjavik and the establishment of the parsonage. ==References== Category:Lutheran bishops of Iceland Category:1794 births Category:1867 deaths Category:19th-century Lutheran bishops ",
