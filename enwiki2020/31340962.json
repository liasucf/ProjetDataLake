    "text": "Wandsworth Museum, 2014 The museum during redevelopment in 2009 Wandsworth Museum is a local museum in the London Borough of Wandsworth, southwest London, England. This community museum covers the cultural and social history of Wandsworth, especially artifacts and artworks that show contemporary and traditional skills of local people. ==History== In 2007 Wandsworth Museum was suspended, attracting objectors and renewed interest in its collections including objections from the UK Museums Association. The museum reopened in September 2010 after a three-year closure having gathered promises of \u00a32 million of funding by local philanthropists. It closed again in 2016, and Wandsworth Council and the Battersea Arts Collection became custodians of the collection. It was registered as a charity in 2008 until removal in 2017. ==Building and exhibits== Elizabeth Clasper. \"Vase of Lilies\" Wandsworth Museum was based at the low-rise but tall-storied Victorian stone-embellished public building -- the former West Hill Reference Library -- 38 West Hill, Wandsworth between 2010 and 2016. The museum is a function of the local authority. The museum displayed the history of Wandsworth and in part of the rest of the borough through the ages, with artefacts exhibited including an ornate Iron Age shield recovered from the Thames and further collections in its catalogue available for inspection. For a few years until 2014 it featured the De Morgan Centre, with exhibits of the ceramics of William de Morgan and of the paintings of Evelyn De Morgan. == See also == * List of museums in London == References== == External links == * * Wandsworth Museum group, Facebook Category:Museums established in 2010 Category:Museums in the London Borough of Wandsworth Category:Local museums in London Category:Art museums and galleries in London Category:2010 in London Category:2010 establishments in England ",
