    "text": "A calcium channel is an ion channel which shows selective permeability to calcium ions. It is sometimes synonymous with voltage-gated calcium channel, although there are also ligand-gated calcium channels. ==Comparison tables== The following tables explain gating, gene, location and function of different types of calcium channels, both voltage and ligand-gated. ===Voltage-gated=== {| class=\"wikitable\" | style=\"text-align:center\" | Type || Voltage || \u03b11 subunit (gene name) || Associated subunits || Most often found in |- | L-type calcium channel (\"Long-Lasting\" AKA \"DHP Receptor\")|| HVA (high voltage activated)|| Cav1.1 () Cav1.2 () Cav1.3 () Cav1.4 () || \u03b12\u03b4, \u03b2, \u03b3 || Skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, bone (osteoblasts), ventricular myocytes** (responsible for prolonged action potential in cardiac cell; also termed DHP receptors), dendrites and dendritic spines of cortical neurons |- | P-type calcium channel (\"Purkinje\") /Q-type calcium channel || HVA (high voltage activated) || Cav2.1 () || \u03b12\u03b4, \u03b2, possibly \u03b3 || Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum / Cerebellar granule cells |- | N-type calcium channel (\"Neural\"/\"Non-L\") || HVA (high-voltage-activated) || Cav2.2 () || \u03b12\u03b4/\u03b21, \u03b23, \u03b24, possibly \u03b3 || Throughout the brain and peripheral nervous system. |- | R-type calcium channel (\"Residual\") || intermediate-voltage- activated || Cav2.3 () || \u03b12\u03b4, \u03b2, possibly \u03b3 || Cerebellar granule cells, other neurons |- | T-type calcium channel (\"Transient\") || low-voltage- activated || Cav3.1 () Cav3.2 () Cav3.3 () || || neurons, cells that have pacemaker activity, bone (osteocytes), thalamus (thalamus) |} ===Ligand-gated=== *the receptor-operated calcium channels (in vasoconstriction) **P2X receptors Page 479 {| class=\"wikitable\" | style=\"text-align:center\" | Type || Gated by || Gene || Location || Function |- | IP3 receptor || IP3 || ITPR1, ITPR2, ITPR3 || ER/SR || Releases calcium from ER/SR in response to IP3 by e.g. GPCRs |- | Ryanodine receptor || dihydropyridine receptors in T-tubules and increased intracellular calcium (Calcium Induced Calcium Release - CICR) || RYR1, RYR2, RYR3 || ER/SR || Calcium-induced calcium release in myocytes |- | Two-pore channel ||Nicotinic Acid Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NAADP)||TPCN1, TPCN2||endosomal/lysosomal membranes||NAADP-activated calcium transport across endosomal/lysosomal membranes |- | Cation channels of sperm || Calcium (CICR) | PKD2 family | sperm (specifically flagella) | non-selective calcium- activated cation channel directing sperm in female reproductive tract |- | store-operated channels || indirectly by ER/SR depletion of calcium || ORAI1, ORAI2, ORAI3 || plasma membrane || provide calcium signaling to the cytoplasm |- |} ==Pharmacology== thumb L-type calcium channel blockers are used to treat hypertension. In most areas of the body, depolarization is mediated by sodium influx into a cell; changing the calcium permeability has little effect on action potentials. However, in many smooth muscle tissues, depolarization is mediated primarily by calcium influx into the cell. L-type calcium channel blockers selectively inhibit these action potentials in smooth muscle which leads to dilation of blood vessels; this in turn corrects hypertension. T-type calcium channel blockers are used to treat epilepsy. Increased calcium conductance in the neurons leads to increased depolarization and excitability. This leads to a greater predisposition to epileptic episodes. Calcium channel blockers reduce the neuronal calcium conductance and reduce the likelihood of experiencing epileptic attacks. == References == == External links == * * * Category:Ion channels Category:Electrophysiology Category:Integral membrane proteins Category:Calcium channels ",
