    "text": "The Ashton-under-Lyne by-election, 1920 was a by-election held on 31 January 1920 for the British House of Commons constituency of Ashton-under-Lyne. The by-election was triggered by the elevation to the peerage of the town's Conservative Party Member of Parliament (MP) Albert Stanley, who was ennobled as Baron Ashfield. The result was a victory for the Conservative candidate Sir Walter de Frece, who held the seat with a massively reduced majority. British Pathe has a newsreel clip of Sir Walter Frece campaigning in the by-election with his wife. http://www.britishpathe.com/video/miss-vesta- tilley/query/election == Votes == == References == * * == See also == * Ashton-under-Lyne constituency * 1928 Ashton-under-Lyne by-election * 1931 Ashton-under-Lyne by-election * 1939 Ashton-under-Lyne by-election * 1945 Ashton-under-Lyne by-election * List of United Kingdom by-elections (1918\u20131931) Category:By-elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Greater Manchester constituencies Category:1920 elections in the United Kingdom Category:1920 in England Category:1920s in Lancashire Category:By- elections to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in Lancashire constituencies Category:Ashton-under-Lyne Category:Elections in Tameside Category:January 1920 events ",
