    "text": "This is a list of Turkish Members of Parliament who did not seek re-election in the June 2015 general election. Only MPs who have not applied for renomination are listed. MPs of the 24th Parliament who applied to become candidates but failed to make it onto their party's lists are not included. ==AKP three-term limit== A Justice and Development Party (AKP) by-law dictates that members of parliament can only serve 3 successive terms from AKP lists. Therefore, 70 of AKP's 312 MPs will have to stand down in the 2015 elections, which includes 9 members of the Davuto\u011flu Cabinet and other prominent AKP people who have been MPs since 2002. A farewell ceremony and feast was held on 31 March 2015 for the outgoing MPs who had served for three terms.http://www.aljazeera.com.tr/al-jazeera-ozel/akpde-agabeylere-veda-zamani {| | *\u00d6mer \u00c7elik, Adana *Mehmet Necati \u00c7etinkaya, Adana *Ali K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckayd\u0131n, Adana *Sait A\u00e7ba, Afyonkarahisar *Ruhi A\u00e7\u0131kg\u00f6z, Aksaray *Ali R\u0131za Alaboyun, Aksaray *Ali Babacan, Ankara (I) *Reha Deneme\u00e7, Ankara (I) *B\u00fclent Gedikli, Ankara (I) *Cemil \u00c7i\u00e7ek, Ankara (II) *Cevdet Erd\u00f6l, Ankara (II) *Haluk \u0130pek, Ankara (II) *Salih Kapusuz, Ankara (II) *Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, Antalya *Mehmet Vecdi G\u00f6n\u00fcl, Antalya *Fahrettin Poyraz, Bilecik *Vahit Kiler, Bitlis *Bayram \u00d6z\u00e7elik, Burdur *B\u00fclent Ar\u0131n\u00e7, Bursa *Mehmet Dan\u0131\u015f, \u00c7anakkale *Murat Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, \u00c7orum *Mehmet Mehdi Eker, Diyarbak\u0131r *Recep Akda\u011f, Erzurum *H\u00fcseyin \u00c7elik, Gaziantep | *Mehmet Sar\u0131, Gaziantep *Nurettin Canikli, Giresun *Sadullah Ergin, Hatay *Mustafa Ata\u015f, \u0130stanbul (I) *Egemen Ba\u011f\u0131\u015f, \u0130stanbul (I) *Nimet Ba\u015f, \u0130stanbul (II) *Burhan Kuzu, \u0130stanbul (II) *Abd\u00fclkadir Aksu, \u0130stanbul (III) *Halide \u0130ncekara, \u0130stanbul (III) *\u00dcnal Ka\u00e7\u0131r, \u0130stanbul (III) *Mehmet Say\u0131m Tekelio\u011flu, \u0130zmir (I) *Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, \u0130zmir (II) *Nevzat Pakdil, Kahramanmara\u015f *Mehmet Ali \u015eahin, Karab\u00fck *Mevl\u00fct Akg\u00fcn, Karaman *Hakk\u0131 K\u00f6yl\u00fc, Kastamonu *Mustafa Elita\u015f, Kayseri *Sad\u0131k Yakut, Kayseri *Taner Y\u0131ld\u0131z, Kayseri *Be\u015fir Atalay, K\u0131r\u0131kkale *Muzaffer Ba\u015ftop\u00e7u, Kocaeli *Nihat Erg\u00fcn, Kocaeli *Kerim \u00d6zkul, Konya *Harun T\u00fcfek\u00e7i, Konya | *Soner Aksoy, K\u00fctahya *Hasan Fehmi Kinay, K\u00fctahya *H\u00fcseyin Tanr\u0131verd, Manisa *Durdu Mehmet Kasdal, Osmaniye *Nusret Bayraktar, Rize *Hayati Yaz\u0131c\u0131, Rize *Hasan Ali \u00c7elik, Sakarya *\u015eaban Di\u015fli, Sakarya *Ayhan Sefer \u00dcst\u00fcn, Sakarya *Cemal Y\u0131lmaz Demir, Samsun *Mustafa Demir, Samsun *Suat K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7, Samsun *Ahmet Yeni, Samsun *Afif Demirk\u0131ran, Siirt *Yahya Akman, \u015eanl\u0131urfa *Faruk \u00c7elik, \u015eanl\u0131urfa *Tevfik Ziyaeddin Akbulut, Tekirda\u011f *Zeyid Aslan, Tokat *\u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Ayala, Tokat *Faruk Naf\u0131z \u00d6zak, Trabzon *Bekir Bozda\u011f, Yozgat *K\u00f6ksal Toptan, Zonguldak |} File:\u00d6mer \u00c7elik cropped.jpg|\u00d6mer \u00c7elik, Minister of Culture and Tourism File:Ali Babacan - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2012 crop.jpg|Ali Babacan, Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey File:Cemil \u00c7i\u00e7ek Senate of Poland 01.JPG|Cemil \u00c7i\u00e7ek, Speaker of the Grand National Assembly File:Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu (cropped).jpg|Mevl\u00fct \u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu, Minister of Foreign Affairs File:Msc 2006-Saturday, 14.00 - 16.00-002Siko06 Goenuel Tuerk.jpg|Vecdi G\u00f6n\u00fcl, former Minister of National Defence File:Bulent Arinc 2014.jpg|B\u00fclent Ar\u0131n\u00e7, Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey File:Mehdi Eker (cropped).jpg|Mehmet Mehdi Eker, Minister of Food, Agriculture and Livestock File:H\u00fcseyin \u00c7elik 2008.jpg|H\u00fcseyin \u00c7elik, former Minister of National Education File:NurettinCanikli.jpg|Nurettin Canikli, Minister of Customs and Trade File:Egemen Bagis portrait.JPG|Egemen Ba\u011f\u0131\u015f, former Minister of European Union Affairs File:Nimet \u00c7ubuk\u00e7u.PNG|Nimet Ba\u015f, former Minister of National Education File:Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m.jpg|Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, former Minister of Transport, Maritime and Communication File:Mehmet Ali Sahin.jpg|Mehmet Ali \u015eahin, former Deputy Prime Minister, Justice Minister and Parliamentary Speaker File:Taner Yildiz - World Economic Forum on the Middle East, North Africa and Eurasia 2012 crop.jpg|Taner Y\u0131ld\u0131z, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources File:Faruk \u00c7elik (cropped).jpg|Faruk \u00c7elik, Minister of Labour and Social Security ==HDP two-term limit== The Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) party constitution imposes a two-term limit on elected members who have served under the banner of the HDP or its predecessor Peace and Democracy Party (BDP).
