The wine produced here was classified as one of fourteen Troisi\u00e8mes Crus (Third Growths) in the historic Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855. MacNeil, Karen, (2001) The Wine Bible, Workman Publishing, 2001 pp. 885, The Ch\u00e2teau has planted with Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.

Suckling, James, Wine Spectator (March 31, 2007). '\"50 Best Bordeaux under $50\" p. 69 == History == The estate's name comes from its founder, Gabriel FERRIERE, who was a royal in charge of the king's hunts during the 18th century. In 1777, he sold it to his cousins also named FERRIERE. One of them, Jean FERRIERE, will become mayor of the city of Bordeaux after Robespierre's fall, in 1795. In 1855, took place the classification of the Medoc growths. On this occasion, Ch\u00e2teau Ferri\u00e8re was classified [third growth]. The estate remained in the hands of the FERRIERE family until 1914, when it was sold to Armand FEUILLERAT, then owner of another Margaux classified growth, [Ch\u00e2teau Marquis de Terme]. In 1952, [Alexis LICHINE] took over the management of Ch\u00e2teau Ferri\u00e8re as a farmer and all the wine was vinified at Ch\u00e2teau Lascombes, second growth in Margaux. During 40 years, only a small quantity of bottles is produced and the wine somehow becomes a second label for Ch\u00e2teau Lascombes. Only passengers of a famous airline had the opportunity to taste its potential. == Return of a classified growth == In 1988, the VILLARS family purchases the vineyard and the buildings, but it is only in 1992 that the agricultural lease comes to an end. The family then takes over the management of the vineyard as well as the vinification. The estate is now owned by Claire Villars-Lurton. == A small vineyard for a great Terroir == With 21 [classified growths in 1855], the [Margaux appellation] has more classified estates than any other commune in the [Medoc]. With its 12-hectare vineyard, composed of Garonne gravels laying on chalk, Ch\u00e2teau Ferri\u00e8re has the smallest surface of vines of all the classified growth in 1855. A parcel of this small piece of terroir lies in the heart of the Margaux village and is rounded by an old stone wall. == Technical information == {| class=\"wikitable centre\" width=\"80%\" |+ Information |- !scope=\"row\"| Owner | Claire VILLARS LURTON |- !scope=\"row\"| Winemaking consultant | Eric BOISSENOT |- !scope=\"row\"| Surface of the wineyard | 12 hectares |- !scope=\"row\"| Soil | Deep gravels on limestone substrate |- !scope=\"row\"| Average age of vineyard | 45 Years old |- !scope=\"row\"| Density | 10 000 plants/ha |- !scope=\"row\"| Plantation | 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc |- !scope=\"row\"| Winemaking | Traditional, in concrete and wooden vats, whose volumes are proportional to the plot |- !scope=\"row\"| Ageing | 40% of new oak, ageing during 18 months |} == Visit == Ch\u00e2teau Ferri\u00e8re is open from Monday to Friday, from 9h00 to 12h30 and 14h00 to 17h30.
