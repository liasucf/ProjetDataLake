The latter two will typically require a certain amount of time with patients. Used by both doctors, dentists and chiropractors at Danish universities. Administrative positions: * Rektor (rector) * Prorektor, second-ranked official of governance, deputy rector. * Dekan (dean), head of a faculty (humanities, natural sciences, etc.) * Institutleder (head of department), head of department (computer science, mathematics, etc.) * Studieleder (programme director), head of a study programme (business administration, civil engineering, etc.) ==Professorship== In Denmark the word professor is only used for full professors. An associate professor is in Danish called a lektor and an assistant professor is called an adjunkt. Before promotion to full professorship, one can get a time limited (usually 5 years) post as an MSO (professor med s\u00e6rlige opgaver) or \"professor with special responsibilities.\" The post of professor with special responsibilities involves fixed-term specific functions as well as duties that are otherwise associated with professorships. The qualification requirements correspond to those of ordinary professorships. This position gives time for the school to raise funds for the permanent professorship. An additional step between lektor and full professor is docent. A docent has the same work as a professor but they do not actively take part in senior administrative duties, such as heading a department. The Danish PhD does not come with a title; only the local docent, after a similar extended thesis to the German docent, brings the right to be addressed as doktor. ==References== Category:Academic ranks Category:Education in Denmark Ranks ",
