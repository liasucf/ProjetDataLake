They are one-time Allan Cup National Champions. ==History== In 1993 the Whitehorse Huskies won the Allan Cup by defeating the Quesnel Kangaroos in the Final. After taking the coveted Allan Cup back to the Yukon, the team hung up their skates.http://whitehorsestar.com/archive/story/huskies-aaa-hockey-to-return- to-whitehorse/ The Huskies are the only teams from the Yukon, Northwest Territories, or Nunavut to have ever won the Allan Cup. In 2009, after a 16-year hiatus, Hockey Canada approved the revival of the Huskies, and the team was subsequently sanctioned by the British Columbia Amateur Hockey Association to compete during the 2009-10 season. The current edition of the Triple A men's hockey team, coached by Dan Johnson, plays its home games at the Takhini Arena.http://whitehorsestar.com/archive/story/huskies-to-play- first-game-at-home-next-weekend/ In the 2009-10 playoffs, the Huskies were eliminated from 2010 Allan Cup contention when they were swept 3-games-to-none by the Powell River Regals in the Pacific finals. ==References== Category:Ice hockey teams in Yukon Category:Sport in Whitehorse, Yukon Category:1992 establishments in Yukon Category:Ice hockey clubs established in 1992 ",
