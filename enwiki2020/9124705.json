    "text": "The \"Nahuel\" DL 43 tank was a medium tank developed in Argentina during World War II. It was the Argentine equivalent of the M4 Sherman and the M3 Grant American medium tanks. == Design == The designer was Lt. Colonel Alfredo Baisi. The word Nahuel means \"jaguar\" in the aboriginal language Mapudungun. It was armed with a 75 mm gun (taken from the Krupp Model 1909 Field Gun used by the Argentine Army) in a rotating armored turret. === Similarity === Its design is similar to that of the United States Army M4 Medium and the early versions of the M3 Grant but with sloped armor. Contrary to popular belief it was not a copy of the M4 Sherman, but the design of the M4 influenced it. == Production == Only 12 tanks and one wooden mock-up were produced by the Arsenal Esteban de Luca in Buenos Aires and supplied to the Argentine Army, because of the availability of cheap surplus Sherman tanks, several of which were provided by Belgium and the United Kingdom in the late 1940s. == Operators == * Argentine Army == See also == * Argentina during World War II * \u00d1and\u00fa (jeep) * TAM (tank) * Patag\u00f3n == Footnotes == == References == ;Notes ;Bibliography * Sigal Fogliani, Ricardo Jorge, Nahuel DL 43 - Tanques Argentinos (desde sus or\u00edgenes hasta 1950), Editorial Dunken, Buenos Aires, 2004, . * Sigal Fogliani, Ricardo Jorge, Blindados Argentinos, de Uruguay y Paraguay, Ayer y Hoy Ediciones, Buenos Aires, 1997. . *Ness, Leland Jane's World War II Tanks and Fighting Vehicles - The complete guide, Harper Collins Publishers, London 2002, == Further reading == * * * * ==External links== * Photo gallery TANKS!
