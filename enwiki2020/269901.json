Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica or c.1280\u20131360), better known by his courtesy name Guanzhong (Mandarin pronunciation: ), was a Chinese writer who lived during the Ming Dynasty. He was also known by his pseudonym Huhai Sanren (). Luo was attributed with writing Romance of the Three Kingdoms and editing Water Margin, the first two of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. ==Identity== Luo Guanzhong Memorial, in Dongping County, ShandongThe location and date of Luo's birth are controversial. One possibility was that he was from Taiyuan, and lived in the late Yuan Dynasty and early Ming Dynasty by the record of his contemporary, the playwright Jia Zhongming (\u8cc8\u4ef2\u660e), who said that he had met him in 1364. Another possibility was that he was born in Dongyuan, the province of Shandong, in about 1280 \u2013 1360. Literary historians suggest other possibilities for his home, also including Hangzhou and Jiangnan. According to Meng Fanren (\u5b5f\u7e41\u4ec1), Luo can be identified in the pedigree of the Luo family, and Taiyuan is most likely his hometown. But, his name is not in this pedigree, and some people believe that pedigree of the Luo Family can't prove that Luo is the author of Three Kingdoms. Some people doubt that If Luo came from Taiyuan, why he had intimate knowledge of people life in Shandong, and he had taken all his time and energy to write them not those people in Taiyuan, Shanxi. Some people believe that the source of Taiyuan statement, which was written by Jia Zhongming (\u8cc8\u4ef2\u660e), is most likely wrong in handwritten copy. According to the recent research, there were two Luo Guanzhong (\u9648\u8fbd\uff0cChen Liao), one is Drama artist who came from Taiyuan, another is author of Three Kingdoms who came from Dongping. Recent research has suggested that his date of birth was between 1315\u20131318.Ouyang Jian, referenced in Roberts 1991, pg. 938 But other sources state it was nearer to 1330. ==Works== The stories forming the bulk of Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin are thought to have been developed by many independent storytellers. Shi Nai'an is thought to be the first to assemble Water Margin into a unified work, and Luo subsequently brought it to the current form of 100 chapters. Luo is usually considered the author of Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The Three Sui Quash the Demons' Revolt (\u5e73\u5996\u50b3) is a shenmo fantasy story attributed to Luo with 20 chapters, developed from the original pieces of storytelling based on a rebellion at the end of the Northern Song Dynasty, and later expanded by Feng Menglong (\u99ae\u5922\u9f8d) into 40 chapters. Can Tang Wudai Shi Yanzhuan (\u6b98\u5510\u4e94\u4ee3\u53f2\u6f14\u7fa9\u50b3) is a chronicle of the end of the Tang Dynasty and the following Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, a compilation of storytelling pieces based on the rebellion of Zhu Wen. ==Bibliography== *Can Tang Wudai Shi Yanzhuan (\u6b8b\u5510\u4e94\u4ee3\u53f2\u6f14\u7fa9, \"The End of Tang Dynasty and the Period of the Five Dynasties\") *Fenzhuang Lou (\u7c89\u599d\u6a13, \"Cosmetical Building\") *Romance of the Three Kingdoms *Sui Tang Zhizhuan (\u968b\u5510\u5fd7\u50b3) *Sui Tang Liangchao Zhizhuan (\u968b\u5510\u5169\u671d\u5fd7\u50b3, \"The Chronicle of the Sui and Tang Dynasties) *The Three Sui Quash the Demons' Revolt (attributed) *Water Margin (editing) ==Notes== ==References== * * * A record of a conference on Romance of the Three Kingdoms in China in 1999 * ==External links== * * * Andrew West, The Textual History of Sanguo Yanyi - Authorship Category:14th- century Chinese people Category:14th-century novelists Category:Chinese historical novelists Category:Chinese male novelists Category:Ming dynasty novelists Category:People from Jinzhong Category:Writers from Shanxi Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Yuan dynasty people Category:Romance of the Three Kingdoms ",
