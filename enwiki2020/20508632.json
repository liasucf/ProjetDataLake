    "text": "Cindy Monta\u00f1ez (born 1974) is a former Democratic Assemblywoman from California's 39th State Assembly district serving for four years, from 2002 until 2006. ==Family== Monta\u00f1ez was raised in the city of San Fernando, California along with her five siblings by parents who were immigrants from Mexico. ==Early political career== Monta\u00f1ez attended the University of California, Los Angeles. In the Spring of 1993 she was one of five students to join a hunger strike in protest against a decision by UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young against the creation of a Chicano Studies program on campus. The hunger strike ended after 14 days with the creation of the C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez Center for Interdisciplinary Instruction in Chicana and Chicano Studies at UCLA. The center later became known as the C\u00e9sar E. Ch\u00e1vez Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies. In 1999 Monta\u00f1ez was elected to the San Fernando city council, and in 2001 she and her older sister, Maribel, made history as two sisters concurrently serving on the same city council when Maribel de la Torre won a seat on the San Fernando city council. Monta\u00f1ez resigned from the San Fernando City Council in late 2002 when she won a seat in the California State Assembly. ==Assembly tenure== In February 2004, Monta\u00f1ez was named the chairperson of the Assembly Rules Committee. At 30 years old, she was the youngest person to ever chair the powerful committee as well as the first Latina and the first Democratic woman to chair the committee. Her legislative work focused on issues that were vital to her district. Specific focuses included education, the environment, health care and consumer/worker protection. During her first term, ten of her bills made it out of the legislature and were signed into law. These bills included statutes to improve the management of urban landfills, a law to protect children from a sexually abusive parent and laws to insure the safety of workers. Montanez was the author of the landmark \"Car Buyer's Bill of Rights\". ==Los Angeles City Council races, 2013 and 2015== Monta\u00f1ez was a candidate in a 2013 special election for the 6th Council District of the Los Angeles City Council, which comprises the neighborhoods of Lake Balboa, Van Nuys, Panorama City, Arleta, Sun Valley and segments of North Hills and North Hollywood. The seat became vacant when Tony Cardenas was elected to the United States House of Representatives. She lost the run-off election on 23 July 2013 to Nury Martinez by a 45-55 margin. Martinez served as the campaign manager for Monta\u00f1ez when Monta\u00f1ez first ran for the State Assembly in 2002. Monta\u00f1ez tried to challenge Martinez in rematch on March 3, 2015 for the full term. Monta\u00f1ez lost the election by a margin of 39 to 61. ==Other ventures== In 2006 Monta\u00f1ez stepped down from the Assembly to run for the California's 20th State Senate district. However, she lost that primary to Los Angeles City Councilman Alex Padilla. After leaving the Assembly, Monta\u00f1ez was appointed to the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. On July 1, 2014, she resigned from her position as an Assistant General Manager for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power in order to run for the Los Angeles City Council. In March 2016 Cindy Monta\u00f1ez was chosen to be the CEO of TreePeople, which is located in Los Angeles at Coldwater Canyon City Park in the eastern Santa Monica Mountains.TreePeople press release ==References== ==External links== *Biography Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the California State Assembly Category:Women state legislators in California Category:American politicians of Mexican descent Category:Hispanic and Latino American women in politics Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century American women politicians ",
