The film will be distributed in North America by BrinkVision in April 2015. ==Synopsis== Ten women find themselves in a vacant mansion on Spektor Island in December, 1972. Each believes she's traveled to the house on business, but they all agree that something seems strange. For one thing, the entire house is full of pictures and statues of pigs. The women all come from drastically different walks of life. None of them would have chosen to spend the night together in such an eerie place, but the last ferry for the mainland has just left, and a terrible storm is rolling in. Trying to make the best of an unpleasant situation, they raid the mansion's wine cellar and throw a party. As the night creeps on, however, it becomes clear that someone\u2014or something\u2014has arranged to get them in the house. It's not long before someone mentions that Spektor Island is supposed to be haunted. Of course, no one in the house believes in ghosts. At least, not until the first murder. What do an actress, a religious zealot, a renegade, a coed, a model, a singer, a medium, a real-estate investor, a historian, and a doctor have in common? None of them is who they seem. Yet, the fate of the entire world may rest in their hands. ==Cast== *Jade Sylvan as the renegade *Molly Carlisle as the zealot *Molly Devon as the real-estate investor *Karin Webb as the medium *Kerri Lynch as the actress *Leah Principe as the model *Rachel Leah Blumenthal as the historian *Susannah Plaster as the doctor *Porcelain Dalya as the co-ed *Sophia Cacciola as the folk singer ==Production== Filming took place in Barrington, RI, Somerville, MA, and Gloucester, MA from December 4 through December 14, 2012. ==Festivals and awards== *Boston Underground Film Festival 2014 (Boston, MA) *Terror Con Film Festival 2014 (Providence, RI) - WINNER BEST ACTRESS: Porcelain Dalya *Brooklyn Girl Film Festival 2014 (Brooklyn, NY) *Sanford International Film Festival 2014 (Sanford, ME) *Fright Night Film Festival 2014 (Louisville, KY) *Fright Night Horror Weekend 2014 (Louisville, KY) *Jennifer\u2019s Bodies 2014 (Scotland) *Scare-a-con Film Festival 2014 (Verona, NY) - NOMINATED: Best Cinematography *New Orleans Comic Expo and Horror Film Festival 2014 (New Orleans, LA) *Imaginarium Film Festival 2014 (Louisville, KY) ==Reception== Michael Gingold of Fangoria described TEN as, \"up to something a little different, looking to subvert audience expectations...and while TEN contains the scenario\u2019s requisite blood and nudity, it veers off in directions you likely won\u2019t see coming, both in narrative terms and in the way it explores questions of female identity.\u201d Lauren Shiro of Curve wrote, \u201cdeeper still, the movie takes on a political and sociological stance, examining stereotypes, identity, and also the subtext and themes behind story lines.\u201d Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald described TEN, \u201cimagine Scream crossed with The Usual Suspects...The art comes with meticulously framed shots full of color, the enjoyment with puzzling out the crazy plot twists.\u201d ==References== ==External links== * Category:2014 films Category:2014 horror films Category:Films shot in Massachusetts Category:Films shot in Rhode Island Category:2014 directorial debut films ",
