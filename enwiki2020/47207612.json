I am most concerned and frankly outraged by the apparent intentional misrepresentation,\" Board of Review Commissioner Michael Cabonargi said in a statement. \"By submitting a signed affidavit with outdated photos, it appears he sought to defraud the Board of Review. By not paying his fair share, Mr. Ricketts shifted his property taxes to other home owners.\"https://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/todd-ricketts-wilmette- house-property-taxes-512480402.html \"When Mr. Ricketts purchased property in Wilmette more than 10 years ago, he filed all necessary paperwork to build a new home,\" Ricketts' spokesman Brian Baker said in a statement. \"Later, he retained a real estate attorney to assist with issues regarding his real estate taxes and assumed everyone involved had the correct information.
