He was educated at the Teacher's Training College in Cote d'Ivoire and the University of Aix-en-Provence in France, earning a bachelor's degree in economics. He served as secretary general of the Dahomeyan Development Bank. Chabi Kao served in the cabinet of president Hubert Maga from 1960 to 1963, developing a close personal relationship. He was appointed minister of labor under Christophe Soglo from 1966 to 1967.

Chabi Kao threatened secession of northern Dahomey in 1970 after the presidential election that would have reinstated Maga was annulled, but was named Minister of Labor and Finance after the Presidential Council was established in May 1970. He was accused of several irregularities, such as bribery, influence peddling, and embezzlement in the Kovacs affair of 1972. Justin Ahomad\u00e9gb\u00e9-Tom\u00eatin attempted to fire him, but was blocked by Maga.
