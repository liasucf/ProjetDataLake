    "text": "David Michael Blatt (; born May 22, 1959), is an Israeli American professional basketball executive. He is also a former coach and player. Blatt played point guard at Princeton University from 1977 to 1981 and played in the Maccabiah Games for the U.S. national team that won a gold medal in 1981. He then played professional basketball in Israel for nine of the next twelve years, before an injury ended his playing career, and he began coaching full-time. He is one of the most successful American coaches in European basketball history. As a coach, Blatt has been the Israeli Super League Coach of the Year four times (1996, 2002, 2011, and 2014), the Russian Super League Coach of the Year (2005), and the EuroLeague Coach of the Year (2014). Blatt took over as Cleveland's head coach, and led the team to the 2015 NBA Finals in his first season. He guided them to the top of their conference the next year, but was fired mid-season, and subsequently returned to coaching in Europe. ==Biography== Blatt was born in Boston, grew up in Framingham, Massachusetts, and is Jewish. As a boy, he went to a Reform Temple, and until his Bar Mitzvah he attended Hebrew school twice a week. He says that in Israel he became \"much more Jewish and much more Zionist.\" In his sophomore year at Princeton, a coach for an Israeli kibbutz team recruited him to play in Israel for the summer. The summer at Kibbutz Gan Shmuel turned out to be a life-changing experience. Blatt graduated from Princeton in 1981 with a B.A. in English literature, completing his senior thesis on Bernard Malamud, author of The Natural. In 1981 he immigrated to Israel, and served in the Israel Defense Forces on the Schneller military base.\"David Blatt\u2019s Maccabiah Experience Influenced His Life Decisions\", Maccabi USA (Fall 2014) In 1991 Blatt married Kinneret, from Netanya, Israel; she had played on an Israeli professional basketball team that he coached. They have four children: twin daughters Shani and Adi (who have served in the Israeli army), daughter Ela (his youngest child), and son Tamir Blatt (born in 1997; in 2014 he was the starting point guard on the Israeli junior national basketball team, and has played for Hapoel Tel Aviv, Hapoel Holon and Hapoel Jerusalem). On August 19, 2019, he announced that he has PPMS. ==Playing career== Blatt played basketball at Framingham South High School, where he was also class president. A point guard, Blatt played college basketball at Princeton University from 1977 to 1981 under coach Pete Carril with the Princeton Tigers, where he was team captain. He also participated in the Maccabiah Games as part of the USA national team that won a gold medal in 1981. After competing in the Maccabiah, Blatt began to play professional basketball in Israel's Super League, and played 9 of the next 12 years in Israel before an injury ended his playing career and he started coaching full-time. ==Coaching career== After retiring from basketball as a player, Blatt became assistant manager for Hapoel Galil Elyon, coaching them for the 1993\u201394 season. In the middle of the season, the head coach was fired and Blatt took his place. The following year, he became Pini Gershon's assistant for the 1994\u201395 season. The next year, he won the title of Israeli Coach of the Year for 1996. In 1997, he continued coaching Hapoel Galil Elyon, while also becoming the assistant coach of the Israeli national team. For six years, he coached Russian national basketball team, winning the EuroBasket 2007. Blatt returned to coach Galil Elyon, and remained assistant manager of the Israeli National Team for the next two years (1997\u201399). During his time in Galil Elyon Blatt notoriously assisted Pini Gershon, then head coach of Maccabi Tel Aviv, by relaying directions laid out during live broadcasts on national television of time outs of their rivals in the Israeli league finals series games. ===European leagues and national head coach=== For the 1999\u20132000 season, he moved to Maccabi Tel Aviv, and once again served as assistant manager to Pini Gershon. During that season, his team took part in the Israeli League and Israeli Cup (winning both), and also in the EuroLeague, where Maccabi finished in 2nd place. In the years between 2000\u201304, he continued as assistant coach under Pini Gershon and actively recruited foreign players such as Anthony Parker (in 2000) and Maceo Baston to the team. During those four years, Maccabi won one EuroLeague title, reached the EuroLeague Final Four (2001\u201302 season), and reached the final stage of the Adriatic League. Maccabi won the SuproLeague title in 2001 in Paris. Blatt was still working as assistant coach of the Israeli National Team in 2002, when he won the title of Israeli \"Coach of the Year\" for the second time, the year he was appointed head coach of Maccabi Tel Aviv. Despite two years as head coach with all possible domestic titles and one EuroLeague Final Four appearance, for the 2003\u201304 season, he agreed to be demoted to assistant coach once again when Pini Gershon came back to the head coach position. Together they led one of the best teams in Maccabi Tel Aviv history, and the history of European basketball, to another EuroLeague title with a 44-point win in the final, as well as to the Israeli Championship and the Israeli Cup. In 2004, he moved to Russia and signed on as head coach with Dynamo Saint Petersburg. During that year, he won the FIBA EuroCup championship with Dynamo and also the title of \"Coach of the Year in Russia\" (2004\u201305 season). For the 2005\u201306 season, he signed on as head coach of the Israeli national team, but his appointment fell through due to the lack of a formal coaching certificate. He left Israel to become head coach of Benetton Treviso of the Italian league, and subsequently led them to the Italian Championship with a 3\u20131 victory in the final series of the Italian playoffs. In the same year, he was also appointed the head coach of the Russian national basketball team. At the beginning of the 2007\u201308 season, Blatt was appointed as a head coach of the Istanbul-based Turkish Super League team Efes Pilsen. However, on April 6, 2008, he parted ways with the team, due to poor results over the season. Blatt also coached the Russian national basketball team, with which he won the EuroBasket 2007 in a final game against the reigning world champions and home team of Spain, by a score of 60\u201359.. Moscow News Weekly In 2008, with Ettore Messina announcing that he would leave CSKA Moscow, Blatt was considered to be the favorite to replace him, but Messina eventually stayed on as CSKA's coach and Blatt agreed to the offer to become the head coach of Dynamo Moscow instead. Although under contract for two seasons, he parted ways with the team, after requesting that from the team in order to pursue his career elsewhere. In early 2010, Blatt served a stint as the head coach of the Greek League club Aris, before moving on to coach Maccabi Tel Aviv once again. Blatt led the Russian national team to a bronze medal during the 2012 Summer Olympics. Russian national team in 2011 In 2014, Blatt led Maccabi Tel Aviv to one of the greatest comebacks against CSKA Moscow in the EuroLeague semifinal game, proceeding to win the championship after beating Real Madrid in overtime. In June, after his contract ended, Blatt officially parted ways with the club in order to seek an NBA coaching position. Over six seasons as Maccabi head coach, he compiled a 179\u201321 (.895) record in the Israeli League, and a record of 90\u201352 (.634) in the EuroLeague, for an overall record of 269\u201373 combined (.787). In 9 seasons, his career coaching record in the EuroLeague with Maccabi, Treviso, and Efes was 121\u201381 (.599).BLATT, DAVID CAREER RECORD. ===NBA=== On June 20, 2014, Blatt was hired as head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers. Following his signing with the Cavaliers, Blatt was named the EuroLeague Coach of the Year. On April 1, 2015, Blatt earned his first Eastern Conference Coach of the Month award. The Cavaliers led the Eastern Conference in March in points-per-game (107.0), points-per-game differential (9.1), field goal percentage (.469), three-point field goal percentage (.399) and three-pointers made per game (12.3). The Cavaliers were also 5\u20130 at home and tied for the most road wins in the East at 6\u20134. The month also saw the Cavaliers extend their winning streak at Quicken Loans Arena to 16 games (January 19 \u2013 March 29), which tied for the third-longest home streak in franchise history. Over the season, the Cavaliers led the Central Division with a 53\u201329 record, and Blatt's lifetime .639 winning percentage after the 2014\u201315 season was the best of any Cavaliers coach in team history. During the Eastern Conference Semifinals, Blatt attempted to call a timeout when the Cavs did not have any left. This would have given the Cavaliers a technical foul, but the referees did not see the attempted timeout and the Cavaliers won the game, tying the series 2\u20132, and eventually winning the series. In Blatt's first season, the Cavaliers won the Eastern Conference title, their first since 2007. While other rookie head coaches have reached the NBA Finals, Blatt and rival coach Steve Kerr of the Golden State Warriors were the first pair of rookie NBA coaches to face each other in the NBA Finals since the first year of the NBA's existence, in 1947. The Cavaliers eventually lost 4\u20132 to the Warriors in the Finals. On January 22, 2016, the Cavaliers fired Blatt. Although the team held the best record in their conference (30\u201311), general manager David Griffin cited \"a lack of fit with our personnel and our vision\" as the reason for the decision. Blatt was replaced by his lead assistant Tyronn Lue, who guided the Cavaliers to their first NBA championship that season. Even though Blatt only coached the first half of the championship season, the Cavaliers' officials sent him a 2016 NBA Championship ring. At first he declined their offer but later changed his mind and accepted it.David Blatt will accept Cavs' championship ring offer; LeBron weighs in ===Return to Europe=== On June 1, 2016, Blatt was named the new head coach for Dar\u00fc\u015f\u015fafaka of the Turkish Super League and the EuroLeague. In his first season with Dar\u00fc\u015f\u015fafaka, Blatt coached the team to the EuroLeague quarterfinals, where they eventually lost 1\u20133 to Real Madrid. In the Turkish Super League, Dar\u00fc\u015f\u015fafaka was eliminated in the semifinals by Fenerbah\u00e7e. In his second season with Dar\u00fc\u015f\u015fafaka, Blatt won the 2018 EuroCup Championship, becoming only the second coach in history (after Dusan Ivkovic) who won Euroleague (with Maccabi in 2014), EuroBasket (with Russia in 2007), EuroCup and Olympic medals (bronze with Russia in 2012). On June 27, 2018, Blatt was officially named the head coach for Olympiacos of the Greek Basket League and the EuroLeague, signing a two-year contract. On October 6, 2019, Blatt parted ways with Olympiacos after one season. ==Executive career== On December 18, 2019, Blatt announced his retirement from coaching after the New York Knicks hired him as consultant. Blatt's contract was not renewed after the 19\u201320 season.
