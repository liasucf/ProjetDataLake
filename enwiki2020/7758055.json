    "text": "A clitoral pump is a sex toy designed for sexual pleasure that is applied to the clitoris or labia to create suction and increase blood flow to the genitals. This device derives from the male prototype, the penis pump, which appeared in the early 1900s and is intended for sexual enhancement, or the treatment of erectile dysfunction. A clitoral pump may be used on the clitoris, clitoral hood, labia (both minora and majora), the entire genital area and, in some cases, the nipples. The clitoral pump, like the penis pump, may be used for temporary effect prior to, or during, masturbation or sexual activity. The clitoral pump is not designed to be applied to the vaginal opening nor the inside of the vagina, since it may cause injuries. The use of a clitoral pump is not only restricted to sexual pleasure purposes. Their use is often recommended by physicians for treating female sexual problems connected with anorgasmia. Improved blood flow to the genitals may be achieved through regular use of the device. ==Structure and action== A clitoral pump usually consists of the cylinder (cup) and a hand pump (hand-squeeze bulb) with a tube. The cylinder can be round or oval and is available in different sizes depending on the size of the area stimulated. The smaller variants are intended only for clitoral and clitoral hood sucking. To use the device, the cylinder is placed over the clitoris and a vacuum is created between the skin and device by operation of the hand pump. The sucking effect makes the clitoris throb due to increased blood and skin tension. The hand pump allows complete control of the effect and it can be stopped at any moment by releasing the valve on the tube. Special variants of hand pumps exist but in most cases they consist of a rubber bulb and a tube connecting it to the cylinder. ==Materials== Normally cylinders are made of soft pliable materials, such as gel, silicone, rubber or a combination of these. The cups made from more pliable materials are generally more pleasant than those made of hard plastic. ==Types== Labial Pump There are three basic types of clitoral pumps: * Simple pumps. This type is a simple device that includes a cup or cylinder and a hand pump connected to the cup with a rubber tube. * Pumps with teasers inside the cylinder. This model's cylinder is equipped with special clitoral teasers: small spikes or bumps inside designed to make the stimulation more intense. The textured sleeves can be interchangeable. * Pumps with a vibrating element. This model creates an intense effect by means of a vibrating bullet inside the cylinder and operated by a separate controller. In most cases the vibrating bullet is removable. ==See also== * BDSM * Clitoris enlargement * Dildo * Genital jewellery * Orgasm * Penis enlargement ==References== Category:Female sex toys Pump ",
