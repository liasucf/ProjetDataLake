Antoine-Charles de Ganay, 2nd Marquis de Ganay (1769\u20131849), a representative for Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire from 1810 to 1823. His paternal grandfather was the Governor of Autun, Paul- Louis, 1st Marquis de Ganay (son of Nicolas, seigneur de Virigneux who was raised to the nobility in 1739) and was married to Ana Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Gravier de Vergennes (a niece of Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes, the Chief Minister of the French Monarch under King Louis XVI).
