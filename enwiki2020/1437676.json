The origins of ATL go back to 1884 when 180 women met to create the Association of Assistant Mistresses (AAM). These women worked in schools founded for higher education of girls. Their concern was primarily for the pupils. However, in 1921, the AAM appointed representatives to the newly formed Burnham Committee on Salaries in Secondary Schools. 1891 saw the formation of the Association of Assistant Masters in Secondary Schools (AMA). Its purpose was to protect and improve the conditions of service of secondary teachers. Between 1899 and 1908 it played an influential part in obtaining security of tenure for assistant teachers through the Endowed Schools Act. Then in 1978 AAM and AMA merged to form the Assistant Masters and Mistresses Association (AMMA) with a membership of approximately 75,000. The name was changed in 1993 to the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL). ATL affiliated to the TUC in 1999. It resigned from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in 2015. In January 2011, the Association for College Management merged into ATL.About AMiE ==Annual Conferences from 2009== * 2009 Liverpool * 2010 Manchester * 2011 Liverpool * 2012 Manchester * 2013 Liverpool * 2014 Manchester * 2015 Liverpool * 2016 Liverpool ==General Secretaries from 1978== * 1978: Andrew Hutchings and Joyce Baird * 1979: Geoff Beynon and Joyce Baird * 1988: Peter Smith and Joyce Baird * 1990: Peter Smith * 2003: Mary Bousted ==See also== * Education in the United Kingdom ==References== ==External links== * * Catalogue of the AMMA archives held at the Modern Records Centre, University of Warwick * Catalogue of the Association of Assistant Mistresses archives, held at the Modern Records Centre, University of Warwick Category:Trade unions in the United Kingdom Category:Education trade unions Category:1978 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Trade unions established in 1978 Category:Teacher associations based in the United Kingdom Category:2017 disestablishments in the United Kingdom Category:Trade unions disestablished in 2017 ",
