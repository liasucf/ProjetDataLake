    "text": "The Defence Act of 1925 was a defence act passed by the Swedish Riksdag on 26 May 1925 and came into force on 1 January 1928. The Act specified how the Swedish Armed Forces would operate during the coming years. The Act resulted in a policy of disarmament. The Act would remain effective until the Defence Act of 1936. The new order of battle meant that the number of Army Divisions was decreased to 4. 17 military units were disbanded and conscription time was lowered to 140 days for most conscripts. Many conscripts were transferred to the Army Reserve. The Army and Naval air powers were combined into the Swedish Air Force. == Background == The Ed\u00e9n Cabinet had in 1919 started an investigation into the Swedish Armed Forces in order to lower the high defence expenditure the Defence Act of 1914 had resulted in. The investigation concluded in 1923 and the right-wing majority had decided on an expenditure cap of 120 million Swedish crowns per year, 62 million less than the Defence Act of 1914 stipulated. The political parties all made differing judgements on how large of a war force Sweden needed. The political right claimed that Russia represented a long-term threat to Sweden, and that Russia's political and economic troubles during the 1920s were just temporary. They also believed - due to Sweden's entry in to the League of Nations - that the risk of Sweden being dragged in to war had increased. The liberal Free-minded National Association referred to the weakened powers of Germany and Russia, the creation of the League of Nations and the war exhaustion that many nations were suffering through as a result of the First World War. The Free-minded had major hopes for international treaties regarding disarmament. The Social Democrats predicted a sustained and stable period of peace, which did not motivate a strong defence in order to counter surprise attacks. A war in Europe would be preceded by worsened international relations and thus give time for necessary rearmament. The Social Democrats believed that Sweden only needed to maintain neutrality in order to deflect foreign aggression. The proposition on a future defence encountered multiple setbacks during its discussion in the Riksdag, but in 1925, the Social Democratic Sandler Cabinet agreed to a mainly Freeminder-backed proposal which involved a further decreased expenditure cap of 107 million crowns per year, equivalent to roughly 1,3 % of the Swedish GDP. == Reorganisation == ; Army * The number of Army divisions was reduced from six to four. * The Cavalry was reduced from 50 to 12 companies, * the Infantry was reduced from 364 to 122 companies; * every infantry regiment had their third battalion dissolved. * The Army Service Troops were reduced from 18 to 12 companies. * The Engineering Troops were reduced from 32 to 22 companies. * The amount of supply companies was reduced from four to three companies. * Two armoured companies were established at G\u00f6ta Life Guards (I 2). ; Navy The construction of new ships was cut which resulted in the older ships not being replaced. In 1927, the Navy was starting to focus on lighter units in order to outnumber the heavier armoured cruisers. ; Coastal artillery The inner lines at Vaxholm Fortress, \u00c4lvsborg Fortress and Hems\u00f6 Fortress were returned to storage and the \u00c4lvsborg Coastal Artillery Regiment (KA 3), H\u00f6rningsholm Fortress and Lule\u00e5 Coastal Position were dissolved. ; Army and naval air forces The Swedish Air Force is formed as a separate military branch, through a merge of the air forces of the Army and Navy, consisting of 57 aircraft. == Disbanded military units == Many units which remained received new unit designations, i.e. the Northern Sm\u00e5land Regiment became I 12. *A 5 \u2013 Uppland Artillery Regiment *A 9 \u2013 Positional Artillery Regiment *I 2 \u2013 G\u00f6ta Life Guards *I 4 \u2013 1st Life Grenadier Regiment *I 5 \u2013 2nd Life Grenadier Regiment *I 6 \u2013 V\u00e4stg\u00f6ta Regiment *I 7 \u2013 Karlskrona Grenadier Regiment *I 12 \u2013 J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping Regiment *I 18 \u2013 V\u00e4stmanland Regiment *I 21 \u2013 Kalmar Regiment *I 26 \u2013 Vaxholm Grenadier Regiment *Int 4 \u2013 Sollefte\u00e5 Supply Company *K 1 \u2013 Life Guards of Foot *K 2 \u2013 Life Regiment Dragoons *K 4 \u2013 Sm\u00e5land Hussar Regiment *K 5 \u2013 Scanian Hussar Regiment *K 6 \u2013 Scanian Dragoon Regiment *K 7 \u2013 Crown Prince's Hussar Regiment *T 5 \u2013 V\u00e4stmanland Train Corps *T 6 \u2013 \u00d6stg\u00f6ta Train Corps == Established military units == *F 1 \u2013 First Air Corps *F 2 \u2013 Second Air Corps *F 3 \u2013 Third Air Corps *F 4 \u2013 Fourth Air Corps *F 5 \u2013 Swedish Air Force Flying School *I 2 \u2013 G\u00f6ta Life Guards *I 4 \u2013 Life Grenadier Regiment *I 12 \u2013 J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping-Kalmar Regiment *K 1 \u2013 Mounted Life Regiment *K 2 \u2013 Scanian Cavalry Regiment == Remaining military units == The Act meant that the Swedish Army in peace time were to consist of the following units from 1 January 1928.
