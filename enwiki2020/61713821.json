The tournament consists of 12 teams, with the winner going on to represent Louth in the Leinster Senior Club Football Championship. The championship starts with a group stage and then progresses to a knock out stage. Newtown Blues were the defending champions for the second time in a row after they defeated the Naomh M\u00e1irt\u00edn in the previous years final. They successfully defended their crown to claim a \"3-in-a-row\" of S.F.C. titles and their 23rd overall when defeating the same opposition by 2-9 to 1-9 at Drogheda Park on 20 October 2019. This was St. Mochta's return to the senior grade after at 37 year absence (they were relegated from the S.F.C. to the I.F.C. back in 1982) when claiming the 2018 Louth Intermediate Football Championship title with a final victory over St. Fechin's. Se\u00e1n O'Mahony's were relegated to the I.F.C. for 2020 after a 5 year spell in the top-flight when losing to the O'Connells in the relegation final. Since winning 2014 I.F.C. the Point Road club reached two senior finals in 2015 and 2016, winning the latter against St. Mary's Ardee. ==Team Changes== The following teams have changed division since the 2018 championship season. ===To S.F.C.=== Promoted from 2018 Louth Intermediate Football Championship * St. Mochta's - (Intermediate Champions) ===From S.F.C.=== Relegated to 2019 Louth Intermediate Football Championship * Kilkerley Emmets ==Group stage== There are 4 groups called Group A, B, C and D.
