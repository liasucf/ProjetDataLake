    "text": "Verch\u00e8res is an off-island suburb of Montreal, in Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie, Quebec, located on the south bank of the Saint Lawrence River. The population as of the Canada 2011 Census was 5,692. == History == In the 17th century, the settlement at Verch\u00e8res was the scene of an Iroquois raid that was apparently thwarted by the ingenuity of a 14-year-old girl named Madeleine (now known as Madeleine de Verch\u00e8res). A cast-iron statue of Madeleine de Verch\u00e8res stands today by the former location of the settlement stronghold on the shore of the Saint- Lawrence river. In French, the word Verch\u00e8res can be used as an adjective to describe a specific type of rowboat invented in Verch\u00e8res at the end of the 19th century, i.e. chaloupe verch\u00e8res. A specimen of the rowboat is on permanent outdoor display during the summer and fall at the Parc Jean-Marie Moreau across from the town office. The motto of Verch\u00e8res is In Tenebris Lumen Rectis Corde. The streets of Verch\u00e8res are mostly named after the patronyms of residing families but also after local people who rose to celebrity in Canadian history. ==Demographics== ===Population=== ===Language=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !colspan=\"19\"|Canada Census Mother Tongue - Verch\u00e8res, Quebec |- !
