Ransohoff (December 29, 1921 \u2013 May 29, 1993) was an American associate professor of Community Planning at the University of Cincinnati, and a promoter of the city as a planner, tour guide, historian, professor, photographer and fund-raiser.Cincinnati Magazine, Oct 2007, Vol. 41, No. 1, ISSN 0746-8210, p.147, Emmis Communications In the early 1950s, he was on the staff of Family Service, for which he took photographs of the clients the agency was serving. ==Education== Daniel J. Ransohoff was born to the German Jewish Ransohoff familySarna, J. D., & Klein, N. H. (1989). The Jews of Cincinnati. Center for Study of the American Jewish Experience, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. in Cincinnati, Ohio. He began his career as a documentary photographer. After serving in the Navy, he obtained a bachelor's degree at Bard College, a master's degree in social work at Columbia University and a doctorate at Union Graduate School and returned to Cincinnati to pursue a dual career as a social worker for Family Service of the Cincinnati area, the Community Chest, and the United Way (United Appeal) and as an associate professor of community planning at the University of Cincinnati. ==Photographer== Ransohoff created a photographic record, now housed in the Cincinnati Museum, that spanned 30 years and documents Cincinnati\u2019s disadvantaged in neighborhoods across the city, including the West End. He left a collection of more than 25,000 prints and negatives of urban housing, economic, social, and health conditions, children, the elderly, families, and the agencies which try to alleviate the conditions.Ransohoff, D. J. (1955). Today's Housing Program, the Community, and Social Casework. Marriage and Family Living, 17(2), 156-161. One example of such imagery was included in 1955 by Edward Steichen in the world-touring Museum of Modern Art exhibition The Family of Man, seen by 9 million viewers and perpetuated in a catalogue that has never been out of print. Ransohoff\u2019s contribution demonstrates his respect for the dignity of his subjects; it is classically and sympathetically composed to show both the interior of an old tenement and its occupant, a resolute old woman in a worn floral dress, top lit and standing next to her rocking chair which is silhouetted against the cheaply curtained window. Author Bill Miller wrote of him in Cincinnati Magazine in May 1968 that, \u201c\u2026his photos have become classics that live on and on, stirring human conscience wherever they are seen.\u201d Many of his photographs appeared in Time, Life, The New Yorker, and on national televisionEditorial, Cincinnati Magazine, May 1971, Vol. 4, No. 8, page 2, ISSN 0746-8210, Emmis Communications ==Promoter of social work== Aside from documenting substandard living conditions of the clients of Family Service, for which he was appointed Community Relations Director, he also photographed to show what social work was and the vital roles that social workers performed in the community. With World War II over, there was a new generation of families who needed the assistance of a clinically trained social worker for marital problems, alcoholism, parent-child relationships, and emotional problems, during a time of tremendous change for American families when men were returning from the military services to the workforce, and women who had worked during the war were back at home; together they were producing babies in record numbers. Ransohoff\u2019s specialty was public relations through photography to help families become aware of the ways Family Service could help. In the early 1960s, the New York-based Family Service Association of America published a pamphlet Their Career: Helping People Help Themselves which used Ransohoff\u2019s imagery to recruit young adults into social work.Linda Vaccariello \u2018Family Matters: Fifty Years Ago, Danny Ransohoff\u2019s Photographs Defined Social Work in Black and White\u2019 Cincinnati Magazine, Nov 2004, Vol. 38, No. 2, ISSN 0746-8210 pps 102-109 ==Later career== Ransohoff went on to work for Community Chest, where he continued to capture images of life in the Cincinnati community. His two official jobs were teaching community planning at the University of Cincinnati and directing special projects for the United Way and Community Chest, but in his unofficial role, he conducted hundreds of tours of the city for residents and visitors and for companies who used him to help recruit workers who may have had negative feelings about the city.Mary Gustafson \u2018Tour de Force\u2019 Cincinnati Magazine, Mar 1977, Vol. 10, No. 6, ISSN 0746-8210 He co- founded Cincinnati's classical music public radio station WGUCDoug Bolton (2010) WGUC gets blog mention Cincinnati Business Courier (online) and was chairman of the Friends of Judaic Studies.The Cincinnati Jewish Jubilee Yearbook, 1957 Ransohoff died of pancreatic cancer in a hospital in Cincinnati, on May 29, 1993 and was survived by two daughters, Sallie Ransohoff Kreines and Lela Ransohoff-Englert, both of Cincinnati; two brothers, Jerry and William, both of Cincinnati; a stepson, Charles Fleischmann, of Unionville, Pa.; a stepdaughter, Melanie Fleischmann of North Salem, N.Y., and two grandchildren.Daniel Ransohoff, 71, Booster for Cincinnati.(Obituary).
