WYCIWYG is a play on the related acronym WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get). ==Usage== Mozilla Firefox implements a registered, strictly internal URI scheme to sort and later reference locally cached pages that were generated or modified by a script on the client side (a common practice for Web 2.0 sites). ==Security issues== In 2007 Micha\u0142 Zalewski reported that it was possible to bypass the same-origin checks and read from cached (wyciwyg) documents. It was possible at that time to access documents without proper same domain policy checks. This could have enabled an attacker to steal sensitive data, perform cache poisoning and execute their own code or display own content with URL bar and SSL certificate data of the original page (URL spoofing).Firefox wyciwyg:// cache vulnerability demo \u2013 Michal Zalewski This was fixed in Firefox 2.0.0.5 and SeaMonkey 1.1.3.Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2007-24: Unauthorized access to wyciwyg:// documents ==References== Category:User interfaces Category:Acronyms Category:Computing acronyms Category:URI schemes ",
