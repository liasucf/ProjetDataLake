When it came out in cinemas in Canada, it was translated into 'Don't Die Too Hard' in reference to 'Die Hard', starring Bruce Willis. ==Plot== \u00c9ric and Ramzy are working as window washers at the Montparnasse skyscraper in Paris. Thinking that he has a date set up with beautiful executive Marie- Jo\u00eblle (who in reality hates his guts), Ramzy stays at work late while \u00c9ric hangs around with him. As a result, the pair witness a gang of terrorists seize the tower and take its late-night occupants (including Marie-Jo\u00eblle) hostage. Knowing that only they can save the day, \u00c9ric and Ramzy swing into action. ==Cast== *Eric Judor as Eric *Ramzy Bedia as Ramzy *Marina Fo\u00efs as St\u00e9phanie Lanceval *Serge Riaboukine as Michel Vignault a.k.a.
