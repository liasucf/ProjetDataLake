The 8,000 congress members concluded the event with the formulation of 46 vows. == Organization == Camille Roy, rector of Universit\u00e9 Laval and president of the Second Congress on the French Language in Canada.To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Congress of 1912, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du parler fran\u00e7ais organized a second congress in Quebec City between June 27 and July 1, 1937. This second congress used the same formula as that of the first congress, with the exception that it was not planned to coincide with the festivities of the French-Canadian National Day, but rather shortly after. The theme of the second congress was: \"The French spirit in Canada, in our language, our laws, our habits\" (L'esprit fran\u00e7ais au Canada, dans notre langue, dans nos lois, dans nos m\u0153urs).Qu\u00e9bec, 1900-2000, p. 45 The organizing committee of the Congress, set up by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du parler fran\u00e7ais on May 8, 1936, was presided by Mgr Camille Roy, president of the Society and rector of Universit\u00e9 Laval.Le deuil d'un pays imagin\u00e9, p. 35-36 It is also Camille Roy who presided the executive office of the organizing committee.The other officers were: Cyrille Gagnon, Arthur Vall\u00e9e and Louis-Philippe Geofrrion, vice-presidents; Antonio Langlais, secretary general; Aim\u00e9 Labrie, Rom\u00e9o Blanchet and Paul-\u00c9mile Gosselin, assistant secretaries; Maurice Lalibert\u00e9, treasurer; Oscar Bergeron, assistant tresurer.

The seven vows of the language section expressed the desire of congress members to see that the phonetic and elocution of the students' speech improve by their methodical teaching and by the particular care which teachers must give to their own diction; that a program of studies on the spoken language of Franco-Americans be set up; that a greater number of local and regional history societies be founded; that libraries be more numerous and more furnished; that the language of advertising improve and be in proper French; that scientific reviews be better supported and encouraged; that a Board on the French language in Canada (Office de la langue fran\u00e7aise au Canada) be set up, with the mandate to examine and correct commercial signs, posters, and brochures. The three vows of the arts section pertained to the promotion of art appreciation among workers by conferences, projections, etc.; that the culture of letters be developed, especially by encouraging \"our own writers\"; that the teaching of drawing be developed in schools. The five wishes of the section on laws dealt with the conservation of the French spirit of laws and interpretation methods; that a commission be set up to revise all laws of Quebec to conform to the French spirit, in a concise, logical and methodical redaction; that the translation of federal laws (which were all in English) improve and that translations \"no longer be restrained to literal translation\"; that the rights of the French language be recognized in all of Canada and that the rights of francophone minorities to preserve their language by learning it in school be recognized in all of North America; The other vows (from the 16th to 46th) were formulated by the section on habits and pertained to the promotion of professional associations, parish schools in the United States, the quality of French in the press and radio, solidarity among francophone groups, the organization of a Congress on Economics, the creation of a linguistic information office (terminology, translation), that Canada and Ha\u00efti establish press relations to better know each other, as well as items dear to the catholic clergy: fighting communism and discouraging marriage between Catholics and Protestants. The participants to the ladies session wished that taste for poetry be cultivated among the young people, that French-language feminine associations be created in Canada and the United States, that the education of women be modernized, that children literature be developed, etc. The participants to the youth session wished that libraries contain books appropriate to young age and also that youth movements develop. On the first of July, the Permanent Committee of the Congresses on the French Language in Canada (Comit\u00e9 permanent des Congr\u00e8s de la langue fran\u00e7aise en Am\u00e9rique), which was inactive since 1920, was reactivated. It was composed of 20 members responsible to publish the account of the Congress's sittings and to see that the vows it has formulated become reality. In 1939, the Committee took the name of Comit\u00e9 de la survivance fran\u00e7aise en Am\u00e9rique and it is under this name that it was incorporated in 1940. ==Notes== == References == * CLFC (1938).
