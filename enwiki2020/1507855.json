    "text": "Ida of Boulogne (c. 1160\u20131216) was suo jure Countess of Boulogne from 1173 until her death. ==Life== Ida was the elder daughter of Matthew of Alsace and Marie I, Countess of Boulogne. Her maternal grandparents were King Stephen of England and Matilda I of Boulogne. Her mother, a nun, had been abducted from a convent and forced into marriage by Matthew. As a consequence, her parents' marriage was controversial and, in 1170, was annulled. ===Reign=== Her father continued to rule until his death in 1173, when she succeeded. Upon the advice of her uncle, Philip I, Count of Flanders, she married first in 1181, to Gerard of Guelders, but he died in the same year. She next married Berthold IV, Duke of Z\u00e4hringen, but he died in 1186. Ida was abducted in 1190 by Count Renaud de Dammartin, who carried her off to Lorraine. She and Renaud had a daughter, Matilda II of Boulogne (died 1258). ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:1160s births Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:1216 deaths Category:Counts of Boulogne Category:Place of birth missing Category:Place of death missing Ida Ida Ida Ida Category:12th-century women rulers Category:13th-century women rulers Category:12th-century French people Category:12th-century French women Category:13th-century French people Category:13th-century French women ",
