Raman maintained the stand that Meiyappan was not a team official during the ensuing investigation conducted by former Chief Justice Mukul Mudgal. But his contention was thereafter rejected by the report filed by the Mudgal committee. In early April 2014, the court-ordered interim BCCI President for all IPL-related matters, Sunil Gavaskar revealed that he is evaluating Raman's role in the IPL scandal. == References == Category:Living people Category:Businesspeople from Madurai Category:Indian chief operating officers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
