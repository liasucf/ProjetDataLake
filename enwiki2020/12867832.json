However, despite including a number of Top Ten or Top 40 singles on the Billboard Hot 100, this was less successful than its predecessors, and it didn't receive a certification from the RIAA. ==Track listing== #\"Dr. Feelgood\" - M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce - 4:51 #\"Unskinny Bop\" - Poison - 3:48 #\"I Remember You\" - Skid Row - 5:15 #\"Kiss Me Deadly\" - Lita Ford - 4:01 #\"I Wanna Rock\" - Twisted Sister - 3:04 #\"Silent Lucidity\" - Queensr\u00ffche - 5:49 #\"Epic\" - Faith No More - 4:54 #\"Up All Night\" - Slaughter - 3:47 #\"Don't Treat Me Bad\" - FireHouse - 3:58 #\"Hole Hearted\" - Extreme - 3:40 #\"Bang Your Head (Metal Health)\" - Quiet Riot - 5:20 #\"In My Dreams\" - Dokken - 4:21 #\"Wait\" - White Lion - 4:03 #\"Easy Come, Easy Go\" - Winger - 4:03 #\"I Saw Red\" - Warrant - 3:50 #\"I'll See You in My Dreams\" - Giant - 4:45 Category:2000 compilation albums Category:Glam metal compilation albums Category:Hard rock compilation albums Category:Heavy metal compilation albums Category:Razor & Tie compilation albums ",
