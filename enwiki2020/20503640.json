A. unicolor was transferred to the genus (from Tyromyces) in 2003. The generic name Amylocystis is derived from the Ancient Greek words (\"starch\") and (\"bladder\"). ==References== Category:Fomitopsidaceae Category:Polyporales genera Category:Taxa named by Rolf Singer Category:Fungi described in 1944 ",
