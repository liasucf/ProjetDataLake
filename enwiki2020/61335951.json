This is that kind of a movie - it is forgettable, it is done to death\u2026 it is running out of boring descriptions for itself\". Manoj Kumar R. of The Indian Express rated 3 out of 5 star and said: \"Ajai Vasudev has served up another snoozefest ... Shylock is a mess. You know this story. You know how things would pan out. And you know what happens to the bad guys even before the film arrives at its depressingly predictable climax\". Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost rated 3.25 out of 5 stars and wrote that \"To compensate perhaps for the absolute lack of novelty in the script, camerawork and all else here, multiple references are made to other films and their Tamil superstars ... The music of Shylock is so painful and the narrative so clich\u00e9d, that if this were an Easter week release, Jesus might have raced back into his tomb begging never to be resurrected. And don't get my imagination started on paavam William Shakespeare's reaction to the appropriation of one of his most famous characters for this story's protagonist\". == Home media == The VOD rights were sold to Amazon Prime Video and satelight television rights to Surya TV channel. ==References== == External links == * Category:2020 films Category:2020s Malayalam-language films Category:Indian films Category:Films featuring an item number Category:Indian action films Category:Films scored by Gopi Sundar Category:2020 action films ",
