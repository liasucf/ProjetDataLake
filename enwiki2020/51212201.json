The Institute publishes journal Nuclear Physics and Atomic Energy. ==History== Soon after the World War II, in 1944 at the Institute of Physics in Kyiv was created a department for dealing with number of issues concerning nuclear physics and use atomic energy. For execution of outlined activities sequentially were placed into operation: in 1956 a cyclotron U-120, in 1960 a research reactor VVR-M (Water-Water), and in 1964 an electro-static generator EGP-5. On 26 March 1970 the Presidium of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (at that time Ukrainian Academy of Sciences) in pursuance of the relevant resolution of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR adopted the resolution #105 about the creation of NASU Institute of Nuclear Research (IYaD) on the basis of a number of nuclear departments of the NASU Institute of Physics. ==Major scientific directions== The main directions of scientific research are Nuclear Physics, Atomic Energy, Solid-state physics, Plasma Physics, Radiobiology and Radioecology. ==Experimental facilities== Research Nuclear reactor WWR-M, Cyclotron U-120, Isochronous cyclotron U-240, 10 MeV Electrostatic Tandem Accelerator. ==Directors== * 1970 \u2014 1974 Mitrofan Pasichnyk * 1974 \u2014 1983 Oleh Nimets * 1984 \u2014 2015 Ivan Vyshnevskyi * 2015 \u2014 Vasyl Slisenko ==Known scientists== *Aleksandr Leipunskii *Vilen Strutinsky *Yuri G.
