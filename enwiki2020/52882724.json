    "text": "Kang Jeongildang (1772-1832), was a Korean poet. She married the scholar Yun Gwangyeon (\u5c39\u5149\u6f14, \uc724\uad11\uc5f0, 1778-1838). Because of their poverty, her spouse could not afford to work for their support and study at the same time, so she supported them both by knitting while he studied. In parallel, she composed many poems of her own. After her death, her widower published her collected works in Jeongildang-yugo (1836), containing 150 writings, among them 38 poems and 82 letters. ==References== * Lee Bae-yong: Women in Korean History \ud55c\uad6d \uc5ed\uc0ac \uc18d\uc758 \uc5ec\uc131\ub4e4 * Sungmoon Kim: The Way to Become a Female Sage: Im Yunjidang's Confucian Feminism * Youngmin Kim & Michael J.
