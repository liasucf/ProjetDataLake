    "text": "Tuonela is the fourth full-length album by Finnish band Amorphis. The album is named from Tuonela, the realm of the dead in Finnish mythology. The album also shares inspiration with many of the band's productions in the text and themes of the Kalevala, or Finnish Epic. This album was the last release with original and long time bassist, Olli-Pekka Laine, until his return in 2017. Laine quit a year after this release in 2000, because of musical differences and to focus on his family. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Amorphis *Pasi Koskinen \u2013 vocals *Tomi Koivusaari \u2013 rhythm guitars, sitar (\"Greed\") *Esa Holopainen \u2013 lead guitars, acoustic guitars *Olli-Pekka Laine \u2013 bass guitar *Pekka Kasari \u2013 drums, percussion Session musicians *Santeri Kallio \u2013 keyboards *Sakari Kukko \u2013 saxophone (\"Nightfall\" & \"Tuonela\"), flute (\"Rusty Moon\") ==References== Category:1999 albums Category:Amorphis albums Category:Relapse Records albums Category:Concept albums ",
