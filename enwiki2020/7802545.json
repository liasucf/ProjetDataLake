Le\u00f3 Salamin taught the French language and he was in the institution's Board of Director and was the high school director during the years 1872\u20131897. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz had five years of being taught the French language by Le\u00f3 Salamin. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz, (born 9 April 1863 in Sopron, died 30 September 1930 in Budapest), was a Hungarian mathematics high school teacher best known for educating such people as John von Neumann and Nobel laureate Eugene Wigner. He was a legendary teacher of \"Budapest- Fasori Evang\u00e9likus Gimn\u00e1zium\", the Budapest Lutheran Gymnasium, a famous secondary school in Budapest in Hungary. ==Biography== He was born on 9 April 1863 in Sopron,Sopron, German: \u00d6denburg, Croatian: \u0160opron, Latin: Scarbantia. a city in Hungary on the Austrian border, near the Lake Neusiedl/Lake Fert\u0151. His father, \u00c1gost R\u00e1tz, was a hardware merchant and ironmonger, and his mother was Emma T\u00f6pler of Danube Swabian origin. He graduated from the Lutheran Grammar School of Sopron in 1882. The courses of study for elementary and middle school the first two years are not available. He was a student in the Hungarian royal state grammar school, \"F\u0151re\u00e1liskola in Sopron\" between 1875 and 1880, now Sz\u00e9chenyi Istv\u00e1n Gimn\u00e1zium (Sopron). From 1880 to 1882 he studied at the Sopron Lutheran High School and graduated in 1882. From 1883 to 1887 he was a student at the University of Budapest. Then he attended the Science University of Budapest from 1883 to 1887. His university studies were at the Academy of Science in Budapest until 1887. He also studied philosophy at Berlin University between 4 October 1887 and 7 August 1888, and natural science at Strasbourg University from 31 October 1888. He worked as a practicing teacher in the Main Practising Secondary School of Budapest Science University from September 1889. He took his university degree specializing in mathematics and physics on 28 November 1890. From 1890 he was a mathematics professor at the \"Budapest-Fasori Evang\u00e9likus Gimn\u00e1zium\", a German-speaking Lutheran High School in V\u00e1rosligeti fasor 17\u201321 in Budapest. Beginning 1 September 1890 he was employed as a substitute teacher. From 1 September 1892 until 1925, he tenured as a regular teacher. From 1909 to 1914, he served as director of the Gimn\u00e1zium. One of his successors in this role was S\u00e1ndor Mikola, who was school principal from 1928\u20131935. Between the years of 1912\u20131921, he taught several students who became excellent mathematicians, physicians and chemists, including Nobel prize-winning physicist Eugene Wigner (Jen\u0151 Wigner) and mathematician and polymath John von Neumann (J\u00e1nos Neumann). At the age of 11, Eugene Wigner developed an interest in mathematical problems. From 1915 through 1919 Wigner studied at the Gimn\u00e1zium, where he and Von Neumann were taught by R\u00e1tz. von Neumann entered the Gimn\u00e1zium in 1911. Although his father insisted he attend school at the grade level appropriate to his age, he agreed to hire private tutors to give him advanced instruction in those areas in which he had displayed an aptitude. L\u00e1szlo R\u00e1tz died on 30 September 1930 in Gr\u00fcnwald Sanatorium, a nursing home, in Budapest. ==Commemorative plaque== An embossed marble tablet commemorates him on the wall of Budapest Lutheran Gymnasium, Budapest-Fasori Evang\u00e9likus Gimn\u00e1zium. The commemorative plaque of Jen\u0151 Wigner, J\u00e1nos Neumann and J\u00e1nos Hars\u00e1nyi, Budapest District VII, V\u00e1rosligeti Alley No 17\u201321, has also the names of four of the teachers of Fasori Gimn\u00e1zium, \u00d6d\u00f6n Hittrich, S\u00e1ndor Mikola, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz and J\u00e1nos Renner. ==Mathematics curriculum== L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz participated in the making of the mathematics curriculum of 1924 as well as the relevant instructions. While an active teacher, he was also the teacher-chairperson of Song and Music Association. After retirement he became the executive president of Former Students Association. His scientific career is significant for two reasons: on the one hand, he was a pioneer in completing the reform of teaching mathematics in secondary schools (1905\u20131914), and, on the other hand, he was the editor of the Journal of Secondary School Mathematics from 1896 to 1914 after D\u00e1niel Arany (1863\u20131945). ==Editor-in-chief== Between 1894\u20131914 R\u00e1tz was editor-in-chief (Editorial Head) of the K\u00f6z\u00e9piskolai Matematikai \u00e9s Fizikai Lapok, K\u00f6MaL, Mathematic and Physical Journal for Secondary Schools, the legendary highschool mathematics journal of Hungary. The archives of the High School Mathematics and Physics Journal, known as K\u00f6MaL, a popular abbreviation of the Hungarian name \"K\u00f6z\u00e9piskolai Matematikai \u00e9s Fizikai Lapok\", is a Hungarian mathematics and physics journal for high school students, which has been continually published since 1894. The journal has an extraordinary collection of problems and articles, spanning more than a century and representing a significant factor in the history of Hungarian mathematics and physics. Mathematics at the start and later extended to physics, this highly professional monthly journal has survived two world wars and several political changes, and it established a worldwide reputation for Hungarian mathematics and sciences. The High School Mathematics Journal was founded in 1894 by D\u00e1niel Arany, a high school teacher of the science high school in the city of Gy\u0151r. He edited the journal until 1896, when L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz, at that time already was a prominent teacher of the Fasori Lutheran High School, took it over from him and continued till 1914. The numbered \"problems\" (\"Feladat\" in Hungarian) were addressed to 11th and 12th-grade students, i. e. 17 to 18-year-old students. ==J\u00e1nos Bolyai Mathematical Society== J\u00e1nos Bolyai (1802\u20131860), painted by Ferenc M\u00e1rkos (2012). The J\u00e1nos Bolyai Mathematical Society (Bolyai J\u00e1nos Matematikai T\u00e1rsulat, BJMT) is the Hungarian mathematical society, named after J\u00e1nos Bolyai, a 19th-century Hungarian mathematician, a co-discoverer of non-Euclidean geometry. It is the professional society of the Hungarian mathematicians, applied mathematicians, and mathematics teachers. It was founded in 1947, as one of the two successor societies of the Mathematical and Physical Society (\"Bolyai J\u00e1nos Matematikai \u00e9s Fizikai T\u00e1rsulat\") founded in 1891. It is a member-society of the European Mathematical Society. The European Mathematical Society (EMS) is a European organization dedicated to the development of mathematics in Europe. Its members are different mathematical societies in Europe, academic institutions and individual mathematicians. The current president is Marta Sanz Sol\u00e9, professor of Statistics at University of Barcelona. Some of the Presidents of the Society were Gy\u00f6rgy Haj\u00f3s (1963\u20131972), L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Fejes T\u00f3th (1972\u20131975), P\u00e1l Tur\u00e1n (1975\u20131976) and J\u00e1nos Sur\u00e1nyi (1976\u20131980), the names of some of them are below under K\u00f6z\u00e9piskolai Matematikai \u00e9s Fizikai Lapok, K\u00f6MaL. J\u00e1nos Bolyai Mathematical Society organizes L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz Congress for secondary school mathematics teachers every year and has issued the L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz coin since 2000. The High School Mathematics Journal was published by the J\u00e1nos Bolyai Mathematical Society and the publication was financed by the Ministry of Education. * J\u00e1nos Bolyai (15 December 1802 \u2013 27 January 1860) , was a Hungarian mathematician, one of the founders of non-Euclidean geometry \u2014 a geometry that differs from Euclidean geometry in its definition of parallel lines. The discovery of a consistent alternative geometry that might correspond to the structure of the universe helped to free mathematicians to study abstract concepts irrespective of any possible connection with the physical world. Bolyai was born in the town of Kolozsv\u00e1r (Klausenburg), Principality of Transylvania (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania), the son of Zsuzsanna Benk\u0151 and the well-known mathematician Farkas Bolyai. He died in Marosv\u00e1s\u00e1rhely, Transylvania, Austrian Empire (now T\u00e2rgu Mure\u015f, Romania). ==K\u00f6z\u00e9piskolai Matematikai \u00e9s Fizikai Lapok, K\u00f6MaL== K\u00f6z\u00e9piskolai Matematikai \u00e9s Fizikai Lapok, K\u00f6MaL, Mathematic and Physical Journal for Secondary Schools, the legendary highschool mathematics journal of Hungary. Some of the best contestants were * J\u00e1nos Hars\u00e1nyi (John Hars\u00e1nyi) (1920\u20132000) (), was born in Budapest. As he attended high school at the Lutheran Gymnasium in Budapest, there is on the marble tablet in Fasori Gimn\u00e1zium also J\u00e1nos Hars\u00e1nyi's name. During high school he became one of the best problem solvers of the K\u00f6MaL, the Mathematical and Physical Monthly for Secondary Schools. Founded in 1893, this periodical is generally credited with a large share of Hungarian students' success in mathematics. He also won the first prize in the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s mathematics competition for high school students.Baron Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s de V\u00e1s\u00e1rosnam\u00e9ny ( or Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s (27 July 1848 \u2013 8 April 1919), more commonly called Baron Roland von E\u00f6tv\u00f6s in English literature, was a Hungarian physicist. He is remembered today largely for his work on gravitation and surface tension. E\u00f6tv\u00f6s was the son of J\u00f3zsef E\u00f6tv\u00f6s, a well-known poet, writer, and liberal politician, who was cabinet minister at the time, and played an important part in 19th century Hungarian intellectual and political life. From 1886 until his death in 1919, Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s researched and taught in the University of Budapest, which in 1950 was renamed after him (E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University). :John Hars\u00e1nyi became a Hungarian-American economist and Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences winner in 1994. He is best known for his contributions to the study of game theory and its application to economics, specifically for his developing the highly innovative analysis of games of incomplete information, so-called Bayesian games. For his work, important contributions to the use of game theory and economic reasoning in political and moral philosophy (specifically utilitarian ethics, he was a co- recipient along with John Nash and Reinhard Selten of the 1994 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics. He died in Berkeley, California, USA. * P\u00e1l Erd\u0151s (Paul Erd\u0151s) (1913\u20131996) (), was born in Budapest, he became a mathematician, he lived in the United States, United Kingdom, Israel, but died in Warsaw, Poland. His fascination with mathematics developed early\u2014at the age of four, he could calculate in his head how many seconds a person had lived, given their age. At 16, his father introduced him to two of his lifetime favorite subjects\u2014infinite series and set theory. During high school, Erd\u0151s became an ardent solver of the problems proposed each month in K\u00f6MaL, the Mathematical and Physical Monthly for Secondary Schools. Erd\u0151s later published several articles in it about problems in elementary plane geometry. In 1934, at the age of 21, he was awarded a doctorate in mathematics. He died in Warszaw, Poland. * P\u00e1l Tur\u00e1n (Paul Tur\u00e1n) (1910\u20131976) (), was born in Budapest, he became a Hungarian a mathematician and worked primarily in number theory. He had a long collaboration with fellow Hungarian mathematician Paul Erd\u0151s, lasting 46 years and resulting in 28 joint papers. He received a teaching degree at the University of Budapest in 1933 and the Ph.D. degree under Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r in 1935. He became associate professor at the University of Budapest in 1945 and full professor in 1949. He died in Budapest. * Gy\u00f6rgy Haj\u00f3s (1912\u20131972) (), was born in Budapest, he became a Hungarian mathematician who worked in group theory, graph theory, and geometry. In graph theory, a branch of mathematics, the Haj\u00f3s construction is an operation on graphs named after Gy\u00f6rgy Haj\u00f3s (1961), that may be used to construct any critical graph or any graph whose chromatic number is at least some given threshold. He earned a teaching degree from the University of Budapest in 1935. He then took a position at the Technical University of Budapest, where he stayed from 1935 to 1949. While at the Technical University of Budapest, he earned a doctorate in 1938. He became a professor at the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University in 1949 and remained there until his death in 1972. Additionally he was president of the J\u00e1nos Bolyai Mathematical Society from 1963 to 1972. He died in Budapest. * Eszter Klein (Esther Szekeres) (1910\u20132005) (, married Esther Szekeres), was born in Budapest, she became a Hungarian-Australian mathematician with an Erd\u0151s number of 1. The Erd\u0151s number describes the \"collaborative distance\" between mathematician Paul Erd\u0151s and another person, as measured by authorship of mathematical papers. Esther Klein was a member of a high school student in mathematics who are interested in associating Anonymous group in Budapest, P\u00e1l Erd\u0151s (Paul Erd\u0151s) (), P\u00e1l Tur\u00e1n (Paul Tur\u00e1n) (), Gy\u00f6rgy Szekeres (George Szekeres) () and with others. In 1936 she married George Szekeres and later moved to Adelaide and Sydney. She died in Adelaide in Australia. * Tibor Bakos (1909\u20131998) (), was born in Szeged, he became a mathematics teacher and he had specialized methods in teaching, he was an excellent expert in mathematics teaching methodology. He graduated the main secondary school in Szombathely in 1927, higher education in the Peter P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny University in mathematics and physics department, was admitted to the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s College. They were masters of the faculty of Fej\u00e9r and Joseph K\u00fcrsch\u00e1k. Teaching career began in Satoraljaujhely, assistant teaching position was a pious teacher of real estates high school. Bakos did well in mathematics teaching methodology, which is why in 1958, in Budapest the mathematician J\u00e1nos Sur\u00e1nyi called him to edit the Problems with K\u00f6MaL. He was one of the responsible editor of the High School Math Sheets (1958\u20131974), until his retirement. He died in Budapest. * J\u00e1nos Sur\u00e1nyi (1918\u20132006) (), was born in Budapest, he became Ph.D. in 1941 and professor at University of Szeged. Erd\u00f6s Award. Professor J\u00e1nos Sur\u00e1nyi received his undergraduate degree in 1941 and his Ph.D. in 1943. He began teaching at University of Szeged as an assistant in 1950 without pay. Since 1950 he has worked at E\u00f6tv\u00f6s University Budapest, and since 1960 he has held the rank of full professor. The journal has been a very important factor in the popularization of mathematics, in particular of solving mathematical problems by high school students. J\u00e1nos Sur\u00e1nyi has served as editor-in-chief since 1970. He had significant educational, didactic and talent management activities. In 1947 Paula So\u00f3s restarted the Middle School Math Sheets and a major part of the J\u00e1nos Bolyai Mathematical Society was created. He died in Budapest.World Federation of National Mathematics Competitions. ==The reformer of teaching mathematics== The reform committee of mathematics declared at the Meran general assembly of nature examiners in Germany in 1905 that sciences also represent cultural values, not only practical benefits: therefore, they are worth being considered equal to linguistics as means of education. In Hungary the reform was conducted by Prof. Man\u00f3 Beke. He, together with Guszt\u00e1v Rados and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz, represented Hungary in the international reform committee from 1909. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz participated in congresses organized in Cambridge and Paris. He was granted the French Officer d'Acad\u00e9mie in 1910. In 1906 the Mathematics Reform Committee was established in Hungary, the chairperson of which was Man\u00f3 Beke, its secretary was S\u00e1ndor Mikola and the members included L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz as well. This committee performed admittedly the most productive work among the European committees. L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz and S\u00e1ndor Mikola, as they found the changes necessary, had worked out the workable methods and curriculum of mathematics teaching. They declared that certain elements that are obtained indirectly belong to mathematics as well and they have to be confirmed in the student. The learning of mathematics has to be completed by immediate experience and lots of measuring. They also emphasized the need for mental calculation and the practice of estimating. According to their theory the students have to be encouraged to tend to know reality. They considered inevitable for the teachers to intend to form clear ideas. Finally, their brave initiatives were successful: in November 1909 R\u00e1tz and Mikola were officially permitted to teach mathematics in the Lutheran Gymnasium as they found it desirable in accordance with the reform endeavours. From the beginning he was an active participant in a worldwide effort of science and mathematics teaching education reform; from 1909 he gets official full liberty in improving educational methods in his own high school; he becomes Officier d'Acad\u00e9mie award at a 1910 Paris congress. The objectives of this reform were the recognition of cultural and humane values of science education, besides tangible pragmatic values. According to the objectives, mathematics has important involuntarily acquirable subconscious elements that need to be enhanced in students. The teachers strived to deliver clearly articulated concepts at the voluntary, conscious level, but more importantly, learning of mathematics has to be tightly woven together with direct experience and practice, emphasizing mental calculations and practicing estimations, allowing students to acquire a subconscious knowledge of reality from experience with quantitative relations. ==Eugene Wigner about his teacher L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz== Eugene Paul Wigner (1902\u20131995) in 1963, when he was awarded his Nobel Prize in Physics. Author: Nobel foundation. Eugene Wigner was asked in the late 1970s \"Do you remember R\u00e1tz?\", to which he answered: \"There he is!\", and pointed to a picture of R\u00e1tz on his office wall. During the years 1912\u20131920 Eugene Wigner was taught by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz and in his acceptance speech for his Nobel Prize (in 1963), dr. Eugene Wigner said: > ... there were many superb teachers at the Lutheran gymnasium. But the > greatest was my mathematics teacher L\u00e1szl\u00f3 R\u00e1tz. R\u00e1tz was known not only > throughout our gymnasium but also by the church and government hierarchy and > among many of the teachers in the country schools. I still keep a photograph > of R\u00e1tz in my workroom because he had every quality of a miraculous teacher: > He loved teaching. He knew the subject and how to kindle interest in it. He > imparted the very deepest understanding. Many gymnasium teachers had great > skill, but no one could evoke the beauty of the subject like R\u00e1tz. R\u00e1tz > cared deeply about mathematics as a discipline... He took special care to > find his better students and to inspire them. R\u00e1tz felt so privileged to > tutor a phenomenon like Neumann Jancsi that he refused any money for it... > Who could know that this precocious 10-year-old would someday become a great > mathematician? Somehow R\u00e1tz knew. And he discovered it very quickly. R\u00e1tz > was just as nice to me and nearly as devoted as he was to Neumann. R\u00e1tz was > the only gymnasium teacher to invite me into his home. There were no private > lessons. But R\u00e1tz lent me many well-chosen books, which I read thoroughly > and made sure to return in good condition. ==References== ==Sources== *Hungarian traditions in talent support, European Day of the Talented and Gifted, Spring 2011.
