    "text": "Southern Luzon State University (SLSU; ), formerly known as Southern Luzon Polytechnic College (SLPC), is the premier, state-funded higher education institution in Quezon Province in the Philippines operating by virtue of Republic Act 9395. It is composed of 11 campuses in the province of Quezon, with the main campus situated in the Municipality of Lucban. SLSU is mandated to provide advanced education, professional, technological instruction in the fields of allied medicine, education, engineering, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, environment, arts and sciences, accountancy, cooperative, business and entrepreneurship, technology and other relevant fields of study in the Province of Quezon and in Region IV-A CALABARZON. It is also mandated to undertake research and extension services and provide progressive leadership in its areas of specialization. By virtue of Republic Act 10931 or the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act signed by President Rodrigo Duterte, SLSU will no longer be collecting tuition fees from its local, first degree undergraduate students.https://www.rappler.com/nation/177684-list- state-colleges-universities-free-tuition == History == Southern Luzon State University (SLSU) started as Lucban Municipal Junior High School by virtue of Municipal Resolution No. 5 passed in April 1964. The permit to operate was bestowed by Assistant Secretary of Education Hon. Miguel Gaffud in July 1964. On May 1965, Municipal Resolution No. 86 was passed requesting the change of name to Lucban Municipal High School. The Director of Public Schools of the time approved the resolution in August 1965. Lucban Community College was created and was made part of Lucban Municipal Junior School as an adjunct institution for its School of Education in June 1968. Lucban School for Philippine Craftsmen formally started in July 1970 by virtue of Republic Act 4345 also known as the merger law, combining the Lucban Municipal high School and Lucban School of Philippine Craftsmen to form the Lucban National High School in July 1972 (with the continuous operation of Lucban Community College). In 1981, 20 Assemblymen of the Southern Tagalog Region sponsored the Parliamentary Bill No. 173 for the conversion of Lucban National College into Southern Luzon Polytechnic College (SLPC). The bill was approved in December 1981 and was signed into law known as Batas Pambansa No. 145 by President Ferdinand E. Marcos. Since then, SLPC grew to establish seven satellite campuses located in various parts of the province of Quezon. The first satellite campus was inaugurated in Alabat in July 1991. In 1991, SLPC-Polilio was created by virtue of Board Resolution No. 19, Series of 1992. In the following year, two additional campuses were established: SLPC-Sampaloc in Brgy. Caldong, Sampaloc, Quezon (BOT Res. No. 33, series of 1993) and SLPC- Infanta. In 1996, another campus, the SLPC-Lucena Dual Training and Livelihood Center, was established under Board Resolution No. 130, series of 1996. Judge Guillermo Eleazar Polytechnic College was integrated in February 2002 under Board Resolution No. 352, series of 2002. {| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; font-size:90%; line-height:1.4em; width:300px;\" ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#03C03C;\"| Presidents of Southern Luzon State University |- | Name || Tenure of office |- | colspan=\"2\" | * * * |- | Dr. Angelo Q.

He served from 1964-1986. Dr. Palermo Salvacion served as the Officer-in-Charge of the College in 1986. In 1987, Dr. Ernesto de Chavez led the school and left office in June, 1990. Dr. Joselito B. Jara took his post as College President in 1990. On May 31, 2002, Dr. Cornelio D. Esquieres became the college president until his demise in August 2004. *Dr. Cecilia N. Gascon's Term (2005-2015) Dr. Cecilia N. Gascon, who was then Vice President for Research, Extension, Production and Development, was designated as Officer-in-Charge of the College in January 2004 and eventually as acting president to serve the unfinished term of Dr. Esquieres until May 31, 2006. On June 1, 2006, the Board appointed Dr. Gascon as the full-fledged College President, disappointing groups who were calling for a search for a new College President to be conducted. On March 17, 2007, SLPC was converted to Southern Luzon State University by virtue of R.A. 9395 signed into law by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Dr. Gascon became the first university president by virtue of Board Resolution No. 609 Series of 2007.About The first female president of the institution, Dr. Gascon's term paved ways to extensive infrastructure development, faculty and staff development, internationalization, and quality assurance. The most notable infrastructures that were built during her term are the Main Library Building, Administration Building, Science and Technology Building, and Business Administration Building in the main campus. New satellite campuses in Tiaong and Gumaca were established, while extension classes in Agriculture and Teacher Education were conducted in Catanauan, Sariaya, and Calauag. An environmental advocate herself, Dr. Gascon has lobbied for a law that would protect the Mt. Banahaw- San Cristobal landscape. A product of her extensive research work in Mt. Banahaw, Republic Act 9847 otherwise known as Mt. Mts. Banahaw-San Cristobal Protected Landscape Act of 2009 was signed into law in December 2009. As the sole educational institution that is recognized as steward of Mt. Banahaw, SLSU receives a Php 1 Million yearly endowment from the Quezon Provincial Government until 2026. Dr. Gascon's administration has also made possible for the first time the joint international teaching and learning opportunities between SLSU and Vietnam's Thai Nguyen University (TNU). It was also in her term when degree programs and institutional services were subjected to external audit, primarily by the AACCUP, for quality assurance. By the end of her term in 2015, SLSU was granted the ISO 9001:2008 Certification for Quality Management System, and the Commission on Higher Education distinction as the Regional Center of Development in Teacher Education and Forestry. Based on a joint CHED and Department of Budget and Management (DBM) evaluation of the University's performance between 2007 and 2015, SLSU was ranked a notch higher from being Level II in 2007 to a Level III higher education institution in 2016. SLSU graduates have also consistently ranked high in licensure examinations administered by the Professional Regulation Commission, specifically in the fields of Nursing, Teacher Education, Forestry, Agriculture, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. Faculty members have likewise been sent abroad for postgraduate studies, short-term training, exchange programs, and research fora as part of the administration's intensive capacity building program. After her term, Dr. Cecilia N. Gascon was elected and appointed University President of Bulacan State University in 2015. *Dr. Milo O. Placino's Term (2015-2019) On April 30, 2015, Dr. Milo O. Placino took his oath as the sixth president of SLSU. Dubbed 'SLSU in the 21st Century', the administrative policy of Dr. Placino and his administration was geared towards aggressively improving University facilities, especially those in the satellite campuses, and continuing measures that ensure the delivery of quality education and services to its students and the greater community. Although met with strong criticisms, his policy on establishing flagship programs for each of the campus of the University was designed to decongest the main campus and to eliminate redundancy in program offerings in hopes of ensuring maximal use of the University's rather limited physical and financial resources. With the support of the City Government of Tayabas the university is expanding into a 50-hectare area in the said city, which will be called the \"University City\", and once completed will be an extension campus of the main campus in Lucban. Dr. Placino's term has been challenged by strong criticisms (about the comparatively lesser number of students admitted) from stakeholders and the community due to the combined effects of the government's transition to the K-12 basic education program and the immediate implementation of the Universal Free Tertiary Education Law or commonly known as \"free tuition\" law. But by the end of his term on May 9, 2019, his administration has laid the groundwork for the establishment of research centers such as the Coconut Research Center in Catanauan and the Center for Mount Banahaw Studies in Lucban, connecting campuses via its dedicated broadband network, and improving library services and holdings. New laboratories were put up such as the Psychological Laboratory, Birthing Home, and Communications Laboratory (TV & Radio Lab) in the main campus, and the Design and Innovations Center in the Lucena Campus. SLSU has likewise been granted the ISO 9001:2015 Certification for Quality Management System, and was recognized by the AACCUP in 2018 as one of the top-ranking SUCs in the Philippines in terms of the number of degree programs accredited. In addition, infrastructures in the satellite campuses were given a facelift, while new academic programs were opened to accommodate a greater number of students. Immediately after his term, the Board designated Dr. Marissa Cadao-Esperal as Officer-in-charge until the election of Dr. Doracie Zoleta-Nantes on September 30, 2019. *Dr. Doracie Zoleta-Nantes' Term (2019\u2013present) On September 30, 2019, Dr. Doracie Zoleta-Nantes took her oath as the seventh President of the University before the University's Board of Regents. The immediate past President of Aurora State College of Technology (ASCOT), having served as Professor for 25 years at the University of the Philippines Diliman's Geography Department, and having conducted and been recognized for her research on Disaster Risk Reduction, Dr. Zoleta-Nantes envisions SLSU to be \"an international academic hub that integrates disciplinary studies and professional skills development, pursues Centers of Excellence and[...] Development in all its[...] curricular programs, undertakes multidisciplinary[...] research projects, and delivers relevant community extension programs[...].\" Among her priorities are the offering of Veterinary Science and Doctor of Medicine programs and the establishment of a Center for Disaster Risk Reduction and Management in SLSU. == Board of Regents == As of October, 2019, the following is the list of Southern Luzon State University's Board of Regents, the highest policy-making body of the institution. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! !Board Member ! |- |Chairperson |Lilian de las Llagas |Commissioner, Commission on Higher Education |- |Vice Chairperson |Doracie Zoleta-Nantes |President of Southern Luzon State University |- |Member |Joel Villanueva |Chairperson, Senate Committee on Higher Education |- |Member |Mark Go |Chairperson, House Committee on Higher Education |- |Member |Alexander Madrigal |Regional Director, DOST |- |Member |Luis Banua |Regional Director, NEDA IV-A |- |Member |Lucy Kopok |Private Sector Representative |- |Member |Renato V.

It is also an accredited \"Dark Green School\", which means that SLSU's instruction, research, and extension activities are geared towards environmental awareness and protection. In 2018, the University is assessed as a Level III State University by the CHED, a level higher than in the 2007 evaluation. Based on the CHED-Department of Budget and Management Joint Circular, a Level III SUC is \"very good in undertaking the functions of a state university/college\", that is, instruction, research, and extension. In 2018, the AACCUP recognized SLSU as a top ranking SUC in the Philippines in terms of number of degree programs accredited. The University has also been recognized by the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) of the Philippines for top performance in licensure examinations and for producing topnotchers in board examinations in the fields of Nursing, Midwifery, Teacher Education, Forestry, Electrical Engineering, Electronics Technician, Mechanical Engineering, and Accountancy. In fact, in 2015, FindUniversity.PH ranks SLSU as the 17th best performing University in the Philippines, and the 2nd best performing State University in Region IV-A CALABARZON among Philippine Universities with at least 15 PRC Board Examinations. == Quality Assurance == As a State University, SLSU is mandated to submit its programs and services to external audit for quality assurance. In terms of instruction, research, and extension services, periodic survey visits are conducted by the Accrediting Agency for Chartered Colleges and Universities in the Philippines (AACCUP). In terms of its management, it has been evaluated and granted the ISO 9001-2015 Certification for Quality Management System. The university is the first State University in the Southern Tagalog region to be ISO certified for Quality Management System in 2015. The Commission on Higher Education of the Philippines, on the other hand, conducts its in-house Institutional Sustainability Assessment (ISA) . As of May, 2017, 97% of all curricular programs both from the undergraduate and graduate levels in the main campus have been accredited by the Accrediting Agency of Chartered Colleges and Universities in the Philippines (AACCUP). Curricular programs in its satellite campuses in Tagkawayan and Tiaong have likewise been subjected to accreditation visits. == Colleges, Campuses and degree programs == The Lucban main campus is home to five colleges: (1) Allied Medicine, (2) Teacher Education, (3) Arts and Sciences, (4) Administration, Business, Hospitality Management, and Accountancy, (5) Engineering and (6) Agriculture; one institute, the Institute of Human Kinetics, and various research centers for agricultural and environmental research.
