    "text": "Cbl (named after Casitas B-lineage Lymphoma) is a mammalian gene encoding the protein CBL which is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase involved in cell signalling and protein ubiquitination. Mutations to this gene have been implicated in a number of human cancers, particularly acute myeloid leukaemia. == Discovery == In 1989 a virally encoded portion of the chromosomal mouse Cbl gene was the first member of the Cbl family to be discovered and was named v-Cbl to distinguish it from normal mouse c-Cbl. The virus used in the experiment was a mouse-tropic strain of Murine leukemia virus isolated from the brain of a mouse captured at Lake Casitas, California known as Cas-Br-M, and was found to have excised approximately a third of the original c-Cbl gene from a mouse into which it was injected. Sequencing revealed that the portion carried by the retrovirus encoded a tyrosine kinase binding domain, and that this was the oncogenic form as retroviruses carrying full-length c-Cbl did not induce tumor formation. The resultant transformed retrovirus was found to consistently induce a type of pre-B lymphoma, known as Casitas B-lineage lymphoma, in infected mice. == Structure == Full length c-Cbl has been found to consist of several regions encoding for functionally distinct protein domains: * N-terminal tyrosine kinase binding domain (TKB domain): determines the protein which it can bind to * RING finger domain motif: recruits enzymes involved in ubiquitination * Proline-rich region: the site of interaction between Cbl and cytosolic proteins involved in Cbl's adaptor functions * C-terminal ubiquitin-associated domain (UBA domain): the site of ubiquitin binding This domain structure and the tyrosine and serine-rich content of the protein product is typical of an \"adaptor molecule\" used in cell signalling pathways. == Homologues == Three mammalian homologues have been characterized, which all differ in their ability to function as adaptor proteins due to the differing lengths of their C-terminal UBA domains: # c-Cbl: ubiquitously expressed, 906 and 913 amino acids in length in humans and mice respectively # Cbl-b: ubiquitously expressed, 982 amino acids long. # Cbl-c: lacks the UBA domain and is therefore only 474 amino acids in length. It is primarily expressed in epithelial cells however its function is poorly understood. Both c-Cbl and Cbl-b have orthologues in D. melanogaster (D-Cbl) and C. elegans (Sli-1), hinting at a long evolutionary path for these proteins. == Function == === Ubiquitin ligase === Ubiquitination is the process of chemically attaching ubiquitin monomers to a protein, thereby targeting it for degradation. As this is a multi-step process, several different enzymes are involved, the final one being a member of the E3 family of ligases. Cbl functions as an E3 ligase, and therefore is able to catalyse the formation of a covalent bond between ubiquitin and Cbl's protein substrate - typically a receptor tyrosine kinase. The RING-finger domain mediates this transfer, however like other E3 ligases of the RING type no intermediate covalent bond is formed between ubiquitin and the RING-finger domain. The stepwise attachment of ubiquitin to the substrate receptor tyrosine kinase can lead to its removal from the plasma membrane and subsequent trafficking to the lysosome for degradation. == Interactions == Cbl gene has been shown to interact with: * Abl gene, * ARHGEF7, * C-Met, * CD2AP, * CSF1R. * CRK, * CRKL, * EGFR,< * FRS2, * FYN, * Grb2, * HCK, * IGF1R, * LCP2;, * NCK1, * PDGFRA, * PIK3R1, * PIK3R2, * PLCG1, * PTK2B, * PTPN11, * SH2B2, * SH3KBP1 * SHC1, * SLA2, * SORBS1, * SORBS2, * SPRY2, * Syk, * UBE2L3, * VAV1, * YWHAB, * YWHAQ, and * ZAP-70, == References == == Further reading == * * * == External links == * Quips article describing CBL function at PDBe * OMIM enteries on NOONAN SYNDROME-LIKE DISORDER WITH OR WITHOUT JUVENILE MYELOMONOCYTIC LEUKEMIA and CBL * Category:Proteins ",
