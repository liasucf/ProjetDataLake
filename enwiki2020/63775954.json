    "text": "Bruus, formerly Brausebart or Brusbart, is a very old north German card game for four players in two teams of two. It was once highly popular but has since died out except for a few pockets in the state of Schleswig-Holstein. As Brusbart, it was the ancestor of a family of similar games in northern Europe, including Swedish Br\u00e4us and Danish Brus which are still played today. Bruus features 'daring and tormenting' which has been said to give the game a certain charm. Once considered the national game of Hamburg, Bruus is a descendant of Karn\u00f6ffel, the oldest identifiable European card game in the history of playing cards with a continuous tradition of play down to the present day. The game is named after the Bruus or Brusbart, once its top card, but now its second-highest trump. == History == The bearded Brusbart The game of Brusbart or Brausebart goes back at least to the first half of the 18th century, Amelung even suggesting that this \"old German game\" may have emerged as early as 1650. By the mid-18th century it had spread to most of northern mainland Europe, including Poland, Livonia and Russia. Earliest references to the game, appear in the 1770s, by when it was familiar enough for a character in a north German stage play to announce that \"my leevtes Spill is Bruusbaart\u201d (\"my favourite game is Brusbart\"). The game contains a number of features that clearly point to its being a descendant of Karn\u00f6ffel, Europe's oldest card game with a continuous tradition of play down to the present day. These include its wild card ranking, the unusual powers of the Sevens and, historically, the use of signalling between partners using gestures, known as winken. Around 1800, \"Bruus'baart\" was the best known card game in the north German city port of Hamburg, so much so that it was described in 1804 as \"Hamburg's national game\" and a song was written in honour of it that conveys something of the rowdy atmosphere of the game and confirms that signalling was an integral part of it. The game faded quickly, being described in 1865 as a \"formerly\" very popular game among the lower classes, and, by 1900, it was virtually forgotten in Hamburg. Nevertheless, it clung on in the north, being recorded in 1911 in the Anglian peninsula, at Wallsb\u00fcll near Flensburg and also in central Schleswig along the Danish-German language boundary. The name of the game appears to have come from the nickname for the King of Hearts (illustrated) which was top card until the 19th century when it was gradually overtaken by the Spitz, the Jack of Clubs. The name 'Brusbart' means \"shaggy beard\" and may be derived from early German-suited playing cards where the King of Hearts was the only King with a bushy beard. The Spitz was also called Spitzkopf. The Toller Hund means \"mad dog\" and may also derived from the depiction of a dog on the Eight of Leaves in early German-suited playing cards. The Low German word bruusen meant 'to play Brusbart' and appears as early as 1800 both as a verb and as a noun (se speelt bruusen). Nevertheless, the name Brusbart, variously spelt, continued to hold sway until the second decade of the 20th century when it was finally superseded by the term Bruus. Today the game is still played are in Schleswig in the region east of the port of Husum, in the villages of Schwesing, Treia and nearby Oster- Ohrstedt.M\u00e4nnergesangverein \"Frohsinn\" von 1881 e.V. at www.treia.de.

Regular Bruus tournaments are held during the winter months in Schwesing and Oster-Ohrstedt. == Related games == The original game of Brusbart developed into a family of related games as it spread across Europe. These include the historical games of Estonian Brus Livonian Brusbart, Russian Bruzbart or Dulya and Polish Dru\u017cbart, as well as the games of Danish Brus, Swedish Br\u00e4us, Icelandic Br\u00fas, Greenlandic Voormsi and Bruus itself, which have survived into the 21st century. More distant cousins include Faroese St\u00fdrivolt and Schleswig Kn\u00fcffeln. == Rules == The rules have changed slightly over the years with new features being added, such as double and triple tricks, but the old signalling scheme and lively communication between partners, including bluffing and blustering, has gone. The latter very much feature in the Brausebart song of 1800, which is the earliest description of play and was interpreted by Feit in 1907. The following gives an outline of the earliest known rules from 1885, followed by early 20th century and modern rules as played in Schwesing and Treia. == Brusbart (1885) == The earliest actual rule set is recorded by Zahn in 1885 in the Korrespondenzblatt des Vereins f\u00fcr niederdeutsche Sprachforschung (Magazine of the Society for Low German Language Research). We are told that \"Brusbart\" was a game played among four players in two teams of two with the partners sitting opposite one another. Signalling, known as winken (the same term used in the game of Gaigel) is recorded as late as 1865, but appears to have dropped out by this point and there is no mention, yet, of double and triple tricks. The King of Hearts, Brusbart, reported as being the highest card as late as 1860, has now fallen to second place. === Cards === The three top trumps in Bruus A French-suited pack of 36 cards is employed. The aim is to win the majority of the nine tricks. There are three matadors which are (highest first): : J, known as Spitzkopf or Spitze (\"rascal\" or \"point\") : K known as Brusbart or Brus (\"shaggy beard\" or \"old grumpy\") : 8 known as Toller Hund (\"mad dog\") Next come the remaining counters (Wertkarten) which beat each other in rank and then suit order as follows: : 9 9 9 9 : A A A A : 6 6 6 6 Thus the A beats the A and any Sixes, but is beaten by any Nine and by the A and A. With the exception of the matadors, the remaining cards (Eights, Tens, Jacks, Queens and Kings) are duds (wertlose Karten) and have no power except among cards of the same rank, where they beat each other in suit order. So, for example, a led 8 may be beaten by the 8 or 8, but not by any other dud. Sevens are free cards when led, i.e. they are unbeatable by any other card, even another Seven. Otherwise they are duds i.e. a Seven played by second, third or fourth hand is worthless. === Play === Players are dealt three cards each and the rest are placed face down to form the Haufen (stock). It is likely that play is clockwise and that forehand leads to the first trick, but Zahn is silent on these points. He does confirm that the trick winner leads to the next, and that players replenish their hand after each trick, the trick winner taking the top card from the stock and the others following in turn. If a player has the Toller Hund, he may say \"I dare\" (ich wage) as he plays it and his team earn a bonus if the dare is successful i.e. it is not beaten by Brusbart, but concede a bonus if it is 'whacked' (gekloppt) by Brusbart. Likewise Brusbart may be dared and is successful if not whacked by Spitzkopf. Daring is only legal if a) the next higher card has not already been played, b) the darer does not hold it, c) the darer is not fourth hand (i.e. last to play to the trick) and d) the Haufen is not exhausted. === Scoring === Scoring is recorded in the traditional way by chalking lines or strokes (Striche) on a slate. A team that takes at least five tricks chalks up 1 line. If they win the first five in a row, their opponents are 'licked' or 'thrashed' (gejaunt or gejannt) and the winners score 2 lines. A successful dare of the Toller Hund is worth 1 line and of Brusbart is worth 2 lines. If a dare fails, Zahn merely says that the points \"naturally fall to the other team\". Game is eight lines and the first to record that collects the winnings, either in money, Boltjes (\"sweets\") or the like. == Bruus (1911) == In 1911, a certain E. Schnack from the Anglian region of north Germany published an account of the game, now called Bruus for the first time. Apart from some different terminology, the main changes are that the Jacks replace the Sixes as counters and that double and triple tricks are introduced for the first time. === Cards === Schnack gives the nicknames of the matadors as Spitz (\"top\"), Bruus (\"grumbler\") and Duller Hund (\"mad dog\"). The remaining counters are the same as before, except that the Jacks now rank immediately below the Aces and the Sixes are not mentioned at all. So either the Sixes are duds or there are only 32 cards in the pack. The duds are known as 'Fosi' (Fosen, an historical Germanic tribe in the area of Lower Saxony) and now have no trick-taking power whatsoever, even among cards of the same rank. Meanwhile, the Sevens retain their unbeatability when led, but may now beat one another in the usual suit order: Clubs, Spades, Hearts and Diamonds. === Preliminaries === The 'tableau' used for scoring Players decide who will partner whom and the partners (Magger) in each team sit opposite one another. One player is nominated as the scribe and chalks up a 'tableau' on a slate consisting of six horizontal lines or strokes (Striche) divided in half by a vertical line. Each half represents the six lines that a team aims to erase first. The dealer now deals 3 cards, one by one, to each player and places the rest down as a Block (stock) in the middle of the table. === Play === Any card may be led to a trick and players may also follow with any card. The highest card wins the trick and the trick winner leads to the next. Beginning with the trick winner, players replenish their cards by drawing from the stock as many as they played to the trick. For the first time, a player may also lead two or three cards to a trick provided they are of the same rank e.g. two Aces or three Kings. As before, the three matadors have a special role in daring and 'tormenting', as it is now called: Bruus and Duller Hund may be 'dared' (gewagt), while Spitz and Bruus may 'torment' (plagen). Teams erase one line for a successful dare; two lines for a successful torment. Schnack says that up to four lines may be erased if the three cards are suitably distributed. Schnack tells us that \"it is this 'daring and tormenting' in particular that... gives the game a certain charm.\" === Scoring === Players combine their scores. The first team to take five tricks wins the deal and erases a line. If they take five tricks before their opponents get one, they may erase two lines. The first team to erase six lines wins the round and their opponents score a blob (Null) on the slate. Once a team has four blobs, the slate is wiped clean, the losers pay for the next round and scoring starts again. == Bruus (2020) == Schwesing, a small village near the North Sea fishing port of Husum, holds regular Bruus tournaments during the winter months. The game is usually played by four, but the rules mention the possibility of six players without, however, clarifying the changes needed to accommodate the extra players. There are always two teams and 36 cards are used (from Ace down to Six). Players agree who is to shuffle and deal first. === Cards === The matadors are as before, but this time the counters include both Jacks and Sixes as well as Nines and Aces. Thus the cards rank as follows: {| cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"float: left; background: #C0C0C0; margin-left: 1em; border-spacing: 1px;\" |- align=\"center\" | style=\"background: #c0c8f8; float:left\" colspan=\"3\" width=\"480\" |Card ranking in Bruus |- align=\"center\" | colspan=\"3\" | Matadors |- align=\"center\" | colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" | |- align=\"center\" | colspan=\"3\" | Beaters |- align=\"center\" | colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" | |- align=\"center\" | colspan=\"3\" | Free cards |- align=\"center\" | colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" | |- align=\"center\" | colspan=\"3\" | Duds |- align=\"center\" | colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" | |} The duds (Luschen) are worthless and have no ranking among themselves. Thus a dud which is led to a trick can only be beaten by a counter (i.e. at least 6), not by any other dud. The Sevens follow the 1885 rules, being unbeatable when led, except by a Seven of a higher suit, but otherwise worthless. === Play === Deal and play are clockwise. Each player is dealt three cards, either individually or en bloc, the dealer receiving his cards last. The cutter must examine the cut card and show it to the dealer; the dealer must complete the cut and examine the bottom card, showing it likewise to the cutter. If either card is a matador, the cards are reshuffled. Forehand (left of dealer) leads any card and subsequent players may, in turn, also play a card of their choice. Suit does not have to be followed. The highest card wins the trick and the trick winner draws a new card from the Stapel (stock), the other players replenishing their cards likewise and in turn. The trick winner leads to the next trick. ;Double and triple tricks If a player has two cards of the same value (2 x A, 2 x Q, etc.) they may be simultaneously led. A subsequent player must beat both in order to win the double trick, albeit not necessarily with cards of the same rank. If only one card can be beaten, it does not count. If a player has three equal-ranking cards, all three may be led even if the player is not on lead. In other words, if player A wins a trick and is on lead, but player B now has three 9s, B takes over the right to lead to the trick and plays his three cards. Unless another player can beat each 9 separately (which can only be done with the three matadors), B wins the triple trick. Beginning with the trick winner, players replenish their hands as many cards as were played i.e. the winner of a double trick draws the top 2 cards from the stock, followed by the others in turn. If there are not enough cards to do this, the players only take their share of the remaining stock. ;Daring and striking The feature of 'daring and tormenting' has been retained, but is now called 'daring and striking'. Only the Toller Hund and the Bruus may be dared (wagt). The Toller can be only be 'struck' (geschlagen) by Bruus and Bruus can only be struck by Spitz. Of course, if the Toller is dared, the trick can be won Spitz, but this is not considered a strike and so the dare stands. If the Toller is struck by Bruus, Bruus may be dared at the same time; this is known as schlagen und weiter wagen (\"strike and dare onwards\"). If Bruus is dared onwards and struck by Spitz, this is a 'counterstrike' (Generalschlag). Daring and striking are valid even if a Seven is led, but of course the trick is won by the Seven. Daring and striking are also possible in a double or triple trick and are scored regardless of who wins the trick. === Scoring === Each team aims to be first to take five tricks, each trick always comprising four cards. One player on each team collects the tricks for that team. Matchsticks are used for points, each team receiving one matchstick per point. Scoring is as follows: * Winning with five tricks \u2013 1 * Winning with five tricks to nil \u2013 2 * Successful dare of 8 or K \u2013 1 * Successful strike of 8 by K or of K by J \u2013 2 * Successful strike of 8 by K and onward dare of K \u2013 3 * Successful counterstrike of K by J after K has been dared onwards \u2013 4 Game is 12 matchsticks, even if this is achieved in the middle of a game by daring or striking. == Bruus (2020) - Treia variant == Men of the male voice choir playing Bruus after choir practice (March 2020). The M\u00e4nnergesangverein \"Frohsinn\" von 1881, a male voice choir in Treia in German Schleswig, who have played Bruus after choir practice since their formation in 1881, use slightly different rules. A 32-card Skat pack is used which means that there are no Sixes and only eight tricks per deal. The duds are known as Schiet or Schietkarten (worthless or 'rubbish' cards) and the stock is called the Bunk. Cards are always dealt in one packet of three. If both teams take four tricks, it is a Bock and the point is carried forward to the next deal. Matchsticks are used to keep score; teams start with ten and one is discarded for each point won. There are certain rituals, the infringement of which incurs a penalty. For example, the cutter must examine the bottom card of the cut and show it to an opponent; the dealer must look at the bottom of the pack and show it to an opponent. If either card is a matador, the pack is reshuffled. If either player forgets to check, he is fined a round of schnaps and the cards are reshuffled. If a team win 10 points while their opponents score nil or their score is only made up of bonuses for daring and striking, the winning team win double. == Footnotes == == References == == Literature == * _ (1800).
