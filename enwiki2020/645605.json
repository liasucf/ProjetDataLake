She began her career in farce comedy in the early 1890s and was such a hit singing the songs interpolated into plot that she quickly won fame, singing ragtime and dialect songs as a single. When she performed with the James and Bonnie Thornton troop, he coined her, \"The Southern Singer\". She married \"Mose\" Gumble, head of Remick Music Publishing in New York, in 1904, but divorced him in 1914. Gumble was a well known songwriter along with his brother, Albert, but is remembered today as the man who gave George Gershwin his first job plugging songs at Remick. According to the 1900 census, this well known marriage was preceded by a marriage to William A. Sims who served briefly as her manager. According to the New York Clipper she was granted a divorce from John Blanchard in early 1904. This was followed by her marriage to Gumble. Recent research into Pike County, Ohio census records indicate that Clarice's mother's name was Mary Vance, solving the riddle of her stage name. Her middle name was actually \"Etta\" not Ella. This was confirmed by Sterling Morris after obtaining a copy of the original notice in Variety of her marriage to Gumble in 1904. The New York Times archives reveal that Vance later married Phelps Decker, a screen scenario writer and for a short time, manager in the New York offices of Universal Pictures.
