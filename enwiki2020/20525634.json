    "text": "Thessalus of Tralles (fl. circa 70\u201395 AD) was a famous Roman physician and early adherent to the Methodic school of medicine.Bartlett, Elisha and Stempsey, William E. Elisha Bartlett's Philosophy of Medicine. Springer, 2005, , p. 223. [Notes] \"Thessalus of Tralles (fl. c. A.D. 70-95) was a prominent Roman physician and early advocate of methodism.\" He lived in Rome,Pliny, H. N. xxix. 5 where he was the court physician of Emperor Nero. It was here that he died and was buried, and his tomb was to be seen on the Via Appia.Galen, De Meth. Med., i. 2, vol. x He was from Tralles in Lydia. He was the son of a weaver, and followed the same employment himself in his youth. This, however, he soon gave up, and, though he had a poor general education, he embraced the medical profession, by which he acquired for a time a great reputation, and amassed a large fortune. He adopted the principles of the Methodic school, but modified and developed them. He appears to have exalted himself at the expense to his predecessors; asserting that none of them had contributed to the advance of medical science, and boasting that he himself could teach the art of healing in six months. Galen frequently mentions him, but always in terms of contempt,Galen, De Meth. Med., i. 1, etc. vol. x; Adv. Julian. c. 1, etc. vol. xviii. pt. i., etc. and is often abusive towards him. He supported a method of treatment that he named metasyncrisis.E. Weckowicz, Thaddeus E. and Liebel-Weckowicz, Helen P. A History of Great Ideas in Abnormal Psychology. Elsevier, 1990, , p. 30. \"Thessalus of Tralles (first century A.D.), was a court physician of Nero. He advocated a method of treatment which he called metasyncrisis. By means of some violent procedure a thorough commotion of the patient's fundamental constitution took place which led to the reestablishment of the equilibrium compatible with a state of health.\" His object was, in obstinate chronic cases, where other remedies failed, to attempt a thorough change in the fundamental constitution of the organism (syncrisis). He began by the application, for three days, of strong vegetable remedies, both internally and externally, together with which, a strict regimen and emetics were applied. This was the preparation to a system of fasting, which concluded with a course of restoratives.William Smith, (1870), Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, Volume 3, page 1102 Thessalus regarded the chicory plant to be an herb of the sun.Wood, Matthew. The Earthwise Herbal: A Complete Guide to Old World Medicinal Plants. North Atlantic Books, 2008, , p. 189. \"Cichorium intybus. Chicory. Chicory is a member of the family Asteraceae, distinguished by its rare blue flower. It was anciently used by the Greeks and Romans. Thessalus of Tralles (c. 50 CE) states that it is an herb of the sun; he reports learning his astrological medicine directly from the demigod Asclepius.\" He wrote several medical works, of which only the titles and a few sentences remain. ==References== Category:1st-century Romans Category:Ancient Roman physicians Category:1st-century physicians Category:People from Tralles ",
