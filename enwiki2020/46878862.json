Lake Coatepeque in the west of the country The San Miguel (volcano) during the eruption of December 29, 2013. Tourism accounts for a large part of El Salvador's economy. It offers many natural attractions including, beaches, a mild tropical climate and lush landscapes. It also offers an important archaeological and ecological heritage, with colonial and pre-Columbian vestiges, and national reserves. El Salvador also has an exceptional potential in the field of cultural tourism, with over 2,000 known archaeological sites, samples of Maya and Olmec cultures, mainly. They stand out for their importance the archaeological remains of the Pyramids of San Andr\u00e9s, Joya de Cer\u00e9n, Cihuat\u00e1n, Quelepa, Tazumal and Tehuac\u00e1n. While tourism is an activity that exploded few over the past two decades due to political instability in times of civil war, after the Peace Accords, signed in 1992, there were new expectations, although its development went slowly due to lack of infrastructure in rural areas of the country because the government of the day established other priorities in economic policy, as the maquila. A feature of the territory is that the extension is small. To El Salvador it is known as the country of the 40 minutes because from the capital it is accessed in that time to various tourist attractions: beaches along the south of the territory, mountains located west north and inland towns. El Salvador had the fourth place in the highest murder rate in the world and it kept growing until 2018. Nevertheless as of September 2019, after the first implementation of \"Plan Control Territorial\", which is a major government plan to reduce crime in El Salvador, murder rates have been substantially decreasing. == Volume of tourism == In 1994, the 181,000 tourists left the country 28.8 million dollars. Three years later was created a specialized governing body, called Salvadoran Tourism Corporation (Corporaci\u00f3n Salvadore\u00f1a de Turismo) (Corsatur), that year entered 387,000 visitors and 74.7 million of dollars. Since then, tourism has seen a significant increase over previous years. In 2004, the activity injected $424.7 million into the economy. It also created the Ministry of Tourism to direct the policy of the development of the sector. To promote the momentum of this activity, during 2005 has developed the Tourism Act (Ley del Turismo), which provides tax incentives for new investments in the sector. In 2008, 1.8 million tourists visited the country, generating the economy with about $720 million, according to the Ministry of Tourism. The growth no has been based on attracting tourism resort, but rather in the business and Salvadorans living in US returning to their country. Tourism contributed US$855.5 million to El Salvador's GDP in 2013. This represented 3.5% of total GDP. \"Travel and Tourism, Economic Impact 2014 - El Salvador\", World Travel and Tourism Council, 2014, p. 1. Tourism directly supported 80,500 jobs in 2013. This represented 3.1% of total employment in El Salvador. \"Travel and Tourism, Economic Impact 2014 - El Salvador\", World Travel and Tourism Council, 2014, p. 1. In 2013, tourism indirectly supported 210,000 jobs, representing 8.1% of total employment in El Salvador. \"Travel and Tourism, Economic Impact 2014 - El Salvador\", World Travel and Tourism Council, 2014, p. 1. It was estimated that 1,394,000 international tourists would visit El Salvador in 2014. \"Travel and Tourism, Economic Impact 2014 - El Salvador\", World Travel and Tourism Council, 2014, p. 5. Despite advances, in Central America it is one of the country marching ahead of other established destinations such as Costa Rica and Guatemala. The lack of promotion abroad and adequate infrastructure to host international tourism are some of the most cited problems. The pros are the substantial improvement of road infrastructure, the remodeling of El Salvador International Airport in Comalapa, southeast of San Salvador. The airport serving international flights in El Salvador is Comalapa International Airport. ==Historical Monuments== Santa Ana, in 2012 ===National Palace=== At times of the government of Captain General Gerardo Barrios did the idea of a National Palace, whose construction was carried out in 1866 to 1870, by Don Idelfonso Mar\u00edn and Jos\u00e9 Dolores Melara; However, on 19 November 1889 a fire reduced it to rubble. The current National Palace was designed by the engineer Jos\u00e9 Emilio Alcaine and constructed in 1905 to 1911 under the direction of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Peralta Lagos; as foreman served Don Pascasio Gonz\u00e1lez and construction materials were imported from Germany, Belgium, Italy and other countries. On 13 December 1974, by legislative decree 165, it declared a national monument the Blue Room (Sal\u00f3n Azul) and the adjacent rooms and 10 July 1980, the Revolutionary Council of the Government, by Decree No. 116, declares the National Palace as \"National Monument\". It has four main halls in colors red, blue, yellow, pink, and 101 secondary rooms. ===The Monument of Christopher Columbus and Queen Isabella=== Both monuments are located side of the entrance of the main gate of the National Palace on Cuscatl\u00e1n Avenue. They were unveiled on 12 October 1924 to place the 432\u00ba anniversary of the discovery of America. Both monuments were donated to the Salvadoran people by the King of Spain, Alfonso XIII, and officially handed over to the Government of El Salvador, during the administration of President Dr. Alfonso Qui\u00f1\u00f3nez Molina. ===Casa de las Academias=== The former Casa Due\u00f1as, owned of Due\u00f1as family, was unoccupied for years. Then, in 1930 and 1933 was leased by the Legation of Mexico (at that time were not Embassies). From 1935 to 1957 the Legation of the United States rented the house for residence of the plenipotentiary ministers. And they lived there six American representatives diplomats, with occasional guests such as former presidents Richard Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson and Senator Robert F. Kennedy and film artists Clark Gable and Tony Curtis. ==Beaches== La Libertad. El Salvador also provides a supply of sun and beach. One of the most visited by tourists are those of La Libertad, in the central region of the country. There are a number of beaches and a variety of hotels and restaurants. Beaches like El Tunco or El Sunzal are used for surfing. Some Europeans and Americans have visited for the Salvadoran waves, ranked among the best in the world for surfing. In the Salvadoran beaches it can fish, surf, or just sunbathing. The entire coast of the country has many beaches, from Ahuachap\u00e1n to La Uni\u00f3n. The hotels offer are still under development, but in 2005 there have been several investments in the field of beach resorts. Casa de Mar, in El Sunzal; Pacific Sunrise, in La Libertad; Las Hojas, in Las Hojas Beach; Club Joya del Pac\u00edfico, on the Costa del Sol are already in operation. The 'Royal Decameron' international hotel chain opened a modern, huge project of hotel in Salinitas Beach, which operates with the concept of all-incorporated. Also, local investors are planning to develop more the Costa del Sol and the Jiquilisco Bay. The latter site, located at Usulut\u00e1n, is one of the most heavenly attractions in the country for its natural diversity. ==Environmental aspects== View of the mountain Apaneca-Ilamatepec. Izalco (volcano), \"The Lighthouse of the Pacific\". View from the town of Perqu\u00edn in the department of Moraz\u00e1n. However, in recent decades, biodiversity and ecological balance of the country have suffered the harsh impact of urban planning and the pollution; the increasing concentration of population in urban areas has led to an increased bonding of the population in the South and Southwest regions of the country (especially in the Metropolitan Area of San Salvador). These areas are a fragile ecosystem, because in them are channeled and feed the aquifers of the southern corridor of the country, limiting the ability of water from underground sources. The main causes of pollution and environmental pollution in El Salvador are mainly transport, industry, field burning and incineration of solid waste (about half of the waste generated in the metropolitan area of San Salvador no is recycled). To this it must add that the vast majority of households use firewood for cooking. However, El Salvador still it has a large number of animal and plant species over other neighboring countries. However, the country can not relax in the task of recovery and conservation of the last natural areas, and project to create, in cooperation with the countries of the region, a biological corridor that maintains stable populations of endangered species. ==Ecotourism== Torogoz, national bird of El Salvador.
