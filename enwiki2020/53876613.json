It has been described as a salad dish per the vegetables that accompany the dish, and as possessing the flavors of saltiness per the shrimp paste, sweetness per the fruits, and spiciness, per the chili peppers. Outside Thailand, the Filipino Bagoong fried rice can be considered a comparable equivalent to this dish. ==History== Khao khluk kapi's recipe was adapted from an original Mon dish during the time of King Rama II. It originated in Central Thailand (historical Mon settlement region), and is typically served as a lunch dish in Thailand. Foreign visitors to Thailand may not be aware of the dish's existence. ==See also== * List of Thai dishes * List of rice dishes ==References== Category:Rice dishes Category:Thai cuisine ",
