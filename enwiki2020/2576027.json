    "text": "2002 Euler is a stony background asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 29 August 1973, by Russian astronomer Tamara Smirnova at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in Nauchnyj, and assigned the prov. designation . It was named after Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler. == Orbit and characterization == Euler is a non- family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.3\u20132.6 AU once every 3 years and 9 months (1,373 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an inclination of 9\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. == Naming == This minor planet was named after Swiss mathematician, physicist and astronomer Leonhard Euler (1707\u20131783). His contributions to astronomy included two theories for the motion of the Moon. Euler spent much of his time in St. Petersburg and was associated with the Russian Academy of Sciences. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 15 October 1977 (). == Physical characteristics == === Diameter and albedo === According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Euler measures between 14.49 and 19.773 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.0416 and 0.0839. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts Petr Pravec's revised WISE-data, that is, an albedo of 0.0375 and a diameter of 19.78 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 12.7. == References == == External links == * Lightcurve Database Query (LCDB), at www.minorplanet.info * Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books * Asteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR \u2013 Geneva Observatory, Raoul Behrend * Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (1)-(5000) \u2013 Minor Planet Center * * 002002 Category:Discoveries by Tamara Mikhaylovna Smirnova Category:Minor planets named for people Category:Named minor planets Category:Leonhard Euler 19730829 ",
