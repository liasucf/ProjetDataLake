    "text": "At the Cafe Bohemia, Vol. 1 is a live album by the Jazz Messengers for Blue Note Records. It featured the original incarnation of the Jazz Messengers, Art Blakey's career-spanning band, and is the first of two volumes recorded on November 23, 1955 at Caf\u00e9 Bohemia, a famous night club in Greenwich Village in New York. With the July 31, 2001 CD re-issue, three additional tracks from this night were added: \"Lady Bird\", \"Deciphering the Message\", and \"What's New?\". ==Reception== This album, which sees the first version of The Jazz Messengers on record, was noted as not \"match[ing] the intensity which the quintet secured at Birdland.\" Tenor saxophonist Hank Mobley, in particular, is noted as \"a somewhat unfocused stylist.\" However, trumpeter Kenny Dorham is seen as an \"elusive brilliance [that] was seldom so extensively captured\" and the playing in general \"is just as absorbing\" as the Birdland albums and is \"still timeless music.\" ==Track listing== # Announcement by Art Blakey 1:32 # \"Soft Winds\" 12:34 # \"The Theme\" 6:11 # \"Minor's Holiday\" 9:11 # \"Alone Together\" 4:15 # \"Prince Albert\" 8:51 # \"Lady Bird\" (reissue bonus track) 7:30 # \"What's New?\" (reissue bonus track) 4:31 # \"Deciphering the Message\" (reissue bonus track) 10:13 ==Personnel== *Art Blakey \u2014 drums *Kenny Dorham \u2014 trumpet *Hank Mobley \u2014 tenor saxophone *Horace Silver \u2014 piano *Doug Watkins \u2014 bass Production *Bob Bluementhal, Leonard Feather \u2014 liner notes *Michael Cuscuna \u2014 reissue producer *John Hermansader \u2014 cover design *Alfred Lion \u2014 producer *Rudy Van Gelder \u2014 digital remastering *Francis Wolff \u2014 photography ==References== Category:Albums produced by Alfred Lion Category:Albums produced by Michael Cuscuna Category:Art Blakey live albums Category:The Jazz Messengers live albums Category:1956 live albums Category:Blue Note Records live albums Category:Albums recorded at the Caf\u00e9 Bohemia ",
