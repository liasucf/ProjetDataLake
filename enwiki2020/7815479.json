The lake's southern end is surrounded by the Willoughby State Forest. This state forest includes Mount Pisgah, Mount Hor, collectively \"Willoughby Gap\". The lake is about long In 2010, Yankee magazine named Willoughby as the third best lake in New England. Willoughby Lake has a public beach that stretches on the north shore of the lake, or in the zone of the lake outlet. Another public beach is located at the bottom of the South Bay of the Lake. The village of Westmore is located on the east side, at the confluence area of Mill Creek which drains the waters of Long Pond. Many cottages and houses are located on North-East bank of the lake. == Hydrology == The lake is known for its clarity and chilly temperature. Because of its depth, the surface of the lake freezes later than other lakes in the Northeast Kingdom. ==Watershed== Willoughby Lake is part of the Saint-Fran\u00e7ois River watershed, its waters eventually reaching the St. Lawrence River in Canada. Willoughby River is the outlet from the lake and runs north through Brownington to feed into the Barton River. The Barton River is tributary to Lake Memphremagog and thence to the Magog River, then the Saint-Fran\u00e7ois River, then the St. Lawrence River, and ultimately to the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Prior to the floods of 1927, the river had three dams. All were destroyed by the flood. An iron bridge that ran from Evansville to Brownington Center was destroyed and rebuilt.Northland Journal, November 2008, page 13, \"The Flood of 1927,\" Ralph Swett A dam where the Whetstone Dam had formerly stood, was rebuilt to run a sawmill, which was still in operation in 2008. The \"state Fish and Game Department\" bought the dam rights to allow rainbow trout to swim upriver. == Geology == A view from the north end of the lake shows Mount Pisgah (left) and Mount Hor rising up above the surface. Lake Willoughby is a southeast trending basin. Willoughby is a glacial lake over deep in places, the deepest lake entirely contained in the state and second to only Lake Champlain whose deepest point reaches . Lake Willoughby resembles a Norwegian fjord. The rock between Mount Pisgah on the east and Mount Hor on the west was eroded by a valley ice lobe. This ice flow cut across the Willoughby granodiorite and adjacent metamorphic rocks. The ice flow may have exploited highly fractured bedrock along the margin of the Willoughby pluton or joint surfaces within the pluton. Other mountains in territory of Westmore, Vermont are on: * East bank: Mount Hedgehog (Vermont) (high: ), Mount Goodwin (Vermont) (high: ), Mount Bald (Vermont) (high: ), Mount Heystack (Vermont) (high: ) and Mount McSherry (Vermont) (high: ); * West bank: Mount Wheeler (Vermont) (high: ) in Caledonia County, Mount Valley (Vermont) (high: ), Mount May Pond (Vermont) (high: ); * South bank: Mount Bartlett (Vermont) (high: ) in Caledonia County. == Natural history == Willoughby is listed as a National Natural Landmark. Willoughby contains rainbow trout (wild and stocked), Lake Trout, landlocked Atlantic salmon (mainly stocked), rainbow smelt, burbot, yellow perch, longnose sucker, white sucker, lake chub, common shiner, and round whitefish which is a native species of extremely limited distribution in Vermont. Steelhead trout (rainbow trout) are not native to the region, but were imported to Lake Memphremagog from the Pacific Northwest. They migrate up the Barton River and Willoughby River to the lake to spawn. The sheer cliffs of Mount Pisgah and Mount Hor provide an environment conducive for arctic and cliff-alpine plants, as well as ideal nesting areas for the rare peregrine falcon. More than 100 bird species have been recorded around the lake including thrushes, warblers, hummingbirds, jays, finches, loons, herons and gulls.Willoughvalle.com Spring, Summer and Fall Recreation ==History== Tiny steam boats operated on the lake for tourists from 1884 to the early 1900s when steam was replaced by the gasoline engine.

It is also called Devil's Rock because when reflected in still water, the image of a skull lying on its side can be seen.
