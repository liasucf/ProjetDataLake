    "text": "Thomas James (c. 1573 \u2013 August 1629) was an English librarian and Anglican clergyman, the first librarian of the Bodleian Library, Oxford. ==Life== He was born about 1573 at Newport, Isle of Wight. In 1586 he was admitted a scholar of Winchester College and matriculated at New College, Oxford on 28 January 1592. He then graduated B.A. on 3 May 1595, M.A. on 5 February 1599, and B.D. and D.D. on 16 May 1614. James became a fellow of New College in 1593, where he served until 1602. In that year, his wide knowledge of books, together with his skill in deciphering manuscripts and detecting literary forgeries, secured him the post of librarian to the library newly founded by Sir Thomas Bodley at Oxford.Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Eleventh edition, a publication now in the public domain, accessed September 2009 At the same time, he was made rector of St Aldate's Church, Oxford. In 1605, he compiled a classified catalogue of the books in the Bodleian Library, but in 1620 substituted for it an alphabetical catalogue. The arrangement in 1610, whereby the Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers (Stationers' Company) undertook to supply the Bodleian with a copy of every book published, was James's suggestion. He assisted in framing a complete body of the ancient statutes and customs of the university. He was also skilled in deciphering manuscripts and in detecting forged readings. He obtained leave to examine the manuscripts in the college libraries at Oxford, and was allowed by easy-going heads of houses (particularly those of Balliol and Merton) to take away several, chiefly patristic, which he gave in 1601 to the Bodleian Library, together with sixty printed volumes. Bodley had fixed upon James as his library keeper, and the appointment was confirmed by the university in 1602. His salary as librarian was initially \u00a322 13s. 4d. annually, but he threatened forthwith to resign unless it was raised to \u00a330 or \u00a340 a year. James made it clear he would leave the library if his compensation was not increased, so Bodley raised the salary by 4 pounds per year. This eventually led to a compensation of 40 pounds per year after 1611. On 14 September 1602 he also became rector of St. Aldate, Oxford. 18 October of that same year, James married his wife, Ann Underhill. Both of these actions, taking place just two months before the library's opening, were in direct opposition to qualifications outlined by Bodley for his librarian. Bodley, who had not been a churchgoer or the marrying type, wanted his librarian to be completely concentrated on the library. Eventually, however, Bodley approved of James's choices. In December 1610 the library began to receive copies of all works published by the members of the Stationers' Company, under an agreement made with them by Bodley at the suggestion of James. In 1614 James, through Bodley's interest, was preferred to the sub-deanery of Wells, and in 1617 he became rector of Mongeham, Kent.There are two places in Kent called Mongeham. The likelier of the two would seem to be Little Mongeham, because the DNB records that Thomas' nephew Richard James was \"presented to the sinecure living\" of that place in 1629. At the beginning of May 1620 he was obliged through ill-health to resign the librarianship. At the convocation held with the parliament at Oxford in 1625 he moved that certain scholars be commissioned to peruse the patristic manuscripts in all public and private English libraries to detect forgeries introduced by Roman Catholic editors. His proposal not meeting with much encouragement, he set about the task himself. Ill health compelled him to resign his post in 1620, he died at Oxford in August 1629, and was buried in New College Chapel. ==Works== His first attempts at authorship were translations from the Italian of Antonio Brucioli's 'Commentary upon the Canticle of Canticles,' which was licensed for the press in November 1597, and from the French of Guillaume du Vair The Moral Philosophy of the Stoicks, London, 1598. He next edited Richard de Bury's The Philobiblon, Oxford, 1599, which he dedicated to Sir Thomas Bodley. In this dedication, James praised Bodley and his colleagues for their efforts in reestablishing the Oxford library, though there was never any indication of his future role as librarian. As the result of his researches in college libraries he published 'Ecloga Oxonio-Cantabrigiensis, tributa in libros duos,' London, 1600, a work commended by Joseph Scaliger. It gives a list of the manuscripts in the college libraries at Oxford and Cambridge, and in the university library at Cambridge, besides critical notes on the text of Cyprian's 'De Unitate Ecclesi\u00e6' and of Augustine of Hippo's De fide. The \"Index Alphabeticus\" the first catalog compiled by James, which consisted of 8,700 entries, appeared in July 1605. It was dedicated to Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, at the suggestion of Bodley (who thought that 'more reward was to be gained from the prince than from the king'). It includes both printed books and manuscripts, arranged alphabetically under the four classes of theology, medicine, law, and arts. A continuation of this classified index, embracing writers on arts and sciences, geography and history, is to be found in Rawlinson MS. Miscell. 730, drawn up by James after quitting the library. An alphabetical catalogue prepared by him in 1613 was not printed, but remained in the library. A second edition of the catalogue appeared in 1620. It abandoned the classified arrangement of the former catalogue, and adopts only one alphabet of names. There was also issued in 1635 'Catalogus Interpretum S. Scriptur\u00e6 juxta numerorum ordinem qui extant in Bibliotheca Bodleiana olim a D. Jamesio \u2026 concinnatus, nunc vero altera fere parte auctior redditus. \u2026 Editio correcta,' Oxford. In 1604, Bodley noted some errors James had made in cataloguing the Hebrew manuscripts, suggesting that James should check with scholars fluent in Hebrew. Before 1611, James was on a committee working on the Authorised Version of the Bible. James's other works are: * \u2018Bellum Papale, sive Concordia discors Sixti Quinti & Clementis Octavi circa Hieronymianam Editionem,\u2019 London, 1600; 1678. * \u2018Concordanti\u00e6 sanctorum Patrum, i.e. vera & pia Libri Canticorum per Patres universos, tam Gr\u00e6cos quam Latinos, Expositio,\u2019 Oxford, 1607. * \u2018An Apologie for John Wickliffe, shewing his Conformitie with the now Church of England,\u2019 Oxford, 1608; in answer to Robert Parsons and others. * 'Bellum Gregorianum, sive Corruptionis Roman\u00e6 in Operibus D.

James is said to have been the 'Catholike Divine' who edited, with preface and notes in English, the tract entitled 'Fiscus Papalis; sive, Catalogus Indulgentiarum & Reliquiarum septem principalium Ecclesiarum urbis Rom\u00e6 ex vetusto Manuscripto Codice descriptus,' London, 1617; another edition, 1621, was accompanied by the English version of William Crashaw. In 1608 James edited John Wycliffe's 'Two short Treatises against the Orders of the Begging Friars.' Four of his manuscripts are in Lambeth Palace Library: #'Brevis Admonitio ad Theologos Protestantes de Libris Pontificorum caute, pie, ac sobrie habendis, legendis, emendis,' &c.; #'Enchiridion Theologicum, seu Chronologia Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum, ordine alphabetico,' &c.; #'Suspicionum et Conjecturarum liber primus, in quo ducenta ad minus loca SS. Patrum in dubium vocata, dubitandi Rationes, Rationum Summ\u00e6 perspicue continentur.' #'Breviarium Episcoporum totius Angli\u00e6, seu nomina, successio, et chronologia eorundem ad sua usque tempora.' In the Bodleian Library (Bodl. MS. 662) is his 'Tomus primus Animadversionum in Patres, Latin\u00e6que Ecclesi\u00e6 Doctores primarios.' Two letters from James to Sir Robert Bruce Cotton, dated 1625 and 1628, are preserved in Cotton. MS. Julius C. iii., ff. 159, 183. Bodley's letters to James are in 'Reliqui\u00e6 Bodleian\u00e6,' published by Thomas Hearne, from Bodleian MS. 699, in 1703. ==References== Category:1570s births Category:1629 deaths Category:Bodley's Librarians Category:English librarians Category:Alumni of New College, Oxford Category:People educated at Winchester College Category:Fellows of New College, Oxford Category:People from Newport, Isle of Wight Category:16th-century English educators Category:17th-century English people ",
