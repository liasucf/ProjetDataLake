He was a leading figure of anarchism in Spain. == Career == Juan Garc\u00eda Oliver was born in 1901. He apprenticed as a cook and in 1919, assisted in the formation of the waiters' union, affiliated with the Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). Garc\u00eda Oliver later organized workers in Reus, led the CNT's provincial committee, was jailed during a strike action, and joined the armed-struggle group Los Solidarios. During the Spanish Restoration, Garc\u00eda Oliver worked as a polisher in France, where he unsuccessfully plotted to kill King Alfonso XIII and Benito Mussolini. He was jailed upon his reentry to Spain in 1926 but was released with the coming of the Second Spanish Republic in 1931. As a leading insurrectionist in the period, he joined the Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica, advocated for full revolution with the CNT, and fought in the streets of Barcelona. Garc\u00eda Oliver came to lead the militias. In 1936, he became the defense minister of the Generalitat de Catalunya and the justice minister in the Francisco Largo Caballero administration. Garc\u00eda Oliver destroyed the archives of convicts and worked to curtail terrorism. During the May Days, he encouraged the CNT fighters to disarm. Garc\u00eda Oliver reluctantly subordinated the goal of revolution to win the civil war, but after Catalonia fell in 1939, he would remain in exile for the rest of his life, first in France, then Sweden, and finally Mexico. He continued to argue for unity for the rest of his life. In 1978, two years before his death, Garc\u00eda Oliver published his autobiography, El eco de los pasos. == References == == Further reading == * My Revolutionary Life: Juan Garcia Oliver interviewed by Freddy Gomez (Translated by Paul Sharkey) (2008), Anarchist Library series #19, Kate Sharpley Library, . * Category:1901 births Category:1980 deaths Category:People from Reus Category:Catalan anarchists Category:Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo members Category:Justice ministers of Spain Category:Spanish people of the Spanish Civil War (Republican faction) Category:Anarcho-syndicalists Category:Spanish revolutionaries Category:Spanish anarchists ",
