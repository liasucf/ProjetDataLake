After completing his studies, he began his career at the MIT Sloan School of Management as an assistant professor (2002\u201305). In 2005, Doyle became the Jon D.

Key findings of his research include the following: * Children in the U.S. on the margin of being placed in foster care (e.g. in cases where the recommendations of child protection investigators disagree) are on average better off if they remain at home, especially for older children. * Juvenile incarceration in the U.S. decreases the likelihood of incarcerated individuals completing high school and increases the likelihood of adult (re-)incarceration. * Children in the U.S. on the margin of placement in foster care are two to three times more likely to enter the criminal justice system as adults if they were placed in foster care, a situation that is disproportionately common for African Americans, girls and young adolescents. In particular, Doyle's research with Douglas Almond, Heidi Williams and Amanda E. Kowalski on the marginal returns of medical care for at-risk newborns was awarded the Garfield Economic Impact Award by Research!America in 2011.Research!America (December 8th, 2011). Authors of Landmark Study on Economic Benefits of Advanced Medical Care for At-Risk Newborns Receive Garfield Economic Impact Award. Retrieved on February 19th, 2018. The study showed that medical care prescribed as a result of newborns being slightly below the critical birthweight threshold of 1,500 grams was effective in substantially decreasing the mortality of these newborns relative to newborns slightly above the threshold. The authors then use the cost of the decrease in mortality rates for these newborns to estimate the cost for saving a newborn's statistical life to be about $550,000 in 2006 US$, i.e. well below common estimates of the value of a full statistical life. == References == == External links == * Webpage of Joseph Doyle at MIT Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Health economists Category:American economists Category:MIT Sloan School of Management faculty Category:Cornell University alumni Category:University of Chicago alumni ",
