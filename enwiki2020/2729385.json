Carss Park is part of the St George area. ==Location== Carss Park is a picturesque suburb around Carss Point, overlooking Kogarah Bay on the Georges River. The suburb is surrounded by the suburbs of Kogarah Bay, Allawah, South Hurstville and Blakehurst. Carss Park is a mostly residential area featuring some valuable real estate with water views and bushland surrounds. ==History== The area was purchased from the Crown on 28 January 1853 by Jonathan Croft for A\u00a3123. It changed hands several times before being acquired in 1863 by William Carss, a cabinet-maker, who called his property Carss Bush. He built a stone cottage in the 1860s called Carss Park Cottage. After William Carss died, his family continued to live in the house, including daughter Mary Carss. William had left the estate to the trustees of the Sailor Home in Sydney. When Mary died this clause in her father\u2019s will was honoured and the estate passed to the trustees in 1916. In 1921 the Blakehurst Progress Association made attempts to secure Carss Bush for a public park and Kogarah council was able to acquire the land for the people. Carss Bush Park was dedicated on 26 January 1924 and 150 lots were auctioned on the same day for development. Many of the streets on the new estate were named after Aboriginal tribes.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 53 == Heritage listings == Carss Park has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 74 Carwar Avenue: Carss Cottage ==Commercial area== A small shopping strip is located on the Carwar Avenue near the intersection with the Princes Highway, containing a bottleshop, chemist, hairdresser, newsagent, petrol station and supermarket.
