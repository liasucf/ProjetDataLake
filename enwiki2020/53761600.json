This led to members of the group starting the Imperial College A Cappella SocietyImperial College A Cappella Society of which The Techtonics would be part of, with the wider aim of making the activity of A Cappella open to all ICU members and to promote other groups to form. Societies at Imperial are able to purchase pewter tankards for their society, and get them engraved with leading members - however due to the historical independence of The Techtonics (existing before the a cappella society), both a tankard for The Techtonics and Imperial A Cappella Society reside in the Union bar.Imperial College Union Tankards As of 2016, 5 established groups are recorded as being within the society, making it one of the largest university a cappella societies in the UK: * The Techtonics * The Imperielles (all-female, formed in 2011) * The Scopes (mixed, formed in 2011) * Take Note (all-female, barbershop style) * Surcery (mixed, fusion style) The Techtonics perform with the other a cappella groups at Imperial frequently, singing alongside them in Christmas concerts, Easter concerts, and a number of times at the annual Imperial Summer Ball. == References == Category:Collegiate a cappella groups Category:Clubs and societies of Imperial College London Category:Musical groups established in 2008 ",
