In 2009 they changed their name to St Andrews, and then to Hull United in 2014, when the club was rebranded after Jamie Waltham and ex-pro Jamie Barnwell-Edinboro joined up with John Duffill and Kenny Sayers, adopting a new nickname (\"the Citizens\") and changing their kit colours to black and white, echoing Hull City's original kit.'I'll pay you to come and watch my new football team' \u2013 Hull United AFC chairman Jamie Waltham Hull Daily Mail, 20 August 2014 Originally based at East Mount Recreation Centre, following their re-branding as Hull United the club moved to Dene Park, located in the village of Dunswell on the northern outskirts of Hull. The ground was originally the home of fellow Northern Counties East League side Hall Road Rangers F.C., who continued to share the ground with United before relocating to Haworth Park ahead of the 2015/16 season. On 15 August 2015 the club renamed the ground the \"Breathe for Cameron Stadium\" after local child, Cameron Good, who had died due to asthmatic complications during a football match he was involved in. In January 2015 the club appointed Curtis Woodhouse as manager, replacing chairman/first team manager Jamie Waltham, with fellow ex-Hull City teammate Ian Ashbee also joining as his assistant.Former Hull City man Curtis Woodhouse named as new Hull United manager Hull Daily Mail, 13 January 2015 One of the club's biggest matches came in March 2015 when they played Hull City Under-21s in the East Riding Senior Cup, beating them 3\u20132.Hull United 3 Hull City 2: Tigers dumped out ERCFA Cup by Citizens Hull Daily Mail, 24 March 2015 Following this win, they progressed to the final where they met Bridlington Town at the KC Stadium with Bridlington eventually winning 4\u20132.

The next game resulted in a 1\u20130 defeat at Teversal F.C. in the League Cup. However, they returned to league action with a 3\u20130 win over Dronfield Town F.C. a few days later, their first home game of the season, which attracted a crowd of 617. They kept up their good league form for the rest of the month, recording wins against Penistone, Westella VIP and a 7\u20130 thrashing of Grimsby Borough, as well as a draw at Hemsworth. This good run of form continued into September as they beat A.F.C. Emley and lead Glasshoughton Welfare before the game was abandoned early in the second half due to floodlight failure. A few days later they travelled to Selby Town and won 3\u20131, which meant after 8 games United sat 3 points clear at the top of the league and remained unbeaten. On 30 September 2015 it was revealed founder of the club and former chairman, Jamie Waltham would no longer be working with the club.'No longer wanted': Jamie Waltham shocked by Hull United exit Hull Daily Mail, 30 September 2015 Following this, their game against A.F.C. Mansfield was postponed due to being locked out of Dene Park by Jamie Waltham after he and the club were unable to agree on a lease to play there. This prompted the club to find another home. On 21 October the new ground was revealed to be the KC Lightstream Stadium, home of Hull Kingston Rovers. United started life at their new home with a 2\u20131 victory over Bottesford Town F.C. in the re-arranged fixture from earlier in the season. The game attracted a crowd of 431. 1 December saw the first competitive local derby against city rivals Hall Road Rangers, nicknamed the 'Hull Clasico'. The match ended 1\u20130 to United after a winning goal scored in the last seconds of the game. On 21 December it was announced that Gary Bradshaw had signed for the club from nearby Scarborough Athletic. His debut came in the second Hull derby against Hall Road on Boxing Day at Haworth Park, however the game ended in defeat for United after another winner in the dying seconds of the game, this time for Hall Road as it ended 2\u20131. They started 2016 with a 2\u20131 win against Winterton at the KC Lightstream Stadium, with Gary Bradshaw also getting his first goal for the club. This was to be their last game here as on 13 January the club announced it would no longer be playing at the stadium due to being unable to afford the match day running costs. On 15 January former North Ferriby captain and Scarborough Athletic Player/Manager Paul Foot signed for the club, joining up with fellow ex Ferriby legend Gary Bradshaw once more. It was revealed on 22 January that the club had made a request to groundshare with Brigg Town, however this was rejected by the league, meaning United would have to play their remaining games away until the end of the season or until a suitable ground could be found. Following this they were deducted 3 points after fielding a suspended player against Hallam F.C. earlier in the season, a game they won 2-0. They played their first game in a month on 2 February, after four games in January were postponed, beating Grimsby Borough 2-1 away, with Paul Foot scoring on his debut. The following game took place almost two weeks later on 13 February and saw them face North Ferriby in the East Riding Senior Cup for the first ever time. The game was played at South Hunsley School in Melton, just outside of Hull, and ended 2-1 to Ferriby, who fielded a reserve side, knocking United out of the cup. On 31 March manager Curtis Woodhouse left the club but was persuaded to re-join until the end of the season just a couple of days later, with Paul Foot taking charge of the game he missed.http://www.hullunitedafc.com/news/hull-united-afc-manager-curtis- woodhouse-has-stepped-down-with-immediate-effect Hull United AFC manager Curtis Woodhouse has stepped down with immediate effect It was also confirmed on the club website that they had acquired a 10-year lease of the old Endeavour School sports centre, as part of their recently formed partnership with Hull College, starting from the 2016/17 season. As United were hit hard by an 18-point deduction for three instances of player irregularities and an inability to obtain a ground/ground-share agreement for next season by 31 March deadline, on 21 April the Northern Counties East League decided to relegate them to a lower league designated by the FA as they have not \"received a grading certificate by 31st March and not having an alternative proposal approved at the relevant Board Meeting\" and as a consequence for this failure. Eight days later Craig Tock was introduced as the club's new chief executive officer, replacing John Duffill. After a statement was released from the club, it was revealed they will be participating in the Humber Premier League Division one from the 2016/17 season, with Ian Ashbee leaving his role as chairman and Curtis Woodhouse resigning as first team manager.http://www.hullunitedafc.com/news/hull-united-afc-club-statement On 5 July 2016 Hull United appointed Ashley Moon as the new Chairman and John Duffill as the Vice Chairman.http://www.hullunitedafc.com/news/hull-united- afc-have-appointed-ashley-moon-as-our-new-chairman ===Humber Premier League=== After leaving the NCEL they were placed in Division One of the Humber Premier League, two leagues below. 2016/17 proved to be a difficult season for United after starting again with virtually no players, however they managed to finish 2nd from bottom, one point above Hessle Sporting. The 2017/18 season saw an upturn in the Citizens' fortunes, after acquiring a number of players and staff from Hanson Jewellers who played the previous season in the league above, as well as several players returning from previous successful seasons for United. Positive results which started off the season continued throughout the campaign, keeping then in promotion contention, and also saw a good cup run in which they reached the semi-final of the Humber Premier League Cup against Pocklington, which they lost 2-0. They achieved promotion after finishing 2nd place. 2018/19 saw the team competing in the Humber Premier League Premier Division once again, but it was a difficult start for them as they won only one of their opening 7 games, drawing one and losing 5. However, after a couple of experienced additions to the squad they managed to turn things around. They finished the season in a very respectable 5th position, however their main success came in the Humber Premier League cup, winning the final on penalties after holding Chalk Lane to a draw in normal time, with Chalk Lane hoping to win the league and cup double for a second season in a row. This was United's second cup win since their rebrand in 2014, after winning it in their first season in 2014/15. They also reached the quarter final of the East Riding Senior Cup once again playing Chalk Lane but lost 2-1. The following season 2019/20 brought a rather mixed campaign in terms on league form, with lack of consistency being a big problem. Once again there were impressive cup runs though, in both the East Riding Senior Cup, with wins against East Hull and Hemingborough setting up a semi-final tie against North Ferriby F.C., and the Whitehead's Cup where they were unable to retain the trophy after a semi-final defeat against Pocklington. The season was declared null and void in March 2020, along with all other non-league football from step 7 down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Players== ===Current squad=== ===Notable players=== Former professionals to have played for the club include:Hull United likely to step up to NCEL Division One Hull Daily Mail, 11 March 2015 *Danny Clarke *Ian Ashbee *Lawrie Dudfield *Mark Greaves *Martin Foster *Matty Plummer *Gary Bradshaw *Paul Foot *Francesco Carrera ==Non- playing staff== Chairman: Ciar\u00e1n Phipps Chief Executive Officer: Lewis Poucher Secretary: Steve White Press Officer: John Duffill Director of Football: Paul Goldie Manager: John Duffill Assistant Manager: Steve White Coach: Ben Kinsley GK Coach: Dave Goldsmith Youth Football Officer (U'13's - U'18's: Kenny Sayers) Women's Team Manager: Kev Drewry Women's Team Assistant Manager: Mel Marsden Physio: Men's Team Captain: Lewis Poucher Woman's Team Captain: Amy Thompson ==Women's Team== On the 8th of June 2020, Hull United's social media accounts announced that the team would be setting up a women's team at level 6 in the pyramid, meaning that they'd be able to compete in the Women's FA Cup. ==Honours== ===League=== * Humber Premier League ** Runners-up (1): 2014\u201315 * Humber Premier League Division One ** Runners-up (1): 2017\u201318 ===Cup=== * Humber Premier League Cup ** Winners (1): 2014\u201315, 2018\u201319 * East Riding Senior Cup ** Runners-up (1): 2014\u201315 ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Football clubs in England Category:Football clubs in the East Riding of Yorkshire Category:Association football clubs established in 2005 Category:2005 establishments in England Category:Sport in Kingston upon Hull Category:Humber Premier League Category:Northern Counties East Football League ",
