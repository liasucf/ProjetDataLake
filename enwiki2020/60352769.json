He is active as a social media personality and has released a number of albums. ==Music career== Calhoun started his music career performing with another country rap singer Hosier. They released a single \"Salute the Brave\" in 2017, which reached No. 46 on Hot Country Songs. and they also released an album Made in America that year. He ended his collaboration with Hosier and started a solo career in 2018, and released AmerAcal. Later in the year he released his second album The Throne. A track in the album \"Racism\" drew criticism for using the N-word and stereotypes about white and black people. He released an EP Crazy White Boy with Demun Jones. During their \"Crazy White Boy Tour\", their shows in Sacramento, California were scheduled in the same weekend as the Sacramento Pride, which led to protests because of his social media posts on gay and trans people and song lyrics described as \"racist\". It resulted in those shows being cancelled. Other shows similarly faced protests and another show in Oklahoma City was canceled. On July 18, 2019, Calhoun released his third solo album, War. The album was the second best-selling country album and the third best-selling rap album of the week, with 3,200 copies sold. ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details ! colspan=\"4\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9em;\"| Sales |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:4em;\"| US ! style=\"width:4em;\"| US Country ! style=\"width:4em;\"| US Heat * ! style=\"width:4em;\"| US Indie * |- ! scope=\"row\"|Made in America (with Hosier) | * Release date: December 1, 2017 * Label: Redneckin Records * Formats: Digital download | \u2014 | \u2014 | 6 | 46 | |- ! scope=\"row\"|AmerAcal | * Release date: March 13, 2018 * Label: ACal * Formats: Digital download | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | *US: 11,600 |- !scope=\"row\"|The Throne | * Release date: November, 2018 * Label: ACal * Formats: Digital download | \u2014 | 21 | 1 | 4 | * US: 7,800 |- !scope=\"row\"|War | * Release date: July 18, 2019 * Label: ACal * Formats: Digital download, streaming | \u2014 | \u2014 | 2 | 8 | * US: 3,200 |- ! scope=\"row\" | Hooligan (with Upchurch) | * Release date: November 25, 2019 * Label: ACal / RHEC * Formats: Digital download, streaming | 160 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | |- | colspan=\"7\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart |} ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17em;\"| EP details ! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart positions |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:4em;\"| US Heat ! style=\"width:4em;\"| US Indie |- ! scope=\"row\"|Crazy White Boy (with Demun Jones) | * Release date: February 11, 2019 * Label: ACal * Formats: Digital download | 1 | 10 |- |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Title ! colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:4em;\"| US Country |- |2017 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Salute the Brave\" (with Hosier) | 46 | Made in America |- |2020 ! scope=\"row\"| \"The Patriot\" |\u2013 | |} ==References== ==External links== * YouTube channel * website Category:1980 births Category:21st-century American singers Category:American country singer-songwriters Category:American male rappers Category:Country rap musicians Category:Living people Category:21st-century male singers ",
