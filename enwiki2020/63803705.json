The album peaked at number 21 on the UK Albums Chart. ==Background== Talking about the album, Michael Ball said, \"People will assume what a record is going to be like and they are loath to even give it a listen. I sometimes feel I want to release an album without people knowing it is me.\" ==Critical reception== Writing for the Daily Express, Clive Davis wrote \"His new album If Everyone Was Listening... is springing some surprises, proving there is more to Ball than those anthems from Les Mis\u00e9rables. Reflecting his passion for Americana and the neglected corners of the singer-songwriter repertoire, the record might just be the best thing the singer has ever recorded. All he has to do now is to persuade the doubters to give it a try. He knows it won\u2019t be easy.\" ==Singles== \"What We Ain't Got\" was released as the lead single from the album on 17 November 2014. ==Track listing== All songs produced by Nick Patrick and Michael Ball. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2014) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
