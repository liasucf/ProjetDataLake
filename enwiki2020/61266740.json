Having spent a decade in the West Bromwich Albion Academy he moved to Barcelona in 2019 and subsequently joined Aston Villa in January 2020. Barry has represented England at youth international level. ==Early and personal life== Barry was born in Sutton Coldfield, and holds dual English-Irish nationality.

In February 2020 he said he had been an Aston Villa fan his entire life. ==Club career== === Barcelona === After spending ten years with West Bromwich Albion, he signed a three-year contract with Spanish club Barcelona in July 2019. He had previously been close to signing for French club Paris Saint-Germain. In September 2019 it was announced that West Bromwich Albion were going to report Barcelona to FIFA over the transfer, claiming that they had not received the compensation they were due. Barcelona contested this, however, stating that they did not believe that his scholarship for West Brom had any international standing, and that they would wait for the verdict from FIFA. He subsequently had to wait three months for his international registration to be confirmed which meant he missed the first seven matches of the Barcelona under-19 season. Barry made his competitive debut for Barcelona's under-19 side in October 2019, scoring on his first start, in a 6-0 victory against Ebro. === Aston Villa === In January 2020 he held talks with Aston Villa, signing for them later that month for a fee of \u00a3880,000. He made his debut for the club's U23 team on 23 January 2020, shortly before he was officially unveiled by the Midlands club. He came on to score the equaliser in a 2\u20131 win over Cardiff City. In June 2020 he spent time training with the Aston Villa first team, then made a first appearance in the EFL Trophy with the club's under-21 side four months later.EFL Trophy: Fleetwood Town 3-0 Aston Villa, Aston Villa FC, 6 October 2020 ==International career== Barry has represented England at under-15, under-16 and under-17 youth levels.
