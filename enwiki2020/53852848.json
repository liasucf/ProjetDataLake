    "text": "Mary Queen of Scots is a 2018 historical drama film directed by Josie Rourke (in her feature directorial debut) and with a screenplay by Beau Willimon based on John Guy's 2004 biography Queen of Scots: The True Life of Mary Stuart. The film stars Saoirse Ronan as Mary, Queen of Scots and Margot Robbie as her cousin Queen Elizabeth I, and chronicles the 1569 conflict between their two countries. Jack Lowden, Joe Alwyn, David Tennant, and Guy Pearce also star in supporting roles. Mary Queen of Scots had its world premiere on closing night of AFI Fest on 15 November 2018, was released in the United States on 7 December 2018, and was released in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2019. The film received mixed reviews, with praise for the performances (particularly Ronan and Robbie) and costumes, but was criticised for the screenplay and several historical inaccuracies. The film received three nominations at the 72nd British Academy Film Awards, and two nominations, for Best Costume Design and Best Makeup and Hairstyling, at the 91st Academy Awards. For her performance, Robbie earned nominations for a SAG Award and BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress. == Plot == In 1561, nineteen-year-old Mary Stuart, Catholic Queen of Scotland, returns to her home country from France following the death of her husband, Francis II, to take up her throne, where she is received by her half brother, the Earl of Moray. In neighbouring England, Mary's twenty-eight-year-old cousin Elizabeth is Protestant Queen of England \u2013 unmarried, childless, and threatened by Mary's potential claim to her throne. Mary dismisses the cleric John Knox from her court. A Protestant and leader of the Scottish Reformation, Knox views Mary as a danger to the kingdom's Protestant supremacy. Seeking to weaken her cousin's threat to her sovereignty, Elizabeth arranges for Mary, whom English Catholics recognize as their rightful Queen, to be married to an Englishman. She chooses Robert Dudley, whom she secretly loves; though he and Mary are unwilling, news of Elizabeth's smallpox convinces Mary to accept, provided she is named Elizabeth's heir apparent. Reluctant to let go of Dudley, Elizabeth sends Lord Darnley to Scotland with the pretence of living under their religious freedom. Despite sensing an ulterior motive, Mary grows fond of Darnley and eventually accepts his marriage proposal. Mary's impending marriage causes a constitutional crisis within both realms: Elizabeth is advised to oppose the marriage for fear that Darnley, an English noble, will elevate Mary's claim to the Crown; Mary's council is suspicious of Darnley, fearing an English takeover. Both kingdoms demand his return to England but Mary refuses, enraging Moray to mount a rebellion against her. Mary marries Darnley, only to discover him in bed with her friend and private secretary, David Rizzio. Mary quashes the rebel forces but spares Rizzio and Moray, and demands Darnley give her a child. When a child is conceived, Mary declares the child is \"heir to Scotland and England\" \u2013 offending the English. Moray colludes with Darnley's father Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, to undermine Mary. They spread rumours that her child was illegitimately fathered by Rizzio, driving John Knox to vehemently preach that Mary is an adulteress. Fearing these accusations and the possible discovery of his homosexuality, Darnley is coerced by the underminers to join them in murdering Rizzio, and reluctantly delivers the final blow. Discovering the plot, Mary agrees to pardon the conspirators if presented with evidence that Darnley took part. She ultimately forgives Moray, and asks Elizabeth to be her child's godmother. They agree the child is heir presumptive, much to the English court's chagrin. Mary banishes Darnley but refuses to divorce him, despite the appeals of her council, which approaches her adviser and protector, the Earl of Bothwell, to have him killed. After Darnley's death, Mary is forced to flee without her child. Bothwell advises that her council have decided she must marry a Scotsman immediately\u2014and that Scotsman should be Bothwell himself. Mary initially objects, suspecting he was involved with Darnley's murder, but after he threatens her and subsequently rapes her, she consents to the marriage. This induces Knox to preach to the Scots that Mary is a \"harlot\" who had her husband killed, leading Moray and her court to demand her abdication. Despite her objections, Mary eventually abdicates her throne and flees to England. Elizabeth arranges a clandestine meeting, where Mary asks for help to take back her throne. Reluctant to go to war on behalf of a Catholic, Elizabeth instead promises a safe exile in England as long as Mary does not aid her enemies. Mary responds that if she does, it will only be because Elizabeth forced her to do so, and threatens that should Elizabeth murder her, she should remember that she \"murdered her own sister and queen\". Placing Mary under house arrest, Elizabeth receives compelling evidence that Mary conspired with her enemies to have her assassinated. With no other choice, Elizabeth orders Mary's execution. As Mary is walked to the scaffold, a remorseful Elizabeth cries for Mary, who reveals a bright red dress, implying herself a martyr. In her final thoughts, Mary wishes her son James well and hopes for peace upon his reign. A post-script reveals that upon Elizabeth's death in 1603, James became the first monarch to rule both Scotland and England. == Cast == * Saoirse Ronan as Mary Stuart, the Queen of Scots and Elizabeth's cousin * Margot Robbie as Queen Elizabeth I, Mary's cousin and the Queen of England and Ireland * Jack Lowden as Henry Darnley, Mary's second husband * Joe Alwyn as Robert Dudley, Elizabeth's counselor and lover * David Tennant as John Knox, founder of the Church of Scotland * Guy Pearce as William Cecil, advisor to Elizabeth * Gemma Chan as Bess of Hardwick, a friend and confidante of Elizabeth and keeper of Mary * Martin Compston as Lord Bothwell, Mary's third husband * Ismael Cruz C\u00f3rdova as David Rizzio, Mary's close friend and confidant * Brendan Coyle as Earl of Lennox, father of Lord Darnley * Ian Hart as Lord Maitland, Lord Chancellor of Scotland * Adrian Lester as Lord Randolph, Elizabeth's ambassador to Scotland * James McArdle as the James, Earl of Moray, Regent of Scotland In addition, Eileen O\u2019Higgins, Izuka Hoyle and Liah O\u2019Prey are seen throughout the film as Mary's personal attendants, Mary Beaton, Mary Seton and Mary Livingston, respectively. Alex Beckett, who appears as Sir Walter Mildmay, English Chancellor of the Exchequer, died at age 35, seven months before the film's release; the film is dedicated to his memory. The director, Josie Rourke, followed British theatre's principle of color-blind casting. == Production == The film was originally planned to be a Scarlett Johansson vehicle, scheduled to begin shooting in mid-2007 on a $25\u201330 million budget. After Johansson dropped out, the film languished in development hell for several years. On 9 August 2012, it was announced that Saoirse Ronan would play the title role of Mary Stuart. On 21 April 2017, it was announced that Margot Robbie was cast to play Queen Elizabeth I, and that the film was scheduled to commence principal photography in August 2017. The film based on John Guy's biography My Heart Is My Own: The Life of Mary Queen of Scots would be produced by Working Title's Tim Bevan, Eric Fellner, and Debra Hayward, and HBI Production's James Biggam. Josie Rourke was announced to direct the film from an adapted screenplay by Beau Willimon. On 13 June 2017, Jack Lowden was announced to play Lord Darnley, while Joe Alwyn was announced to play Robert Dudley. On 22 June 2017, it was reported that Martin Compston was cast in the film to play James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell, the third husband of Stuart. On 23 June 2017, German-Romanian actress Maria- Victoria Dragus had also joined the cast to play Scottish noblewoman and childhood friend of Stuart, Mary Fleming, marking her English-language debut in film, having a minor role previously in Australian teen drama Dance Academy. On 17 August 2017, Brendan Coyle, David Tennant, and Guy Pearce joined the cast, followed by Gemma Chan the next day. On 22 August, Ismael Cruz C\u00f3rdova was cast to play David Rizzio, Mary's close friend and confidant. Focus Features handle the domestic rights while Universal Pictures handle the international distribution. The crew on the film includes Academy Award winners costume designer Alexandra Byrne, hair and make-up designer Jenny Shircore and editor Chris Dickens; Emmy Award-winning production designer James Merifield; and BAFTA Award-winning cinematographer John Mathieson. Principal photography began on 17 August 2017, in various locations around the United Kingdom, including Scotland. ==Release== It had its world premiere at the closing night gala of AFI Fest on 15 November 2018 in Los Angeles, CA. The film was released in the United States on 7 December 2018, and in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2019. == Historical accuracy == Historians and fans have heavily criticised the inaccuracies of the story. Mary and Elizabeth's letters to each other were their only sources of communication, and they never saw each other face to face. There have been suggestions that Mary would not have had a Scottish accent. The five-year-old Mary was sent to France, where she grew up in the French Court. Estelle Paranque, an expert on Queen Elizabeth I, told The Telegraph: \"It shows a friendship at first, but there was not a friendship, Elizabeth tried to be kind to her at first but Mary never saw Elizabeth as an equal. She saw her as a rival from the start.\" In the film Mary is referred to several times as the 'Queen of Scotland'. However, as a popular monarchy the Scottish monarch was instead titled the [King/Queen] of Scots (as the film's title and eponymous character accurately states), something which was the norm until usage started to decline during the reigns of William II and Mary II. The movie portrays the English ambassador to the Scottish Court, Lord Thomas Randolph, as a black man, which he was not. Gemma Chan's character is Elizabeth Hardwick, who in real life was white. Director Josie Rourke told the L.A. Times: \"I was really clear, I would not direct an all-white period drama.\" ==Reception== ===Box office=== Mary Queen of Scots grossed $16.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $29.9 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $46.4 million. The film made $194,777 from four theaters in its opening weekend, an average of $48,694 per venue. It expanded to 795 theaters in its third weekend, grossing $2.8 million, and then to 841 in its fourth, making $2.7 million. ===Critical response=== Reviewers criticised the film's historicity, its plotting and its sex scenes. Emily Yoshida of New York magazine's Vulture site called it \"a kind of nothing of a film. It's neither a rigorous history lesson nor a particularly interesting work of drama and character\"; Shane Watson of The Telegraph called it \"history porn for the Instagram generation\"; while A.O. Scott of The New York Times said that \"students of Scottish history may be surprised to learn that the fate of the nation was partly decided by an act of cunnilingus.\" On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 62% based on 280 reviews, with an average rating of 6.20/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Mary Queen of Scots delivers uneven period political thrills while offering a brilliant showcase for the talents of its well-matched leads.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by PostTrak gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars and a 38% \"definite recommend\". ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"width:99%;\" |- style=\"background:#ccc; text- align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\"| Award ! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony ! scope=\"col\"| Category ! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| AACTA International Awards | 14 November 2018 | Best Supporting Actress | Margot Robbie | | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Academy Awards | rowspan=\"2\"| 24 February 2019 | Best Costume Design | Alexandra Byrne | | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Makeup and Hairstyling |Jenny Shircore, Marc Pilcher, and Jessica Brooks | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\"| BAFTA Awards | rowspan=\"3\"| 10 February 2019 | Best Costume Design | Alexandra Byrne | | rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Makeup and Hair | Jenny Shircore | |- | Best Supporting Actress | Margot Robbie | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Costume Designers Guild | 19 February 2019 | Excellence in Period Film | Alexandra Byrne | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Critics' Choice Movie Awards | rowspan=\"2\"| 13 January 2019 | Best Costume Design | Alexandra Byrne | | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Hair and Makeup | Mary Queen of Scots | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Hollywood Film Awards | 14 November 2018 | Make-Up & Hair Styling Award | Jenny Shircore, Sarah Kelly and Hannah Edwards | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Hollywood Music in Media Awards | 14 November 2018 | Best Original Score \u2013 Feature Film | Max Richter | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| Make-Up Artists and Hair Stylists Guild | rowspan=\"2\"| 16 February 2019 | Best Period and/or Character Hairstyling | Jenny Shircore, Marc Pilcher | | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Period and/or Character Make-up | Jenny Shircore, Hannah Edwards, Sarah Kelly | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\"| Satellite Awards | rowspan=\"3\"|17 February 2019 | Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama | Mary Queen of Scots | | rowspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Costume Design | Alexandra Byrne | |- | Best Supporting Actress |rowspan=2|Margot Robbie | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Screen Actors Guild Awards | 27 January 2019 | Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role | | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- |} == References == == External links == * * Category:2018 films Category:2018 directorial debut films Category:2018 drama films Category:2018 biographical drama films Category:2010s historical drama films Category:American biographical drama films Category:American films Category:American historical drama films Category:Biographical films about British royalty Category:Biographical films about Scottish royalty Category:British biographical drama films Category:British films Category:British historical drama films Category:Films about cousins Category:Films about Elizabeth I Category:Films about Mary, Queen of Scots Category:Films based on biographies Category:Films produced by Eric Fellner Category:Films produced by Tim Bevan Category:Films scored by Max Richter Category:Films set in the 1560s Category:Films shot in Edinburgh Category:Films shot in Gloucestershire Category:Focus Features films Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Working Title Films films ",
