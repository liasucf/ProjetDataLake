In 1825, he moved to Philadelphia and got a position as a salesman there. ==Career== Saving and investing his earnings, he eventually became partner in Williamson, Burroughs & Co. selling dry-goods to local shops, where he made a large amount of his fortune. ==Philanthropies== Williamson was known for his philanthropy, though due to the way he dressed and walked through the city, he was sometimes referred to as the \"threadbare philanthropist.\" Also, it has been difficult to determine how much Williamson gave because most of his donations were made anonymously under the pseudonym \u201cHez.\u201d His large sums of money went to hospitals, including the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in the 1870s and founding the Williamson Free School of Mechanical Trades with $5,000,000, December 1, 1888, a gift \"larger than the entire endowment of Harvard, Yale or Columbia.\" ==Death== Isaiah V.
