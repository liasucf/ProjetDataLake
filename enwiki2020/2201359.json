    "text": "Philip John Taylor (21 September 1954 \u2013 11 November 2015), better known as \"Philthy Animal\", was an English drummer for the rock band Mot\u00f6rhead from 1975\u20131984 and 1987\u20131992, recording eleven studio albums and four live albums. The Mot\u00f6rhead line-up consisting of Taylor, Lemmy, and \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke is generally regarded as the 'classic' line-up of the band. ==Biography== Born on 21 September 1954, in Hasland, Chesterfield, Taylor grew up in Leeds. He took drum lessons at Leeds College of Music on advice from his father. After meeting Lemmy, who was a fellow speed user, he joined Mot\u00f6rhead and replaced Lucas Fox during the recording of the band's first album On Parole in 1975. Lemmy has said that Fox wasn't working out and Taylor \"had a car and could give us a lift back down to the studio\". Taylor, in turn, introduced Lemmy to guitarist \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke, having worked with him while painting a houseboat. Shortly after recording the classic Ace of Spades album in 1980, Taylor broke his neck after being lifted above the head of a friend in a test of strength, only to be dropped on his head. Taylor continued to play in Mot\u00f6rhead with the aid of a neck brace, as is visible in the music video for \"Ace of Spades\". As a result, Taylor had a prominent lump located on the back of his neck (affectionately referred to as his \"knob\"), thought to be a calcium deposit caused by his previous spinal trauma. Tour-disrupting injuries were not unfamiliar to Taylor at the time, as he had previously broken his hand whilst punching a man outside his flat in London. Taylor continued to drum by using gaffer tape to attach his drum stick into his hand until it had sufficiently healed. Taylor left Mot\u00f6rhead in 1984. The following year, he made appearances with Waysted, and joined former Mot\u00f6rhead and Thin Lizzy guitarist Brian Robertson to form the band Operator. In 1986, he was part of Frankie Miller's touring band. Taylor returned to Mot\u00f6rhead in 1987. He said \"I always regretted leaving. Let's just say I took a three-year holiday.\" He continued playing in the group until 1992. After having been warned three times in the previous two years \"to get his act together\", he was fired after recording \"I Ain't No Nice Guy\", because of his poor performance.Kilmister, Ian and Garza, Janiss White Line Fever (2002) \u2014 Simon & Schuster pp. 242-243 From 2005 to 2008 Taylor played and recorded in a group called The Web of Spider with Whitey Kirst (Iggy Pop) on guitar and Max Noce on bass. In 2007 Taylor briefly worked on a project called Capricorn with former Danzig guitarist Todd Youth, former Monster Magnet guitarist Phil Caivano and former Nashville Pussy bassist Corey Parks. After playing in The Web of Spider, Taylor began work on a project with guitarist Chris Holmes, formerly of the heavy metal band W.A.S.P., and in 2009, Taylor joined American thrash metal band Overkill for a set at the Islington Academy. The set included a cover of the Mot\u00f6rhead song from which Overkill took their name. He sporadically played drums for Mick Farren and The Deviants, featuring on Dr. Crow (2002), Sheep in Wolves' Clothing (2008), and Portobello Shuffle (2009). Taylor reunited with Lemmy and Clarke on 6 November 2014 at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham, on stage for Mot\u00f6rhead's classic \"Ace of Spades\" only to come on to wave to the crowd and leave. ==Death== Phil Taylor died on 11 November 2015, in London, at the age of 61 after an illness. Liver failure was cited as a cause. \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke said of his former bandmate: Lemmy told Classic Rock that he was \"devastated\" to have lost one of his best friends. He also remembered former Mot\u00f6rhead guitarist Michael \"W\u00fcrzel\" Burston, who died in 2011. Lemmy died on 28 December 2015, less than seven weeks after Taylor and on 10 January 2018 \"Fast Eddie\" Clarke also died, leaving none of the classic Ace of Spades-era M\u00f6torhead lineup alive. ==Discography== ===Mot\u00f6rhead=== *On Parole (recorded 1975\u201376, released in 1979) *Mot\u00f6rhead (1977) *Overkill (1979) *Bomber (1979) *Ace of Spades (1980) *No Sleep 'til Hammersmith (1981) *Iron Fist (1982) *Another Perfect Day (1983) *Rock 'n' Roll (1987) *N\u00f6 Sleep at All (1988) *1916 (1991) *March \u00f6r Die (1992) \u2013 \"I Ain't No Nice Guy\" only ===Other recordings=== *The Muggers Tapes \u2013 live recording from a brief spell of about four gigs.
