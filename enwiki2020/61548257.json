    "text": "Action in Slow Motion is a 1943 British silent short film. In the very short film, which runs only 3 minutes, a completely nude woman is depicted frolicking in the surf. Then the film re-plays the same action in slow motion, from a different angle. It was an \"art film\" in the sense that this description was often used to dispute that the film was outright pornography. A card is displayed at the beginning that warns the viewer that the film is intended only for art students, and exhibition for other purposes could result in prosecution or jail time. The only known print of this film was gifted to the British Film Institute, and is notable as an early depiction of full frontal female nudity in British cinema. The film has no production credits, so its author, and other information surrounding its production, are unknown. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1943 short films Category:Black- and-white documentary films Category:British silent short films Category:British black-and-white films Category:British films Category:1940s pornographic films Category:1943 films ",
