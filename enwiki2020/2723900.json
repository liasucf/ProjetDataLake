Its purpose is to spread information on electronic music, techno music, avantgarde, experimental music and independent music in Finland; of artists, record labels, clubs and so on. The peculiar spelling of pHinnWeb's name is a reference to acid house culture where \"f\" was often spelled as \"ph\" or \"pH\". pHinnWeb is also concerned with underground culture and arts in Finland and around the world. Among some of the non-Finnish artists featured at pHinnWeb one might mention, for example, Chicks on Speed and Jonathan Saul Kane. As part of its activities, pHinnWeb runs an English- language electronic mailing list on Yahoo! Groups. == pHinnMilk Recordings == pHinnMilk Recordings, a small record label publishing CD-Rs, was founded in 2001 in Tampere, Finland as the publishing outlet of pHinnWeb. === Discography === * Club Telex Noise Ensemble: Just To Disturb You A Little Bit CD-R (phnnmlk-0, June 2001) * Virtal\u00e4hde: Virka- ja v\u00e4kivalta CD-R (phnnmlk-1, March 2002) * Kohinatuotanto (a.k.a.
