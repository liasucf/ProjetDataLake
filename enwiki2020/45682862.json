Chan, who left Kon-Tiki in the 1970s,Roxanne Arsenault, Les commerces kitsch exotiques au Qu\u00e9bec : reconnaissance et sauvegarde d'un nouveau patrimoine, septembre 2011. opened his first restaurant Tiki Dor\u00e9 in 1974 at 6976 Sherbrooke Street East in Montreal. Chan bought back many elements of the Kon-Tiki restaurant's decor at an auction sale held after the Kon-Tiki restaurant's closure in 1981, in order to use them in another more spacious restaurant that he wanted to open. He founded a new business on 14 February 1985 and the following year opened his second restaurant Jardin Tiki (literally Tiki Garden) with the help of then co-owners Albert Wong and Paul Yee, in a former car dealership. Chan sold the Tiki Dor\u00e9 restaurant in 1990. The Tiki Dor\u00e9 restaurant closed in January 2000. Jardin Tiki was located at 5300 Sherbrooke Street East in Montreal, facing the Olympic Village in the Hochelaga-Maisonneuve district. It was noted for its kitsch Polynesian decor, its large atrium filled with tropical plants and its pond with live turtles.USA Today, \"10 great places to carry a torch for Tiki bars\", 3 August 2007 It got rave reviews in James Teitelbaum's book on the pop-Polynesian phenomenon Tiki Road Trip. The all-you-can-eat buffet served Canadian Chinese cuisine. Danny Chan, son of Douglas Chan, who died in 2002, took over his father's business. According to its last owner, the only day Jardin Tiki had been closed was the day of his father's funeral. ==Closure== The Jardin Tiki closed on 28 March 2015. The land and building (including the decor) were purchased by retirement-home mogul Eddy Savoie of R\u00e9sidences Soleil to make way for a new retirement residence to be built on the site. ==Significance== Scenes from the 1998 film C't'\u00e0 ton tour, Laura Cadieux, the 2006 Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque television miniseries and the 2008 movie Truffe by Kim Nguyen, were shot at Jardin Tiki. At the time of its closing in 2015, the Jardin Tiki was the last tiki-themed restaurant remaining in Montreal and one of a handful of tiki establishments in Quebec. A notable survivor is the H\u00f4tel Motel Coconut in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res. ==Gallery== File:Jardin Tiki God (2092761329).jpg|Tiki statue, 2004 File:Jardin Tiki Montreal 2005.jpg|Entryway, 2005 File:Jardin Tiki Door Handles.jpg|Tiki-themed door handles File:Jardin Tiki Drink (2092761327).jpg|A cocktail at Jardin Tiki File:Jardin Tiki Montreal drink.jpg|A cocktail at Jardin Tiki ==References== ==External links== * Official website (from the Internet Archive Wayback Machine) * Photo Gallery at Cult MTL * Photo gallery at Montreal Eater Category:1986 establishments in Quebec Category:2015 disestablishments in Quebec Category:Canadian Chinese cuisine Category:Chinese-Canadian culture Category:Defunct restaurants in Montreal Category:Mercier\u2013Hochelaga-Maisonneuve Category:Montreal cuisine Category:Restaurants disestablished in 2015 Category:Restaurants established in 1986 Category:Tiki bars Category:Tiki culture ",
