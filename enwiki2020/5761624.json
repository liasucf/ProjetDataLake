    "text": "\"Goodnight Tonight\" is a song by the British\u2013American rock band Wings. Written and produced by Paul McCartney, it was released as a non-album single on 23 March 1979 by Parlophone in the UK and Columbia Records in the US. It was recorded during the sessions for the band's 1979 album Back to the Egg and is notable for its disco-inflected sound and spirited flamenco guitar break. It peaked at number five on both the US Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. ==Recording== \"Goodnight Tonight\" began as an instrumental backing track McCartney had recorded in 1978. Needing a single for Wings to accompany the Back to the Egg album, McCartney took out the track and brought it into the studio, where the full Wings line-up completed it. Laine and Juber added electric guitars, mirroring Paul's parts and Holley added percussion, while the whole band sang in the chorus.Luca Perasi, Paul McCartney: Recording Sessions (1969\u20132013), L.I.L.Y. Publishing, 2013, , pp.169\u2013170. Since the track was over seven minutes long, an edited version was used as the single, with the full version available as a 12-inch single. A music video was made for the song, showing Wings performing in 1930s costumes; stills from the video were used on the single's sleeve. In the US, the single was the first released under McCartney's new deal with Columbia Records. ==Release== The track did not appear on Wings' then-current album Back to the Egg (from which sessions this song was recorded), as McCartney felt it did not fit the theme of the LP; it was later included on the McCartney compilations All the Best! (1987), Wingspan: Hits and History (2001) and Pure McCartney (2016). The 7\" version was released as a bonus track on the 1993 remastered CD of McCartney II, as part of The Paul McCartney Collection. The B-side of this single was \"Daytime Nighttime Suffering\". An extended version of the song appears on a digital iTunes re-issue of Back to the Egg. ==Charts and reception== \"Goodnight Tonight\" was an international hit, reaching number five on both the Billboard Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart. John Lennon, McCartney's former songwriting partner, later commented that he did not care for the song, but enjoyed McCartney's bass guitar on the single. The single was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over one million copies. ==References in popular culture== The song was featured in the 2010 film Grown Ups. ==Track listings== ;7\" single (R 6023) # \"Goodnight Tonight\" \u2013 4:15 # \"Daytime Nighttime Suffering\" \u2013 3:19 ;12\" single (12 YR 6023) # \"Goodnight Tonight\" (Long Version) \u2013 7:15 # \"Daytime Nighttime Suffering\" \u2013 3:19 ==Personnel== * Paul McCartney \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic and electric lead guitars, bass, drums * Linda McCartney \u2013 harmony and backing vocals, keyboards * Denny Laine \u2013 backing vocals, lead guitar * Laurence Juber \u2013 backing vocals, lead guitar * Steve Holley \u2013 backing vocals, percussion ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1979) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |Australia KMR | style=\"text-align:center;\"|6 |- |Belgium | style=\"text-align:center;\"|24 |- |Canada RPM Top Singles | style=\"text- align:center;\"|2 |- |Canada RPM Adult Contemporary | style=\"text- align:center;\"|1 |- |Germany | style=\"text-align:center;\"|34 |- |Ireland | style=\"text-align:center;\"|9 |- |Japan | style=\"text-align:center;\"|77 |- |Netherlands | style=\"text-align:center;\"|24 |- |New Zealand | style=\"text- align:center;\"|6 |- |Norway | style=\"text-align:center;\"|9 |- |South Africa (Springbok) |align=\"center\"|15 |- |UK Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|5 |- |US Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|5 |- |US Billboard Adult Contemporary | style=\"text-align:center;\"|30 |- |US Cash Box Top 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|4 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1979) ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|Rank |- |Australia | style=\"text-align:center;\"|57 |- |Canada | style=\"text-align:center;\"|6 |- |UK | style=\"text-align:center;\"|73 |- |US Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|52 |} ==References== Category:1979 songs Category:1979 singles Category:Disco songs Category:Columbia Records singles Category:Music published by MPL Music Publishing Category:Parlophone singles Category:Paul McCartney songs Category:Song recordings produced by Paul McCartney Category:Songs written by Paul McCartney Category:Wings (band) songs Category:RPM Adult Contemporary number-one singles ",
