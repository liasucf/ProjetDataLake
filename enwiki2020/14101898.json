Recent major projects include the Vienna International Airport extension, a large-scale hospital building in the Belgian town of Courtrai (Kortrijk), high-rises in Beijing and the UNAIDS/WHO building in Geneva. Since starting up business in Vorarlberg, the westernmost state of Austria, with the focus of its activities on housing and residential architecture, the company has meanwhile become internationally established with branches in Lochau (Austria), Vienna, St. Gallen (Switzerland), Z\u00fcrich (Switzerland), Vaduz (Liechtenstein) and Beijing. Professor Winfried Nerdinger attributes the success of the practice to \"the combination of a clearly evident maintenance of architectural tradition, the use of the most modern technologies, and a concern for sustainable energy efficiency\".Nerdinger 2007, page 7 ==Founders== Carlo Baumschlager, born 1956, began his lecturing activities in early 2007.
