    "text": "is a Japanese anime studio. It has produced numerous series, including RahXephon, No. 6, Wolf's Rain, Scrapped Princess, Eureka Seven, Angelic Layer, Darker than Black, Soul Eater, Ouran High School Host Club and two adaptations of the Fullmetal Alchemist manga along with Star Driver, Gosick, Mob Psycho 100, Space Dandy, Noragami, and My Hero Academia. Its headquarters is located in Igusa, Suginami, Tokyo. ==History== Bones was founded by Sunrise staff members Masahiko Minami, Hiroshi \u014csaka and Toshihiro Kawamoto in October 1998. One of their first projects was collaborating with Sunrise on Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door, a feature film based on the Cowboy Bebop anime series. In 2007, the studio suffered the loss of co-founder Hiroshi \u014csaka, well known for his works as character designer on series such as Mobile Suit Victory Gundam, Mobile Fighter G Gundam and The Mars Daybreak. \u014csaka had been battling with cancer, and died from the disease on September 24, 2007. He was 44 years old. Since the death of \u014csaka, two new additions have been made to the studio's board of directors: Makoto Watanabe and Takahiro Komori. Komori is well known as a character designer and animator who has been with the studio since its inception. His previous works as designer consist of Angelic Layer, Scrapped Princess, and Darker than Black. ==Studios== Like the Sunrise Studio, in which some of its founders previously worked, Bones is divided into smaller studios which are focused on their own anime projects. *Studio A: Led by producer Naoki Amano and mainly known for Gosick, Wolf's Rain, Angelic Layer, Hiwou War Chronicles, Noragami and Carole & Tuesday. *Studio B: Mainly known for Eureka Seven, RahXephon and currently for Mob Psycho 100. *Studio C: Led by producer Yoshihiro Oyabu, it is more known for Fullmetal Alchemist, Darker than Black: The Black Contractor, Soul Eater and Ouran High School Host Club. Currently, it works exclusively for My Hero Academia. *Studio D: Led by Mari Suzuki and mainly known for Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood and No. 6. Since 2015, it works on Bungo Stray Dogs. *Studio E: The newest studio, led by Makoto Watanabe and working on the new Eureka Seven movies since 2017.http://www18.atwiki.jp/sakuga/pages/252.htmlhttp://www.bones.co.jp/community/index.html ==Works== === Anime television series === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; width:98%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\" |- ! style=\"width:3%\" class=\"unsortable\" | Year ! style=\"width:22%\" | Title ! style=\"width:12%\" | Director(s) ! data-sort- type=\"date\" style=\"width:12%\" | Original run start ! data-sort-type=\"date\" style=\"width:12%\" | Original run end ! style=\"width:2%\" | ! class=\"unsortable\" | Note(s) |- | 2000 || Hiwou War Chronicles || Tetsur\u014d Amino || October 24, 2000 || May 1, 2001 || 26 || align=left | Original work; animated by Bones Studio A. |- | 2001 || Angelic Layer: Battle Doll || Hiroshi Nishikiori || April 1, 2001 || September 30, 2001 || 26 || align=left | Based on a manga by CLAMP; animated by Bones Studio A. |- | 2002 || RahXephon || Yutaka Izubuchi || January 21, 2002 || September 10, 2002 || 26 || align=left | Original work; animated by Bones Studio B. |- | rowspan=\"3\" | 2003 ||Wolf's Rain || Tensai Okamura || January 6, 2003 || July 29, 2003 || 30 || align=left | Original work; animated by Bones Studio A. |- | Scrapped Princess || S\u014dichi Masui || April 8, 2003 || October 7, 2003 || 24|| align=left | Based on a light novel by Ichir\u014d Sakaki; animated by Bones Studio B. |- | Fullmetal Alchemist || Seiji Mizushima || October 4, 2003 || October 2, 2004 || 51|| align=left | Based on a manga by Hiromu Arakawa; animated by Bones Studio C.
