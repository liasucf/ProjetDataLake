    "text": "Jonah ben Elijah Landsofer (1678 \u2013 9 October 1712) was a Bohemian rabbi and Talmudist. He made a special study of the Masorah and was well versed in the regulations concerning the writing of scrolls of the Law, whence his name \"Landsofer.\" He studied also secular science and Kabbalah, and as a kabbalist he, with Moses \u1e24asid, was sent by Abraham Broda to Vienna to engage in a disputation with the Shabbethaians. He died in Prague in 1712. Though he died young, Landsofer wrote several important works: \"\u1e92awwa'ah,\" ethics, printed in Asher b. Jehiel's \"Or\u1e25ot \u1e24ayyim\" (Frankfurt am Main, 1717); \"Me'il \u1e92eda\u1e33ah,\" responsa, at the end of which are notes on Euclid (written in 1710, and published by his grandson Yom-\u1e6cob Landsofer, Prague, 1757); \"Bene Yonah,\" novell\u00e6 on the Masorah and the regulations concerning the writing of scrolls of the Law (ib. 1802); \"Kanfe Yonah,\" novell\u00e6 on Shul\u1e25an 'Aruk, Yoreh De'ah (to \u00a7 111; ib. 1812). His pupil Elijah b. Azriel quotes, in the preface to his \"Miktab le-Eliyahu,\" a work of Landsofer entitled \"Me'ore Or,\" on corrections for scrolls of the Law. == References == Category:1678 births Category:1712 deaths Category:17th-century rabbis Category:18th-century rabbis Category:Czech rabbis ",
