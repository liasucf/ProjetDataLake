    "text": "Vladimir Grigoryevich Proskurin (; 24 January 1945 \u2013 19 July 2020) was a Soviet Russian football player and coach. He is most notable as the co-top scorer of the 1969 Soviet Top League with 16 goals. He was not awarded the top scorer prize as the Trud newspaper which was awarding said prize suspected that the last game of the season, in which he scored a hat-trick to catch up to Nikolai Osyanin on the scorers list, was fixed (his team FC SKA Rostov-on- Don played FC Torpedo Kutaisi with a score of 3-3, Kutaisi's Dzhemal Kherhadze, who also scored a hat-trick to catch up with Osyanin, was not awarded the prize either). Formally the decision was justified by Osyanin scoring in \"more important\" games. ==External links== * ==References== Category:1945 births Category:Footballers from Voronezh Category:2020 deaths Category:Soviet footballers Category:Russian footballers Category:FC Fakel Voronezh players Category:FC SKA Rostov-on-Don players Category:FC Spartak Moscow players Category:Soviet Top League players Category:Soviet football managers Category:Russian football managers Category:FC Fakel Voronezh managers Category:Association football forwards ",
