    "text": "My Brute is a fighting simulation video game with roleplaying elements first released in March 2009. Though an English-language game, it was developed by Motion-Twin, a French online game provider. My Brute originated as a free browser-based Flash game. It was later ported to the iPhone and iPod Touch, with enhanced graphics and added features, by the video game developer Bulkypix. ==Gameplay== ===Character creation=== The player begins by creating an avatar called a Brute. Players may create as many Brutes as they wish. The Brutes of new users are, by default, public and can be used by anyone to battle. However, a password can be added in the Brute's cell page so that only the person who created the Brute can use it. The player may customize his or her Brute by giving it a name and tweaking variables such as gender, clothing, hairstyle, accessories, and skin color. The Brute is then randomly assigned ability points (health, strength, agility, and speed), skills, weapons, and pets. There are 26 weapons in the game, 28 skills to learn, and 3 pets: dogs, wolves, and bears. ===Battle arena and leveling=== The player gains experience points from fighting in the arena and expanding his or her dojo by recruiting other players to be pupils. Each time a player levels up, one of the Brute's three statistics (strength, agility, and speed) is increased. There is also a chance that the Brute will gain a new weapon, a new skill, or a new pet. The arena fights are completely automatic and require no input from the user. Brutes with higher levels and skills tend to be more successful. Though the player cannot control his or her Brute in a fight, the player can control who the Brute challenges. Other than fights that result when a pupil is recruited, a Brute is limited to three or five (depending on the version of the game) fights per day. Six fights are allowed on the first day when the character is created. However, as players are allowed to create as many Brutes as they wish, players may continue to engage in fights using other Brute characters. ===Skills=== There are a total of 42 skills a Brute can gain each time it levels up: {| | * 6th Sense * Armour * Bolt of Lightning * Bomb * Cry of the Damned * Determination * Deluge * Extra-Thick Skin | * Feline Agility * Fierce Brute * Fist of fury * Hammer * Herculean Strength * Hypnosis * Immortal * Impact | * Implacable * Lead skeleton * Lightning bolt * Martial Arts * Master of Arms * Net * Pugnacious * Reconescence * Sabotage * Shield | * Survival * Strong Arm * Tamer * Thief * Tragic Potion * Tornado of Blows * Untouchable * Vitality |} ==Reviews== Reviewers praised the game's sound effects, cute presentation, and cartoonish graphics. Reviewers found the game simple and easy to get into and appreciated that it required little time investment from the player. Reviewers also found that the game mechanic of pupil-recruitment contributed to the game by making it a social experience. Negative criticism focused on the inability to control the Brutes during the fights, which served to limit the game's depth and replayability. Reviewers also criticized the cap on the number of fights each Brute could engage in daily. == MyBrute V2.0 (Muxxu version) == * http://labrute.muxxu.com Launched in March 2010, French only *http://mybrute.muxxu.com Launched in May 2011 in English and Spanish Unlike its predecessor, MyBrute V2.0 does not use the referral system. Each brute is given two choices of weapons/skills/stats upon each level up, resulting in deeper strategic planning. On each day, each brute can fight up to 10 battles (20 battles with payment of 0.25 Euro) or 3 losses, whichever occurs first, as well as enter one tournament. ==References== ==External links== * My Brute official website * Motion-Twin official website * Bulkypix official website *My Brute at GameFAQs * Category:2009 video games Category:Browser games Category:Casual games Category:Fighting games Category:Flash games Category:Free online games Category:IOS software Category:IPod software Category:Role-playing video games Category:IOS games Category:Video games developed in France ",
