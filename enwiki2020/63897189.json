    "text": "\"Dinner Guest\" is a song recorded by British rapper, singer, songwriter and record producer AJ Tracey featuring British rapper MoStack. It was released as a single on 29 April 2020 and peaked at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart, spending 12 weeks in the top ten. The song features a sample of \"Push the Feeling On\" by Nightcrawlers. ==Production== The song was written in January 2020 and saw a collaboration in production between AJ Tracey and The Elements. With the Covid-19 pandemic first hitting the UK and the world in the early months of the year, Tracey announced that all first week download profits from sales of \"Dinner Guest\" would be donated to the Covid-19 Urgent Appeal, to support NHS staff and volunteers. This followed his appearance on the BBC Radio 1 charity single \"Times Like These\", which topped the chart and also raised money for the NHS. Tracey used a sample of \"Push the Feeling On\" by Scottish house music producers Nightcrawlers as the hook for the song. It was one of two songs released in 2020 to sample \"Push the Feeling On\", the other being \"House Party\" by Mist featuring Fredo. ==Chart performance== \"Dinner Guest\" entered the top 10 on its first week of release, making its bows at number 8. It hovered between positions 8 to 10 for six weeks before rising to number 6 and finally its peak of number five on the chart week ending 25 June 2020. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |} ==References== Category:2020 songs Category:AJ Tracey songs Category:MoStack songs ",
