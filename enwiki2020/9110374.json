    "text": "wood fiber sponge combined with scouring pad. Animal fiber sponge: A Greek natural sponge. A sponge is a tool or cleaning aid made of soft, porous material. Typically used for cleaning impervious surfaces, sponges are especially good at absorbing water and water-based solutions. Originally made from natural sea sponges, they are most commonly made from synthetic materials today. == Etymology == The word comes from the Ancient Greek word (). == History == The first references of sponges used for hygiene dates from the Ancient Greece. Competitors of the Olympic Games bathed themselves with sea sponges soaked in olive oil or perfume before competing. In the book Odyssey by the Greek poet Homer, the god Hephaestus cleans his hands, face, and chest with a sea sponge, and the servants in the Odysseus palace also used sea sponges to clean the tables after the meals the suitors of Penelope had there. The Greek philosophers Aristotle and Plato also mentioned sea sponges in both scientific and historic contexts in their works. Ancient Greeks and Romans also used sea sponges tied to sticks for anal hygiene, and washed them with sea water. Ancient Romans also used sea sponges extensively for hygiene and other uses. The belief that sponges had therapeutic properties led to its usage in medicine for cleaning wounds and treating disease. Sea sponges were used as tampons by females throughout history and are still used as a cheaper and more eco-friendly alternative to fibre ones. However, researchers do not recommend using sea sponges as tampons, as they may contain dirt and microorganisms, especially if poorly sanitized. In the New Testament, a Roman soldier offers Jesus Christ a sponge soaked in vinegar on the tip of his spear (some versions say staff) for Jesus to drink during his crucifixion, as an act of mockery. Synthetic sponges were made possible to be manufactured only after the invention of polyester in 1941 and the commercial production of polyurethane foam in 1952. ==Material== Synthetic sponges can be made of polyester, polyurethane, or vegetal cellulose. Polyurethane is used in polyester sponges for their abrasive side. Polyester sponges are more common for dish washing and are usually soft and yellow. Vegetal cellulose sponges made of wood fiber are more used for bathing and skin cleaning, and are usually tougher and more expensive than polyester sponges. They are considered more eco-friendly than polyester sponges as they are biodegradable and made of natural materials. ==Harboring bacteria== Bacteria from a kitchen sponge A sponge can be a medium for the growth of harmful bacteria or fungi, especially when it is allowed to remain wet between uses. ===Cleaning=== Several methods have been used to clean sponges. Studies have investigated the use of the microwave to clean non-metallic domestic sponges that have been thoroughly moistened. A 2006 study found that microwaving wet sponges for two minutes (at 1000 watt power) killed 99% of coliforms, E. coli, and MS2 phages, but Bacillus cereus spores required four minutes. After some fires were caused by people trying to replicate the results at home, the study's author urged people to make sure their sponges were wet.\"Microwave 'sterilisers' warning\". 24 January 2007. BBC News. A 2009 study showed that the microwave and the dishwasher were both effective ways to clean domestic sponges. == In economy == Caribbean and Mediterranean developing countries are the largest sponge exporters, whereas the largest importers are developed European and North- American countries. Tunisia is the world's main sponge exporter, exporting 90% of its sponge production. France is the main importer, being supplied by Tunisia, but France's sponge demand has fallen in recent years. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Main sponge exporters (in megatonnes exported) !Exporters !1981 !1982 !1983 !1984 !1985 !1986 |- |Tunisia |74 |71 |84 |81 |91 |88 |- |Cuba |36 |33 |38 |33 |41 |41 |- |France |25 |26 |33 |31 |35 |30 |- |Greece |32 |42 |36 |27 |32 |22 |- |Bahamas | - |8 |21 |8 |3 |14 |- |Turkey |11 |8 |7 |8 |1 |1 |- |Egypt |5 |4 |4 |2 |4 |8 |- |Japan | - |6 |4 |1 |1 |6 |- |Philippines |9 |4 |5 |6 |6 |4 |- |Libya | - | - | - |6 |3 | - |- |TOTAL |192 |202 |232 |213 |245 |225 |} ==Gallery== Image:Sponge Macro.jpg|Macro photograph of the porosity in a synthetic cleaning sponge File:Chania - Markthalle - Schw\u00e4mme.jpg|Natural sponges for sale in Crete Image:Luffa sponge.png|Plant fiber sponge: A luffa sponge whose coarse texture helps with skin scrubbing and exfoliation Image:Spongegourd.jpg|A Luffa aegyptiaca sponge section magnified 100 times Image:Urethane sponge2.jpg|A close-up of one corner of a urethane abrasive sponge with a top layer used for more intense dish scrubbing Image:Spugna sintetica.jpg|A close-up of a synthetic sponge's openings Image:Alceesponja.JPG|A souvenir made out of an artificial sponge ==See also== *Dishcloth *Ethylene-vinyl acetate \u2013 material that craft foam is made from ethylene-vinyl and acetate *Luffa aegyptiaca *Sponge metal ==References== Category:Cleaning tools Category:Cleaning products Category:Domestic implements ",
