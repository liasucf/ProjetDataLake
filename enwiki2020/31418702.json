    "text": "\"The Foolish Thing to Do\" is a song by the British synthpop band Heaven 17 and featuring American singer Jimmy Ruffin. It was released in 1986 as a non-album single. The song was written by Glenn Gregory, Ian Craig Marsh, Martyn Ware and Nick Plytas, and produced by Marsh and Ware (as the British Electric Foundation). \"The Foolish Thing to Do\" reached No. 80 in the UK and remained in the charts for two weeks. A music video was filmed to promote the single. The B-side, \"My Sensitivity (Gets in the Way), is a cover of the Luther Vandross song. Ruffin performed lead vocals on both tracks. For the CD version of Heaven 17's fifth studio album Teddy Bear, Duke & Psycho, released in 1988, a new version of the song featured Gregory performing the lead vocal. == Background == Speaking to Record Mirror in 1986, Gregory spoke of how Heaven 17 came to work with Ruffin: \"We wrote the song for a French film that we were doing some music for, and they wanted it in a certain mood. Ware knew Ruffin from the Council Collective, the Soul Deep thing, so he cheekily phoned him up, and asked him if he'd do a guide vocal for us. It turned out that the girl who was supposed to sing it in the film couldn't cut the cheese in the studio, and the vocal that Jimmy did was just so brilliant, anyway.\" Ruffin commented: \"When I got the song from Martyn, I knew it was a better song than he realised. I thought right, I will sing this song so well, that this girl won't be able to do it. It was like, OK, I don't mind doing a guide vocal, but it'll be so good that they'll have to use it.\" When the film project fell through, the band decided to release the song as a single. Ware commented: \"After a six months wait, during which time the film project fell through, \"The Foolish Thing to Do\" was a little too good to waste, and a little too, er, smouldering for Mr Gregory's voice. It's obviously not in the Heaven 17 style, and we couldn't really envisage putting Glenn's voice on it. It would have been pointless, especially after Jimmy had done what appeared to be the definitive version.\" ==Formats== ;7\" single #\"The Foolish Thing to Do (Version 1)\" - 3:38 #\"My Sensitivity (Gets in the Way)\" - 3:33 ;12\" single #\"The Foolish Thing to Do (Version 1)\" - 3:37 #\"My Sensitivity (Gets in the Way)\" - 3:32 #\"The Foolish Thing I Do (Instrumental)\" - 3:37 #\"The Foolish Thing to Do (Version 2)\" - 3:37 ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1986) !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|80 |} ==Personnel== * Jimmy Ruffin - lead vocals * Glenn Gregory - backing vocals * Carol Kenyon - backing vocals on \"My Sensitivity\" * Tim Cansfield - guitar * Martyn Ware - Emulator II, backing vocals, producer * Nick Plytas - piano on \"The Foolish Thing to Do\", piano and emulator on \"My Sensitivity\" * Camelle Hinds - bass * Preston Heyman - drums * UK Orchestras - strings on \"My Sensitivity\" * Richard Niles - string arrangements on \"My Sensitivity\" * Ian Craig Marsh - producer ;Other * Assorted iMaGes - sleeve * Peter Ashworth - photography ==References== Category:1986 singles Category:Heaven 17 songs Category:Songs written by Martyn Ware Category:Songs written by Glenn Gregory Category:Songs written by Ian Craig Marsh Category:Soul ballads Category:1986 songs Category:Virgin Records singles ",
