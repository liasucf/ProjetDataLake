He won the South African Championships six times; four consecutive titles from 1921 through 1924 as well as victories in 1930 and 1931. In 1924 he made it to the semifinal of the singles event at the Wimbledon Championships, losing to eventual champion Jean Borotra in straight sets. In 1927 he reached the quarterfinal of the French Championship in which he was defeated by Bill Tilden. Between 1919 and 1931, Raymond played in ten ties for the South African Davis Cup team and has a record of ten wins and eleven losses. In Tilden's book, The Art of Lawn Tennis, Raymond is described as a \"hard working and deserving player\" and someone who \"attains success by industry rather than natural talent\".Tilden, William T.
