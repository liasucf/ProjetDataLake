    "text": "The 1972 United States presidential election in Michigan took place on November 7, 1972, as part of the 1972 United States presidential election. Voters chose twenty-one representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Michigan was won by incumbent President Richard Nixon (R\u2013California), with 56.20% of the popular vote, against George McGovern (D\u2013South Dakota), with 41.81% of the popular vote. John G. Schmitz was the only other candidate on the ballot, and, as the candidate for the American Independent Party, he received over 63,000 votes. Delta, Lake, Washtenaw, and Wayne counties were the only four of Michigan's 83 counties to vote for McGovern. Washtenaw was one of only five counties outside of South Dakota (McGovern's home state) to vote for McGovern after voting for Richard Nixon in 1968. ==Results== ===Results by county===
