It is open daily; an admission fee is charged. The ch\u00e2teau dates to the 11th-15th centuries; note that it is distinct from the better- known Ch\u00e2teau de Suscinio in Morbihan. Its botanical park was created in 2004 as an ambitious development project supported by Morlaix, but then closed for several years before reopening in 2008. Today the park contains parterres, gardens, and variety of trees, some of which are more than two centuries old and designated arbres remarquables de France (remarkable trees of France). == See also == * List of botanical gardens in France == References == * Plurielles article (French) * Maville.com article (French) * Cabm29.free.fr article and photos (French) Suscinio, Parc botanique de Suscinio, Parc botanique de ",
