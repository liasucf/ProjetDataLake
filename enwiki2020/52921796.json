    "text": "The 1954\u201355 Rheinlandliga was the third season of the highest amateur class of the Rhineland Football Association under the name of 1. Amateurliga Rheinland. It was a predecessor of today's Rheinlandliga. The 1. Amateurliga was below II. Division Southwest until 1963 and therefore the third-class in the hierarchy. In the seasons 1956\u201357 to 1962\u201363 the league was played in two divisions (East and West). The two division champions played to determine the Rhineland champion. With the introduction of the regional league Southwest as second highest class, starting in the 1963\u201364 season, the Amateur league Rheinland was again combined into one division. Beginning in the 1974\u201375 season, the league played a role as a sub-team to the newly introduced 2. Bundesliga, where the Rhineland champion played in a relegation against the champion of the Verbandsliga S\u00fcdwest and the Saarlandliga, for a position in the south divisions of the 2. Bundesliga. Starting from the 1978\u201379 season, the Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar was introduced as the highest amateur class and this class was renamed to the \"Verbandsliga Rheinland\" and since then only fourth class. ==Results== Rhineland champion was, as in the previous season, VfL Trier, which this time won the relegation round for the II. Division southwest and moved up. Runner up, SV Niederlahnstein, participated as a Rhineland representative in the German Football Amateur Championship in 1955 and failed in the group stage. VfB L\u00fctzel, FC Urbar and SV Wittlich had to move down to the 2. amateur league after this season. For the following season, 1955\u201356, SG Andernach, SV Niederfischbach, TuS Konz and VfL Bad Ems moved up from the 2. Amateur league, as well as the descendant from the II. Division, SC 07 Bad Neuenahr. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Rank !! Club !! Matches !! Goals !!
