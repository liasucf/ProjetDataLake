    "text": "The Skyliners Drum and Bugle Corps (formerly the New York Skyliners, Raymond A. Garbarina Memorial Corps, and Garbarina Skyliners) are an Open Class competitive senior drum and bugle corps. Formerly based in New York City, the corps is now based in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania area. The Skyliners were one of the original founding corps of Drum Corps Associates (DCA) and have won every major title available to a senior drum & bugle corps. The Skyliners are sponsored by American Legion Post #411 in Jessup, Pennsylvania and American Legion Post #1523 in New York City.They have won the DCA World Championship three times, the DCA Open Class Championship twice, and the American Legion National Title twice. == History == The Skyliners formed in 1945 as the New York Skyliners as a drum and bugle corps function of two American Legion posts in New York City. They were officially accepted as a senior corps in the American Legion in 1946, sponsored by Raymond A. Garbarina Memorial Post #1523. During the Skyliners' years in the American Legion League, they claimed the championship title three times. In 1964, the Skyliners, along with several senior corps in the northeastern United States, formed the Drum Corps Associates to establish a more formal competition format than the then-current haphazard collection of contests. The New York Skyliners succeeded in DCA, going on to win both several Open Class and Class A titles, before dwindling attendance forced the corps to remain inactive. In 2014, Director Larry Carbonell and Assistant Director Doreen Sandor revived the inactive corps and moved its location from New York to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The corps is currently active in DCA Class A Competition and rehearses in nearby Plymouth, Pennsylvania. == Show Summaries 1950-Present == Source: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"
