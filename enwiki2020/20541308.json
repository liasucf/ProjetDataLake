    "text": "The Filobasidiales are an order in the fungal class Tremellomycetes. The one family in the order, the Filobasidiaceae, contains four species. They are distinguished from other tremelloid species by the lack of a macroscopic basidiocarp. One species of the family seems to be interesting for biotechnological applications. Filobasidium floriforme shows an ability to produce lipases which could be used in biofuel production. ==References== Category:Tremellomycetes Category:Fungus orders ",
