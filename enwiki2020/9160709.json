    "text": "Fuaim (Irish for \"sound\") is the sixth album by Irish folk group Clannad. It was released in 1982. It was produced by Nicky Ryan and was the last Clannad album to feature younger sister Eithne N\u00ed Bhraon\u00e1in, later known as Enya. It is also the only Clannad album to credit her; while she performed keyboard and backing vocals on the previous album \"Crann \u00dall\", she was not credited for this. She departed, along with Nicky Ryan, shortly thereafter to begin a solo career. The album was remastered and reissued on August 7, 2020 in both compact disc and vinyl formats. ==Track listing== #\"Na Buachaill\u00ed \u00c1lainn\" \u2013 2:57 #\"Mheall S\u00ed Lena Gl\u00f3rtha\u00ed M\u00e9\" \u2013 4:17 #\"Bruach Na Carriage B\u00e1ine\" \u2013 2:37 #\"L\u00e1 Bre\u00e1 F\u00e1n Dtuath\" \u2013 :45 #\"An T\u00fall\" \u2013 3:07 #\"Strayed Away\" \u2013 2:46 #\"N\u00ed L\u00e1 Gaoithe L\u00e1 Na Scoilb?\" \u2013 6:11 #\"Lish Young Buy-A-Broom\" \u2013 3:30 #\"Mh\u00f3rag 'S Na Horo Gheallaidh\" \u2013 1:43 #\"The Green Fields of Gaothdobhair\" \u2013 4:09 #\"Buaireadh An Ph\u00f3sta\" \u2013 2:52 ==Singles== # \"Mh\u00f3rag 'S Na Horo Gheallaidh\" ==Personnel== ===Band=== * Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Braon\u00e1in \u2013 bass, guitar, keyboards, vocals * M\u00e1ire N\u00ed Bhraon\u00e1in \u2013 vocals, harp * P\u00f3l \u00d3 Braon\u00e1in \u2013 flute, guitar, percussion, vocals * Noel \u00d3 D\u00fag\u00e1in \u2013 guitar, vocals * P\u00e1draig \u00d3 D\u00fag\u00e1in \u2013 guitar, mandolin, vocals * Eithne N\u00ed Bhraon\u00e1in (Enya) \u2013 percussion, keyboards, vocals ===Additional musicians=== * Neil Buckley \u2013 clarinet, saxophones * Noel Bridgeman \u2013 percussion * Pat O'Farrell \u2013 electric guitar ===Production=== * Brian Masterson \u2013 engineer * Pearce Dunne \u2013 assistant engineer * Clannad \u2013 liner notes * Paul Wexler \u2013 liner notes * Nicky Ryan \u2013 producer ==Notes== ==External links== * Album sleevenotes * Record Label Catalogue 2010 * The Official Clannad Website Category:1982 albums Category:Clannad albums ",
