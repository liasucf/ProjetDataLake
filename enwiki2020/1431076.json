Situated to the south of the Rh\u00f6n Mountains on the Franconian Saale river, it is one of the health resorts, which became famous as a \"Weltbad\" in the 19th century.http://www.infranken.de/regional/bad-kissingen/Ein-Platz- fuer-das-Weltbad-Bad-Kissingen;art211,665628 == History == The town was first documented in the year 801 as chizzicha and was renowned above all for its mineral springs, which are recorded from as early as 823. At that time, Kissingen was under the domination of Fulda Abbey, later it fell to the Counts of Henneberg and was sold to the bishops of W\u00fcrzburg in the 14th century. Kissingen was first mentioned as \"oppidum\" (town) in 1279. The town developed to a spa in the 1500s and recorded its first official spa guest in 1520. In 1814, Kissingen became part of Bavaria. The town grew to be a fashionable resort in the 19th century, and was extended during the reign of Ludwig I of Bavaria. Crowned heads of state such as Empress Elisabeth of Austria, Tsar Alexander II of Russia and King Ludwig II of Bavaria, who bestowed the 'Bad' on Kissingen in 1883, were among the guests of the spa at this time.Thomas Ahnert, Peter Weidisch: 1200 Jahre Bad Kissingen, 801-2001, Facetten einer Stadtgeschichte, Bad Kissingen 2001, Other well-known visitors to the resort included author Leo Tolstoy, composer Gioachino Rossini and artist Adolph von Menzel. On 10 July 1866, during the Mainfeldzug (campaign at the river Main) of the Austro-Prussian War, Kissingen was the site of fierce battle between Bavarian and Prussian troops, which ended with a Prussian victory. Imperial Chancellor Otto von Bismarck visited Kissingen's spas many times, and in 1874 in the course of the Kulturkampf he survived an assassination attempt by the catholic Eduard Franz Ludwig Kullmann there. In 1877 the Kissingen Dictation (German: Kissinger Diktat) was written here, in which Bismarck explained the principles of his foreign policy. Bismarck's former home in Kissingen is now the Bismarck Museum. In June 1911 Alfred von Kiderlen-Waechter, German Secretary of State, and the French ambassador Jules Cambon had negotiations in Bad Kissingen about Morocco without achieving a solution. The failure of the negotiations lead to the Agadir Crisis.http://www.yamaguchy.com/library/fay/origin_104.html The resort's clientele changed in the 20th century, with ordinary people increasingly replacing nobility as guests. The spa suffered a one-year interruption in 1945, the only closure in its history. Shortly prior to World War II Manteuffel Kaserne (Manteuffel barracks) was established at the eastern edge of the Bad Kissingen town center by the German military as part of Hitler's program to expand the German Wehrmacht. In 1945, the American army entered the town peacefully and took over the Kaserne, which was renamed Daley Barracks in 1953. The barracks were closed in the 1990s after the fall of the iron curtain when the American troops were withdrawn. After the war, the Department of Social Security built clinics in the town. A change in health legislation in the 1990s reduced the opportunities for German health insurance contracts to fund spa visits, which led to job losses. As a result, efforts were made to attract a new kind of clientele, helped in no small part by the EMNID survey which named Bad Kissingen Germany's best-known spa town.https://www.mainpost.de/regional/bad-kissingen/Immer-noch-bekanntester- Kurort;art766,4502349 In 2015, about 1.5 million overnight stays of more than 238,000 visitors were registered in the town. With the opening of the KissSalis Therme in February 2004, Bad Kissingen gained a spa leisure centre and, in December 2004, the German-Chinese Football Academy was opened in the town, where the Chinese \"08 Star Team\" lived and trained in preparation for the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008.

They differ from other spa resorts mainly through the following criteria: * Entertainment: The social life in a \"Weltbad\" is at least as important as the medical cure, or even more. A \"Weltbad\" offered many opportunities for the spa guests to spend their free time, such as exercise and sports, trips to the surroundings, theater and concert, library and games. * Guests: The \"Weltbad\" was attractive to guests from all five continents. Particular attention was paid to prominent visitors, who attracted more visitors, especially from nobility and upscale middle class. * Architecture: There are spa quarter, quarters with villas, areas for business and care, gardens and parks with a smooth transition into the surrounding landscape * Infrastructure and supply: Despite the small number of inhabitants, a \"Weltbad\" offered the guests all the contemporary comfort, which was not even common in all major cities. These include good transport connections, communication facilities (such as telegraphy and telephone on the latest state of the art), luxury goods offer, differentiated hotel and gastronomy as well as state-of-the-art technology for energy supply, water supply and sanitation.https://www.badkissingen.de/de/aktivitaeten/museen- obere-saline/weltbad-kissingen/index.html Bad Kissingen and several other of these traditional spa baths want to become a UNESCO World Heritage site under the name \"Great Spas of Europe\".https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5928/ ==Geography== === Subdivision === In addition to the main town of Bad Kissingen, its districts include (with population numbers given in brackets, as of 1 January 2011): * Albertshausen (624) * Arnshausen (1,244) * Bad Kissingen (11,003) * Garitz (4,557) * Hausen (1,704) * Kleinbrach (375) * Poppenroth (876) * Reiterswiesen (2,103) * Winkels (1,378) == Governance == === Mayors === * Franz Meinow (1910-1947): 1945\u20131946 * Franz Rothmund: 1946\u20131947 * Karl Fuchs (1881-1972): 1947\u20131952 * Hans Wei\u00df (1919-2008): 1952\u20131984 * Georg Straus (1926-2014): 1984\u20131990 * Christian Zoll: (1941-2017): 1990\u20132002 * Karl Heinz Laudenbach (born 1957): 2002\u20132008 * Kay Blankenburg: (born 1957): 2008\u20132020 * Dirk Vogel (born 1977): since 2020 === Town Council === The Council of Bad Kissingen (2020\u20132026), elected on 15 March 2020:\"Stadtratswahl Bad Kissingen: Gr\u00fcne verdoppeln ihre Sitze\", Saale- Zeitung, 17 March 2020 * The mayor Dirk Vogel (Social Democratic Party of Germany, SPD) * 9 members of the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU) * 6 members of the (SPD) * 4 members of the Demokratische B\u00fcrger Kissingen (DBK, local group) * 3 members of the Freie W\u00e4hler party, (Free voters) * 4 members of the B\u00fcrger f\u00fcr Umwelt (BfU) /Alliance '90/The Greens /\u00f6dp * 2 members of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) * 1 member of the Left Party * 1 member of the Zukunft Bad Kissingen (local group) In May 2020, three members of the CSU changed to DBK.

The old town hall is a Renaissance design from 1577. The town hall of today is the former mansion of the noble family von Heu\u00dflein, built by Johann Dientzenhofer in 1706. The medieval chapel Marienkapelle was renewed and enlarged by Balthasar Neumann. The catholic parish church Herz-Jesu-Kirche (Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus) was built in neo-gothic style in 1882 by Andreas Lohrey. The tower is 67 meters high. The Jakobuskirche (Church of St. James) was the old catholic parish church of Bad Kissingen. The tower dates back to the 14th century, the church - replacing a medieval predecessor - was built from 1772 to 1775 by Johann Philipp Geigel in classicist style. The Lutheran church Erl\u00f6serkirche (Church of the Savior) was erected in 1847 according to the plans of the architect Friedrich von G\u00e4rtner, and expanded in 1891 according to the plans of August Thiersch. The Russian Orthodox Church of Saint Sergius of Radonesh, consecrated in 1901, was designed by the tsar's architect Viktor Schr\u00f6ter (St. Petersburg) in a neo-byzanthine style and erected by the architect Carl Krampf (Kissingen) for the then very numerous Russian spa guests. The Anglican Church of 1862 for the British spa guests was sold to the Lutheran community in 1953. The dilapidated building was replaced by the Lutheran community center in 1968. Between 1838 and 1913, the arcade (Arkadenbau) was built around the spa garden by Friedrich von G\u00e4rtner, as well as the halls for the use of the mineral water (\"Brunnenhalle\") and for promenades (\"Wandelhalle\"), following a design by Max Littmann. Littmann also designed the Kurtheater (spa theatre), completed in 1905, and the concert hall Regentenbau, inauguratet in 1913. The train station building, with its Renaissance revival fa\u00e7ade, was built in 1874 under the supervision of Friedrich B\u00fcrklein. The KissSalis Therme was opened in 2004. It is one of the largest wellness baths in Europe, and the largest building project in the town since World War II. Another point of interest is the casino in the spa park.
