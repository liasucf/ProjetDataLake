    "text": "Keiservarden is a mountain plateau on top of Veten hill near Bod\u00f8, Nordland in northern Norway (not to be confused with Veten near Bergen). It lies 366 meters (1,201 feet) above sea level and is named after German Emperor Wilhelm II, who supposedly climbed the mountain on one of his many visits to Norway on 19 July 1899. It is disputed though whether Wilhelm II really visited the place. The second half of the designation, varden is a Norwegian word for a pile of stones that indicate a mountaintop as well as the way up there. The plateau offers a great view to every direction. Under good weather conditions the silhouette of Lofoten mountainline can be seen behind Vestfjorden. During Nordland music festival week (musikkfestuke) Keiservarden is also used as a venue for concerts. In the year 2016 stone stairs were built, thus an easy climb from Bod\u00f8 turisthytta is guaranteed. ==References== Category:Bod\u00f8 ",
