The ruling Communists in Albania covered up his death and the official stance was that he had escaped from the concentration camp and had left Greece on a boat that sank and killed everyone on board except for Samsuri. Being the only one to survive the incident, he supposedly travelled to the French Upper Volta, modern\u2013day Burkina Faso where he lived under the name Justin Osturno. This was all a lie told to Samsuri's family by the Communist Party, who even wrote fake letters to his family members posing as Samsuri under the name Justin Osturno. This all ended in 1981 and Samsuri was officially declared a martyr and his death was accepted as taking place during World War II. == Honours == ;Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb *Albanian Superliga: 1 :: 1933 Albania - Championship Winning Teams - RSSSF ;Individual * Albanian Superliga top scorer (1): 1931 == References == Category:Year of birth missing Category:1942 deaths Category:People from Devoll (municipality) Category:Footballers from Kor\u00e7\u00eb Category:Association football forwards Category:Albanian footballers Category:KF Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb players Category:Albanian Superliga players ",
