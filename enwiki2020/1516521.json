It can be taken by a boat from Marina South Pier.

From two outcrops on a reef, the island was enlarged and transformed into an island of . The legend behind the island says that a magical tortoise turned itself into an island to save two shipwrecked sailors, one a Malay and the other a Chinese. At the top of the rugged hillock on Kusu Island stands three keramats (or holy shrines of Malay holy figures) to commemorate a pious man (Syed Abdul Rahman), his mother (Nenek Ghalib) and his sister (Puteri Fatimah), all of whom once lived in the 19th century. Many devotees will climb the 152 steps leading up to the kramats to pray for wealth, good marriage, good health and harmony. The shrines are also popular with childless couples who would pray for children. Despite misconceptions, they do not pray to the keramats, but at the sites. Also located on Kusu island is the popular Chinese temple dedicated to both Da Bo Gong (\u5927\u4f2f\u516c), or Tua Pek Kong (Grand Uncle), and Na Tuk Kong (Dato Keramat or \"\u62ff\u7763\u516c\"). Built in 1923 by a wealthy businessman, the temple houses two main Taoist deities, Da Bo Gong and Guan Yin (\"\u89c2\u97f3\", or Goddess of Mercy). The former is highly regarded as having the power to confer prosperity, cure diseases, calm the sea and avert danger, while Guan Yin is known as the \"Giver of Sons\". Da Bogong Temple on Kusu Island. Marble Tortoise statues on Kusu Island. It is popular for its lagoons, pristine beaches and general tranquil settings. Visits are often made by occasional ferry trips from the nearby Marina South Pier (formerly from Clifford Pier) to see the famous wishing well and the Tortoise Sanctuary. Afternoon picnics on the island are also very popular, although no food or beverage service providers are situated on the island. A stand-alone open-air hawker centre is located in the middle of the island but it is only open and running during certain periods of the year, such as during festivals or pilgrimages to the keramats or the temple. No overnight stays are permitted on the island. However, most ferries to Kusu Island also route past Saint John's Island, which does have overnight lodging offered. ==References== * Chia, Jack Meng-Tat. \"Managing The Tortoise Island: Tua Pek Kong Temple, Pilgrimage, and Social Change in Pulau Kusu, 1965-2007.\" New Zealand Journal of Asian Studies 11, 2 (December 2009): 72-95. * Lu, Caixia. \"The Kusu Pilgrimage: An Enduring Myth.\" International Institute for Asian Studies Newsletter 59 (Spring 2012): 50-51. ==External links== * Satellite image of Peak Island - Google Maps *Info for visitors on wildsingapore *Kusu Island Coral Reef Survey Data on Coral Reefs of Singapore Category:Islands of Singapore Category:Southern Islands ",
