    "text": "Bill Henderson (William McCranor Henderson) (born 1943, Charlotte, N.C.) is an American author whose writing has explored the mutual influences of popular culture and literature, and the dark side of celebrity.George Myers, Jr. Columbus Dispatch, July 28, 1994Ann Alexander, Greensboro News & Record, March 6, 1992 Boston Magazine noted that his work displays \"a real feel for the sad, ridiculous squalor in America, the tacky bars and beauty shops and motel swimming pools, the even cheaper dreams of the people who hang out at them. What Henderson does best, though, is transform the seedy into musical prose.\"Lee Grove, Boston Magazine, January 1985 Henderson, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer, \"has raided the pop-cult pantheon and managed the estimable feat of breathing new life into the theme of adulation and emulation in a fame-happy era.\" He is best known for his novels Stark Raving Elvis and I Killed Hemingway. ==Writing== Stark Raving Elvis, (E.P. Dutton, 1984), was cited by the St. Louis Dispatch as being \"the first instance\u2026of a serious rock novel.\"Robert Boyd, St. Louis Dispatch, 1984.The Village Voice characterized it as \"profoundly concerned with contemporary American culture and its myths.\"Ed Ward, The Village Voice, January 29, 1985 The New York Times called it \"funny and revealing,\"Nikki Giovanni, New York Times Book Review, December 9, 1984 and The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, \"[Henderson's] writing is nothing if not sure-handed\u2013\u2013lean, taut, oddly graceful... There is dark fun to be had in Stark Raving Elvis. This is a nifty, aptly titled read.\"The Philadelphia Inquirer, November 25, 1984. The Boston Herald followed: \"Henderson has drawn a rich, comic, crazy picture of pop insanity.\"Eric Stange, The Boston Herald, November 18, 1984 And the Houston Chronicle: \"Henderson's work is a moral tale.\" Review, Tracy Santa, The Houston Chronicle,\" 1993 The New York Times named the paperback reissue of Stark Raving Elvis to its April 30, 1987 \"New and Noteworthy\" List. I Killed Hemingway (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's, 1993) was published nine years later, again to positive critical response. \"Henderson's novel is as intricate as a Swiss watch. Fortunately, it runs efficiently\u2014with a strong narrative drive, firm delineation of character, and desperate knowledge of how difficult it is for the central character to make sense of his life, to make peace with his shortcomings, and to define himself authentically.\"Scott Byrd, Spectator Magazine, April 8, 1993 Robert Grudin, in The New York Times Book Review, found that Henderson's thematic probing highlighted the very real complexities of literary celebrity, and concluded the work was \"complex, amusing and palpably symbolic.\".Robert Grudin, review, New York Times Book Review, May 9, 1993 Carl Hiaasen, in The Washington Post, called it \"funny, enthralling, and uncommonly clever.\"Review, Carl Hiaasen, The Washington Post, March 26, 1993 The San Francisco Chronicle called it a \"raucous tale of literary fear and loathing.\" San Francisco Chronicle, April 18, 1993 Publisher's Weekly observed that \"Henderson's dementedly comic, ribald foray into fiction and fact may alter forever the way we perceive the delicate art of biography.\"Publisher's Weekly, January 25, 1993 The Los Angeles Reader noted it was \"a genuine rarity: a work of serious fiction that can entertain,\" and added, \"this masterful novel is strongly recommended.\"Los Angeles Reader, 1993 I Killed Hemingway was a 1993 New York Times Notable Book of the Year.The New York Times Notable Books of the Year, 1993, December 5, 1993 I Elvis, Confessions of a Counterfeit King (1997), provided a perfect opportunity for Henderson to playfully take on the celebrity mantle himself: it is a nonfiction account of how, when challenged by John Talbot, his editor at Putnam-Berkely,I Elvis, Confessions of a Counterfeit King, pp. 4\u20135 Henderson struggled to teach himself the craft of the Elvis impersonator. He then hit the performance trail\"Elvis Breaks Out of Ivory Tower,\" Durham Herald-Sun, July 8, 1997 to amass first-hand experience for what became, in Kirkus Reviews' words, \"a rollicking piece of gonzo journalism.\" Kirkus also hinted at the author's thematic contribution to American fiction: \"Henderson's great achievement is to convey, in elegantly droll prose, what it's like to imagine being a great performer\u2026in the face of real-world evidence to the contrary.\"Kirkus Reviews, June 1, 1997 ==Life== Henderson grew up in Chapel Hill. N.C. By chance, as a teenager, he encountered what he has cited as his major early influence, John Dos Passos' The Big Money, from the U.S.A.
