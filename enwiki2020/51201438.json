Which saw her visit 23 cities nationwide with several international dates in Europe. Initially the tour and release of \"Tringle\" release was a reintroduction for JoJo into the industry with a major label backing that had been lacking from her previous label. At the time a large portion of the album had already been recorded, While the \"Tringle\" was set to appear on JoJo's third album as the first three singles from the album that would each receive service to top 40 radio at different stages leading up to the impending album release. During the tour, Levesque's father Joel died in November due to struggles with addiction and she also broke up with her boyfriend of two years. Following the tour in December 2015, Levesque took a 6-day rest from work during the first week of January, where JoJo booked a hotel and spent time with herself and re-evaluated her life. As a result, JoJo was unhappy with the approach the album was taking and decided to \"take control\" and begun re-recording and re-writing the entire album to fit her new feelings and emotions. The end result was the \"Infectious\" lead single. ==Recording and composition== \"Fuck Apologies\" is an up-tempo pop and R&B; song that infuses twangy guitar rhythms, with a running duration of three minutes and 15 seconds.
