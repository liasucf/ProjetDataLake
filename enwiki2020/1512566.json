    "text": "BS 8110 is an outdated British Standard for the design and construction of reinforced and prestressed concrete structures. It is based on limit state design principles. Although used for most civil engineering and building structures, bridges and water-retaining structures are covered by separate standards (BS 5400 and BS 8007). The relevant committee of the British Standards Institute considers that there is no need to support BS 8110. In the 1990s, and definitively in 2010, BS 8110 was superseded by EN 1992 (Eurocode 2), which is more accurate, economical and adequate to structural design and construction although parts of the standard have been retained in the National Annex of the Eurocode. 08110 Category:Reinforced concrete Category:Structural engineering standards ",
