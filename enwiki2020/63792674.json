He developed his own abstract and geometric style, inspired by Selman Selmanagi\u0107. After his studies, M\u00fcller returned to Leipzig and produced abstract sculptures inspired by Jean Arp and Buckminster Fuller. He did not exhibit his works, but participated in architectural projects across the city of Leipzig in the 1960s and 1970s. He notably sculpted the aluminum facade of the Blechb\u00fcchse and sculptures of the Sachsenplatz fountain. ==References== Category:1930 births Category:2020 deaths Category:German sculptors Category:Artists from Leipzig ",
