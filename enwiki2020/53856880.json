In a positive review, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the project \"erratic, sometimes transfixingly so,\" stating that \"Playboi Carti\u2019s album takes hip- hop\u2019s ad-lib era to its logical extreme \u2014 everything sounds like an ad-lib, even the main lyrics.\" In a more negative review, HipHopDX critic Narshima Chintaluri described the record as \"simply a glorified beat tape with ad- libs\", stating Carti \"need[s] to further develop his songwriting in order to maintain this allure alongside his more successful contemporaries.\" Brian Duricy of PopMatters described the record as \"the sonic equivalent of the stereotypical laissez-faire worker who breezes through presentations on sheer personality alone,\" stating that \"over the production, however, you\u2019re not getting particularly much.\" Pitchfork's Briana Younger wrote that \"Playboi Carti feels like a break from life, the soundtrack to a mindless good time,\" and adding that \"Carti is tactful in discerning where and when he can get away with letting the instrumental ride and when he needs to rise to the occasion.\" The single \"Magnolia\" was awarded Best New Track by Pitchfork. ===Accolades=== The mixtape appeared on 2017 year-end album lists by publications such as Fact, Pitchfork, and Tiny Mix Tapes. John Twells of Fact stated that the project \"adeptly taps into a widespread youthful malaise and the genre-fluid playlist culture that has come to dominate rap\u2019s mainstream [...] Sad and restless but also party-ready, Playboi Carti doesn\u2019t need political rambling or conscious posturing to get its message across.\" Corrigan B of Tiny Mix Tapes wrote that \"of everything that 2017 promised about rap\u2019s future, Playboi Carti felt the most like a real path forward, a crystallization of the SoundCloud underground\u2019s zeitgeist in a format built to transcend the scene\u2019s messy adolescence.\" {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
