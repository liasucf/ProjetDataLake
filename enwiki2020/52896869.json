    "text": "H\u00e6geland is a former municipality in Vest-Agder county, Norway. The municipality existed from 1896 until its dissolution in 1964. The municipality was located in the northwestern part of the present-day municipality of Vennesla. The administrative centre was the village of H\u00e6gelandskrossen where H\u00e6geland Church is located. ==History== The municipality of H\u00e6geland was established on 1 July 1896 when the old municipality of \u00d8vreb\u00f8 og H\u00e6geland was divided into the separate municipalities of H\u00e6geland (population: 843) and \u00d8vreb\u00f8 (population: 888). During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of H\u00e6geland (population: 849) was dissolved and merged with the neighboring municipalities of Vennesla (population: 7,321), and most of \u00d8vreb\u00f8 (population: 925) to form a new Vennesla municipality. (Vennesla was previously part of the old municipality of \u00d8vreb\u00f8 og H\u00e6geland until 1865). ==Name== The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old H\u00e6geland farm (Old Norse: Helgaland) since that is where the H\u00e6geland Church was located. The first element of the name means \"holy\" (Old Norse: heilagr and ) and the last element (Old Norse: land) is identical with the word land which means \"land\". This area was important to ancient Norse pagan worship. ==See also== *List of former municipalities of Norway ==References== Category:Former municipalities of Norway Category:Vennesla ",
