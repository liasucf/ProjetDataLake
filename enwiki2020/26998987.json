The aircraft is a high-wing, tandem seat monoplane with conventional landing gear. The fuselage is constructed with welded steel tubing with doped Superflite aircraft fabric. In April 2015 the Super Legend design was further developed with the addition of a greater number of carbon fibre components, including doors, floorboards, the propeller spinner and the wingtip bows. Avionic upgrades include Garmin G3X avionics and a FreeFlight Systems 1201 WAAS GPS sensor, Trig Mode S and 1090ES ADS-B Out transponder. ==Variants== ; Diesel Engine : In July of 2015, American Legend Aircraft and Superior Air Parts (makers of the Gemini engine) announced that the 100-horsepower Gemini turbo-charged diesel engine would be available in 2016 as an option throughout the American Legend product line.
