    "text": "The Swiss Medical Students\u2019 Association (swimsa) is an independent association representing all medical students in Switzerland. It was founded in 1917, and currently maintains 22 member organisations, 7 of which are local medical students' associations and 15 are public health and awareness organisations/projects. All medical students of Basel, Bern, Fribourg, Geneva, Lausanne and Zurich are represented on a national and international level. ==History== In 1917, the medical faculties of Switzerland unites to form the Association of Swiss Clinicians (Verband der Schweizer Klinkerschaften, VDSK). In 1951 the IFMSA (International Federation of Medical Students' Associations) was founded by the VDSK and associations of six other countries in Copenhagen, Denmark. History on the official website of IFMSA History on the official website from swimsa From then on the IFMSA has been representing the interests of medical students on an international level. Later on the VDSK underwent a reform to become the Association of Swiss Medical Students (Verband der Schweizer Medizinstudenten) VSM, from which the organization IFMSA Switzerland had split, concentrating solely on professional clinical exchange for medical students. In 2006 the VMS and IFMSA Switzerland approached each other and decided to create a joined venture under the name of Swiss Medical Students\u2019 Association (swimsa). Nonetheless IFMSA-Switzerland mutated to swimsa Exchanges and remained a legally independent organization, still taking care of international exchanges. Further founding members of swimsa were the medical student organizations Achtung Liebe, promoting sexual health and education, and Gruhu, enabling medical students to volunteer for clinical electives in third world countries. In 2014 the organization swimsa Exchanges was dissolved and formally integrated into swimsa. ==Member Organisations== The student councils of the medical faculties of Basel, Berne, Fribourg, Geneva, Lausanne and Zurich are recognized as members of swimsa with voting rights at the national delegate assembly, which takes place twice a year. Other medical student organizations, also known as swimsa projects, are represented as members with voting rights as well. Currently there are ten such organizations/projects. Usually the organization/projects have their own constitutions and are as such de jure independent from swimsa. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Medical Faculty !! Full Name !! University !!
