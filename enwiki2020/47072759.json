He was from Gusinje, hence his byname. At the start of the Serbian uprising against the Dahije (1804), Gu\u0161anac was in Jagodina. He was subsequently appointed commander of Belgrade by the Dahije. ==Sources== * * Category:People of the First Serbian Uprising Category:Rebels of the Ottoman Empire Category:People from Gusinje ",
