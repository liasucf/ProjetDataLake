    "text": "The River Stour is an English river that rises in the county of Oxfordshire but largely flows through Warwickshire. It is a tributary of the Avon, which it joins just south west of Stratford-upon-Avon. The source of the River Stour is a spring near Highways Farm, just south of Swalcliffe. Some to the west, it crosses the Oxfordshire/Warwickshire border near Traitor's Ford. The first settlement that the river flows through is the village of Stourton. The River Stour then turns to the north and passes through the town of Shipston-on- Stour. The A3400 road roughly follows the course of the river to Stratford- upon-Avon, through the villages of Halford, Alderminster, Newbold-on-Stour, Atherstone-on-Stour and Clifford Chambers. ==See also== *Rivers of the United Kingdom ==External links== * Stour Stour 1Stour ",
