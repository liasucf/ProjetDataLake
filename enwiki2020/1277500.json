In 1939, the Romanian state signed a contract with the German company Ferrostaal of Essen to build a factory (called \"Ucea\") on the site of what is now Victoria. The contract was canceled after Romania declared war on Germany in 1944, during World War II. The building of the town began in 1949 and it had the provisional names of \"Colonia Ucea\" and \"Ucea Ro\u0219ie\" (Red Ucea), only to be changed in November 1954 to Victoria. ==Twin towns == * Chevilly-Larue, France (1994) * Utrechtse Heuvelrug, Netherlands (2005) * Lariano, Italy (2007) ==References== ==External links== * www.orasulvictoria.ro Category:Monotowns in Romania Category:Populated places established in 1949 Category:Populated places in Bra\u0219ov County Category:Localities in Transylvania Category:Planned cities in Romania Category:Socialist planned cities Category:Towns in Romania ",
