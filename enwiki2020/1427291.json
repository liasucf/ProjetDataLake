Rison was selected to the Pro Bowl five times, from 1990\u20131993 and once again in 1997. Rison won a Super Bowl championship with the Packers in 1996 over the New England Patriots, scoring the first points of the game on a 54-yard touchdown catch from quarterback Brett Favre. He also won a Grey Cup championship with the Toronto Argonauts in 2004. He is one of the few players to win professional football championships in both the United States of America and Canada. He was released by the Argonauts during the 2005 CFL season. He holds an NFL record for scoring a touchdown with 7 teams. He was a star player at Flint Northwestern High School and in college at Michigan State University. As a senior at Michigan State, Rison had 30 receptions for 709 yards and 5 touchdowns; he was a prominent contributor to the 1987 Michigan State squad that won the Rose Bowl on January 1, 1988. ==Professional career== ===Indianapolis Colts=== The Indianapolis Colts selected Rison in the first round (22nd overall) of the 1989 NFL Draft. In his rookie season, he caught 52 passes for 820 yards with four touchdown receptions. ===Atlanta Falcons=== On April 20, 1990, the Indianapolis Colts traded Rison, Chris Hinton, a fifth round pick in the 1990 NFL Draft, and their first round pick on the 1991 NFL Draft to the Atlanta Falcons for their first overall pick and their fourth round pick in the 1990 NFL Draft. The Indianapolis Colts used the trade to move up to select Jeff George first overall in the 1990 NFL Draft. His next season marked the first of five very productive campaigns with the Falcons. During these years, Rison finished near the top of most receiving categories, and led all NFL players with 15 receiving touchdowns in 1993. Andre Rison was only the 5th Receiver in NFL history to score 60 touchdowns in his first six seasons. Rison led the NFL in most receptions in his first four and first five seasons.

During his final season in Atlanta, on June 9, 1994, his girlfriend at the time Lisa Left Eye Lopes from TLC burned Rison's house down. ===Cleveland Browns=== After the 1994 season, Rison signed a lucrative free agent contract with Cleveland, where he was expected to become the featured receiving threat for the Browns, who had made the playoffs the year before. Rison, who had been named to the Pro Bowl in four of his previous six seasons, had career lows in receptions (47), yards (701), touchdowns (3), receptions per game (2.9), and yards per game (43.8). Rison also developed a feud with the Cleveland fans, who were angered over the announcement that the team would be relocating to Baltimore. After a home loss to the Packers, Rison, who had been booed by the fans throughout the game, lashed out, stating, \"We didn't make the fucking move. So, for all the booers, fuck you too. I'll be glad when we get to Baltimore, if that's the case. We don't have any home-field advantage. I've never been booed at home. Baltimore's our home. Baltimore, here we come.\" Rison, however, did not make the move with the team to Baltimore as he joined the Jacksonville Jaguars in the offseason. ===Jacksonville Jaguars, Green Bay Packers, Kansas City Chiefs, Oakland Raiders=== Rison had a very short stint with the Jaguars, and joined the Packers in 1996. He won a Super Bowl in his stint with the Packers. He signed with the Chiefs prior to the 1997 season. He made it to the Pro Bowl after a solid first year with the Chiefs. His 2nd season was less successful. In his final NFL season, with the Raiders in 2000, Rison had 41 catches for 606 yards and 6 touchdowns. Rison finished his NFL career with 743 receptions for 10,205 yards and 84 touchdowns, along with 8 kickoff returns for 150 yards and 9 carries for 23 yards. ===Toronto Argonauts=== He signed with the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League in August 2004, who went on to win the 92nd Grey Cup championship that year.

During his three-season stint with Kansas City, Rison was nicknamed Spider-Man and would often fake shooting a web, like Spider-Man after scoring a touchdown. Rison gave himself the nickname in part because he viewed Spider-Man as a positive character and wanted to be thought of as less of a headache and problem. His \"Spider-Man\" nickname has been named one of the best nicknames in sports history by Bleacher Report. ==Life after football== ===Coaching=== In the 2006\u20132008 high school football seasons, Rison was assistant coach at Beecher High School in Flint, Michigan.

Not only did these games showcase two former NFL players coaching at their alma maters, but the schools are so close geographically that it made for an intriguing and intense rivalry. The crowds came in large numbers for both games, which forced each game to Flint's 11,000 seat Atwood Stadium, instead of Flint Beecher's Russ Reynolds Field, or Flint Northwestern's Guy V.
