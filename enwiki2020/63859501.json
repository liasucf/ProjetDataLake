    "text": "UAAP Season 83 will be the 2020\u201321 athletic year of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP). This season will be hosted by the De La Salle University. Eight member universities of the UAAP will be competing in the league's sixteen sport disciplines to vie for the general championship. The COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines caused Season 82, which was supposed to end in May 2020, to be cancelled in April 2020. This had to be done to avoid logistical issues in organizing Season 83, which is planned to open in January 2021 instead of the usual September, taking into account training that is usually held months prior to the opening of a UAAP season and the imposition of general community quarantine measures in Metro Manila. Unlike NCAA Season 96 which was curtailed to hold just four regular sports, UAAP Season 83 will retain a full calendar with 15 sports. All events are to be held during the second semester of the 2020\u201321 academic year, with the basketball and volleyball tournaments, two events that are traditionally conducted in different semesters, to be held simultaneously. ==See also== * NCAA Season 96 ==References== 83 UAAP UAAP ",
