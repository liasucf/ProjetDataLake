John senior was in partnership with his son Joseph Crew Boulcott (1788-1850) with a yard in Narrow St, Ratcliff, London, by June 1810.London Lives, accessed 17 March 2019 That business continued to operate till 1834 under the name of John Boulcott & Son.

Jones (1992), Ships employed in the South Seas Trade 1775-1859, Vol 2, Canberra, Roebuck, p.236. Shipbrokers were maritime middlemen, intermediaries who brought together sellers and buyers of shipping in return for a commission payment from each. Some also functioned as shipping agents or vessel managers, finding crews, cargoes and passengers, supplying provisions and equipment and arranging insurance and handling port clearance documents for departing ships. For arriving vessels they would supervise the payment of crews, oversee the discharge of passengers and cargo, pay any customs duties due and arrange necessary maintenance and repair on the vessel. Boulcott seems to have specialised in providing these services to whaling and sealing vessels based in London.A.G.E.
