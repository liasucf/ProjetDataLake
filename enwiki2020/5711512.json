    "text": "The National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) Men's Division II Basketball Championships consists of sixteen teams playing over a five-day period (Wednesday through Saturday) in March to determine a National Champion. == About the tournament == Teams qualify for the tournament by first winning their district/region championships. The NJCAA Division II Men's Basketball Committee then seeds the top eight teams and uses a blind draw to place the remaining eight teams. When choosing the top eight seeds for the tournament, the three criteria that are considered by the committee are the national poll, the coaches' rankings, and each team's history. Since 1994, Danville Area Community College has hosted the tournament in the Mary Miller Gymnasium. == Past results == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" font=90%\" | Year || Winner ||Runner-up || Score |- | 1986 || Parkland College || Keystone Junior College || 88-72 |- | 1987 || Oakland Community College || Community College of Allegheny County || 91-90 (OT) |- | 1988 || Lansing Community College || Parkland College || 91-85 |- | 1989 || Delta College || St. Louis Community College (Meramec) || 77-71 |- | 1990 || Community College of Allegheny County || Muskegon Community College || 85-76 |- | 1991 || Danville Area Community College || Brookhaven College || 89-81 |- | 1992 || Owens Technical College || Iowa Lakes Community College || 105-86 |- | 1993 || Owens Technical College || Northeastern Christian Junior College || 109-85 |- | 1994 || Joliet Junior College || Owens Technical College || 85-80 |- | 1995 || North Iowa Area Community College || Grand Rapids Community College || 64-63 |- | 1996 || Penn Valley Community College || Kishwaukee College || 93-88 |- | 1997 || Community College of Beaver County || Penn Valley Community College || 83-81 |- | 1998 || Kirkwood Community College || Sinclair Community College || 73-61 |- | 1999 || Brown Mackie College || Danville Area Community College || 68-63 |- | 2000 || Community College of Baltimore County || Rose State College || 88-77 |- | 2001 || Johnson County Community College || Mott Community College || 91-76 |- | 2002 || Redlands Community College || Penn Valley Community College || 58-57 |- | 2003 || Mott Community College || Lackawanna College || 76-75 (OT) |- | 2004 || Cuyahoga Community College || Mott Community College || 74-67 |- | 2005 || Brown Mackie College || Kirkwood Community College || 77-65 |- | 2006 || Cecil Community College || Kirkwood Community College || 64-63 |- | 2007 || Mott Community College || Monroe Community College || 75-61 |- | 2008 || Mott Community College || Columbus State Community College || 83-73 |- | 2009 || Johnson County Community College || Kirkwood Community College || 63-49 |- | 2010 || Lincoln College || Cincinnati State Community College || 71-60 |- | 2011 || Lincoln College || Mott Community College || 74-67 |- | 2012 || Mott Community College || Community College of Rhode Island || 70-60 |- | 2013 || Rend Lake College || Moraine Valley Community College || 87-69 |- | 2014 || Phoenix College || Essex County College || 71-67 |- | 2015 || Richard Bland College || John Wood Community College || 64-53 |- | 2016 || Kirkwood Community College || Triton College || 83-76 |- | 2017 || Southwestern Community College || Louisburg College || 77-52 |} == See also == *List of Division 2 NJCAA schools *NJCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship *NJCAA Men's Division III Basketball Championship *NJCAA Women's Basketball Championship == References == Basketball, Men's Division II ",
