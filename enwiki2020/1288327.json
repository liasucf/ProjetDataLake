    "text": "World in Motion is the ninth album by American singer-songwriter Jackson Browne, released in 1989 (see 1989 in music). It peaked at number 45 on The Billboard 200 and was Browne's first album to obtain neither gold nor platinum status. The album took three years to complete and makes statements about nuclear disarmament and the \"secret\" government that brought forth Oliver North and the Iran-Contra scandal. ==Reception== The critical reviews of World in Motion were lukewarm. Music critic William Rulhmann wrote \"Except for the gloomy viewpoint, it was hard to recognize the Jackson Browne of his first few albums amid all the commentary, and even if you agreed with his overall political stance, that was disappointing.\" Critic Robert Christgau commented that the best songs were the ones Browne did not write. Rolling Stone wrote, \"Steven Van Zandt's 'I Am a Patriot' is the only truly memorable song on Browne's trilogy of protest albums.\" ==Track listing== All tracks composed by Browne except where noted: #\"World in Motion\" (Browne, Craig Doerge) \u2013 4:24 #\"Enough of the Night\" \u2013 4:54 #\"Chasing You into the Light\" \u2013 4:16 #\"How Long\" \u2013 6:10 #\"Anything Can Happen\" \u2013 5:05 #\"When the Stone Begins to Turn\" \u2013 4:48 #\"The Word Justice\" (Browne, Scott Thurston) \u2013 4:18 #\"My Personal Revenge\" (Tom\u00e1s Borge, Luis Enrique Mej\u00eda Godoy, translation by Jorge Calder\u00f3n) \u2013 4:02 #\"I Am a Patriot\" (Steven Van Zandt) \u2013 4:02 #\"Lights and Virtues\" \u2013 4:53 ==Personnel== * Jackson Browne \u2013 lead vocals, slide guitar (1), resonator guitar (1), piano (2, 5, 7), baritone guitar (3, 10), keyboards (4), drum programming (4) * Alex Acu\u00f1a \u2013 percussion (2, 5) * David Crosby \u2013 harmony vocals (7) * Craig Doerge \u2013 keyboards (1, 4) * Djene Doumbouya \u2013 harmony vocals (6) * Kevin Dukes \u2013 guitar (1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10), acoustic guitar (3, 8), electric guitar (8) * Sly Dunbar \u2013 drums (6) * Brinsley Dan Forde \u2013 harmony vocals (6) * Tony Gad \u2013 harmony vocals (6) * Bob Glaub \u2013 bass guitar (2, 3, 4, 8, 9), guitar (7) * Doug Haywood \u2013 harmony vocals (1, 6, 9), keyboards (7), organ (9) * Michael Jochum \u2013 drums (1, 2, 3, 7\u201310), tom tom (6) * Salif Keita \u2013 Malian vocals (6) * Russ Kunkel \u2013 drums (4), drum programming (5) * Ray Lema \u2013 keyboards (6), harmony vocals (6) * David Lindley \u2013 lap steel guitar (4) * Yves N'Djock \u2013 guitar (6) * Hugo Pedroza \u2013 charango (8), tiple (8) * Bonnie Raitt \u2013 harmony vocals (1) * Walfredo Reyes, Jr. \u2013 drums (5) * Robbie Shakespeare \u2013 bass (6) * Jorge Strunz \u2013 acoustic gut-string guitar (8) * Scott Thurston \u2013 bass (1, 7, 10), harmony vocals (1, 2, 6, 7, 9), keyboards (2\u20138, 10), guitar (5), guitar solo (8) * Lori B.
