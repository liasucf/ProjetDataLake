He leads a trio with bassist William Parker and drummer Donald Robinson.Cherry Box at EremiteMarco Eneidi discography by Rick Lopez ==Reception== In his review for AllMusic, Steve Loewy states \"Eneidi's somewhat thin sound is distinguished by its wailing quality, one that combines the searing cry of the prophet with a Bird-like post-bop energy..\" The Penguin Guide to Jazz says \"The 1998 trio shows off Eneidi at his best, blowing fiercely enough to make his wiry saxophone sound glow with energy. Parker does his usual thing, but Robinson is the real star of the piece, providing a tireless but subtle accompaniment.\" ==Track listing== All compositions by Eneidi, Robinson, Parker. # \"Cherry Box\" \u2013 4:11 # \"Slashing the Bird\" \u2013 13:50 # \"Forget It\" \u2013 13:56 # \"Barbequed Brahms\" \u2013 19:04 # \"One More Thing\" \u2013 12:34 # \"Spank\" \u2013 5:42 ==Personnel== *Marco Eneidi \u2013 alto saxophone *William Parker \u2013 bass *Donald Robinson \u2013 drums ==References== Category:2000 albums Category:Marco Eneidi albums Category:Eremite Records albums ",
