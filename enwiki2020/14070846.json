    "text": "\"Break Every Rule\" is a song by recording artist Tina Turner. It was the title track to both Turner's 1986 album of the same name and the name of her 1987-88 \"Break Every Rule World Tour\". It was released as a single in early 1987 to support the album and the tour. The song found limited success on the US and UK singles charts. The music video shows Turner performing on stage as well as behind-the-scenes footage of Turner and her band from the tour. The song was written by British composer and singer Rupert Hine and his then girlfriend Jeanette Obstoj, who had previously composed \"I Might Have Been Queen\" which was featured on Turner's Private Dancer album. The \"Break Every Rule\" 12\" single included both an Extended Dance Mix and an Extended Rock Mix. ==Music video== The official music video for the song was directed by Andy Morahan. ==Versions and remixes== * 7\" edit \u2013 3:48 * Album version \u2013 4:02 * Extended Dance Mix \u2013 8:46 * Extended Rock Mix \u2013 7:02 ==Chart performance== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !scope=\"col\"| Chart (1987) !scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (Kent Music Report) | 60 |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (European Hot 100 Singles) | 44 |- !scope=\"row\"|Germany (Official German Charts) | 38 |- |- |- |} == References == Category:1986 songs Category:1987 singles Category:Capitol Records singles Category:Music videos directed by Andy Morahan Category:Song recordings produced by Rupert Hine Category:Songs written by Rupert Hine Category:Tina Turner songs Category:Songs written by Jeannette Obstoj ",
