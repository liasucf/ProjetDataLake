    "text": "Le Grand Mogol (\"The Grand Mughal\") as imagined by French cartographer Alain Manesson Mallet (Paris, 1683) Grand Mughal or Mogul, also Great Mughal, is a title coined by Europeans for the ruler of the Mughal Empire of India. The Mughals themselves used the title Padishah. The title is especially associated with the third in the line, Akbar the Great (1542-1605). It is said that the Portuguese called Akbar the Grand Mughal and sent Jesuit missionaries to convert him to Catholicism. The Mughal empire was romanticized in Europe, particularly from the sixteenth century onward. The empire's court at Agra, for instance, was often described in glowing terms. An account stated that it is not uncommon for Britons living in India to adopt the Mughal culture. The Mughal rule persisted until the mid-nineteenth century, ending in 1737 with the death of the sixth Mughal emperor, Aurangzeb (an account also cited Nadir Shah's invasion as the cause of the empire's demise). In the same way the Ottoman sultan was known as the \"Grand Turk\". ==References== Category:Heads of state Category:Royal titles Category:Mughal emperors ",
