    "text": "RIS is a standardized tag format developed by Research Information Systems, Incorporated (the format name refers to the company) to enable citation programs to exchange data.The origin of the name RIS was obtained via email from Henry Johnson, a Customer Technical Representative at Scientific Thomson Reuters. Research Information Systems was owned by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). RIS, the creators of Reference Manager which had also previously bought ProCite from Personal Bibliographic Software Inc, merged with Niles software, the creators of EndNote. The result of the merger was the creation of ISI ResearchSoft, a subsidiary of Thomson Reuters, which produces Reference Manager, EndNote and ProCite. Email date 7/3/08. It is supported by a number of reference managers. Many digital libraries, like IEEE Xplore, Scopus, the ACM Portal, Scopemed, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, Rayyan QCRI, Accordance Bible Softwarehttps://www.accordancebible.com/New- Features-112, and online library catalogs can export citations in this format. Citation management applications such as RefWorks, Zotero, Citavi, Papers, Mendeley, and EndNote can export and import citations in this format. == Format == The RIS file format\u2014two letters, two spaces and a hyphen\u2014is a tagged format for expressing bibliographic citations. According to the specifications, the lines must end with the ASCII carriage return and line feed characters. Note that this is the convention on Microsoft Windows, while in other contemporary operating systems, particularly Unix, the end of line is typically marked by line feed only. Multiple citation records can be present in a single RIS file. A record ends with an \"end record\" tag with no additional blank lines between records. === Example record === This is an example of how the article \"Claude E. Shannon. A mathematical theory of communication. Bell System Technical Journal, 27:379\u2013423, July 1948\" would be expressed in the RIS file format: TY - JOUR AU - Shannon, Claude E. PY - 1948/07// TI - A Mathematical Theory of Communication T2 - Bell System Technical Journal SP - 379 EP - 423 VL - 27 ER - === Example multi-record format === This is an example of how two citation records would be expressed in a single RIS file. Note the first record ends with and the second record begins with : TY - JOUR AU - Shannon, Claude E. PY - 1948/07// TI - A Mathematical Theory of Communication T2 - Bell System Technical Journal SP - 379 EP - 423 VL - 27 ER - TY - JOUR T1 - On computable numbers, with an application to the Entscheidungsproblem A1 - Turing, Alan Mathison JO - Proc. of London Mathematical Society VL - 47 IS - 1 SP - 230 EP - 265 Y1 - 1937 ER - == Tags == There are two major versions of the RIS specification. The second version, introduced near the end of 2011 has different lists of tags for each type of record, sometimes with different meanings. Below is an excerpt of the main RIS tags, from both versions. Except for and , order of tags is free and their inclusion is optional. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ RIS format fields |- ! Tag !!
