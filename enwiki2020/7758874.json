    "text": "Luise\u00f1o traditional narratives include myths, legends, tales, and oral histories preserved by the Luise\u00f1o people of southwestern California. Luise\u00f1o oral literature is very similar to that of the Luise\u00f1o's Takic-speaking relatives to the north and east, and also to that of their Yuman neighbors to the south. Particularly prominent are several versions of the Southern California Creation Myth.
