The charity is the sole organiser of the annual Srebrenica Memorial Week which culminates in Srebrenica Memorial Day on July 11. Dr Waqar Azmi OBE founded Remembering Srebrenica in 2013 and is Chairman of the charity. The President of the charity is Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth and the Director is Amil Khan. Remembering Srebrenica is part funded by the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government and works to build a better, safer, more cohesive society. This is done through ensuring the victims of the genocide are remembered, lessons are learned from the atrocity through educational visits and through community champions who pledge to stand up to hatred and intolerance. ==Origins== In 2009, The European Parliament adopted the resolution on Srebrenica calling \"on the Council and the Commission to commemorate appropriately the anniversary of the Srebrenica-Poto\u010dari act of genocide by supporting Parliament's recognition of 11 July as the day of commemoration of the Srebrenica genocide all over the EU, and to call on all the countries of the western Balkans to do the same\".European Parliament (2009) OJC 157 E, 6.7.2006, p. 468, http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&reference;=P6-TA-2009-0028&language;=EN In implementing the European Parliament Resolution, Prime Minister David Cameron announced support for Remembering Srebrenica in 2013 on the 18th anniversary of Srebrenica Memorial Day. The Prime Minister said: \"Srebrenica was a stark demonstration of what can happen when hatred, discrimination and evil are allowed to go unchecked. I am pleased that the government has been able to work with Remembering Srebrenica, an initiative dedicated to commemorating and honouring the victims of Srebrenica\". On Srebrenica Memorial Day, Prime Minister David Cameron also \"met with three survivors of the Srebrenica genocide at Downing Street. The survivors shared their experiences of Srebrenica, and the Prime Minister stressed how important it was that we never forget what happened during this most shameful moment in European history\".Prime Minister's Office, 10 Downing Street, 11 July 2013, '18th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide: Prime Minister\u2019s statement', London, https://www.gov.uk/government/news/18th-anniversary-of-the-srebrenica- genocide-prime-ministers-statement In 2014, Foreign Secretary William Hague MP, and the Special Envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Angelina Jolie during their visit to Srebrenica announced \"new UK funding that will enable 750 young people from Britain to visit Srebrenica over the next two years through the Remembering Srebrenica programme, so that the lessons from the Bosnian conflict are never forgotten.Foreign & Commonwealth Office (27 March 2014), 'Foreign Secretary and UNHCR Special Envoy visit Bosnia ahead of Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict', London, https://www.gov.uk/government/news/william-hague-and-angelina-jolie-on-joint- visit-to-bosnia ==Support== Remembering Srebrenica's work has received broad support from numerous high-profile figures. During the commemoration of the 25th anniversary, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"There are those who would prefer to forget or deny the enormity of what took place. We must not allow that to happen. We owe it to the victims and to future generations to remember Srebrenica and to ensure it never happens again.\" HRH Prince Charles said: \"By remembering the pain of the past and learning its lessons, we can together resolve that it must never happen again. This is why the work of organisations such as the United Kingdom\u2019s Remembering Srebrenica is so vitally important and why, 25 years after these terrible crimes were committed, we should stand in determined solidarity with those who have lost so much.\u201d Adama Dieng, former UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, said: \"Remembering Srebrenica is working to raise awareness on the terrible tragedy and to educate on the consequences of hatred and intolerance. This work is essential everywhere.\" Cardinal Vincent Nichols said \"The programmes of education that organisations like Remembering Srebrenica UK...do [are] just so important.\" == Boards == === National and regional boards === Remembering Srebrenica has eleven national and regional boards across the UK that play a key role in organising and coordinating memorial events in their areas.
