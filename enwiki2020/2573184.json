    "text": "The Oceania Footballer of the Year award is presented each year to the best football (soccer) player from the Oceania region, as chosen by a panel of football journalists. The award was dominated by Australian players until that nation became part of the Asian Football Confederation, and is now similarly dominated by New Zealand players. New Zealand's Wynton Rufer is tied with Harry Kewell for the most titles with three awards each, whilst New Caledonia's Christian Karembeu, New Zealand's Shane Smeltz and Ryan Nelsen and Australia's Robbie Slater have each won the award twice. ==Winners== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Player !Team |- |align=\"center\"|1988 | Frank Farina | Club Brugge |- |align=\"center\"|1989 | Wynton Rufer | Grasshopper |- |align=\"center\"|1990 | Wynton Rufer | Werder Bremen |- |align=\"center\"|1991 | Robbie Slater | Lens |- |align=\"center\"|1992 | Wynton Rufer | Werder Bremen |- |align=\"center\"|1993 | Robbie Slater | Lens |- |align=\"center\"|1994 | Aurelio Vidmar | Standard Li\u00e8ge |- |align=\"center\"|1995 | Christian KarembeuKarembeu was born in New Caledonia, although he represented France at international level | Sampdoria |- |align=\"center\"|1996 | Paul Okon | Lazio |- |align=\"center\"|1997 | Mark Bosnich | Aston Villa |- |align=\"center\"|1998 | Christian KarembeuKarembeu was born in New Caledonia, although he represented France at international level | Real Madrid |- |align=\"center\"|1999 | Harry Kewell | Leeds United |- |align=\"center\"|2000 | Mark Viduka | Leeds United |- |align=\"center\"|2001 | Harry Kewell | Leeds United |- |align=\"center\"|2002 | Brett Emerton | Feyenoord |- |align=\"center\"|2003 | Harry Kewell | Liverpool |- |align=\"center\"|2004 | Tim Cahill | Everton |- |align=\"center\"|2005 | Marama Vahirua | Nice |- |align=\"center\"|2006 | Ryan Nelsen | Blackburn Rovers |- |align=\"center\"|2007 | Shane Smeltz | Wellington Phoenix |- |align=\"center\"|2008 | Shane Smeltz | Wellington Phoenix |- |align=\"center\"|2009 | Ivan Vicelich | Auckland City |- |align=\"center\"|2010 | Ryan Nelsen | Blackburn Rovers |- |align=\"center\"|2011 | Bertrand Ka\u00ef | Hiengh\u00e8ne Sport |- |align=\"center\"|2012 | Marco Rojas | Melbourne Victory |- |align=\"center\"|2015 | Ryan Thomas | PEC Zwolle |} ==Winners by Country== {| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font- size: 95%;\" |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\" !Tally !Country |- |12 | Australia |- |10 | New Zealand |- |3 | New Caledonia |- |1 | Tahiti |- |} == Other Oceania Awards == Wynton Rufer was voted as the Oceania Footballer of the Century.
