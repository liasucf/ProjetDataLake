The place may have used for worship by the pre-Christian Angles. Wye became an important ancient communications centre because of the ford across the River Great Stour connecting the parts of the ancient trackway across the North Downs at this point. The Romans constructed their road between Canterbury and Hastings using the gap through the North Downs; remains of a Roman camp and villa have been found. By medieval times the town was a market and meeting place of the hundred court.Open Domesday Online: Wye, Kent, accessed January 2019. In the later 18th century the new turnpike had bypassed the village on the opposite bank of the river; the main A28 road does the same today.
