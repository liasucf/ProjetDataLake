    "text": "Charles A. Dinarello (born April 22, 1943) is a professor of medicine currently at the University of Colorado at Denver. He is an expert on inflammatory cytokines, specifically Interleukin 1. Dinarello received his Doctor of Medicine in 1969 at Yale University and since 1996, he is Professor of Medicine at University of Colorado School of Medicine. He is also Professor of Experimental Medicine at the Radboud University Medical Center in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Dinarello is considered one of the founding fathers of cytokines having purified and cloned interleukin-1. This important step established the validation of cytokines as mediators of disease, particularly of inflammation. Current studies blocking IL-1 in humans supports Dinarello's and his co-workers pivotal contributions to cytokine biology and the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. He is fluent in English, Italian and German. ==Awards== * 1993: Ernst Jung Prize * 2006: Hamdan Award for Medical Research Excellence, awarded by Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum Award for Medical Sciences, Dubai, United Arab Emirates * 2009: Crafoord Prize in Polyarthritis (together with Tadamitsu Kishimoto and Toshio Hirano) \u201cfor their pioneering work to isolate interleukins, determine their properties and explore their role in the onset of inflammatory diseases\u201d.Press Release of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences * 2009: Albany Medical Center Prize (shared with Ralph M.
