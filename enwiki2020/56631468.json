    "text": "The Indian Super Cup was Indian football's annual match contested between the champions of the previous I-League season and the holders of the Federation Cup, usually held at a neutral venue. If the I-League champions also won the Federation Cup then the league runners-up would provide the opposition. The fixture was usually considered the curtain raiser to the Indian football domestic season. The fixture was last contested in 2011 when East Bengal won the cup for the third time, defeating Salgaocar 9\u20138 on penalties. ==History== The Indian Super Cup was started in 1997 by the All India Football Federation as a playoff between the then National Football League champions and Federation Cup holders. The first edition took place that year between the 1996\u201397 NFL (first season in league history) champions JCT Mills and 1996 Federation Cup holders East Bengal. After the match ended 0\u20130, East Bengal won the first Super Cup on penalties 4\u20132. Salgaocar proceeded to win the next two editions of the Super Cup before the tournament was suspended for three seasons. When the cup returned in 2003 Mahindra United defeated East Bengal on penalties 4\u20133 after drawing them 1\u20131. The cup was then held seven more times before being suspended and hasn't been played since the 2011 fixture. ==Records== * The most successful side in the Indian Super Cup is East Bengal. The club have won the annual fixture three times. * The biggest victory in the Super Cup was during the 2007 fixture when Mohun Bagan defeated Dempo 4\u20130 at the Tau Devi Lal Stadium. * Salgaocar have won the cup consecutively the most times (2) in 1998 and 1999. * Sporting Goa are the only side to have won the Super Cup, without winning the league or Federation Cup. ==Results and winners== ===Results=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Year !scope=\"col\"|Winner !scope=\"col\"|Score !scope=\"col\"|Runner-up !scope=\"col\"|Venue |- |1997 |East Bengal |0\u20130 (4\u20132p) |JCT Mills |Salt Lake Stadium |- |1998 |Salgaocar |1\u20130 |Mohun Bagan |Salt Lake Stadium |- |1999 |Salgaocar |1\u20130 |Mohun Bagan |Ambedkar Stadium |- |colspan=\"5\"|Tournament suspended between 2000 and 2002 |- |2003 |Mahindra United |1\u20131 (4\u20133p) |East Bengal |Salt Lake Stadium |- |2005 |Sporting Goa |3\u20130 |Dempo |EMS Stadium |- |2006 |East Bengal |2\u20131 |Mahindra United |Cooperage Ground |- |2007 |Mohun Bagan |4\u20130 |Dempo |Tau Devi Lal Stadium |- |2008 |Dempo |1\u20130 |East Bengal |Tau Devi Lal Stadium |- |2009 |Mohun Bagan |2\u20131 |Dempo |Tau Devi Lal Stadium |- |2010 |Dempo |3\u20131 |East Bengal |Tau Devi Lal Stadium |- |2011 |East Bengal |0\u20130 (9\u20138p) |Salgaocar |Ambedkar Stadium |} ===Winners=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !Club !Wins !Last match won !Runners-up |- |align=left|East Bengal||3||2011||3 |- |align=left|Dempo||2||2010||3 |- |align=left|Mohun Bagan||2||2009||2 |- |align=left|Salgaocar||2||1999||1 |- |align=left|Mahindra United||1||2003||1 |- |align=left|Sporting Goa||1||2005||0 |- |align=left|JCT||0||\u2014||1 |} ==References== Category:Super Cup (India) Category:National association football supercups Category:Football competitions in India Category:1997 establishments in India ",
