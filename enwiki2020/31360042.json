He has worked and toured with various acts from all around the world including Venetian Snares, Otto von Schirach, To Live and Shave in L.A., The Kilimanjaro Darkjazz Ensemble and Zu. He also played drums for the Blood of Heroes project. Since 2009 he has frequently played drums live with Merzbow, and they have released three live records together. They headlined the experimental stage at the Scion Rock Fest in Tampa, Florida in 2012. More recently, he and Merzbow have performed as a trio with Mats Gustafsson. They released Cuts in 2013 on RareNoise. For the follow-up Cuts of Guilt, Cuts Deeper (2015), they were joined by Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth. Bal\u00e1zs started an electronica-metal- breakcore project with Bong-Ra called Wormskull in 2010 (their first album \"Sound of Hell\" was released in 2011). Most recently he joined the Italian experimental instrumental band Zu. His current projects include Italian doom band Obake, Metallic Taste of Blood (featuring Colin Edwin of Porcupine Tree, Eraldo Bernocchi of Obake and Jamie Saft), and Slobber Pup (Saft, Joe Morris and Trevor Dunn). From 2012 he started to play solo shows on selected festivals under his own name. ==Discography== ;With Marshall Allen, Danny Ray Thompson, Jamie Saft, Trevor Dunn and Roswell Rudd *2019 \u2013 Ceremonial Healing (RareNoise) ;With Marco Eneidi *2012 \u2013 A Hint Traumatized (Karl Schmidt Verlag) ;With KK Null *2017 \u2013 Demon Core (Ohm Resistance) *2019 \u2013 Demoncore 1 (Brain Ticket Death) ;With Jason K\u00f6hnen *2017 \u2013 Darkness Comes in Two's (Svart Lava) ;With Merzbow *2010 \u2013 Live at Fluc Wanne, Vienna, 2010/05/18 (Dry Lungs) *2011 \u2013 Ducks: Live in NYC (Ohm Resistance) *2012 \u2013 Katowice (Instant Classic) *2016 \u2013 Live at FAC251 (Cold Spring) ;With Merzbow and Keiji Haino *2016 \u2013 An Untroublesome Defencelessness (RareNoise) *2019 \u2013 Become the Discovered, Not the Discoverer (RareNoise) ;With Merzbow and Mats Gustafsson *2013 \u2013 Cuts (RareNoise) *2015 \u2013 Live in Taba\u010dka 13/04/12 (Taba\u010dka) ;With Merzbow, Mats Gustafsson, and Thurston Moore *2015 \u2013 Cuts of Guilt, Cuts Deeper (RareNoise) ;With Metallic Taste of Blood *2012 \u2013 Metallic Taste of Blood (RareNoise) ;With Obake *2011 \u2013 Obake (RareNoise) *2014 \u2013 Mutations (RareNoise) ;With Ivo Perelman and Joe Morris *2013 \u2013 One (RareNoise) ;With Lee Ranaldo, Jim Jarmusch, Marc Urselli *2019 \u2013 Lee Ranaldo / Jim Jarmusch / Marc Urselli / Balazs Pandi (Trost) ;With Slobber Pup *2013 \u2013 Black Aces (RareNoise) *2015 \u2013 Pole Axe (RareNoise) ;With Wadada Leo Smith, Jamie Saft, and Joe Morris *2014 \u2013 Red Hill (RareNoise) ;With Rope Cosmetology *2009 \u2013 Diffusion de la rue de la Double Identit\u00e9 (Karl Schmidt Verlag) *2009 \u2013 Spezial: Gedankengef\u00fcge (Compound Thought) (Karl Schmidt Verlag) *2009 \u2013 Discoteca Festival (Karl Schmidt Verlag) *2011 \u2014 The Honey Fox in Hare's Longing (Karl Schmidt Verlag) *2012 \u2014 Disunion Strips (Karl Schmidt Verlag) ;With Roswell Rudd, Jamie Saft, and Trevor Dunn *2016 \u2013 Strength & Power (RareNoise) ;With Miko\u0142aj Trzaska and Rafal Mazur *2014 \u2013 Tar & Feathers (Gusstaff) ;With Jon Wesseltoft *2018 \u2013 Infinite Vice (The Tapeworm) *2019 \u2013 Terreng (Moving Furniture) ;With Wormskull *2011 \u2013 Sound of Hell (Ad Noiseam) ;Other appearances {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
