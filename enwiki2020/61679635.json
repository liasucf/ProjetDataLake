    "text": "\"Take Me to the Light\" is a song by American pop project Francis and the Lights featuring Bon Iver and Kanye West. It is the lead single from their forthcoming album, Same Night Different Dream. The song marks the second collaboration between all three artists following the 2016 single \"Friends.\" It also features additional contributions from Caroline Shaw and uncredited vocals by Chance the Rapper. It was released as a single on August 30, 2019, but did not appear on most streaming services until September 3, 2019. In April, 2020, the song seemingly vanished off all platforms except for YouTube for unknown reasons. In June, 2020, Francis posted a reworked version of the song to his personal site. The new version includes a Chance The Rapper verse in addition to a new verse from Francis. On September 17, 2020, the song was reuploaded into streaming services, removing Bon Iver and Kanye's featuring credits and renamed as \"You Still Take Me To The Light\". ==Track listing== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 singles Category:2019 songs Category:Francis and the Lights songs Category:Bon Iver songs Category:Kanye West songs Category:Songs written by Justin Vernon Category:Songs written by Kanye West Category:Song recordings produced by Kanye West Category:Songs written by Benny Blanco Category:Song recordings produced by Benny Blanco Category:Songs written by Cashmere Cat Category:Song recordings produced by Cashmere Cat Category:Songs written by Jeff Bhasker Category:Song recordings produced by Jeff Bhasker Category:Songs written by BJ Burton ",
