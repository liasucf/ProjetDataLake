Turner participated in the 2005 U.S. Army All- American Bowl. He was also on his high school's basketball team until his sophomore year. He also participated on the track team for all four years.

He appeared in 12 games, missing only the UCLA game due to injury. As a sophomore, he moved up the depth chart to be the Trojans' third receiver under the John David Booty- led offense, after junior receiver Dwayne Jarrett and senior receiver Steve Smith. Turner stepped up several times when both Jarrett and Smith were injured and missed games over the season, including 12 catches for 116 yards against Washington. Going into 2007 spring training, Turner was projected to be the leading receiver of the 2007 Trojan squad in the fall, his junior season, following in USC's recent line of star receivers starting with Mike Williams (who previously wore number 1) and Jarrett. He returned some of the most impressive plays during the Spring. In 2007, Turner finished second on the team in receiving yards with 569 yards, following only TE Fred Davis, who led the team with 881 yards.
