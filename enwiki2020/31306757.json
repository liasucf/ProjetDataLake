    "text": "Samuel Colin Walker (born 2 October 1991) is an English professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper, for Championship club Reading. Walker progressed through the youth ranks at Millwall and Chelsea, although he failed to make an appearance for either club. He was loaned from Chelsea to Barnet, Northampton Town, Yeovil Town, Bristol Rovers and Colchester United on two occasions. He made his move to Colchester permanent in January 2014. He made over 200 appearances in total for Colchester. ==Career== ===Chelsea=== Born in Gravesend, Kent, Walker spent his childhood career playing for local club Gravesend & Northfleet but was later signed by Millwall. Chelsea were given permission to speak to a 15-year-old Walker after a \u00a3500,000 bid was accepted by the Lions in September 2007. He joined Norwich City on a youth loan in March 2009, playing for the under-19s to cover an international call-up for Jed Steer and an injury to Declan Rudd. Walker was a member of the successful 2009\u201310 FA Youth Cup-winning squad with Chelsea. He and the team conceded just three goals throughout the entire competition. Having been a regular in the Chelsea youth sides, he subsequently became a regular at reserve team level ====Barnet loan==== Walker joined struggling League Two side Barnet on loan on 24 March 2011 until the end of the season. He made his Football League and professional debut two days later as the Bees came back from two goals down to draw with Chesterfield at Underhill. He was shown a red card for a second bookable offence in added time of a 2\u20131 home victory over Crewe Alexandra on 9 April, but a 3\u20131 away defeat to Accrington Stanley on 30 April left Barnet on the brink of relegation. However, on the final day of the season, with other results working in their favour, Barnet remained a Football League side as Walker kept his first clean sheet in a 1\u20130 victory over Port Vale. He ended his time with the Bees with seven league appearances. ====Northampton Town loan==== Northampton Town boss Gary Johnson signed Walker on a season-long loan from Chelsea on 11 July 2011 following his successful stint at Barnet. He made his debut for the Cobblers in an opening day 0\u20130 draw with Accrington on 5 August. Northampton suffered a string of heavy defeats, including a 7\u20132 home defeat by Shrewsbury Town on 19 November with the club having parted company with Gary Johnson earlier the same week. New manager Aidy Boothroyd offered the players a chance to impress him following significant defeats to Plymouth Argyle and Gillingham However, on 23 December, having made 24 appearances for the club, Boothroyd decided to send Walker back to Chelsea after announcing that Shane Higgs would be his first-choice goalkeeper. ====Yeovil Town loan==== Walker made the step up to League One football in 2012, signing on loan with Yeovil Town on 19 January until the end of the season, once again teaming up with Gary Johnson. He made his Yeovil debut on 21 January as they fell to a 3\u20132 away defeat at Bury. With the club struggling near the relegation zone, Walker put in some impressive performances, including a penalty save against Milton Keynes Dons as the Glovers went on to record a 1\u20130 victory and in turn boost their hopes of survival. Manager Johnson described a \"horrendous mistake\" by Walker in a 3\u20130 defeat to Charlton Athletic as a \"lapse in concentration\", with Walker describing his own recent performances as a \"lapse in form\". Walker retained his place in the first-team, and despite a 6\u20130 defeat by Stevenage, Yeovil survived their relegation battle and Walker completed his loan spell with 20 league appearances. ====Bristol Rovers loan==== Bristol Rovers signed Walker on loan on 14 August 2012 until 2 January 2013. He made his debut in a League Cup clash with Ipswich Town the same day, a match which the Pirates lost 3\u20131. Walker made 14 appearances at the Memorial Stadium, but failed to establish himself as a regular, with fellow loanee and former Chelsea trainee Neil Etheridge becoming first choice goalkeeper for the League Two side. ====Colchester United loans==== Walker first joined Colchester United on 14 January 2013, stepping up to League One for the second half of the 2012\u201313 season. Walker joined until the end of the season alongside fellow Chelsea player Billy Clifford with the U's having dropped into the bottom four in the table. He made his debut on 26 January and immediately kept a clean sheet as Colchester defeated Walsall 2\u20130 to end a run of nine league games without a point, the club's worst ever run. Walker produced clean sheets at former club Yeovil and Stevenage, as well as some important saves to secure points in wins against Bury and a penalty save against Leyton Orient. Walker kept another clean sheet on the final day of the season with a 2\u20130 away victory at Carlisle United, ensuring Colchester remained in League One for another season as they finished 20th in the table. He ended his first loan stint at the club with 19 league appearances. Having been influential in goal in the second half of the 2012\u201313 season, on 19 July 2013, Walker rejoined Colchester on a six-month loan deal, keeping him at the club until 19 January. He kept a clean sheet in the opening day victory at Gillingham on 3 August. He conceded an own goal against Sheffield United in a home FA Cup tie on 9 November as Colchester slipped to a 3\u20132 defeat. In December 2013, with his contract expiring at the end of the season, Walker announced he needed to discuss his future with Chelsea before deciding whether to extend his loan spell at Colchester or pay attention to interest from elsewhere. Walker then played the final game of his loan spell away at Carlisle on 18 December, spilling a late free kick to concede a goal, although the U's went on to win 4\u20132. He amassed a further 29 appearances for Colchester in all competitions in his second loan period. ===Colchester United=== Following his two loan spells with the club in the 2012\u201313 and 2013\u201314 seasons, Walker signed for the League One club on a permanent basis on 20 January 2014 on an 18-month contract. Owing to a string of postponed games due to waterlogged pitches, Walker's first appearance as a full-time U's player didn't arrive until 11 February, when Colchester lost 2\u20130 at Port Vale. Walker signed a contract extension with the club in December 2014 to remain with Colchester until the summer of 2016. Despite being ruled out of the first half of the 2015\u201316 season, Walker signed a new contact extension on 22 December 2015 to remain at the Colchester Community Stadium until the summer of 2018. Being ruled out for the entire season, Walker made just one solitary appearance during the 2015\u201316 season. Walker made his first start in almost one year on 6 August 2016 in Colchester's 1\u20131 draw with Hartlepool United at Victoria Park on the opening day of the 2016\u201317 season. He played every league game in the 2016\u201317 season, making a total of 48 appearances throughout the campaign. On 29 June 2018, Colchester manager John McGreal announced that Walker had left the club after failing to agree a new contract. He had made 47 appearances across the 2017\u201318 season and made 213 total appearances for the club including his loan spells. ===Reading=== On 25 July 2018, Walker signed a three-year contract with Reading. ==Career statistics== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|FA Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Chelsea |2010\u201311 |Premier League |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2011\u201312 |Premier League |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2012\u201313 |Premier League |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2013\u201314 |Premier League |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0 |- |Barnet (loan) |2010\u201311 |League Two |7||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||7||0 |- |Northampton Town (loan) |2011\u201312 |League Two |21||0||1||0||2||0||1||0||25||0 |- |Yeovil Town (loan) |2011\u201312 |League One |20||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||20||0 |- |Bristol Rovers (loan) |2012\u201313 |League Two |11||0||1||0||1||0||1||0||14||0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Colchester United (loan) |2012\u201313 |League One |19||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||19||0 |- |2013\u201314 |League One |26||0||1||0||1||0||1||0||29||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !45!!0!!1!!0!!1!!0!!1!!0!!48!!0 |- |rowspan=\"6\"|Colchester United |2013\u201314 |League One |20||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||20||0 |- |2014\u201315 |League One |45||0||3||0||0||0||1||0||49||0 |- |2015\u201316 |League One |0||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||1||0 |- |2016\u201317 |League Two |46||0||1||0||0||0||1||0||48||0 |- |2017\u201318 |League Two |44||0||1||0||1||0||1||0||47||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !155!!0!!5!!0!!2!!0!!3!!0!!165!!0 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Reading |2018\u201319 |Championship |7||0||0||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||9||0 |- |2019\u201320 |Championship |0||0||4||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||5||0 |- |2020\u201321 |Championship |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !7!!0!!4!!0!!3!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!14!!0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !266!!0!!12!!0!!9!!0!!6!!0!!283!!0 |} ==Honours== Chelsea *2009\u201310 FA Youth Cup winner ==References== ==External links== * Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Gravesend, Kent Category:English footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Millwall F.C. players Category:Chelsea F.C. players Category:Norwich City F.C. players Category:Barnet F.C. players Category:Northampton Town F.C. players Category:Yeovil Town F.C. players Category:Bristol Rovers F.C. players Category:Colchester United F.C. players Category:English Football League players ",
