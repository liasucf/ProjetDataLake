There are many Nordic round churches in Sweden and Denmark (notably the island of Bornholm) and were popular church constructions in Scandinavia in the 11th and early 12th centuries. Round churches should not be confused with the older types of round-tower church constructions. Churches with many-sided polygonal shapes (such as the 16-sided example in Richmond, Vermont, USA) are colloquially referred to as round as well. ==Round churches by country== ===Bosnia=== Church of the Holy Transfiguration in Sarajevo. ===Bulgaria=== Round Church, Preslav ===Brazil=== Cathedral of Bras\u00edlia ===Canada=== Our Lady of Victory Church, Inuvik; St. Jude's Cathedral, Iqaluit; Saint George's Round Church, Halifax ===Croatia=== Church of Saint Vitus in Rijeka. ===Denmark=== Nyker Church, Nylars Church, Saint Ols Church and \u00d8sterlars Church, Bornholm; Bjernede Church, Zealand; Horne Church, Funen (with later gothic extensions), and Thorsager Church, Jutland. ===United Kingdom=== There are four medieval round churches still in use in England: Holy Sepulchre, Cambridge; Temple Church, London; St. John the Baptist Church, Little Maplestead, Essex, and The Holy Sepulchre, Northampton.
