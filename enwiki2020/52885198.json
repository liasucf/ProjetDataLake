    "text": "Ballintaggart Ogham Stones is a collection of ogham stones forming a National Monument located in County Kerry, Ireland. ==Location== Ballintaggart Ogham Stones are located inside a round enclosure (diameter 30 m / 100 ft), immediately east of Dingle racecourse and southeast of the town. ==History== The stones were carved in the 5th and 6th centuries AD and served as burial markers. This was anciently the site of a church and old burial ground (An Cheall\u00fanach or An Lis\u00edn). ==Description== The ogham stones are rounded, made of water-rolled sandstone. Eight of them form a circle, each one lying down pointing outwards. The ninth lies at the centre. Several have been inscribed with crosses. *CIIC 155: AKEVRITTI (presumably a personal name) *CIIC 156: MAQQI-IARI KO\u1eca MA/QQI MU/CCOI DOVVINIAS (Here is Mac-Iair, son of the Corcu Duibne) *CIIC 157: DOVETI MAQQI/ CATTI/NI (of Duibthe, son of Caitne).

The personal name Glasiconas means \"grey wolf.\" *CIIC 160: TRIA MAQA MAILAGNI (of the three sons of Ma\u00edlagnas) / CURCITTI (of Cuircthe). This stone bears a strange cross: with arms of equal length, two with \"E\" shapes on the end, one with a \"Y\" and one with a + *CIIC 161: INISSIO/NAS (a personal name); like CIIC 157 it dates to the 5th century AD *CIIC 162: CU\u1e46\u1ea0MAQQ\u0323I/ AVI C\u1eccRBBI (of Conmac, grandson of Corb) *CIIC 163: N[E]TTA-LAMINACCA KO/I \u1e42A/QQI M\u1ee4COI DO\u1e7e[I]\u1e46[IA]\u1e62 (here is Laminacca's champion, son of the Corcu Duibne) ==References== Category:National Monuments in County Kerry Category:Ogham inscriptions ",
