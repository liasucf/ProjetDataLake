His former teammate, Petre Deselnicu said: \"I've kissed Oblemenco more than my wife, because he scored so many goals for our team\". Oblemenco's final club was FCM Gala\u0163i, where he retired in 1978. One of his biggest regrets was not playing for the national team. ==Coaching career== Oblemenco signing an autograph for a fan.
