    "text": "{| |} The Lanzius L II was a single-seat fighter designed and built in the United States around 1918. The sole prototype is believed to have been tested at McCook Field. ==Design and development== George Lanzius, an immigrant from Holland, founded the Lanzius Aircraft Company in New York, to develop his inventions for variable-camber and variable-incidence wings. Lanzius first designed and built a two-seat aircraft under a US Signal Corps contract in 1917, named the Lanzius Variable Speed Aeroplane (aka L I). His second aircraft, the L II, was a single-seater derived from the L I also featuring the cable operated variable-camber and incidence. The two-bay wings had external trusses over the upper main-spars and under the lower main spars and the variable-camber and incidence were operated by cables and pulleys, with incidence variable from 0\u00b0 to +15\u00b0. Power was supplied by a variety of engines but principally by a Packard 1A-1237 V-12 in-line water-cooled engine. During a test flight the engine failed and the L II crashed. Meanwhile, in April 1918, four similar aircraft were ordered, powered by Liberty L-12 water-cooled V-12 engines. The first of these was destroyed after a structural failure in flight killed Lanzius test pilot L.E. Holt. The United States Army Air Service (USAS) rejected the remaining three aircraft and returned them to Lanzius. ==Variants== ;Lanzius Variable Speed Aeroplane (1917): (L I) A two-seater built to a US Signal Corps contract in 1917, incorporating Lanzius' variable camber and incidence systemand powered by a Duesenberg 4-cylinder water-cooled inline engine. ;Lanzius L II: A prototype single-seater fighting scout, powered by a Packard 1A-1237 V-12 water-cooled engine. ;Lanzuius Variable Speed Aeroplane (1918): Four aircraft similar to the L II, but powered by Liberty L-12 engines. ==Specifications (L II) == ==References== Category:1910s United States fighter aircraft Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Biplanes Category:Aircraft first flown in 1918 ",
