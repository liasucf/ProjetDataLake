Finn Devold (1902 - 1977), Hallvard Devold's brother, on ship Heimen from Troms\u00f8, led the bigger party of six hunters to establish a Norwegian station. Initially Devold went to Timmiarmiut Fjord, but then he moved north to Skjoldungen District and built the hut by a good harbor in southern Thorland, naming it Finnsbu after his own name. Devold's team built two other main stations, as well as a number of smaller huts in the same region.Recent Norwegian Expeditions to Southeast-Greenland, Gunnar Horn The other expedition, led by Ole Mortensen, went initially to Storfjord (Kangerlussuaq Fjord) on ship Signalhorn and built a hut there. Since hunting there was poor, Mortensen moved with his men south to Lindenow Fjord, where a station named Moreton was built which was later moved by Gunnar Horn to neighboring Nanuuseq Fjord and renamed Torgilsbu.Norwegian Expedition to South-East Greenland, 1932 On 12 July 1932 Devold was required by the Norwegian government to formally hoist the Norwegian flag at Finnsbu. An expedition sent by the government led by Gunnar Horn on ship Veslemari visited Finnsbu on 17 August the same year. Together with Torgilsbu further south, Finnsbu became part of the Norwegian contribution to the International Polar Year 1932\u201333.William James Mills, Exploring Polar Frontiers: A Historical Encyclopedia, p. 321 In July 1933 Finnsbu station sent meteorological data to the Decennial Air Cruise squadron of Italian seaplanes led by Italo Balbo. Following the 1933 resolution of the Permanent Court of International Justice rejecting Norway's claims in Greenland Finnsbu was abandoned.Spencer Apollonio, Lands That Hold One Spellbound: A Story of East Greenland, 2008, pp. 188-189 Relief ship Signalhorn evacuated the staff of the stations in the Storfjord and Skjoldungen area and brought them back to Norway in August 1933. Torgilsbu, however, remained in operation until 1940. Currently there is a tide gauge in the location of the former Norwegian settlement.Finnsbu, Greenland Tide Station Location Guide ==Bibliography== *Spencer Apollonio, Lands That Hold One Spellbound: A Story of East Greenland, 2008 ==See also== *Erik the Red's Land ==References== == External links == * Norwegian Polar Year and Radio Stations in East Greenland, 1932\u201333 * Anders Christian Feyling, Torgilsbu 1933-34: dagbok f\u00f8rt av radiostasjonens bestyrer * The World at War - Greenland 1721 - 1953 Category:Ruins in Greenland Category:1931 establishments in Norway Category:1933 disestablishments in Norway Category:History of Greenland Category:Meteorological stations ",
