She took an interest in natural history and especially in bird migration, and after being encouraged by Eagle Clarke in 1905, she and her life-long friend Leonora Jeffrey Rintoul (1878-1953) took up bird studies at the Isle of May. They studied the movements of birds for 20 years leading to several publications. Baxter was also involved in establishing the Scottish Ornithologists' Club on 24 March 1936. Baxter and Rintoul published The Birds of Scotland in 1953. During World War II she volunteered with the Women's Land Army while also teaching at Sunday school where she was known as \"Miss Evie\".
