    "text": "thumb Colonche is an alcoholic red coloured drink made by Mexicans for thousands of years with tuna, the fruits of \"nopal\" (Opuntia cacti), especially with tuna cardona, the fruits of Opuntia streptacantha. It is prepared in the states where wild nopal is abundant (Aguascalientes, San Luis Potosi and Zacatecas). It is a sweet, fizzy beverage. For preparation, the cactus fruits are peeled and crushed to obtain the juice, which is boiled for 2-3 hours. After cooling, the juice is allowed to ferment for a few days. Sometimes old colonche is added as a starter. Another possible starter is \"tibicos\". Tibicos are gelatinous masses of yeasts and bacteria, grown in water with brown sugar.CHAPTER 4 PRODUCTS OF YEAST FERMENTATION FAO Corporate Document repository Amongst other microorganisms responsible for the spontaneous fermentation of colonche, a yeast, Torulopsis taboadae (syn. Torulaspora delbrueckii?), has been isolated. In 2003, Te\u00f3filo Herrera Su\u00e1rez, a Mexican mycologist, published a book titled ' (\u201cBeyond pulque and tepache\u201d), in which he writes about traditional Mexican alcoholic beverages such as \u201cpozol\u201d, \u201ctesg\u00fcino\u201d and \u201ccolonche\u201d. == See also == * List of Mexican dishes == References == == External links == * VI.
