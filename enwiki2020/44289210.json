    "text": "Globe rupture is a condition were the integrity of the outer membranes of the eye are disrupted by blunt or penetrating trauma, usually resulting from a full-thickness injury to the cornea or sclera. It may also result from damage caused by chemicals such as strong acids (hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, etc.) or industrial chemicals such as lewisite. ==Causes== During a globe rupture, the outer membranes of the eye are completely or partially compromised, and the vitreous and/or aqueous humour drain through the site of the rupture, causing the eye to 'deflate'. ==Diagnosis== On CT scan, signs of global rupture include: deepening of the anterior chamber, alteration of global contour with scleral folds, discontinuity of scleral folds, and a shrunken globe. ==Treatment== If not treated swiftly, severe damage can result. In many cases, globe ruptures are untreatable without enucleating the affected eye socket and replacing the eye with an ocular prosthesis. However, with modern diagnostic techniques, surgical approaches, and rehabilitation, in many cases eyes can be salvaged with retention of vision. ==References== Category:Ophthalmology ",
