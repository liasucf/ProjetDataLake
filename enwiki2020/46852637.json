    "text": "The 2015\u201316 Danish Superliga season was the 26th season of the Danish Superliga, which decides the Danish football championship. Midtjylland were the defending champions. As Denmark dropped from nineteenth to twenty-second place in the 2015 UEFA association coefficient rankings at the end of the 2014\u201315 season, the champion of the league will qualify for the UEFA Champions League; that club will commence its campaign in the second qualifying round. Furthermore, the second and third-place clubs will enter the UEFA Europa League in the first qualifying round.http://kassiesa.home.xs4all.nl/bert/uefa/data/method4/crank2015.html Only one team will be relegated after the season due to the Superliga being expanded to 14 teams from the beginning of the 2016\u201317 season. ==Teams== FC Vestsj\u00e6lland and Silkeborg IF finished the 2014\u201315 season in 11th and 12th place, respectively, and were relegated to the 2015\u201316 1st Division. The relegated teams were replaced by 2014\u201315 1st Division champions Viborg FF and the runners-up AGF. A new sponsorship agreement for Randers Stadium was presented on 22 September 2015, when the F\u00e5rup-based fertilizer company BioNutria acquired the naming rights for the stadium from AutoC, effectively changing the name of the home field of Randers FC from AutoC Park Randers to BioNutria Park Randers. Last in the season, the stadium of FC Nordsj\u00e6lland changed its official name to Right to Dream Park following a naming rights agreement with the young academy Right to Dream, taking effect on 27 April 2016. ===Stadia and locations=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
