V\u00e1ri began his athletic career with modern pentathlon but later switched to water polo. He made his debut for the Hungarian national team in 1997. Attila's back hand shot from ten meters in the 2000 Olympic finals against Russia was probably the most unexpected and spectacular goal anyone ever scored in an Olympic final game in water polo. V\u00e1ri was elected into the presidium of the Hungarian Olympic Committee (MOB) in May 2017. He was elected President of the Hungarian Water Polo Federation (MVLSZ) in September 2018, replacing D\u00e9nes Kem\u00e9ny. The ruling party Fidesz\u2013KDNP nominated V\u00e1ri as their candidate for the position of Mayor of P\u00e9cs in the 2019 Hungarian local elections, but was defeated by the opposition's joint candidate Attila P\u00e9terffy. ==Honours== ===National=== * Olympic Games: 15px Gold medal - 2000, 2004 * World Championships: 15px Gold medal - 2003; 15px Silver medal - 1998, 2005 * European Championship: 15px Gold medal - 1997, 1999; 15px Bronze medal - 2001, 2003 * FINA World League: 15px Gold medal - 2003, 2004; 15px Silver medal - 2005; 15px Bronze medal - 2002 * FINA World Cup: 15px Gold medal - 1999; 15px Silver medal - 2002; 15px Bronze medal - 1997 * Universiade: (Silver medal - 1995) * Junior World Championships: (Gold medal - 1995) * Junior European Championship: (Gold medal - 1994) ===Club=== * Euroleague Winners (1): (2004 - with Bp.
