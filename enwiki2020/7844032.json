    "text": "At the Cafe Bohemia, Vol. 2 is a 1955 live album release by the Jazz Messengers. It was first released by Blue Note Records. This record featured the original incarnation of The Jazz Messengers, one of Art Blakey's most endearing bands, and was the second of two volumes recorded at Caf\u00e9 Bohemia, a famous night club in Greenwich Village in New York, New York on November 23, 1955. ==Reception== This album, which sees the first version of The Jazz Messengers on record, was noted as not \"match[ing] the intensity which the quintet secured at Birdland.\" Tenor saxophonist Hank Mobley, in particular, is noted as \"a somewhat unfocused stylist.\" However, trumpeter Kenny Dorham is seen as an \"elusive brilliance [that] was seldom so extensively captured\" and the playing in general \"is just as absorbing\" as the Birdland albums and has \"influenced jazz up to present time.\" With the July 31, 2001 CD re-issue, three additional tracks from this night were added: \"Just One for Those Things\", \"Hank\u00b4s Symphony\" and \"Gone With The Wind\". ==Track listing== {| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #FCFDFF; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" !
