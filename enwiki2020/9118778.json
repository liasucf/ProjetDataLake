    "text": "Georges Alexandre Malkine (10 October 1898 - 22 March 1970) was the only visual artist named in Andr\u00e9 Breton\u2019s 1924 Surrealist Manifesto among those who, at the time of its publication, had \u201cperformed acts of absolute surrealism.\"Andr\u00e9 Breton, \u201cManifesto of Surrealism\u201d [1924], in Manifestoes of Surrealism, transl. Richard Seaver and Helen R. Lane (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1972), 26. The rest Breton named were for the most part writers, including Louis Aragon, Robert Desnos, and Benjamin Peret. Malkine's 1926 painting Nuit D'amour was the precursor of the lyrical abstract school of painting. Georges Malkine *\"He has pushed individualism to the point of impertinence! But what art in his expression of the ineffable whenever he took the pains to do so!\" -- Andr\u00e9 BretonPatrick Waldberg, Georges Malkine (Brussels: Andr\u00e9 de Rache, 1970),p. 40. *\"Georges Malkine has left his delicate mark on the window of time, made as with a diamond, without altering its transparence, without blurring the view, leaving the purest trace that can only be discerned from a certain angle and in a certain light.\" -- Patrick Waldberg (1970)Waldberg, pp. 9-10. ==Life== Georges Malkine chose not to expose his private life and, apart from his career in film and theatre, his work was known only to his collectors. He avoided social gatherings, as well as group meetings and anthologies and other methods of categorizing (and, to his mind, demeaning) artists. His example, as suggested in the above quote by Breton, championed the concept of individualism. In his 1970 monograph of Malkine, Patrick Waldberg (French art historian) wrote, \"[Malkine] is perhaps the only artist about whom it can be said that through his life and his work, reality and dreams may cease to be viewed contrarily.\" Indeed, Malkine lived Surrealism and eschewed all attachments to fame, money, career, and other things that he felt sought to confine, define, and in the end, confuse the real issues.http://www.lemondedesarts.com/DossierMalkine.htm He believed a man's wealth was contained in the inner landscapes, and didn't like to talk publicly about himself; his paintings were the only personal glimpses he provided for those who might be interested. Georges Malkine had a musical soul, and especially loved the piano, which appears in many of his paintings. His highest love was for poetry. Among his closest friends were the poets Robert Desnos and Louis Aragon. Upon Malkine's death, Aragon wrote a lengthy poetic tribute to Malkine,Louis Aragon, \"Demeure de Georges Malkine,\" Lettres fran\u00e7aisesno. 132, 8 (1-7 avril 1970), pp. 3-4. published in his magazine Les lettres fran\u00e7aises. A historian of Surrealism has erroneously suggested that Malkine was homosexualPenelope Rosemont, ed. Surrealist Women: An International Anthology. Austin: Univ. of Texas, 1998, p. xlv. based on a Man Ray photograph of him kissing his first wife, Yvette, who wore her hair short like a man's. This 1930 photo, in addition to Malkine and his wife, included Andr\u00e9 de la Rivi\u00e8re, Robert Desnos, and the Swiss sculptor Andr\u00e9 Lasserre. ==Work== Malkine's work spans the years from the early 1920s right up until his death in 1970. He painted approximately 500 pieces in his lifetime, and did some writing and illustrating. He had seven solo shows, with five more after his death; he contributed to 37 collective shows (19 posthumously).For a complete list of these exhibitions, see Pavillon des Arts, Georges Malkine: Le Vagabond du surr\u00e9alisme (exh. cat. 28 April \u2013 29 August 1999), essays by Vincent Gille and Fern Malkine-Falvey, p. 156. He won the William and Norma Copley Foundation Award in 1966. His records and reports from other sources show his periods of greatest activity as being the 1920s, early 1930s, and the 1960s. His output is remarkable in that it ended with a period of productivity that was just as notable as the early period. He embarked in 1966 on his Demeures, or Dwellings,Fabrice Flahutez, \u00ab Les demeures de Georges Malkine ou la fabrique de la maison de compensation \u00bb, M\u00e9lusine n\u00b0 XXIX, Cahiers du Centre de Recherche sur le Surr\u00e9alisme (Paris 3 Sorbonne-Nouvelle), Henri B\u00e9har (dir.), Lausanne, \u00c9ditions L\u2019Age d\u2019Homme, 2008, pp. 148-158. a series of metaphorical portraits of great artists from many disciplines, presented in the form of buildings reflecting Malkine's perception of their character or work. Malkine was not devoted uniquely to the art of painting; between the years 1933-1939, he acted in 20 films, working with, among others, Jean Gabin, Billy Wilder, and Mich\u00e8le Morgan. In 1950 he wrote a farcical novel, 'A Bord du Violon de Mer, including many illustrations by Malkine. It was published posthumously. ==Selected exhibitions== A retrospective of Malkine's early and late paintings opened at the Galerie Les Yeux Fertiles in Paris in June 2004. Two major shows in 1999 contained paintings and drawings by Malkine, from both his late and early periods. The Surrealism: Two Private Eyes exhibit at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City, taken from the immense Surrealist art collections of Daniel Filipacchi and Nesuhi Erteg\u00fcn, included a four-painting array and one drawing. The other show,Georges Malkine: Le Vagabond du Surr\u00e9alisme, was a four-month retrospective at the Pavillon des Arts in Paris. It was the most complete Malkine retrospective to date. Five paintings were shown in Paris in 1995 in a collector's show at the Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, titled Passions Priv\u00e9es. His paintings come up for auction periodically throughout Europe, and are in collections throughout the world. A retrospective exhibition, Georges Malkine: Perfect Surrealist Behavior, ran from October 2014 to January 2015 at the Woodstock Artists Association & Museum in Woodstock N. Y. The catalogue to the exhibition includes an 8-chapter monograph and is the first book-length publication on Malkine in English.Derin Tanyol, with contributions by Fern Malkine-Falvey, Georges Malkine: Perfect Surrealist Behavior (Woodstock: Woodstock Artists Assoc. & Museum, 2014). ==Paintings== A selection of his paintings may be seen here. ==Filmography== * L'Ange gardien (1933) * Mauvaise graine (1934) The secretary. * L'Or (1934) Zorloff. * Love, Death and the Devil (1934) Vikhom. * The Devil in the Bottle (1935) Vikhom. * The First Offence (1936) * Un de la l\u00e9gion (1936) The Russian legionnaire. * La Dame de Malacca (1937) A guard. * La Trag\u00e9die imp\u00e9riale (1938) Beggar. * S.O.S.
