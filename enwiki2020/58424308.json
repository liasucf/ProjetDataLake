    "text": "Alpha Phi Gamma (\u0391\u03a6\u0393) was an Honor Society in the field of Journalism founded in 1919 at Ohio Northern University. It merged with Pi Delta Epsilon to form the Society for Collegiate Journalists in 1975. ==History== Alpha Phi Gamma was founded on December 11, 1919 under the name Phi Alpha Gamma. The founders were B. H. Focht, Lloyd W. Reese, R. S. Lyman, Tom B. Haber and Fred C. Slager. In 1923, the group called its first national convention, at which delegates from six other Ohio colleges attended and were granted charters. Also at this meeting, the group changed its name to Alpha Phi Gamma due to another fraternity being called Phi Alpha Gamma and initiated its first female member. The fraternity merged with Omega Xi Alpha, a similar California group, in 1929 which became Alpha Phi Gamma's western section. After activity came to a standstill during World War II, Gil A. Cowan of the Los Angeles Examiner was responsible for its revival and post war growth. In 1949, Cowan was named President Emeritus, a unique honor to the organization. Alpha Phi Gamma merged with Pi Delta Epsilon to form the Society for Collegiate Journalists in 1975. ==Symbols== The Symbols of Alpha Phi Gamma *Badge: A rectangular key with the three greek letters, Alpha Phi Gamma diagonally from upper left to lower right, three stars in the upper right and an inkwell in the lower left. *Coat of Arms:Three wreath and quill-surmounted inkwells and a secretary bird at the crest *Pledge Emblem:White Bridge Emblem with Alpha Phi Gamma inscribed in black. *Black and White are the society colors *White Carnation is the society flower ==Chapters== Chapters of Alpha Phi Gamma: *Alpha - Ohio Northern University *Beta - University of Akron *Gamma - Wilmington College *Delta - Baldwin-Wallace College *Epsilon - Muskingum College *Eta - University of Toledo *Theta - Cotner College *Iota - Louisiana State Normal College *Kappa - New York State Teacher's College, Albany *Lambda - Redlands University *Nu - Southwestern University (Los Angeles) *Omicron - State College of Fresno *Pi - Santa Barbara State Teacher's College *Rho - Hanover College *Sigma - Pennsylvania State Teacher's College - Indiana *Tau - Albion College *Chi - Georgetown College *Psi - College of Puget Sound *Omega - Ball State Teacher's College *Alpha Beta - Gustavus Adolphus College *Alpha Gamma - San Francisco State Teacher's College ==Officers== ===Presidents=== The presidents of Alpha Phi Gamma were:Past Excutive (sic) Directors - Society for Collegiate Journalists *1923-1926 Charles McCorkhill, Ohio Northern University *1926-1927 George McNamara, Ohio Northern University *1927-1928 Ralph L.
