    "text": "Pamela Cosman is a professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, San Diego. She has conducted pioneering research on the quality of compressed images for application in medical diagnostic imaging. At UCSD, Cosman currently researches ways to improve wireless video transmission. == Early life and education == Pamela C. Cosman obtained her B.Sc. with Honor in Electrical Engineering from the California Institute of Technology in 1987, and her Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University in 1993 with doctoral advisor Dr. Bob Gray. == Career and research == Following an NSF postdoctoral fellowship at Stanford and at the University of Minnesota (1993\u20131995), she joined the faculty of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California, San Diego. Currently, Dr. Cosman is a Professor at the University of California, San Diego. Cosman's lab conducts research on video compression in an effort to minimize losses during wireless transmission. Cosman simultaneously conducts sociology research on interruptions and introductions during job talks to explore the bias that exists in the hiring process for computer science and engineering faculty. Cosman is also the Faculty Equity Advisor at UCSD's Jacobs School of Engineering where she conducts unconscious bias training for the faculty search committees. The effects of Cosman's course were evident in the nearly 20% increase in female faculty hired between 2013 and 2018. Cosman's efforts were recognized when she won a state grant for enhancing diversity in her department in 2016 as well as the Diversity Award at the ECEDHA Annual Conference and ECExpo in 2019. Cosman is also the author of a children's novel called The Secret Code Menace, which uses a narrative about two siblings to keep readers aged 9\u201312 engaged as it introduces concepts in coding theory like error correction code. == Awards and recognition == * Inaugural holder of the Dr. John and Felia Proakis Chancellor Faculty Fellowship * 2018 National Diversity Awards from ECEDHA (Electrical and Computer Engineering Department Heads Association) * 2017 Athena Pinnacle Award - Outstanding Educator * 2016 UC San Diego Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action and Diversity Award *2008 Fellow of the IEEE *1997-1998 Powell Faculty Fellowship == Selected publications== Publications include: * Song Q, Cosman PC.
