The movie is based on the Ben Barka affair. ==Plot== In a Parisian apartment, police discover the body of Georges Figon, the man who broke the scandal of the Ben Barka affair, and undermined Gaullist power. A year earlier, Figon, tired of dubious deals and petty scams, is looking for a lucrative job. Close to the \"middle\" since his years in prison, he is given a big assignment: to produce a documentary about decolonization, written by Marguerite Duras and directed by Georges Franju, with the help of famous Moroccan dissident, Mehdi Ben Barka, who has been hired as an historical consultant. The film project is a trap. ==Cast== * Charles Berling as Georges Figon * Simon Abkarian as Mehdi Ben Barka * Josiane Balasko as Marguerite Duras * Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud as Georges Franju * Mathieu Amalric as Philippe Bernier * Fabienne Babe as Anne-Marie Coffinet * Azize Kabouche as Chtouki * Fran\u00e7ois Hadji-Lazaro as Le Ny * Jean-Marie Winling as Pierre Lemarchand * Franck Tiozzo as Georges Boucheseiche * Jo Prestia as Dubail * Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Blanco as The judge * Georges Bigot as Inspector Louis Souchon * Rony Kramer as Lopez * Xavier Serrat as Voitot * Brahim A\u00eft El Kadi as Thami Azzemouri * Muna Fettou as Ghita Ben Barka * Fay\u00e7al Khyari as Mohamed Oufkir * Abdellatif Khamolli as Ahmed Dlimi * Hubert Saint-Macary as The doctor ==References== ==External links== * Category:2005 films Category:2005 drama films Category:French films Category:French drama films Category:French- language films Category:Moroccan drama films ",
