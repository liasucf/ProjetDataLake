    "text": "Glassworks is a chamber music work of six movements by Philip Glass. Following his larger-scale concert and stage works, Glassworks was Philip Glass's successful attempt to create a more pop-oriented \"Walkman-suitable\" work, with considerably shorter and more accessible pieces written for the recording studio. In fact, the cover of the cassette release stated that it was \"specially mixed for your personal cassette player\". The album was released in 1982. ==Movements== ===\"Opening\"=== \"Opening\" uses triplet eighth notes, over duple eighth notes, over whole notes in . Formally it consists of three groups of four measure phrases of three to four chords repeated four times each, ABC:||ABC, which then merges with the next movement, \"Floe\" with the entrance of the horns. The movement has been arranged for and performed by Gamelan Pacifica. ===\"Floe\"=== There are two formulaically identical sections to the movement. Although rhythmically driven, the melodic implications of \"Floe\" occur somewhat coincidentally by orchestration. There is no modulation, but the harmonic progression simply repeats over and over again. The layering of contrasting timbres is characteristic of the piece as a whole. Floe borrows a theme from Jean Sibelius's fifth symphony.https://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/art-2000005451447.html \"Rubric\" and \"Fa\u00e7ades\" both appeared in the 2008 documentary about Philippe Petit, Man on Wire. \"Floe\" was featured on the soundtrack of the 1989 Italian horror film The Church. ==Release and reception== Glassworks has a 4.5/5 rating on Allmusic.http://www.allmusic.com/album/philip-glass-glassworks-mw0000157237 The album was commercially successful, introduced Glass' music to a large audience, and gave Glass widespread name recognition. ==References== Category:1981 compositions Category:1982 albums Category:Compositions by Philip Glass Category:Philip Glass albums ",
