    "text": "Erik Satie The Trois M\u00e9lodies (Three Songs) is a 1916 song cycle for voice and piano by Erik Satie. One of Satie's rare excursions in m\u00e9lodies (French art songs), it lasts under 4 minutes in performance. The composer's first English- language biographer, Rollo H. Myers (1948), thought this work contained \"the essence of Satie the ironist, the wit, and the skillful parodist\".Rollo H. Myers, \"Erik Satie\", Dover Publications, Inc., NY, 1968, p. 94. Originally published in 1948 by Denis Dobson Ltd., London. ==Songs== The cycle consists of three songs set to whimsical verses by three contemporary French authors. Apart from a general light-hearted tone there are no unifying elements in the music or texts. Satie conceived it for mezzo-soprano voice but it has been successfully performed by soprano and baritone vocalists. L\u00e9on-Paul Fargue :1. La statue de bronze (\"The Bronze Statue\"). Poem by L\u00e9on-Paul Fargue. Dedicated to Jane Bathori. :- Pas trop vite (not too fast) :During the World War I years Satie found a friend and kindred spirit in avant-garde author L\u00e9on-Paul Fargue, whose absurdist, virtually untranslatable poetry cannot be linked to any school. They would later collaborate on Satie's m\u00e9lodie cycle Ludions (1923). Fargue's lyrics for La statue de bronze describe the ennui of an ornamental garden sculpture, a metallic frog, as passersby toss coins and other objects into its gaping mouth. There is a strong whiff of music hall in the cakewalk-like introduction, after which the piano part subsides into an oom-pah ostinato rhythm. Over this the initially ebullient vocal line fades into quiet pensiveness, as the artificial frog muses that it would rather be with real frogs in a pond \"blowing bubbles of music out of the moonlight's soap\",Myers, \"Erik Satie\", p. 94. and how at night its mouth is full of insects it cannot eat. :2. Daph\u00e9n\u00e9o. Poem by M. God. Dedicated to \u00c9mile Engel. :- Tranquille (quietly) :\"M. God\" was a pseudonym for Marie Anne \"Mimi\" Godebska (1899-1949), the 17 year-old niece of Misia Sert, Satie's foremost patron of the period. Along with her younger brother Jean she was a dedicatee of Maurice Ravel's piano duet Ma m\u00e8re l'Oye (1910).\"3 M\u00e9lodies, IES 34 (Satie, Erik)\", complete score and notes at IMSLP. See External Link below for access to the page. Godebska's poem is a silly dialogue about trees between two faux- mythical characters, Daph\u00e9n\u00e9o and Chrysaline. Allmusic reviewer Virginia Sublett noted that the song \"depends for its intelligibility on an untranslatable pun: eliding a final \"n\" turns \"un oisetier\" (a nonexistent word meaning \"bird-tree\") into \"un noisetier,\" or \"hazel-nut tree.\"Virginia Sublett, Allmusic review at https://www.allmusic.com/composition/m%C3%A9lodies-3-of-1916-for-voice-piano- mc0002368227 Satie's solemn, gently swaying underscoring gives the text an ironic dignity. Rollo H. Myers enthused, \"The effect is irresistibly comic, although the means employed by Satie in turning this bit of nonsense into music are classic in their sobriety and restraint\".Myers, \"Erik Satie\", p. 95. The Mad Hatter's tea party, illustration by Sir John Tenniel :3. Le chapelier (\"The Hatter\"). Poem by Ren\u00e9 Chalupt after Lewis Carroll. Dedicated to Igor Stravinsky. :- Allegretto (genre Gounod) (fairly brisk, in the manner of Gounod) :Satie was a great fan of imaginative and humorous literature, and was very fond of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865). He once planned to write a ballet on the subject.Satie proposed the ballet Alice au Pays de Merveilles in June 1921. American translator Louise Norton and French author Henri-Pierre Roch\u00e9 worked on the scenario throughout the summer without success, and the project was abandoned. See Robert Orledge, \"Satie the Composer\", Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 325. This song cleverly employs multiple levels of literary and musical pastiche. Poet-journalist Ren\u00e9 Chalupt (1885-1957) drew his lyrics from Chapter 7 of Alice, \"A Mad Tea- Party\", focusing on The Mad Hatter. The character frets over his pocket watch, which is running \"three days late\" even though he lubricates it with \"the best butter\" and dunks it into his tea. Satie's accompaniment parodies the love duet Chanson de Magali from Charles Gounod's opera Mireille (1864), which itself was an adaptation of an old Proven\u00e7al folksong.Orledge, \"Satie the Composer\", pp. 21-24. Robert Orledge suggested that the playing direction \"genre Gounod\" was the composer's discreet way of thumbing his nose (musically speaking) at Gounod, \"that epitome of bourgeois sentimentality\".Orledge, \"Satie the Composer\", p. 22. :Satie was so pleased with Le chapelier that he dedicated it to his friend Igor Stravinsky, one of the few contemporary composers he admired without reservation.David Drew, \"The Savage Parade - From Satie, Cocteau, and Picasso to the Britten of 'Les Illuminations' and beyond\", Tempo, New Series, No. 217 (July, 2001), p. 7. Published by Cambridge University Press. The drollery of the Trois M\u00e9lodies would appear to link it with Satie's humoristic or \"fantaisiste\" compositions of the 1910s. But in this song cycle, apart from the \"genre Gounod\" reference, he refrained from using the witty playing directions and extramusical commentary that helped define the public perception of his music in the pre-World War I era. He had apparently grown weary of the formula.For example, Satie's song cycle Trois po\u00e8mes d'amour (composed in 1914) was conceived in his vintage humoristic spirit, but upon its delayed publication in 1916 he chose to remove all the extramusical jokes and verbiage. See Orledge, \"Satie the Composer\", pp. 308-309. Satie would revert to it only once more, for his spoof of 18th Century piano music, the Sonatine bureaucratique (1917). ==History== Jane Bathori Satie wrote the Trois M\u00e9lodies for mezzo-soprano Jane Bathori, a star of the Parisian opera world and a vigorous promoter of new French music. Although Bathori knew of Satie's reputation through their mutual friend Claude Debussy,Orledge, \"Satie the Composer\", p. 52. the two did not actually meet until early April 1916, in preparation for an upcoming \"Ravel-Satie Festival\" sponsored by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Lyre et Palette. Satie immediately agreed to provide two new vocal numbers for her, and the songs Daph\u00e9n\u00e9o and Le chapelier were completed by April 14. They were first performed by Bathori and pianist Ricardo Vi\u00f1es at the festival, held at the Salle Huyghens in Paris on April 18, 1916.Orledge, \"Satie the Composer\", pp. 311-312. Trois M\u00e9lodies, first edition cover (1917) Bathori was then invited to perform the two songs at a more prestigious event, a benefit concert \"for artists affected by the War\" sponsored by Germaine Bongard, sister of fashion designer Paul Poiret, scheduled for the following month. It would be staged in conjunction with an exhibition of modern painting, and Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso were commissioned to design the programme.Orledge, \"Satie the Composer\", p. 312. Satie habitually preferred to construct his compositions in groups of three, and on May 16 he sent L\u00e9on-Paul Fargue a note requesting a bit of verse to cap the Bathori cycle - \"something very short & terribly cynical\".Caroline Potter, \"Erik Satie: Music, Art and Literature\", Routledge, 2016, p. 299. Fargue's brand-new poem La statue de bronze was duly delivered, and Satie completed his setting on May 26. The complete Trois M\u00e9lodies was premiered by Bathori and Satie at the Galerie Thomas in Paris on May 30, 1916. The score was published by Rouart, Lerolle & Cie in 1917. In his last years the irascible Satie severed ties with two collaborators on the Trois M\u00e9lodies, Ren\u00e9 Chalupt and L\u00e9on-Paul Fargue, over petty misunderstandings.Robert Orledge, \"Satie Remembered\", Faber and Faber Ltd., 1995, pp. 126-127.Ornella Volta (ed.), \"Satie Seen Through His Letters\", Marion Boyars Publishers, London, 1989, p. 164. But Jane Bathori continued to promote his music after the composer's death in 1925. With Satie disciple Darius Milhaud as her accompanist she made the first recording of the Trois M\u00e9lodies, issued by Columbia in 1929.Library of Congress catalog, at https://catalog.loc.gov/vwebv/search?searchCode=LCCN&searchArg;=2005655290&searchType;=1&permalink;=y ==Discography== Jane Bathori and Darius Milhaud (Columbia, 1929), Pierre Bernac and Francis Poulenc (Columbia Masterworks, 1952), Elaine Bonazzi and Frank Glazer (Vox, 1971), Mady Mespl\u00e9 and Aldo Ciccolini (2 songs only, excluding La statue de bronze, Arabesque, 1974), Marjanne Kweksilber and Reinbert de Leeuw (Harlekijn, 1976, reissued by Philips, 1982), Jessye Norman and Dalton Baldwin (Philips, 1977), Bruno Laplante and Marc Durand (Calliope, 1985), Eileen Hulse and Robin Bowman (Factory Classical, 1990), Sigune Von Osten and Armin Fuchs (ITM Classics, 1994), Jane Manning and Bojan Gori\u0161ek (Audiophile Classics, 2002). ==Notes and references== ==External links== * Complete score at IMSLP, at https://imslp.org/wiki/3_M%C3%A9lodies%2C_IES_34_(Satie%2C_Erik)}} * * Category:Compositions by Erik Satie Category:Song cycles by Erik Satie Category:20th-century classical music Category:1916 compositions Category:Classical song cycles in French Category:M\u00e9lodies ",
