He was mostly active around the town of Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu Natal. Duma is a violent psychopath who partook of theft, kidnapping, torture, rape and murder. He worked as a taxi driver and used his vehicle as a weapon on occasion as well as to obtain his victims. Duma\u2019s reasoning, victimology and methodology changed sometimes from victim to victim, indicating that he was a disorganized killer. Duma first killed on 9 September 2007 when he used his minibus taxi to run over and kill a Department of Education security guard, Mqeku Zondi. Duma had been hired to drive Mr. Zondi to his residence for an agreed upon fee. The conductor of Duma\u2019s taxi, Mlungisi Bhengu, testified that Zondi reneged on paying the fare for some of the journey, at which point \"Duma drove into the old man, ran over him with the wheels of the taxi and then reversed over his body again\".\u2018\u2018The Saturday Star\u2019\u2019 : Jailed Killer denies killer rampage. Duma then robbed the victim of his remaining money and a 9mm Norinco pistol. On the evening of 14 October 2007, Duma and his accomplice, Simphiwe Khesi, had been drinking at a local shebeen. Leaving a little after 19:00, the men realised that there would be no taxis available, so they planned to hijack a vehicle in order to get home.\u2018\u2018iol\u2019\u2019 : Killers laugh at jail term. Finding a suitable vehicle, Duma shot and killed the driver, First National Bank employee Patricia Kippen (39).

They soon found another possible target vehicle, shooting and killing the driver, former Witness crime journalist, Elaine Anderson (59). On 19 October 2007, Duma raped, shot and murdered Hlengiwe Shangase. Duma had waited near her home before dragging her to a desolate area and raping her. He then shot her in the head at point blank range using the Norinco pistol he had stolen from Mqeku Zondi. The following day, Duma hijacked, shot and killed two men; Masizane Mtshatsha and Thamsanqua Mbindwane. An hour later, now driving in the hijacked VW Polo, Duma kidnapped three further victims; Tsepo Mhlongo, Linda Jali and a teenage girl. The two men were robbed, ordered out of the vehicle, shot and left for dead. Duma with his accomplice, Simphiwe Khesi, took the young girl to Azalea Cemetery where they raped her. Duma then drove the stolen car over the girl multiple times in order to kill her. Finally, on 25 October 2007, Duma kidnapped, robbed, raped and murdered Pinetown teacher, Noxolo Dlamini. Duma was originally charged, convicted and sentenced along with Simphiwe Khesi for the murders of Kippen and Anderson on 14 November 2007. Judge President Vuka Tshabalala sentenced the men to 15 years each for attempting to rob Anderson and sentenced Duma to 15 years for robbing Kippen and Khesi 20 years, in addition to the life sentences for murder. Both men laughed when sentenced saying, \"They're dead now. What are they worrying about?\" On 4 August 2009, Duma was further charged in connection with his various other crimes. On 17 August 2009, Acting Judge Kobus Booyens imposed a further six life sentences and prison terms totaling 104 years.
