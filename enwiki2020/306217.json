    "text": "Poster in support of the \"Conspiracy 8\" The Chicago Seven (originally Chicago Eight, also Conspiracy Eight/Conspiracy Seven) were seven defendants\u2014Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, John Froines, and Lee Weiner\u2014charged by the US federal government with conspiracy, inciting to riot, and other charges related to anti-Vietnam War and countercultural protests that took place in Chicago, Illinois, on the occasion of the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Bobby Seale, the eighth man charged, had his trial severed during the proceedings, lowering the number of defendants from eight to seven. The trial resulted in five of the seven convicted for inciting riots. All were acquitted of conspiracy. However, during the trial, Judge Julius Hoffman sentenced all of the defendants to lengthy sentences for contempt of court. In subsequent proceedings, the judge's contempt charges were reversed, and all of the convictions for inciting riots were overturned. ==Background== The 1968 Democratic National Convention was held in Chicago in late August to select the party's candidates for the November 1968 presidential election. Prior to and during the convention\u2014which took place at the International Amphitheatre\u2014rallies, demonstrations, marches, and attempted marches took place on the streets and in the lakefront parks, about five miles away from the convention site. These activities were primarily in protest of President Lyndon B. Johnson's policies for the Vietnam War, policies which were vigorously contested during the presidential primary campaign and inside the convention itself. Anti-war groups had petitioned the city of Chicago for permits to march five miles from the Loop to within sight of the convention site, to hold a number of rallies in the lakefront parks and also near the convention, and to camp in Lincoln Park. The city denied all permits, except for one afternoon rally at the old bandshell at the south end of Grant Park. The city also enforced an 11:00 pm curfew in Lincoln Park. Confrontations with protesters ensued as the police enforced the curfew, stopped attempts to march to the International Amphitheatre, and cleared crowds from the streets. The Grant Park rally on Wednesday, August 28, 1968, was attended by about 15,000 protesters; other nearby activities involved hundreds or thousands of protesters. After the rally at the bandshell, several thousand protesters attempted to march to the International Amphitheatre, but were stopped in front of the Conrad Hilton Hotel, where the presidential candidates and their campaigns were headquartered. Police worked to push the protesters out of the street, using tear gas, verbal and physical confrontation, and police batons to beat people; protesters retaliated by throwing rocks and bottles, and damaging private commercial property. The police made scores of arrests. The television networks broadcast footage of these violent clashes, cutting away from the nominating speeches for the presidential candidates. Over the course of five days and nights, the police made numerous arrests, in addition to using tear gas, mace, and batons on the marchers. Hundreds of protesters and police officers were injured. Dozens of journalists covering the actions were also clubbed by police or had cameras smashed and film confiscated. In the aftermath of what was later characterized as a \"police riot\" by the U.S. National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence, a federal grand jury indicted eight demonstrators and eight police officers. == Grand jury and indictment == Following the convention on September 9, 1968, a federal grand jury was convened to consider criminal charges. The grand jury focused on the possible grounds for charges in four areas: * A conspiracy by protesters to cross state lines to incite a riot; * Violations by police of the civil rights of demonstrators by use of excessive force; * TV network violations of the Federal Communications Act; and * TV network violations of federal wiretap laws. Over the course of more than six months, the grand jury met 30 times and heard some 200 witnesses. President Lyndon Johnson's Attorney General, Ramsey Clark, discouraged an indictment, believing that the violence during the convention was primarily caused by mishandling of the protests by the Chicago police. The grand jury returned indictments only after President Richard Nixon took office and John Mitchell assumed the office of Attorney General. On March 20, 1969, eight protesters were charged with various federal crimes and eight police officers were charged with civil rights violations. == Charges == The eight defendants were charged under the anti-riot provisions of Title X of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 which made it a federal crime to cross state lines with the intent to incite a riot, or to conspire to do so. The Chicago Eight indictments alleged crimes of three kinds: * That all eight defendants conspired (together with another 16 other co-conspirators who were not indicted) to cross state lines to incite a riot, to teach the making of an incendiary device, and to commit acts to impede law enforcement officers in their lawful duties. * That David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and Bobby Seale individually crossed state lines to incite a riot. * That John Froines and Lee Weiner instructed other persons in the construction and use of an incendiary device. The 16 people who were named as alleged co-conspirators but not indicted were: Wolfe B. Lowenthal, Stewart E. Albert, Sidney M. Peck, Kathy Boudin, Corina F. Fales, Benjamin Radford, Thomas W. Neumann, Craig Shimabukuro, Bo Taylor, David A. Baker, Richard Bosciano, Terry Gross, Donna Gripe, Benjamin Ortiz, Joseph Toornabene, and Richard Palmer. There is evidence that at least one other person, Eric Weinberger, was considered for indictment. ==Trial== Bobby Seale as depicted by Franklin McMahon at the trial. The original eight defendants indicted by the grand jury on March 20, 1969, were Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, John Froines, Lee Weiner, and Bobby Seale. The trial began on September 24, 1969.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon and Schuster 2000 p. 552 The defense attorneys were William Kunstler, Leonard Weinglass of the Center for Constitutional Rights, as well as Michael Kennedy, Michael Tigar, Charles Garry, Gerald Lefcourt, and Dennis Roberts. The judge was Julius Hoffman, and the prosecutors were Richard Schultz and Tom Foran. On October 9, the governor of Illinois requested the United States National Guard for crowd control as demonstrations increased outside the courtroom. When the names of the defendants were mentioned in court, at the early part of the trial, Judge Hoffman made a comment about defendant Abbie Hoffman (no relation); \"He is not my son.\" In an immediate reply, Abbie called out, \"Dad, dad, have you forsaken me?!\" Right from the beginning of the trial, Judge Hoffman showed a marked bias for the prosecution in his rulings and a dislike of the defense lawyers, making it clear that he disapproved of Kunstler's long hair.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon and Schuster 2000 p. 553 According to The Chicago Tribune, \"[b]eginning as the Chicago Eight Trial, it quickly became the Chicago Seven when Seale, after loudly disrupting the trial when he could not have the lawyer of his choice, was at first bound and gagged in the courtroom and then severed from the case for a later trial, which never occurred.\" Seale requested that the trial be postponed so that his attorney Charles Garry could represent him (as Garry was about to undergo gallbladder surgery). The Judge denied the postponement, and refused to allow Seale to represent himself. Seale vehemently protested the judge's illegal and unconstitutional actions, and arguing that they were not only illegal, but also racist. Seale told the courtroom: \"This racist administration government with its Superman notions and comic book politics. We're hip to the fact that Superman saved no black people. You got that?...You have did everything you could with those jive lying witnesses up there presented by these pig agents of the government to lie and say and condone some rotten racists, fascist crap by racist cops and pigs that beat people's heads in-and I demand my constitutional rights!\" The judge in turn accused Seale of disrupting the court, and on October 29, Hoffman ordered Seale to be bound, gagged, and chained to a chair, citing a precedent from the U.S. Supreme Court case Illinois v. Allen.US Supreme Court Center, 397 U.S. 337 (1970) For several days, Seale appeared in court bound and gagged before the jury, struggling to get free and managing to make muffled sounds. Defense attorney Kunstler declared, \"This is no longer a court of order, Your Honor, this is a medieval torture chamber.\" This was alluded to in Graham Nash's song, \"Chicago\", which opened with: \"So your brother's bound and gagged, and they've chained him to a chair\". Trying Seale with the other seven defendants also proved to be a fiasco, as it was revealed that Seale had not participated in the planning for the demonstration, but had gone to Chicago as a last-minute replacement for Eldridge Cleaver and was only in the city for two days of the convention. Ultimately, Judge Hoffman severed Seale from the case, sentencing him to four years in prison for contempt of court, one of the longest sentences ever handed down for that offense in the U.S. up to that time.Contempt in Chicago, Time Magazine, Friday, Nov. 14, 1969 Due to the judge's unconstitutional actions, the contempt charges against Seale were soon overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals. The Chicago Eight were then reduced to the Chicago Seven. The defendants, particularly members of the Youth International Party (\"yippies\"), Hoffman and Rubin, mocked courtroom decorum and the widely publicized trial became a focal point for a growing legion of protesters. One day, defendants Hoffman and Rubin appeared in court dressed in judicial robes. Hoffman blew kisses at the jury. Judge Hoffman was a frequent target of the defendants, who insulted him to his face. Abbie Hoffman told Judge Hoffman \"you are a shande fur de Goyim [Yiddish for \"disgrace in front of the gentiles\"]. You would have served Hitler better.\" He later added that \"your idea of justice is the only obscenity in the room.\" Both Davis and Rubin told the judge \"this court is bullshit.\" The trial extended for months, with many celebrated figures from the American left and counterculture called to testify, including singers Phil Ochs, Judy Collins, Arlo Guthrie, and Country Joe McDonald; writers Norman Mailer and Allen Ginsberg; and activists Timothy Leary and Jesse Jackson. Ochs, who was involved in planning for the demonstrations, told the court that he had acquired a pig to nominate as a presidential candidate. Rubin had tried to deliver the acceptance speech for the pig, named Pigasus, but before he could finish, police arrested him and Ochs under a livestock ordinance; this charge was later changed to disorderly conduct. ==Contempt citations== While the jury deliberated on the verdict, Judge Hoffman cited all the defendants\u2014plus their lawyers Kunstler, Kennedy, Weinglass, Lefcourt, Roberts and Tigar\u2014for numerous contempts of court, imposing sentences ranging from 2\u00bd months to four years. Judge Hoffman gave Kunstler four years in prison for addressing him as \"Mr. Hoffman\" instead of \"Your Honor\", Abbie Hoffman received 8 months for laughing in court, Hayden one year for protesting the treatment of Seale, and Weiner two months for refusing to stand when Judge Hoffman entered the courtroom.Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon and Schuster 2000 p. 560 Despite also engaging in occasional courtroom disruption, it was acknowledged that Froines' courtroom antics were mild compared to those of his other Chicago Seven co-defendants. ==Verdict== On February 18, 1970, each of the seven defendants was acquitted of conspiracy. Two (Froines and Weiner) were acquitted completely, while the remaining five were convicted of crossing state lines with the intent to incite a riot. The crime was instituted by the anti-riot provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, a provision that was introduced in the House by Representative William C. Cramer of Florida. On February 20, they were sentenced to five years in prison and fined $5,000 each.The Chicago Seven Trial: Excerpts from the Trial Transcript, Famous Trials: Chicago Seven Dellinger told the court that whatever punishment he faced in prison \"will be slight compared to what has happened already to the Vietnamese people, to the black people, to the criminals with whom we are now spending our days in the Cook County jail\".Langguth, A.J. Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975, New York: Simon and Schuster 2000 p. 561 Hayden charged that the responsibility with the riots at the Chicago Democratic convention laid with Chicago Mayor Richard Daley who had denied permits for protesters, saying: \"We had no choice. We had no choice in this trial. The people always do what they have to do\". Abbie Hoffman pointed to the portraits of American Revolutionary War heroes on the wall behind Judge Hoffman and said: \"I know those guys on the wall. I know them better than you, I feel. I know Adams. I mean, I know all the Adams. They grew up twenty miles from my home in Massachusetts. I played with Sam Adams on the Concord Bridge. I was there when Paul Revere rode right up on his motorcycle and said, 'The pigs are coming, the pigs are coming. Right into Lexington'. I was there\". In a final gesture of contempt towards those on trial, Judge Hoffman ordered that the barbers of the Cook County Jail cut the long hair of the defendants and defense lawyers that he found so offensive. At a press conference, Sheriff Joseph Woods of Cook County proudly displayed Abbie Hoffman's shorn hair. ==Appeal== On November 21, 1972, all of the convictions were reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on the basis that the judge was biased in his refusal to permit defense attorneys to screen prospective jurors for cultural and racial bias,United States v. Dellinger, 472 F.2d 340 (7th Cir. 1972). and the FBI surveillance of the defense lawyers' offices. The Justice Department decided against retrying the case. During the trial, all of the defendants and both defense attorneys had been cited for contempt and sentenced to jail, but those convictions were also overturned on appeal. The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that the personal nature of the conduct at issue required all of the contempt charges to be tried before another judge, and that each appellant whose sentence exceeded six months was entitled to a jury trial on the charge. In re Dellinger, 461 F.2d 389 (7th Cir. 1972). The contempt charges were retried before a different judge, who found Dellinger, Rubin, Hoffman, and Kunstler guilty of some of the charges, but did not sentence any of them to jail or fines.In re Dellinger, 370 F.Supp. 1304 (N.D.Ill. 1973). ==Cultural representations== ===Music=== Over 25 songs referenced the Chicago Seven and the 1968 Chicago demonstrations outside the Democratic National Convention. One of the first, released in 1968, was \"Telling It Straight in '68\" by country artist Jim Hartley, about the 1968 presidential election, which noted the confrontation in Chicago. A popular song was by Graham Nash, called \"Chicago\", for his debut album, Songs for Beginners. The songs's first line, \"So your brother's bound and gagged, and they've chained him to a chair\", is a reference to Bobby Seale. Other notable songs included \"William Butler Yeats Visits Lincoln Park and Escapes Unscathed\" and \"Where Were You in Chicago\" by Phil Ochs, featured on his 1969 album Rehearsals for Retirement, \"Circus '68 '69\" (1970) by Charlie Haden, \"Christmas in My Soul\" (1970) by Laura Nyro, \"Free Bobby Now\" (1970) by Black Panther group The Lumpen (about Bobby Seale), \"Chicago's 7\" by Walt Wilder, \"Chicago 7\" by Warren Farren, \"Chicago Seven\" (1971) by blues artist Memphis Slim, and \"The Chicago Conspiracy\" (1972) by David Peel. ===Film=== *Mixing fact and fiction, Haskell Wexler's 1969 film Medium Cool centers on the relationship between a cameraman and young widow as they are surrounded by the turmoil and violence during the \"long hot summer\" of Chicago. Wexler mixed staged scenes with documentary footage he shot at the demonstrations, creating a film in which his characters interacted seamlessly with the protesters. At one point, the viewer can hear another filmmaker telling Wexler he is getting too close to the action. *A BBC-produced docudrama titled The Chicago Conspiracy Trial was based on trial transcripts and aired in the United Kingdom in October 1970. The film was subsequently aired by Bayerischer Rundfunk (Bavarian Television) in West Germany in July 1971, and in the US by PBS in July 1975. *French filmmakers Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin, under the collective Dziga Vertov Group, made a film depicting the 1970 trials called Vladimir et Rosa. In it, Judge Julius Hoffman is referred to as \"Judge Himmler\" and the accused become microcosms of French revolutionary society. The historic figures of Lenin and Karl Rosa also appear, played by Godard and Gorin, respectively. *In the 1971 Peter Watkins film Punishment Park, fictional members of the counterculture are put on trial for similar \"crimes\". Like Black Panther Party activist Bobby Seale, one of the African-American defendants is bound and gagged as he was at the historic trial. *Woody Allen satirized the trial in his 1971 film Bananas. Allen's character, Fielding Melish, is on trial and defending himself. The judge orders Melish bound and gagged. In the next scene, a bound and gagged Allen coerces a confession, \u00e0 la Perry Mason, from a prosecution witness in his cross-examination. *In 1987, HBO aired Conspiracy: The Trial of the Chicago 8, a docudrama based on the court transcript as the primary source for the script. All eight of the original defendants, along with defense attorneys William Kunstler and Leonard Weinglass, participated in the project and provided commentary throughout the film. It was awarded the 1988 CableACE Award for Best Dramatic Special. *The 2000 film, Steal This Movie, is mostly about Abbie Hoffman (played by Vincent D'Onofrio), but also looks at the trial. *In the 2007 film Chicago 10, Oscar-nominated director Brett Morgen intercuts archival footage from the period, including the events of August 1968, with animated scenes based on the trial transcript. The film premiered at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival and was released in theaters in February 2008. *The Great Chicago Conspiracy Circus, by Cannes-winning director Kerry Feltham, was a feature film made at the time of the trial, based on the trial transcript and distributed by New Line Cinema. It was released in January 2008 on DVD. The film won the Berlin Film Festival jury prize, as well as positive reviews from the New York Times and Newsweek. *Archival footage of events at the Chicago demonstrations was featured in the 2010 documentary Phil Ochs: There but for Fortune. The film also featured interviews with many of Ochs' associates, including Rubin and Hoffman. It was a dual portrait of the singer- songwriter's career and the protest movements of the 1960s. *The Chicago 8, written and directed by Pinchas Perry, was filmed in September and October 2009 and released on October 23, 2012. The film is based closely on the trial transcripts and most of the action takes place in the courtroom. *Writer Aaron Sorkin directed a film entitled The Trial of the Chicago 7, released in 2020, which was based on a script he had written in 2007. Producers Steven Spielberg, Walter F. Parkes, and Laurie MacDonald collaborated on the development of Sorkin's script, with Spielberg intending to direct the film. Sacha Baron Cohen was originally cast as Abbie Hoffman, while Spielberg approached Will Smith for the role of Bobby Seale, and planned to meet with Heath Ledger about playing Tom Hayden. The Writers Guild of America strike, which started in November 2007 and lasted 100 days, Paul Greengrass in Talks for Aaron Sorkin-Penned 'The Trial of the Chicago 7' , Rebecca Ford, The Hollywood Reporter, 23 July 2013.Retrieved: 26 April 2015. delayed filming and the project was suspended. Sorkin was later to continue to rewrite the script for Spielberg, and the director intended to mostly cast unknowns to keep the budget down. Paul Greengrass and Ben Stiller were rumored as replacement directors, but the project did not move forward until Sorkin agreed to direct the project himself. The film was eventually released in 2020, distributed by Netflix. Top-name actors Sacha Baron Cohen, Mark Rylance, Michael Keaton, Eddie Redmayne, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Frank Langella were featured in the cast. ===Theatre and plays=== *In 1972, playwright and screenwriter David Petersen's play Little Orphan Abbie based on the transcript of the trial, opened in Seattle, directed by Jody Briggs and starring Glenn Mazen. It got good reviews and sold out every night; its run was extended twice. It was slated for production in New York by director Joe Papp, but had to be postponed and finally cancelled due to extended runs of other plays. It was later produced in Los Angeles, first on stage at the Burbage Theater, directed by Ron Hunter. It was later shot for television by Telemedia Productions, directed by Dick Studebaker. The television version used stock footage of the events in the parks and on the streets of Chicago during the riots. *In 1993, British playwright John Goodchild adapted the original trial transcripts for a radio play produced by L.A. Theatre Works, titled The Chicago Conspiracy Trial. Its cast included David Schwimmer (Abbie Hoffman), Tom Amandes (Richard Schultz), George Murdock (Judge Julius Hoffman), and Mike Nussbaum (William Kunstler). The play received an award at the New York Television Festival in 1993. ===Art=== On November 5, 1969, Richard Avedon made his first wall-sized mural portrait of the Chicago Seven in what appears to be a police-like line- up before the trial is completed. It was first exhibited at the Minneapolis Institute of Art in the summer of 1970 and has since been exhibited in museums around the world. Avedon called the group of defendants \"heroic.\" Menand, Louis, \"This is the End,\" (2012) Murals and Portraits (New York: Gagosian Gallery) ==See also== *Seattle Liberation Front *Days of Rage *Pigasus (politics) ==References== ==Further reading== ;Five editions of excerpts from the transcript of the trial have been published: * Edited by Judy Clavir and John Spitzer.
