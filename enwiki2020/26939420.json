Sandy soil and fields extend to the south in an area known as Pe\u0161\u010denke. Marshy meadows lie to the north, where the fields are arranged in beds with drainage canals.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2. Ljubljana: Dr\u017eavna zalo\u017eba Slovenije, p. 403. Northeast of the settlement, the territory of Brest includes a grove known as Kosler's Thicket (), named after Peter Kosler. ==Name== Brest was attested in written sources in 1330 as Fraezzen (and as Vrezzen circa 1330 and Brezzt in 1401). The name is derived from the Slovene common noun brest 'elm', referring to the local vegetation.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo\u0161ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo\u017eba ZRC, p. 78. ==History== A dugout canoe belonging to the prehistoric pile-dwellers' culture from the Ljubljana March was discovered in Brest during work in the courtyard of Brest Manor, testifying to early settlement of the area.
