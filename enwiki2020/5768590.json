    "text": "The Open Source Developers' Conference (OSDC) was a non-profit conference for developers of open-source software. It was started in Australia in 2004, and later expanded to Israel, Taiwan, Malaysia, France and Norway, where conferences began in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2009 and 2015, respectively. No further conferences have been held since 2015. The conference was open to talks about software developed for any platform or operating system so long as the talk was of interest to open-source developers. Talks about closed source projects which used open-source languages or open-source projects which used close source languages were accepted. Talks have covered languages such as Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby, Groovy, Scala, Java, Mono and C. Other talks have covered open-source tools such as databases and revision control systems or meta- topics such as talk presentation hints, and working with others. ==History== The conference was founded by Scott Penrose and first organised by members of the Melbourne Perl Mongers group in Melbourne, Australia in 2004. Originally it had been intended to be a YAPC-style (Perl) conference, but after discussions with the Melbourne PHP Users Group it was expanded to include PHP and Python talks. Following the 2004 conference's success, Scott Penrose created the Open Source Developers' Club Association to encourage programmers of other languages to also be involved in running the conference. At first this was an entirely Melbourne based organisation, but after the 2005 conference, it expanded to include members from elsewhere in Australia. At the end of 2006, control of running the conference for 2007 was given to a group in Brisbane, with the Open Source Developers' Club Association committee members taking the role of overseers. In 2013 the Open Source Developers' Club Association awarded the running of the event to a team in Auckland New Zealand, further expanding the conference with an Australasian focus. ==OSDC Australia== ===Locations=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
