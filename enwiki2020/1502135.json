She grew up in Timnath, Colorado. She was from a Lutheran background.. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Colorado State University and master's degrees in history from the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison and the University of Colorado. She received her Doctor of Philosophy degree from Brandeis University in 1973, writing her dissertation on Women and Politics: A Theoretical Analysis. ===Career=== Elshtain taught from 1973 to 1988 at the University of Massachusetts and then from 1988 to 1995 she taught at Vanderbilt University as the first woman to hold an endowed professorship.

Goodnow award, the highest award for distinguished service to the profession given by the American Political Science Association. The focus of Elshtain's work is an exploration of the relationship between politics and ethics. Much of her work concerned the parallel development of male and female gender roles as they pertain to public and private social participation. After the September 11, 2001, attacks she was one of the more visible academic supporters of US military intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq.News report in September/October 2013 issue of Philosophy Now magazine entitled 'Jean Bethke Elshtein' (sic), accessible here She published over five hundred essays and authored and/or edited over twenty books, including Democracy on Trial, Just War Against Terror: The Burden of American Power in a Violent World, Jane Addams and the Dream of American Democracy, Augustine and the Limits of Politics, and Sovereignty: God, State, Self. In 2006, she was appointed by US President George W. Bush to the Council of the National Endowment for the Humanities, and also delivered the prestigious Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, joining such previous Gifford Lecturers as William James, Hannah Arendt, Karl Barth, and Reinhold Niebuhr. In 2008, Elshtain received a second presidential appointment to the President's Council on Bioethics. Elshtain contributed to national debates on the family, the roles of men and women, the state of American democracy, and international relations for more than thirty-five years. ====Analysis of major works==== Elshtain's importance to the United States stems both from her impact in political ethics, and also her position in society as a woman. Carlin Romano, author of America the Philosophical, explains in his work that Elshtain's aim \"was not so much to lobby for specific policies as to push for good civic-minded 'individualism' over the egoism of 'bad individualism'\". In one of her more popular titles, Women and War, Elshtain examines women's roles in war as contrasted against masculine roles and why these concepts are important to society. Beginning by examining America's societal interpretations of gender roles during wartime (man as a brave fighter and woman as a pacifist), Elshtain argues that men may make poor civic soldiers due to the fact that they are predisposed to a dangerous kind of eager adolescence on the battlefield, while women may be enthusiastically patriotic and possess a kind of necessary maturity, which is vital to successful combat. In one of her more famous works, Democracy on Trial, Elshtain reflects on democracy in America, discussing how socio-cultural insistence on \"difference\" or \"separatism\" have evolved since the ratification of the Constitution, and how it may be detrimental to the system. Elshtain does not deny the importance of difference, especially within a civic body. Rather, she recognizes that Americans are no longer acting as representative bodies in governments, which embrace separate interests and also work as a collective towards the betterment of the whole. Elshtain, like James Madison, explains that American factional hostility is only a detriment to society: \"one makes war with enemies: one does politics \u2013 democratic politics \u2013 with opponents\". ===Death=== She died on August 11, 2013, at the age of 72 of heart failure resulting from endocarditis.
