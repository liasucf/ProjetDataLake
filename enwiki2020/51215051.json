Their world is disturbed when Carl von Rendt, an escaped Yugoslav war criminal, moves in next door. Carl is kidnapped by the Belford's gardener and charwoman with the intention of returning him to Europe to face justice. Martin and Alice discover the plot and have to decide if the kidnapping is justified or if Carl should be set free. ==Reviews== Helen Brown in The Canberra Times found much to enjoy in the book but also had reservations: \"Miss Cusack's latest novel seems to me one of her best; readable as always and enjoyable because of the human warmth of its author...The Sun Is Not Enough is wholesome fare, a home grown thriller. It would make a good escapist film. But the flavour of truth is almost lost in the chunks of fat and gristle.\"\"Fat lards the flavour of truth\" by Helen Brown, The Canberra Times, 5 August 1967, p8 In a short review in The Western Herald the reviewer noted the book is \"a warning of neo-Nazism spreading like a cancer within its unsuspecting host society, and events move fast and tension mounts to a dramatic climax as Dymphna Cusack's powerful story unfolds.\"\"The Public Library\", The Western Herald, 26 April 1968, p12 == See also == * 1967 in Australian literature ==References== Category:1967 Australian novels Category:Novels by Dymphna Cusack ",
