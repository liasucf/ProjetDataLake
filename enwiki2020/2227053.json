    "text": "\"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini\" is a novelty song telling the story of a shy girl wearing a revealing polka dot bikini at the beach. It was written by Paul Vance and Lee Pockriss and first released in June 1960 by Brian Hyland, with orchestra conducted by John Dixon. The Hyland version reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, selling a million copies in the US, and was a worldwide hit. The song has been adapted into French as \"Itsy bitsy petit bikini\" and into German as \"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Honolulu- Strand-Bikini\", reaching number one on national charts in both languages. Several versions of the song have proved successful in various European countries. In 1990 a version by British pop band Bombalurina, titled \"Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini\", reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and in Ireland. ==History and lyrics== The story told through the three verses of the song is as follows: (1) the young lady is too afraid to leave the locker where she has changed into her bikini; (2) she has made it to the beach but sits on the sand wrapped in a blanket; and (3) she has finally gone into the ocean, but is too afraid to come out, and stays immersed in the water \u2013 despite the fact that she's \"turning blue\" \u2013 to hide herself from view. Trudy Packer recited the phrases \"...two, three, four / Tell the people what she wore\", heard at the end of each verse before the chorus; and \"Stick around, we'll tell you more\", heard after the first chorus and before the start of the second verse. In an interview and article by Greg Ehrbar in The Cartoon Music Book, edited by Daniel Goldmark and Yuval Taylor, Rankin- Bass musical director Maury Laws said he 'ghosted' the arrangement of the song for John Dixon, as Dixon had taken on more work than he could handle at that time. At a time when bikini bathing suits were still seen as too risqu\u00e9 to be mainstream, the song prompted a sudden take off in bikini sales and is credited as being one of the earliest contributors to the acceptance of the bikini in society. The early 1960s saw a slew of surf movies and other film and television productions that rapidly built on the song's momentum.Rothaar, James. , JustLux\u00e9, LuxeMont, 2004. Hyland's version hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 on August 8, 1960 and sold over a million copies in the US. It also made the top 10 in other countries, including #8 on the UK Singles Chart. It also reached #1 in New Zealand. ==Ownership controversy== In September 2006 Paul Vance, the song's co-writer, read on TV his own mistaken obituary, as a consequence of the death of another man, Paul Van Valkenburgh, who claimed to have written \"Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polkadot Bikini\" under the name Paul Vance. The impostor had explained his lack of royalty payments for the song by claiming that he had sold the rights as a teenager. Vance, the song's true co-author, has earned several million dollars from the song since 1960, describing it as \"a money machine.\" ==In other media== The song was featured in the 1961 Billy Wilder film comedy One, Two, Three \u2013 in a key scene, the character Otto (Horst Buchholz), suspected of being a spy, is being tortured by East German police playing the song to him repetitively, eventually with the record off-center to create a weird howling variation of pitch. The actual recording was re-released in 1962 to capitalize on the film's success, but it did not rechart. The song is also used in films such as the 1981 Aparna Sen film 36 Chowringhee Lane as well as Sister Act 2 and Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise. The song was going to be one of the tracks for Just Dance 2017, but was removed for an unknown reason. However, it has made an appearance on its sequel Just Dance 2018, performed by The Sunlight Shakers. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! Chart (1960) !

The French version was recorded in 1960 first by Dalida and then by Johnny Hallyday and Richard Anthony (Dalida also recorded a version in Italian titled \"Pezzettini di bikini\"). Sales of all three French versions as well as Brian Hyland's English version were combined and reached number one in Wallonia (French-speaking Belgium), charting for nine months from September 1, 1960 to May 1, 1961.

It was recorded by Club Honolulu, an alias for French-born Italian singer Caterina Valente and her brother Silvio Francesco, and reached number one on the West German charts. The teenage Danish brothers Jan & Kjeld also recorded a version in German, but although the duo were popular in West Germany, having already had several hits there, their version failed to chart in that country, and its only chart appearance was in the Netherlands. ===Charts=== ====Club Honolulu version==== {| class=\"wikitable\" !

Andrews later married Gary Barlow of the group Take That. Mallett told the British pop magazine Smash Hits that the composer of popular theatre musicals Andrew Lloyd Webber had come up with the idea for making the single, and had asked Mallett to sing on it. The day after recording the song, Mallett took a copy of it on a tour of European clubs where he was making personal appearances, and asked the clubs' DJs to play the song, raising public awareness of the record. In November 2008, schoolteacher and former singer Everton Barnes claimed that he was the real singer on the record, as Mallett had been unable to hit the right notes and sung flat. The song was released on Carpet Records, a subsidiary of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group, and Lloyd Webber later admitted that he had produced the song because his wife had bet him that as a composer of musical theatre, he would not be able to make a pop song that was a big hit. The band name \"Bombalurina\" was taken from the name of one of the characters in Lloyd Webber's musical Cats. The song reached number one on the UK Singles Chart on August 19, 1990 and was certified silver for sales of 200,000 copies. The single also reached number one in Ireland and the top ten in Austria, Finland, Germany, New Zealand, and Norway. ===Charts=== ====Weekly charts==== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1990) !Peak position |- |- |- |Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |align=\"center\"|2 |- |Finland (Suomen virallinen lista) |align=\"center\"|4 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ====Year- end charts==== {|class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (1990) !Rank |- |Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |align=center|39 |- |UK Singles (Gallup) |align=center|16 |} ===Certifications=== ==Other cover versions and parodies== There have been cover versions in many languages. * Comedian Buddy Hackett released a cover version of this song soon after the original was released. * German version with Club Honolulu (Caterina Valente and her brother Silvio Francesco) in 1960. * The country comedy duo Homer and Jethro did a parody version on their 1966 album \"Songs To Tickle Your Funny Bone.\" * Connie Francis included a version of the song on her 1966 album Connie Francis and The Kids Next Door. * Jimi Hendrix played a brief cover of the song on the live recording Mr. Pitiful, released in 1981 in Germany only. * German punk band Die Toten Hosen covered the Club Honolulu version (in German) on their 1987 cover album Never Mind the Hosen, Here's Die Roten Rosen.
