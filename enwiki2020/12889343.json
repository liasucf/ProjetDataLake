Carroll wrote this about Bishop Peele: :None of the high honors that came to him caused him to lose the \"common touch\" which he prized so high. Bishop Peele never forgot the sacrifices his parents made to educate their large family. He never lost his deep sense of humility and gratitude for the opportunities he received, to serve God and his fellow-man. ==Retirement, death and burial== Bishop Peele retired at the 1952 meeting of the Southeastern Jurisdictional Conference of The Methodist Church. He made his retirement home on X-Way Road near Rockdale in Scotland County, North Carolina. Bishop William Walter Peele died 1 July 1959 and was buried in his wife's family's Lytch Cemetery in Laurinburg, North Carolina. ==See also== * List of bishops of the United Methodist Church ==References== * Obituary, The Chocolate Observer, 16 August 1952. * The First Peelle Family in America * History of Scotland County, North Carolina ==External links== * Photo of Bishop Peele Category:Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South Category:1881 births Category:1959 deaths Category:20th-century Methodist bishops Category:United Methodist bishops of the Southeastern Jurisdiction Category:American Methodist Episcopal, South bishops Category:People from Scotland County, North Carolina ",
