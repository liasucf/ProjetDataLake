She took acting and singing lessons and planned to train as a dancer, but a cardiac defect prevented this, and led her to acting. She made her film debut in Addio giovinezza! (1927), starring Walter Slezak, Elena Sangro, and Carmen Boni. That same year, she played supporting roles in A Girl of the People, the anti-abortion film Children's Souls Accuse You, and Herkules Maier. She is perhaps best known for her roles in Todessturz im Zirkus Cesarelli (1927), Die wei\u00dfe Sonate (1928), and The Hound of the Baskervilles (1929). Her last film appearance was in the Nazi propaganda film Hans Westmar (1933). After Bartheel retired from acting, she traveled throughout Europe as a photographer. She published two books containing her photographs, Abenteuer an der Eismeerstra\u00dfe (1939) and Unter Sinai-Beduinen und M\u00f6nchen. Eine Reise (1943). Bartheel died on 28 December 1983 in West Berlin. ==Selected filmography== * Children's Souls Accuse You (1927) * Goodbye Youth (1927) * The Curse of Vererbung (1927) * A Girl of the People (1927) * Der Ladenprinz (1928) * Under the Lantern (1928) * Herkules Maier (1928) * His Strongest Weapon (1928) * He Goes Right, She Goes Left!
