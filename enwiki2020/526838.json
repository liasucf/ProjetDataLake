    "text": "Singin' in the Rain\" in Art on Ice 2014 Kurt Browning, (born June 18, 1966) is a Canadian figure skater, choreographer and commentator. He is a four-time World Champion and Canadian national champion. == Career == Browning was both Canadian figure skating champion and World Champion four times. He represented Canada in three Winter Olympics, 1988 (finishing 8th overall), 1992 (6th) and 1994 (5th), and earned the privilege of carrying the Canadian flag during the opening ceremonies of the 1994 games in Lillehammer, Norway. Browning's other achievements include three Canadian Professional Championships and three World Professional Championships. On March 25, 1988, at the 1988 World Championships in Budapest, Hungary, Browning landed the first ratified quadruple jump, a toe loop in the competition. This accomplishment is listed in the Guinness Book of Records. Jozef Sabov\u010d\u00edk had previously landed a quad toe loop at the 1986 European Championships which was recognized at the event but then ruled invalid three weeks later. Browning later said, \"I remember that there were a few people landing the jump (in practice) long before I did, and by watching them I was inspired to try it myself. After landing it, I certainly expected more skaters to start doing it in competition. I was surprised in the next few years when that really did not happen.\" Browning is also known for his intricate, fast, often lighthearted footwork. During his career, Browning had a long rivalry with Brian Boitano. At the 2006 Ice Wars competition, Browning narrowly defeated Boitano. One of Browning's iconic programs is \"Singin' in the Rain\", where he emulates Gene Kelly's dancing in the film. Choreographed by Sandra Bezic and debuted in a CBC-TV special in 1994, this program is still asked to be performed at ice shows after 20 years. As a commentator, Browning has made frequent appearances since turning professional in 1994. He has been a regular colour commentator for the CBC at major skating events since 2006. Browning appeared in the 2006 Fox television program Skating with Celebrities. Starting in 2009, he was the co-host of Battle of the Blades. As a choreographer, he has choreographed programs for many figure skaters including: * Jeremy Abbott * Kevin Alves * Patrick Chan * Vaughn Chipeur * Marc-Andr\u00e9 Craig * Alissa Czisny * Javier Fern\u00e1ndez * Yuzuru Hanyu * Takeshi Honda * Brian Joubert * Tu\u011fba Karademir * Carolina Kostner * Takahiko Kozuka * Tara Lipinski * Evan Lysacek * Brandon Mroz * Lucinda Ruh * Jamie Sal\u00e9 / David Pelletier * Yuka Sato * Tom\u00e1\u0161 Verner * Yan Han He also co-directed and choreographed the 2011\u201312 Stars on Ice tour. == Awards and honors == Browning was awarded with a Lou Marsh Trophy for top Canadian Athlete (in 1990), Lionel Conacher Awards (1990 and 1991), Order of Canada (in 1990), an American Skating World Professional Skater of the Year Award (in 1998), and a Gustav Lussi Award from the Professional Skaters' Association (in 2001).

He was inducted into World Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2006. == Personal life == Browning was born on June 18, 1966, in Rocky Mountain House, Alberta. He was raised in Caroline, Alberta.
