A solicitor before entering politics, he practised at West Wyalong and Waverley. He was married three times: firstly on 7 May 1879 to Harriett Elizabeth Hollingdale; secondly on 15 December 1901 to Rebecca Agnes Wales, whom he later divorced; and thirdly to Isabella Jane Peterson. None of these marriages produced children. In 1877 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Bogan, but he was defeated in 1880. He returned as the member for Forbes in 1882 and was re-elected in 1885, but did not contest the 1887 election. Coonan died in 1926. ==References== Category:1853 births Category:1926 deaths Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly ",
