It was reported in the New York Times that Stein 'often complimented women on their appearance and suggested they invite attractive friends to [Paris Review] parties'.

Another woman in publishing claimed that, a decade earlier, Stein had touched her at a work dinner in an inappropriate way, including touching her knee several times, sliding his hand up her skirt and touching her underwear.
