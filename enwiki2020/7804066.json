    "text": "The General Conference Session is the official world meeting of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, held every five years. At the session, delegates from around the world elect the Church's World Leaders, discuss and vote on changes to the Church's Constitution, and listen to reports from the Church's 13 Divisions on activities going on within its territory. The first session was held on May 20, 1863 in Battle Creek, Michigan with 20 delegates in attendance. The early sessions were held every year in a small church. As the Church's membership grew, time between sessions lengthened, meeting places got bigger, and more delegates attended. Today the sessions are held every five years in cities with stadiums that can seat more than 70,000 attendees, which includes the more than 2,400 delegates attending and the visitors from around the world who are watching the session. == List of sessions https://www.adventistarchives.org/general-conference-sessions == {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Session!!Date!!City!!Venue!!# of Delegates!!Theme!!Comments |- | 1.|| May 20\u201323, 1863|| Battle Creek, Michigan|| ||20|| ||General Conference organized |- | 2.|| May 18\u201321, 1864 ||Battle Creek, Michigan|| ||20|| || |- | 3.|| May 17, 1865||Battle Creek, Michigan|| ||21|| || Work with \"colored\" people organized |- | 4.|| May 16\u201317, 1866||Battle Creek, Michigan|| ||19|| || |- | 5.|| May 14\u201319, 1867||Battle Creek, Michigan|| ||18|| || |- | 6.|| May 12\u201318, 1868||Battle Creek, Michigan|| ||15|| || |- | 7.|| May 18\u201324, 1869 ||Battle Creek, Michigan|| ||16|| || |- | 8.|| March 15\u201320, 1870 ||Battle Creek, Michigan|| ||22|| || James Erzberger of Switzerland becomes the first delegate from outside the United States |- | 9.|| February 7\u201312, 1871||Battle Creek, Michigan|| ||17|| || |- | 10.|| December 29, 1871 \u2013 January 3, 1872|| Battle Creek, Michigan|| ||14|| || |- | 11.|| March 11\u201314, 1873||Battle Creek, Michigan|| ||18|| || |- | 12.|| November 14\u201316, 1873||Battle Creek, Michigan|| ||21|| || |- | 13.|| August 10\u201315, 1874 ||Battle Creek, Michigan|| ||19|| ||J.N.
