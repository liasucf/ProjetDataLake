Its initial height was about 200m, however in July 1976 its top part of 40m was cut off and replaced with a platform with 8 antennae. The resulting height has become 176m. This reconstruction was doe to the fact that the main TV/radio broadcasting functions were passed to the newly built 350metre tall Kolodischi TV Mast some 15 km off Minsk. The new design was to support radiotelephone communications network. By the tower there used to be the TV center. Currently this building is occupied by the state-owned TV channels All-National TV and Capital Television. ==References== Category:Towers in Belarus Category:Communications in Belarus Category:Radio masts and towers in Europe Category:Towers completed in 1955 ",
