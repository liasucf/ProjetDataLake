    "text": "Poatina (Palawa indigenous people's word for \"cave\") is a town in Tasmania, Australia, 60 km south west of Launceston's central business district. Its local government area is the Northern Midlands Council. At the 2006 Census, Poatina had a population of 166. The Poatina Power Station opened in 1964 and Poatina Village was constructed nearby to house the work force from the time that work started in 1958. Hydro Tasmania sold the village in 1995 to Fusion Australia, an Australian Christian Youth and Community organisation that works with young people and their communities throughout Australia. Poatina Village is located on the edge of the Great Lakes country, renown for its trout fishing, and is framed by the majestic Great Western Tiers. Located only 40 minutes from Launceston, 90 minutes from Devonport and 2 hours from Hobart, Poatina Village offers a unique Great Western Tiers accommodation. The power station comprises 6 Pelton turbines with a generating capacity of 300MW. The underground power station is driven by waters from Great Lake, 5.6 km to the south west. Some of the Poatina facilities are used throughout the year in youth and community training programmes. The Poatina Hill Climb is staged in December on a 10.2 km stretch of the Poatina Road; the rise is 580m. The village now has the Golden Chain Chalet Motel and Hostel with 12 self- contained, double storey, mountain cottages, a 9-hole Golf Course, a post office, service station, general store, restaurant and cafe making it a popular mountain retreat style accommodation. It is also the home of the Althea Mountain Retreat Arts Centre and Hot Glass Studio. ==References== ==External links== http://www.hydro.com.au/energy/our-power-stations/great- lake-south-esk-0/poatina-power-station http://www.poatina.com/poatina-story Category:Midlands (Tasmania) ",
