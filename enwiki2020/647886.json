The trio had started exploring together during the summer of 1985\u20131986. Alfred Saddlier, a worker for the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works (MMBW), is often cited as an inspiration to the Cave Clan's founders. During construction on Melbourne\u2019s drains in the 1940s and 1950s, Saddlier would leave his name and the date in tar paint before the last section of tunnel was put in place. After Saddlier was mentioned in an article in Melbourne\u2019s The Herald Sun his sister wrote to the Cave Clan explaining that her brother was in fact a \"builder of drains\", and not an explorer. ==Membership and activities== Cave Clan members explore natural or artificial tunnels and caves, along with rooftops and abandoned buildings. Their most frequent activities involve exploring underground stormwater drains, bunkers, tunnels and forts.Brunero, Tim (22 January 2008) \"Live News Exclusive \u2013 Drunk Vandals or Intrepid Explorers?\", livenews.com.au.

Amongst other things, members are attracted by the appeal of entering locations that the public rarely sees. ==Safety issues== The Cave Clan does not advocate entering drains when it is raining, exploring alone, or removing a manhole from beneath if the above location is unknown. This is due to the potential hazard of the exit being on a road and thus has the risk of being struck by a vehicle. The golden rule of the Cave Clan is, \"When it rains, no drains!\". ==Controversy== A modern compass themed Cave Clan logo. As with urban exploration-related topics, by entering into locations or drains without permission, the members of the Cave Clan can be described as \"recreational trespassers\".

Coroner Hugh Dillon investigating the death of two graffiti artists in a Sydney stormwater drain in 2008 has recommended police investigate a group known as the Sydney Cave Clan. Delivering his findings into the deaths, Dillon said he was concerned about the counter-cultural message by the group, which he said consisted of \"shadowy characters\". Dillon said he would recommend to police that they investigate the group and shut the website down after it was revealed that it publicised the drain and encouraged risk-taking activity.

Drain tagging is discouraged, especially in historically significant areas; there are clear examples, however, of the Cave Clan name, logo and other specific material related to the Cave Clan and/or their members, being used in graffiti, by unknown sources. The group accepts leaving details of an expedition in a plain section of the drain, tunnel or cavity to mark the place and time, and placing stickers above ground for promotional purposes. ==Cultural references== \"Cave Clan\" is the subject and title of a song released on the Mick Thomas album Spin!
