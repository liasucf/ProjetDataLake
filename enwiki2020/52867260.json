The hospital is not a traditional public hospital, and it is expected that 40% of beds will be reserved for private patients. Doctors are paid less to treat public patients than those with private health insurance. Since opening, the hospital has attracted criticism, with a doctor's union accusing the private operator of being \"incompetent\" and driven by \"profit before patient care\". The hospital has also experienced problems with insufficient staffing numbers and lack of basic medical supplies such as insulin. Dr Tony Sara, from the Australian Salaried Medical Officers Federation of New South Wales, told the ABC that \"There is not a complete and proper blood bank...There are ongoing reports of lack of medicines, lack of forms and clinical policies and processes.\" ==References== Category:Hospital buildings completed in 2018 Category:Hospitals established in 2018 Category:Hospitals in Sydney Category:2018 establishments in Australia ",
