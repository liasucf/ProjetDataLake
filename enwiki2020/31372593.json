    "text": "\"Motivation\" is a song performed by American recording artist Kelly Rowland, from her third studio album Here I Am (2011). The song was written by Jim Jonsin, Rico Love, Daniel Morris and Lil Wayne, with Jonsin producing the song and Lil Wayne having featured vocals. The R&B; slow-jam serves as the lead single from Here I Am and was released from April 8, 2011. Upon release, \"Motivation\" received favorable reviews from critics generally praising the sexiness of the song. Official remixes were produced for the song, including a dubstep-inspired electronic mix by Diplo and a rap remix by Busta Rhymes, Trey Songz and Fabolous. In the United States, the song has peaked at number one on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs chart where it stayed seven weeks in a row, and number seventeen on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Rowland's second US top 20 hit (fourth top 30 overall) and her second highest performing single to date as a solo artist, behind \"Dilemma\". It was certified double platinum by the RIAA in May 2013. An accompanying music video was directed by Sarah Chatfield, the director behind Rowland's previous video \"Forever and a Day\" (2010). It follows a number of sultry scenes where Rowland dances seductively amongst partially dressed dancers in a dimly-lit warehouse, with the entire video tinged in blue light. \"Motivation\" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 54th Grammy Awards. Rowland sang the song with Trey Songz at the 2011 BET Awards ceremony. ==Background and release== Here I Am was originally scheduled for release in 2010, but was pushed back numerous times. Initially the dance-influenced \"Commander\" served as the album's lead single for international territories while two separate singles were serviced in the United States. \"Rose Colored Glasses\" for the pop format and \"Grown Woman\" for the urban format. Rowland decided in September 2010 to re-enter the recording studios to work on new material for the album. This, coupled with creative issues such as naming the album, led to multiple pushbacks. \"Motivation\" was announced as the title for the album's new lead single during New York Fashion Week. It debuted online via Rap-Up magazine's website on March 2, 2011. Speaking of how the record came about, Rowland said \"Motivation came about when I was in the studio with [producers] Jim Jonsin and Rico Love, and we kind of were just vibing. I told Rico I wanted something really sexy ... and he came up with 'Motivation' along with Jim. It turned into this amazing record... I played [ 'Motivation' for Lil Wayne ] and he got on it, and it was just as simple as that.\" Along with the single announcement, Rap-Up said fans could expect the video and a remix produced by Diplo to premiere in April 2011. However, the electronic remix, produced by Diplo, premiered via Rap-Up on March 8, 2011. ==Composition== \"Motivation\" is a R&B; slow jam and electropop song written by Richard Butler (Rico Love), Jim Jonsin, Dwayne Carter and Danny Morris. The racy lyrics center around Rowland asking her man to use his hands all over her body, and are accompanied by a \"synth-saturated beat\" produced by Jonsin. In terms of instruments, \"Motivation\" uses sparse keyboard notes, programmed beats and pulsing synths in the chorus. The song has a medium tempo of 140 beats per minute. Wayne adds a rap verse complementing Rowland's seductive suggestions, using the kitchen and a car as metaphors for sex. According to Scott Shetler from AOL Music, Rowland uses the lyrics to promise \"to be her lover's motivation.\" Rowland called the record a mixture between dance and mash-up. When asked by MTV what Rowland thought of the song, she said,\"It has that personality and characteristic to it that I don't think anybody can deny. That's why when Wayne dropped that insane verse on there ... I was like, 'You really brought that up even more.' He went into the studio and just did it. I don't think it takes much for Wayne to think. He just does it. He's so admirable.\" ==Critical reception== Lil Wayne (pictured) is featured on the single, and his verse received positive reviews. Ryan Brockington, from the New York Post, was amongst the first to review \"Motivation.\" In his review, he said \"The single is a big leap from the dance club synth pop that Kelly has been releasing the past year and it seems like she might be trying to shimmy her way back into the hip-hop world by teaming up with the Midas touch vocals of Lil Wayne.\" Both Rap-Up and AOL Music's Scott Shetler called the song \"sexy.\" Becky Bain from Idolator disliked the song for not being memorable. The short review was summed up with the closing phrase, \"she's going to need another hit to help promote her album when it finally is ready to drop.\" Mikey Fresh of Vibe said that Rowland readies the song with \"just a touch of sensuality\". Wesley Case from The Baltimore Sun complimented the song's sexy quality. \"If this isn't the year's hands-down sexiest song thus far, it has to be in the discussion. Rowland, whose sultry voice could get a priest hot, weaving in and out of the minimal beat, and setting the table for Lil Wayne's stuttering, after-hours guest-verse. Stack the pieces together and it's an understated knockout that gets sexier with each spin.\" Shahryar Rizvi of Dallas Observer felt that the song was a \"female-fronted counterpart\" to the smooth, slow-tempo R&B; vibe that R. Kelly and Trey Songz usually proffer. Nathan Slavik of Billboard ranked it number five on their \"Critics' Picks: 20 Best Songs of 2011\". Rap-Up ranked \"Motivation\" number 6 on their year-end best songs list for 2011. \"Motivation\" was nominated for two awards at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards including Best Dance Performance and Song of the Year. It won the award for Song of the Year and was also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 54th Grammy Awards, which was held on February 12, 2012. In 2019, The Associated Press named the song number 2 out of 25 songs listed as a part of its \"Top songs of the decade\". ===Accolades=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! Publication !

In the weeks following it continued to rise thanks to urban airplay, eventually reaching number one in its tenth week on the chart, chart dated May 23, 2011. \"Motivation\" is Rowland's first solo number one as lead artist on a US Billboard composite chart (one combining airplay and sales), although she previously peaked at number one with Nelly on his 2002 single \"Dilemma.\" It stayed at the top spot of the chart for six more weeks.

The producer of \"Motivation\", Jim Jonsin, said he was proud and confident of the song's success. \"I'm really happy that things are going well for her on this record. A real concern for us was to get that smash for her... She's a friend of ours as well, so to see her win is huge.\" Furthermore, \"Motivation\" reached the top ten in other Billboard component charts, peaking at number three on the Hot Ringtones chart, number ten on the Radio Songs chart and number one on the Hot 100 Recurrents chart. ==Music video== One of the blue light-shaded scenes from the video, where Kelly Rowland sings seductively, while other people get romantic in the background. The music video for \"Motivation\" was directed by Sarah Chatfield, at the end of March 2011. Frank Gatson served as the video's chroegrapher. Speaking during Roberto Cavalli's fashion show, Rowland said she was on the look out for \"womanly, sexy designs\" for a \"feminine sexy video.\" She elaborated on the development of the video during an interview when MTV News' Jocelyn Vena. She told Vena, \"We came up with the energy, and with Frank [Gatson] \u2014 and I don't know how he sees something, but he got it... I'm so thankful I have a great team that's thinking 10 steps ahead of me. With Sarah she understood; she got the concept. It was great the way everything came together.\" The video made its world premiere on BET's 106 & Park on April 4, 2011. The video opens in a blue-colored hue lit warehouse, with Rowland standing in the passageway before it cuts to her walking through the building checking out the ladies and men mingling. Rowland can then be seen in a purple swimsuit & coat, doing different sexual choreography routines with her many half-dressed male backup dancers. The clip then shows Lil Wayne in his own scene rapping his verse to the song. He can then be seen leaning against a wall and standing on a bed with the lights flashing while Rowland is simultaneously being entertained by a male dancer as she sits upon a chair. The video then continues with the crowd entwining with each other; full make out sections between females and their male counterparts, as well as half- dressed males feeling on each other's bodies, while the females also interact with each other. After more dancing from Rowland and her dancers, the video then ends with Rowland singing her last lines, surrounded by the sexually charged crowd.
