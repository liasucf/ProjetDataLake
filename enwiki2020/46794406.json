By agreement with the neighbouring South African Republic, it was incorporated into the ZAR in July 1888. The Volksraad (legislature) approved an official flag on 13 November 1884.Leverton, B.J. & Pringle, J.A. (1975). The Pioneers of Vryheid. ==Description== Flag of Nieuwe Republiek Alternative version that was never flown The flag was evidently inspired by the 'Vierkleur' Flag of the South African Republic. The colours were simply re- arranged, so that the horizontal bands were red, white and green, and the vertical bar was blue.Van Zyl, J.A. (1995). 'History of the Flags of South Africa before 1900' in SAVA Journal SJ 4/95.Burgers, A.P. (2008). The South African Flag Book. The Volksraad resolution specified that a small Union Jack should be placed on the blue, a small ZAR 'Vierkleur' on the red, a small Orange Free State flag on the white, and a small Cape Colony flag on the green. However, this was not done. ==References== ==Sources== * Burgers, A.P. (1997). Sovereign Flags over Southern Africa. * Burgers, A.P. (2008). The South African Flag Book. * Van Zyl, J.A. (1995).
