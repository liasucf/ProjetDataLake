It is one of only four native species of earwig in the United Kingdom, although three further species have been introduced. In the United Kingdom, it is only found in the south-east, which has the most continental climate. It is widespread in East Kent, and is also found in Essex and Suffolk. It may have arrived in Great Britain via a land bridge over the North Sea known as Doggerland. ==Taxonomy== Hagenbach's 1822 illustration of \"Forficula media\" (now Apterygida media) Apterygida media was first described by Jacob Johann Hagenbach under the name Forficula media. His description appeared in the 1822 work '. ==Description== Apterygida media has short wings and elytra.
