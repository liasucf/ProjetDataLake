The station building was razed in 1965 and the station closed for traffic in 1990. The station did not have a residential section and was drawn by Paul Armin Due. ==History== The station was built as part of Hell\u2013Sunnan Line and opened 15 November 1905 along with the rest of the line north of Verdal. Though part of the initial plans for the railway, and supported by the then Sparbu municipal council, the Parliament decided not to build the station on 5 June 1900 but changed their minds giving the go-ahead on 24 April 1901. ==References== Category:Railway stations in Steinkjer Category:Railway stations on the Nordland Line Category:Railway stations opened in 1905 Category:Railway stations closed in 1990 Category:Disused railway stations in Norway Category:1905 establishments in Norway Category:1990 disestablishments in Norway Category:National Romantic architecture in Norway Category:Art Nouveau railway stations ",
