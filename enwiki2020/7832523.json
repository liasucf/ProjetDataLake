    "text": "The College Ground is a cricket ground in the grounds of Cheltenham College in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England. Gloucestershire County Cricket Club have played more than 300 first-class and more than 70 List A matches there. It also hosted a women's One-Day International between England and Australia in 2005. The College Ground first hosted first-class cricket in 1872 when Gloucestershire played Surrey; Gloucestershire won the game by an innings and 37 runs thanks largely to W. G. Grace's match haul of 12\u201363. In August 1876, Grace became the first man to score a triple century in a county match when he hit 318 not out against Yorkshire; he had made the first triple hundred in all first-class cricket for the Gentlemen of Marylebone Cricket Club at Canterbury just one week earlier. The Cheltenham Cricket Festival, held during the school holidays, has been a part of Gloucestershire's season ever since the 1870s. ==Notes== ==See also== *List of cricket grounds in England and Wales ==External links== * College Ground, Cheltenham at CricketArchive * College Ground, Cheltenham at Cricinfo Category:Cricket grounds in Gloucestershire Category:Sports venues in Cheltenham ",
