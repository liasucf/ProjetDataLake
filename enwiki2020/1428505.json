    "text": "Artis Gilmore (born September 21, 1949) is a former American basketball player who played in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and National Basketball Association (NBA). Gilmore was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on August 12, 2011. A star center during his two collegiate years at Jacksonville University, Gilmore led the Dolphins to the NCAA Division I championship game in 1970, where his team was beaten 80\u201369 by the UCLA Bruins. Gilmore remains the top player in rebounds per game in the history of NCAA Division I basketball. Gilmore followed five All-Star seasons with the Kentucky Colonels of the ABA by becoming the first overall pick in the 1976 ABA Dispersal draft, which dispersed the players in the ABA clubs, such as the Colonels, that did not join the NBA. During his career, Gilmore was an 11-time All-Star, the ABA Rookie of the Year, and an ABA MVP. Nicknamed \"The A-Train\", the Gilmore once played in 670 consecutive games. ==Early years== Gilmore was born in Chipley, Florida, one of 10 children. He was raised there, and attended Roulhac High School. Gilmore was 6'5' at age 15. When public schools were integrated, he attended Chipley High School for one week before leaving home to attend Carver High School in Dothan, Alabama, a larger community 35 miles to the north. He graduated from Dothan's Carver High School in 1967, at 6'10\" as a Third Team All- American.https://hoopsaddict.wordpress.com/2007/08/28/historical-glimpses- artis-gilmore/ ==College career== Gilmore played college basketball beginning at Gardner\u2013Webb Junior College in Boiling Springs, North Carolina from 1967\u20131969.

But Artis showed that he was deserving of that attention. I would say Artis and George Adams were two of the hardest-working players I ever coached. They were relentless. Anything you asked them to do or pushed them to do, they did it \u2014 or tried to do it anyway.\u201d\u201d In 1969\u20131970, Gilmore transferred to Jacksonville University. He led the Jacksonville Dolphins team to a 27\u20132 record under Coach Joe Williams.

The Dolphins defeated St. Bonaventure 91\u201383 (29/21) in the Semi-Final. For the season, Gilmore averaged 26.5 and 22.2 rebounds per game.
