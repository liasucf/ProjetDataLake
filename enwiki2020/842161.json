After two albums, the group parted ways in 2005 ==History== The group's original members met at Cheltenham Girls High School in northern Sydney in 1994 and decided to form a band. They had been pitched as Australia's premier all-female band. The original line-up consisted of Greer Skinner on lead vocals and guitar, Annette Harada on bass guitar, Naomi \"Batti\" Battah on guitar and occasional lead vocals and drummer Angela Blackshaw. After an initial period establishing itself on the Sydney live circuit the band came to the attention of independent label Chatterbox Records and in 2000 Skulker released the album Too Fat for Tahiti. The title was apparently inspired by the band being rejected for a gig as a house band at a resort in Tahiti because they were \"too fat\". Too Fat for Tahiti spawned the tracks \"Naughty\" and \"H\u00ebj\" that received considerable support from the national youth radio station Triple J and both were voted into the network's annual listeners' poll, The Hottest 100, at number 50 and 80 respectively. The album was subsequently nominated for Best Independent Album at the ARIA Awards and Skulker was nominated for Best New Live Act at the Australian Music Awards. Skulker then toured Australia exhaustively before recording a new album The Double Life that was released in early 2003. A free download-only single \"Rock Nugget\" was released. It was downloaded over 20,000 times and received high rotation on Triple J. The band also played alongside one of their major music influences, Veruca Salt, in Sydney's The Metro Theatre in July that year. The album received feature album status on the network. The band went on to release the singles \"Coming Home\" and \"In Your Arms\" and played the Big Day Out tour in 2004. Early 2004 also found the band opening for Pink in Sydney and Newcastle and toured nationally supporting The Superjesus. At this point Batti decided to depart the band and moved to Canada to pursue other interests. Following the replacement of Batti with new guitarist Gregory Boulting, Skulker toured the east coast of Australia and recorded extensive demos of new material that have never been released. The band members have since decided to go their own ways and pursue further interests. ==Discography== === Albums === *Too Fat For Tahiti (2000) *The Double Life (2003) === EPs === *Morgan to the Moon (1998) === Singles === *Bittersweet (1998) *H\u00ebj (2000) *Naughty (2000) *Newport Nightmare / Strawberry Deluxe (2001) *Rock Nugget (2001) *Coming Home (2003) *In Your Arms (2003) ==References== ==External links== *Guest programming Rage *Official MySpace page *Ange's new band *Skulker message board Category:Australian rock music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1994 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2005 Category:All-female bands ",
