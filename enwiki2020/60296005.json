He was active in Burgos and the neighboring region. == Biography == He was long forgotten, until being rediscovered in 1966, thanks to a study by , who proposed that he was born in Flanders around 1460 and arrived in Spain before the first group of Flemish painters arrived, led by Juan de Flandes. Other researchers, such as presumed that he was born in Spain; probably Castile. This viewpoint was supported by Didier Martens (born 1960), who published a study on the subject in 2001.Martens, 2001, p. 208. The influence upon his work by painters of the Burgundian Netherlands, such as Rogier van der Weyden, especially in his treatment of light, may be explained by their presence in Spain, rather than by his origins. Even Guidol suggests that he began as a sculptor and may have started his artistic career in the workshop of Gil de Silo\u00e9, who is believed to have been born in Antwerp. His artistic personality is largely defined by two works: Cristo de Var\u00f3n de Dolores entre la Virgen y San Juan, at the Museo del Prado; his only signed work, probably created between 1475-1480, and the Estigmatizaci\u00f3n de San Francisco de As\u00eds at the Iglesia de San Esteban de Burgos (1487-1489). Based on an analysis of these works, it has been possible to make other attributions: notably, Cristo de Piedad entre dos \u00e1ngeles at the , and the Cristo de Piedad entre los profetas David y Jerem\u00edas, the central tableau of the predella of an altarpiece and companion to two other tableaux (of the prophets Isaiah and Daniel) in the collection of the University of Li\u00e8ge, which have been attributed to the German painter, Hans Leonhard Sch\u00e4ufelein. == References == ==Further reading== * Azc\u00e1rate, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda, Arte g\u00f3tico en Espa\u00f1a, Madrid, 2000, C\u00e1tedra, pg. 391. * Martens, Didier, \"Diego de la Cruz, cuarenta a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s de su redescubrimiento: balance de las investigaciones y nuevas propuestas\", in: Goya, 283-284 (2001), pgs. 208-222. * Silva Maroto, Pilar, Donaci\u00f3n V\u00e1rez Fisa, Madrid, Museo Nacional del Prado, 2013, pg.38. ==External links== * Diego de la Cruz @ the Museo del Prado Category:Spanish painters Category:15th-century Spanish painters Category:Religious artists Category:People from Burgos ",
