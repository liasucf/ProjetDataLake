He succeeded his father, Nur-ili, but was ousted in a coup by his uncle, A\u0161\u0161ur-rabi I. ==Biography== There remains uncertainty concerning the dating of his accession, as the two subsequent Assyrian kings have unknown reign lengths, effectively disconnecting him and his predecessors from the firmer chronology of the later Assyrian King List. Although there are no extant contemporary inscriptions for him or his immediate predecessor or successors, his name appears on two of the Assyrian King Lists (Khorsabad and SDAS) and faintly at the end of the first column of the Synchronistic Kinglist,Synchronistic Kinglist, Ass 14616c (KAV 216), i 25'. level with where one of the successors' to Kassite Babylonian king Ka\u0161tilia\u0161u III might be supposed to appear.
