Her behavior dramatically changes as she begins to make reckless choices in the face of oncoming death. These include kicking her husband out of the house, spending money on an expensive car, and having an affair. She befriends Andrea, a mouthy student in her summer English class. Desperate to make sure her teenage son is on the right path before she dies, she unintentionally drives a rift between them. She ends her affair when it is exposed, and allows her husband to move back in after finally revealing to him that she is sick. She gives Marlene's house, which Marlene left to Cathy in her will, to her brother Sean. She decides to undergo a treatment with great risks because she wants to live. Although initial results are promising, the treatment proves unsuccessful. In season four, Cathy plans for the inevitability of her imminent death. * Oliver Platt as Paul Jamison, Cathy's husband.

While separated, he has a sexual encounter with another woman; this is ultimately forgiven in the face of Cathy's affair. After Cathy reveals her cancer to him, he moves back in and becomes overly attentive and doting.

Season One received an overall score of 66 on Metacritic. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times wrote: \"The Big C works because most of the writing is strong and believable, and so is Ms. Linney, who rarely sounds a false note and here has perfect pitch... the series is at its best when sardonic and subdued.\" Washington Post critic Hank Stuever said: \"Buoyed by scalpel-sharp writing and even keener performances, The Big C \u2026walks a fine line of having it both ways. It's for people who are repelled by the warm-fuzzy, disease-o'-the-week dramas of cable television,\" while EW.com's Ken Tucker quibbled with its major plot point: \"My big problem with The Big C concerns a crucial decision the show made for the early episodes: Cathy declines to tell those closest to her that she has cancer. While this is one of the many different reactions people have to such a diagnosis in real life, in a comedy-drama like this, it makes everyone around her seem a bit dim.\" The second season received similar reviews to the first, receiving a score of 64 on Metacritic. Maureen Ryan of AOL TV stated that \"Having a character and her family deal with a potentially fatal illness is such a rich arena for both drama and black comedy, but so far, The Big C hasn't been able to mine that topic with consistent freshness and depth.\" Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly was critical towards the show, but commended the acting, stating that \"Much of The Big C's unoriginal dramatization of cancer concerns is mitigated by the fresh, dynamic performances of Laura Linney and Oliver Platt.\" The third season received a score of 67 on Metacritic. The fourth and final seasonconsisting of four hour-long episodesreceived a score of 73 on Metacritic and a user-rating of 8.5. ==Awards and nominations == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! Year !!
