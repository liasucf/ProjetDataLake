In his late teens he adopted general fitness as his favourite way to stay in shape. Doing body weight exercises gave rise to a motivation to perform greater amounts of exercise in shorter periods of time. In order to keep track of push ups, his favourite exercise, Pruden videotaped challenges that lasted 1 minute, 10 minutes, and 30 minutes. This led to many world record attempts from 2000 to 2008. Pruden has appeared in the Guinness World Records book 4 times, and The Book of Alternative Records 8 times. As of 2009 Pruden holds 10 world records in various push up categories: one arm, one arm back of the hand, back of the hands, and fist/knuckles. The most he has ever done in regular push ups is 10,000 in 8 hours. In 2005 he attempted breaking the long-time British record held by Kevin Jefferson, whose 2003 UK record was 1582 back of hand push ups in one hour. Pruden completed more than 1800 on his first attempt, but due to errors in the claim, it was rejected. On July 8, 2005 he reapplied to Guinness World Records for the 1 hour record. The final official count in this new record was 1781 which was accepted by Guinness. On November 8, 2009 he did 1025 one arm back of the hand push ups in 1 hour at the Don Wheaton Family YMCA.
