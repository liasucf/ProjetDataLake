    "text": "Biblical infallibility is the belief that what the Bible says regarding matters of faith and Christian practice is wholly useful and true. It is the \"belief that the Bible is completely trustworthy as a guide to salvation and the life of faith and will not fail to accomplish its purpose.\" == Infallibility and inerrancy == Some theologians and denominations equate \"inerrancy\" and \"infallibility\"; others do not.McKim, DK, Westminster dictionary of theological terms, Westminster John Knox Press, 1996. For example, Davis suggests: \"The Bible is inerrant if and only if it makes no false or misleading statements on any topic whatsoever. The Bible is infallible if and only if it makes no false or misleading statements on any matter of faith and practice.\"Stephen T. Davis, The Debate about the Bible: Inerrancy versus Infallibility (Westminster Press, 1977), p. 23. In this sense it is seen as distinct from biblical inerrancy. There is a widespread confusion among Evangelical and Christian Fundamentalist circles that biblical infallibility means that the Bible cannot contain errors while inerrancy implies that the Bible contains no errors. However, the concept of infallibility has not relation to errors, but the impossibility of failure. Using non-theological dictionary definitions, Frame (2002) insists that infallibility is a stronger term than inerrancy. Inerrant' means there are no errors; 'infallible' means there can be no errors.\" Yet he agrees that \"modern theologians insist on redefining that word also, so that it actually says less than 'inerrancy.Frame, John M. \"Is the Bible Inerrant?\" IIIM Magazine Online,Volume 4, Number 19, May 13 to May 20, 2002 Some denominations that teach infallibility hold that the historical or scientific details, which may be irrelevant to matters of faith and Christian practice, may contain errors. This contrasts with the doctrine of biblical inerrancy, which holds that the scientific, geographic, and historic details of the scriptural texts in their original manuscripts are completely true and without error, though the scientific claims of scripture must be interpreted in the light of the phenomenological nature of the biblical narratives. The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy uses the term in this sense, saying, \"Infallibility and inerrancy may be distinguished but not separated.\"Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, Article XI ==Biblical integrity== The idea of biblical integrity strengthens the concept of infallibility by suggesting that the current Judeo-Christian biblical text is complete and without failing its purpose (infallibility). The proposal suggests that the \"integrity\" of biblical text--to include its present-day message, purpose, and content--has never been corrupted or degraded. ==Background== The idea of biblical infallibility gained ground in Protestant churches as a fundamentalist reaction against a general modernization movement within Christianity in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the Catholic church, the reaction produced the concept of papal infallibility whereas, in the evangelical churches, the infallibility of the Bible was asserted.Ruthven, M., Fundamentalism: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press, 2007, p.47. \"Both movements represent a synthesis of a theological position and an ideological-political stance against the erosion of traditional authorities. Both are antimoderne and literalist.\"Kaplan, L., Fundamentalism in Comparative Perspective, Univ of Massachusetts Press, 1992, p. 84. > No matter how little common ground was apparent at the time between Roman > Catholicism and the Evangelical Right, these two reformulations of > scriptural and papal supremacy represented a defiant assertiveness in > reaction against the crisis of religious authority that was engulfing > Western religion.Warner, R., Secularization and Its Discontents, A&C; Black, > 2010, p.19. ==Catholicism== The Catholic Church speaks not about infallibility of scripture but about its freedom from error, holding \"the doctrine of the inerrancy of Scripture\".Cardinal Augustin Bea, \"Vatican II and the Truth of Sacred Scripture\" The Second Vatican Council, citing earlier declarations, stated: \"Since everything asserted by the inspired authors or sacred writers must be held to be asserted by the Holy Spirit, it follows that the books of Scripture must be acknowledged as teaching solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings for the sake of salvation.\"Second Vatican Council, Dei Verbum (Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation), 11 It added: \"Since God speaks in Sacred Scripture through men in human fashion, the interpreter of Sacred Scripture, in order to see clearly what God wanted to communicate to us, should carefully investigate what meaning the sacred writers really intended, and what God wanted to manifest by means of their words.\"Dei Verbum, 12 ==Methodism== The Methodist theologian Thomas A. Lambrecht notes that John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, As such, Lambrecht notes that \"orthodox, evangelical, and traditionalist United Methodists believe in the 'infallibility' of Scripture.\" \"Article V\u2014Of the Sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for Salvation\" in the Articles of Religion states that: Lambrecht, therefore, writes that: ==See also== * Biblical literalism * Christian fundamentalism * Mammotrectus super Bibliam ==References== Category:Christian theology of the Bible Category:Christian terminology Category:Methodism ",
