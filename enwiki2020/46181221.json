    "text": "The Bad Batch is a 2016 American dystopian thriller film directed and written by Ana Lily Amirpour. The film is about a young woman (Suki Waterhouse) exiled to a desert where she is attacked by a group of cannibals (led by Jason Momoa), barely escaping alive to a bizarre settlement run by a charismatic leader (Keanu Reeves). Other actors include Jim Carrey, Giovanni Ribisi, and Diego Luna. It was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival, where it won the Special Jury Prize. It was released in theaters on June 23, 2017, by Neon. == Plot == A young woman named Arlen is exiled to a desert outside Texas, where people deemed undesirable by society (the \"bad batch\") are forced to fend for themselves. A sign declares the area outside of the US and that American laws and citizenship no longer apply. Arlen is soon kidnapped by two women in a golf cart. When she wakes chained up, a woman cuts off her right arm and leg. Arlen tricks the woman into unchaining her, kills her, observes cannibalism of human limbs, and escapes crawling on a skateboard. She is rescued in the desert by a mute hermit, who takes her to a makeshift settlement named Comfort that has all- night raves. Five months later, Arlen has a prosthetic leg and a home in Comfort. She walks out to the desert with a pistol. Investigating a golf cart similar to the one used by the cannibals, she finds a woman and little girl scavenging in a garbage dump. Accusing the woman of being part of the cannibal community, Arlen shoots her in the head. She takes the girl back to Comfort, observed by the hermit. Miami Man, a leader of the cannibals and the father of the girl, goes looking for her, finding the dead woman, and then the hermit. The hermit, in exchange for a hand-sketched portrait, advises Miami Man to \"find Comfort\". In Comfort, Arlen takes a hallucinogen at a rave held by The Dream, the cult-like leader of Comfort, and loses track of the child, who is taken in by The Dream. Hallucinating, Arlen wanders out into the desert, where Miami Man finds her. Upon threat of death, he demands that she find his daughter in Comfort. Arlen and Miami Man grow closer on their journey to Comfort. He kills another cannibal who is looking to trade gasoline for her flesh and reveals that he was put into the lawless territory because he was an illegal immigrant from Cuba. However, another man shoots Miami Man in the chest, and Arlen somewhat reluctantly returns to Comfort. She searches for the girl, eventually discovering she is living in The Dream's mansion, along with his large harem of pregnant young women. Arlen visits The Dream, who explains that Comfort's economy is run on the drugs his concubines make, and that Comfort is free of feces because of the plumbing he provides. Arlen agrees to join his harem but uses a pistol she has hidden inside her prosthetic to hold one of the pregnant concubines hostage. After extracting the girl, they head out of Comfort in a golf cart and reunite with Miami Man, who had been found and healed by the hermit. The child and Miami Man blissfully reunite, and Arlen implies she would rather stay with him in the desert than live in Comfort. Miami Man tries to discourage her, deeming her unable to survive out in the harsh desert, but does not send her away. The daughter asks for spaghetti, as she had grown accustomed to good things in the mansion. Instead, Miami Man takes his daughter's pet rabbit, and later the three of them lounge by a fire eating it. Miami Man rubs his teary daughter's back, and then he and Arlen look into each other's eyes, smiling. == Cast == * Suki Waterhouse as Arlen * Jason Momoa as Miami Man * Keanu Reeves as The Dream, the leader of the Comfort settlement * Jim Carrey as the Hermit * Yolonda Ross as Maria * Giovanni Ribisi as Bobby * Jayda Fink as Honey * Diego Luna as Jimmy * Cory Roberts as the Bridgeman * E.R.

Guy Lodge of Variety wrote that \"though there's much to savor in the pic's lavishly distressed visuals and soundscape, its narrative feels increasingly stretched and desultory.\" Lee Marshall of Screen International wrote that \"the story runs out of steam \u2013 with a full ninety minutes still to go.\" David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that \"the movie is overlong and not without draggy patches, but it's sustained enough to keep you watching.\" == References == == External links == * Category:2016 films Category:2016 horror films Category:American films Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in California Category:Films set in Texas Category:Dystopian films Category:Romantic horror films Category:Romantic Western (genre) films Category:American romance films Category:American horror thriller films Category:2010s romantic thriller films Category:Annapurna Pictures films Category:Vice Films films Category:Neon (distributor) films Category:Films produced by Megan Ellison Category:Films directed by Ana Lily Amirpour Category:Films about cannibalism ",
