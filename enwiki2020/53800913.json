    "text": "The C\u00f4te de Saint-Nicolas is a climb in the municipality of Saint-Nicolas in Belgium. It is often included in the Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge cycling classic, where it comes as one of the last difficulties, at approximately 6 km from the finish in the neighbouring municipality of Ans. With a length of 1.4 km at an average gradient of 7.6%, it is often a decisive site of the race. The climb is nicknamed The Italian Hill, because of the composition of its immigrant population and their descendants \u2013 often from Sicily and the South of Italy. Their presence is particularly expressed by the many Italian flags hanging outside the windows, especially during race day of Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge. ==References== Category:Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge Category:Climbs in cycle racing in Belgium Category:Mountains and hills of the Ardennes (Belgium) Category:Mountains and hills of Li\u00e8ge (province) Category:Li\u00e8ge ",
