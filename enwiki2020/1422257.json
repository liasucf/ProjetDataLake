His work has influenced a generation of calligraffiti artists. == Early life == Hassan Massoudy was born in 1944 in Najaf. He grew up in a traditional society. He moved to Baghdad in 1961, where he was apprenticed to various calligraphers and exhibited a talent for classic Arabic calligraphy. == Career == \"Ecstasy\" (Al-Wajd) by Hassan Massoudy, 2001 In 1969 he fled Iraq for France, and after arriving in Paris in 1969, he entered the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts where he studied figurative painting. However, he continued to work on calligraphy and paid for his studies, by doing headlines in calligraphy for Arabic magazines. In 1972, he created, with the actor Guy Jacquet and later the musician Fawzi Al Aiedy, Arabesque, a public performance combining music, poetry and live calligraphies projected on a screen . In 1995, he was involved in the design of the stage set for the ballet \"Selim\" with the dancer Kader Belarbi from the Opera de Paris and the singer Houria Aichi on a choreography from Kalemenis. In 2005 he met the dancer and choreographer Carolyn Carlson, and the musician Kudsi Erguner. Together with three other dancers and three other musicians, they created the show \"Metaphore\", a harmony of music, dance and calligraphy. Massoudy has continued to live in France.Eigner, S., Art of the Middle East: Modern and Contemporary Art of the Arab World and Iran, Pennsylvania State University, 2011, p.32 ==Influence== Massoudy has become an important influence on a generation of calligraffiti artists. The Tunisian street artist, el Seed, who uses calligraphy in his art, points to the work of Iraqi painter, Hassan Massoudy as a major source of inspiration, noting that \"The work of Hassan Massoudy was totally out of anything I\u2019ve seen from the way he shapes the letters to the colors he uses. He completely revolutionized the art of calligraphy.\" Salda\u00f1a, S., \"Reviving Arabic Calligraphy: An Encounter with Iraqi-French artist Hassan Massoudy,\" Mosaic Stories, 10 March 2017, Online: ==Work == Massoudy often uses quotations from classic and modern writers as the inspiration for his work. One such work is Woman is a Ray of Divine Light painted in 1987, which is based on the words of a 13th-century Sufi poet, Rumi.Welland, M., The Desert: Lands of Lost Borders, Reaktion Books, 2014, [E-book edition], n.p. For Massoudy, reproducing a poem in calligraphy means more than simply presenting it in a particular style, rather it enables him to grasp the inner meaning of the words.HALI: The International Journal of Oriental Carpets and Textiles, 2009, pp 135-137 Massoudy explains:Cantin, L., \"Practices of the Letter: Writing a Space for the Real,\" Umbra Journal, 2010, p. 27 : [The calligrapher must] assimilate all aspects of culture that relate to [his art]. Practice awakens the knowledge gradually stored up in the body and releases the expression of a myriad of nuances. [Calligraphic] codes serve to control the internal excitement and prevent his feelings from overflowing... but the calligrapher must pass beyond these set rules. To achieve his aim, he must first conform to these restrictions, and then go beyond them. This is because a true calligraphic composition must contain something indefinable, something elusive and powerful that takes it beyond the rules.
