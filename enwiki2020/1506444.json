However, the show's early episodes attracted low ratings, as it was competing in a time slot occupied on other channels almost entirely by the second half of hour-long drama series, and by January 2005 its weeknight airing had been shifted to 11 p.m. A total of 90 episodes of the show were produced before the show was cancelled in 2006. The show continued to air for some further time in repeats on Omni Television, and was later rebroadcast nationally on Super Channel and FX. ==Cast== * Walter Alza - Andreas * Sean Bell - T.K.

Henrietta Walmark of The Globe and Mail wrote that \"A little bit Queer as Folk, a little bit Sex and the City, Metropia' delivers a whole lot of gorgeous characters making for a whole lot of hotness and plenty of juicy plot threads. The language can be raw and the hookups are frequent, but there's also sweetness and a natural ambiance among the large ensemble cast. Watching this sudsy reflection of our very own boho culture is a delight even if it does qualify as a guilty pleasure.\"Henrietta Walmark, \"The critical list\". The Globe and Mail, October 16, 2004. Jim Bawden of the Toronto Star modestly praised the show as \"a showcase for a dozen up-and-coming young Toronto actors\".Jim Bawden, \"Season spanned Saints to sinners\".
