    "text": "\"Radio Nowhere\" is the first single released from Bruce Springsteen's 2007 studio album Magic. It was awarded Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance and Best Rock Song at the Grammy Awards of 2008. ==History== The song is an up-tempo, electric guitar-driven, modern rocker that features the work of E Street Band members Max Weinberg on drums, Garry Tallent on bass guitar, Clarence Clemons on saxophone, Steven Van Zandt, Clemons and Patti Scialfa on background vocals, and Nils Lofgren on a guitar part underneath Clemons's sax solo. Springsteen's 1990s twang reasserts itself in the first verses of the down- mixed vocal line. \"Radio Nowhere\"'s lyrical themes address alienation and a desire for musical and social connection, a theme similar to some of his previous work: :I was tryin' to find my way home, :But all I heard was a drone\u2014 :Bouncing off a satellite, :Crushin' the last lone American night. :This is Radio Nowhere . . . is there anybody alive out there? Springsteen's lyrics appear to intentionally and repeatedly allude to his previous songs, an important artistic tradition in poetry and songwriting, continuing and reconnecting the artist's chosen themes they wish to emphasize. The lyric \"I was driving through the misty rain\" is likely a reference to his song \"Downbound Train\" on his album Born in the U.S.A. with the lyric \"I feel her kiss in the misty rain.\" And the lyric \"Dancing down a dark hole\" likely refers to his song \"Dancing in the Dark\" from the same album. In addition, the line \"is there anybody alive out there?\", while not a previous Springsteen lyric, has been a staple exhortation of his live show. He has been yelling it out for years \u2014 notably during the 1999-2000 E Street Reunion Tour \u2014 as the show enters its final stretch and he wants to rally the crowd one more time. It is also arguably the central question running through his entire body of work, reflecting the primal importance that he gives to the connective power of rock'n'roll. The single was released ahead of the album, initially leaking to the Internet on August 22, 2007, to satellite radio the following day and to regular terrestrial radio the day after that. Scott and Todd played the song twice on the morning of August 24 on New York City's 95.5 WPLJ-FM. After the first airing, a disgruntled Sony representative called in ordering them not to play the song again. It is unclear as to whether this was a radio bit, designed to drum up publicity for record, or if the Sony rep was truly upset. Either way, Scott and Todd told the caller that they would not play the song again as long as he was on the phone with them. They proceeded to hang up on him and then play Radio Nowhere for a second time. Later in the day, classic rocker Q104.3 in New York City reportedly played the song several times in a row. The song was also played twice in the afternoon of August 24 by \"Fast\" Freddie of 93.3 WNCD the Wolf, in Youngstown, Ohio. After being contacted by a Columbia Records representative, they stopped playing it. The official release for radio was set for Tuesday, August 28, 2007. \"Radio Nowhere\" received some of its biggest promotion and early airplay from a huge Springsteen fan, Chris \"Mad Dog\" Russo, sports talk host on WFAN in New York, who could not stop raving about it. In fact, callers frequently open their conversations with Russo by chanting Springsteen's \"Is there anyone alive out there?\" line from the song. It was also admired by other artists within rockdom: At the MTV Europe Music Awards 2007 in Munich, Germany, when asked by Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl which song he wished he had written, R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe cited \"Radio Nowhere\". \"Radio Nowhere\" was made available as a free, limited-timespan download \"exclusively\" from the iTunes Music Store starting on August 28, 2007Bruce Springsteen News, accessed August 29, 2007 (although it was also available from Guardian UnlimitedGuardian Unlimited, August 28, 2007CNet News Blog, August 28, 2007). The site also offered a pre-order of the new album. Sony BMG themselves created the site www.radionowheredownload.com (no longer active), which also offered the single free for Springsteen's fan base in Europe (for whom iTunes is not always an option), making it available for free well in advance of the commercial release of the album. Despite all this initial drama, the song was not a chart success in the U.S. (with the exception of reaching number 2 on the Triple-A chart). It failed to reach the Billboard Hot 100. The song charted significantly higher in European countries, with it being most successful in Norway and Ireland (peaking at number 2 on both charts). Nevertheless, the song earned a degree of mind share in the mass media. For example, it was used during the broadcast of the final game of the 2007 World Series as the background music for the production credits and underneath a montage of all the major plays of the series. In addition, \"Radio Nowhere\" is being used very frequently in American sports arenas during halts in play. In a similar vein, on SiriusXM Mad Dog Sports Radio's Mad Dog Unleashed with Christopher Russo; who's a huge Springsteen fan; features \"Radio Nowhere\" as the show's opening theme. \"Radio Nowhere\" was included in Springsteen's subsequent compilation album, the 2009 Wal-Mart-only Greatest Hits. ==Music video== The music video for \"Radio Nowhere\", directed by Thom Zimny, was released to Amazon.com on September 4, 2007. It consists mostly of Springsteen and the E Street Band playing the song in a darkened studio, interspersed with filmed Manhattan street scenes and a few shots of a recent promotional photograph of Springsteen being torn. Of the E Streeters, Scialfa, Van Zandt, Weinberg, and Lofgren get the most face time in the video; quasi-member Soozie Tyrell is absent altogether. ==Live performance history== Magic Tour at the Hartford Civic Center. October 2, 2007. The green lighting scheme became associated with the song. \"Radio Nowhere\" was the set opener for Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band's 2007\u20132008 Magic Tour during the first leg. It subsequently shifted to being the second song played, with various other choices ahead of it, but overall it was performed in every show of that tour but one. When the 2009 Springsteen and band Working on a Dream Tour commenced, \"Radio Nowhere\" became the only Magic song to make it into show set lists. Its position in the show was often moved around to match the changing show segment where 18-year-old Jay Weinberg subbed for his father on drums; the younger drummer gave the song a slightly more frenetic feel. ==Tommy Tutone controversy== \"Radio Nowhere\" features a set of guitar riffs and chord progression at the beginning that many fans considered particularly similar to \"867-5309/Jenny\", written by Alex Call and Jim Keller, lead guitarist for Tommy Tutone, although the lyrics and the tone of the two songs are quite different. Tommy Tutone lead singer Tommy Heath was quoted as saying: \"Everybody\u2019s calling me about it,\"Mark Caro, \"Tommy 'Tutone' Heath speaks!\", The Chicago Tribune, August 31, 2007. Accessed September 1, 2007. and that, \"I think it's close enough that if I wanted to [take legal action], I could work with it.\" Heath clarified later on that he had no actual intention whatsoever of taking action and that he felt \"really honored at a similarity, if any\". Both songs were released on Columbia Records. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (2007) !Peak position |- |Canadian Hot 100 (Billboard) |align=\"center\"|55 |- |Germany (Media Control Charts) |align=\"center\"|90 |- |- |Italy (Top Digital Download) |align=\"center\"|25 |- |Norway (VG-lista) |align=\"center\"|2 |- |Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) |align=\"center\"|60 |- |Switzerland (Singles Chart) |align=\"center\"|87 |- |UK Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|96 |- |US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles (Billboard) |align=\"center\"|2 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2007 singles Category:Bruce Springsteen songs Category:Songs written by Bruce Springsteen Category:Song recordings produced by Brendan O'Brien (record producer) Category:Columbia Records singles Category:Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance Category:Grammy Award for Best Rock Song Category:2007 songs Category:Songs about radio ",
