Henriot made her debut at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise as a leading actress as Myrtha in La Douceur de croire by Jacques Normand on 8 July 1899. Le Monde artiste remarked Henriot was a \"little dreamlike and charming infant whose sweet voice made one think of the chirping of birds, a delicious creature, very cute in its juvenile grace\" (March 11, 1900, p. 156). She was loved by both the public and critics. ===Stage career=== Plays that Henriot acted in at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise from 8 July 1899: * Myrtha in La Douceur de croire by Jacques Normand * Sylvette in Les Romanesques by Edmond Rostand * Hippolyta (Hippolyte) in L'\u00c9tourdi ou les Contretemps by Moli\u00e8re * Bertrade in Gris\u00e9lidis by Armand Silvestre and Eug\u00e8ne Morand. * Lucile in Le D\u00e9pit amoureux by Moli\u00e8re * Isabelle in Le L\u00e9gataire universel by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Regnard * Lucinde in Le M\u00e9decin malgr\u00e9 lui by Moli\u00e8re * C\u00e9phise in Andromaque by Jean Racine * Juliette in Diane de lys by Alexandre Dumas fils * Za\u00efre in Bajazet by Jean Racine, which she played from 1 March 1900 until her death. ==Death, funeral and memorial service== The Comedie-Francaise, also known as the Th\u00e9atre-Fran\u00e7ais, where Henriot died Just before noon on 8 March 1900, after a matinee where she was playing the role of the confidant Za\u00efde in Jean Racine's play Bajazet at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, an explosion and fire broke out. Henriot was on the fourth floor of the theater. Her dresser had a better knowledge of place and could find her own way out and through a window. Mary Marquet told her to get out of the fire, however Henriot was trying to find her little dog, which was a gift from Le Bargy, whom she had recently broken-up with. Henriot was still wandered around the building when she died of asphyxiation. Her body was later found, but it was unrecognisable, her face blackened, burnt hair and body convulsed. Her mother identified the body in the morgue. Two days later, a large crowd gathered at her funeral, and the convoy passed through Paris to the church of Saint- Honor\u00e9-d'Eylau, the Montmartre cemetery. Shortly after her death, the Com\u00e9die- Fran\u00e7aise wanted a portrait of Henriot. On the advice of her mother, they gave the portrait painter Carolus-Duran the task of making a portrait of Henriot, having previous painted another actress Jeanne Samary in 1885. Carolus-Duran had known Henriot and was inspired by the photographs taken by Reutlinger, which were published on postcards. A year after her death on 8 March 1901, a memorial service was held in Saint-Roch, Paris, where her friends went to her tomb which was sculpted by Denys Puech above a white marble monument by the architect Marcel Dourgnon with the following words having been engraved on the base of the tomb: \"\u00c0 Jane Henriot, la Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise\" (English: To Jane Henriot, the French-Comedy), with an inscription taken from an article by \u00c9mile Faguet: ...Elle est venue, Elle a souri, Elle a pass\u00e9!
