She (and her then-writing partner Thomas A. Swyden) wrote two of the twelve episodes for the season. Gable has worked on a number of other shows as a writer and producer, including The Invisible Man, Family Law, The Division, Strong Medicine, Crossing Jordan, New Amsterdam and Vegas. In 2008 she was hired to work on The Mentalist as a co-executive producer under creator Bruno Heller and became an executive producer. She left that show after four seasons and subsequently served as co-executive producer on the CBS drama series Person of Interest. In 2019, Gable joined other WGA members in firing her agents as part of the Guild's stand against the ATA after the two sides were unable to come to an agreement on a new \"Code of Conduct\" that addressed the unfair practice of packaging. ==Filmography== ===Buffy the Vampire Slayer episodes=== * 1.08 \"I, Robot...
