It is believed that Bhishma, also known as 'Ganga Putra Bhishma' (Bhishma son of Ganga devi) or 'Bhishma Pitamaha' (Bhishma the grandfather), departed from his body on this chosen day. This occurred during the propitious 'Uttarayan period'; that is, the daytime of devas. Bhishma Ashtami is observed during the month of Magha in the Hindu calendar. It corresponds to the months of January\u2013February. ==History== Bhishma Ashtami is a minor holiday observed in Bengal and parts of southern India in remembrance of Bhishma, a warrior who fought and died in the Kurukshetra War, the battle which fills so many pages of the Mahabharata. Bhishma was the son of Shantanu, who had given his son a boon in that he would be allowed to choose his own day of death. Bhishma had taken an oath not to marry and that he would ever remain faithful to his father's throne. The anniversary of Bhishma Pitamah's death is observed during Magha Shukla Ashtami. The day is known as Bhishma Ashtami and indisputably the death anniversary of Bhishma Pitamah. According to the legend associated with the day, Bhishma waited for 58 days before leaving his body. Bhishma Pitamah left his body on the auspicious day of Uttarayana, i.e. on the day when the Lord Surya started moving towards Northward after completing six-month period of Dakshiyana. This is the day Bhishma decided to leave his body. The day Bhishma left his body known as Bhishma Ashtami (Magha Shukla Ashtami). He has special boon of death as per his will (Ichha Mrityu) from his father. Hence, despite lying on a bed of arrows he continued in that position and then left his body on Sankranti. Hindus believe that the one who dies during Uttarayana goes to heaven. ==Bhishma Ashtami Festival Dates Between 2017 & 2024== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Date (IST) !Date (EDT) |- |2017 |Saturday, 4 February |Saturday, 4 February |- |2018 |Thursday, 25 January |Thursday, 25 January |- |2019 |Wednesday, 13 February |Tuesday, 12 February |- |2020 |Sunday, 2 February |Saturday, 1 February |- |2021 |Saturday, 20 February |Friday, 19 February |- |2022 |Tuesday, 8 February |Wednesday, 7 February |- |2023 |Saturday, 28 January |Friday, 27 January |- |2024 |Friday, 16 February |Thursday, 15 February |} ==Steps to Follow the Performance of 'Bhishma Ashtami Pujan'== * People observe the ritual of \u2018Ekodishta Shraddha\u2019 in the honor of Bhishma.
