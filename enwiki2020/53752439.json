He played electric guitar on the recordings of many Philadelphia jazz musicians, especially electronic organ players. Schwartz is known as Thornel on recording titles and in standard jazz reference works, but Gary W. Kennedy of The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz notes that Schwartz spelled his own and his father's name \"Thornal\" on his social security application.Gary W. Kennedy, \"Thornal Schwartz\". The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz. 2nd edition, ed. Barry Kernfeld. Schwartz attended the Landis Institute for piano, but became known as a jazz guitarist starting in the 1950s.
