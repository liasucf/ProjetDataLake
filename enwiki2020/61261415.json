However, by lack of funds, it didn't make it. For 20 years, there were popular mobilizations in favor of the construction of the station in the region, until it was done and delivered on 16 July 2008. The station was built and is operated by CPTM and attends to Jardim Romano, in the border between Itaim Paulista and Jardim Helena, in the East Side of S\u00e3o Paulo. The implantation of the station encouraged the construction of a shopping mall nearby it, in the place of the deactivate Texima S/A Machine Industry, which construction is ongoing. ==References== Category:CPTM stations Category:Railway stations opened in 2008 ",
