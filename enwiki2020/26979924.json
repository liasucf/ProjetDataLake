From 1917 until 1923, he held various positions in churches in Oslo. In 1918, he received an honorary Doctorate of Theology from the University of Uppsala. He was bishop at the Diocese of Nidaros from 1923 until 1928. His appointment as a bishop was very controversial at the time due to his liberal theology. He retired after only five years as bishop due to health problems, and he died three years later in Oslo on 27 October 1931. ==Selected works== *' (1909) *' (1912) *' (1913) *' (1917) ==References== Category:1860 births Category:1931 deaths Category:People from Voss Category:University of Oslo alumni Category:Bishops of Nidaros Category:20th-century Lutheran bishops Category:Norwegian non-fiction writers ",
