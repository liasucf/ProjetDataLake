The company's founders are Michael Shehan (CEO) and Steve Swoboda (COO and CFO). In March 2007, SpotX formed a separate company from Booyah that focused on digital video advertising technology. In 2009, SpotX launched targeting tools to help advertisers reach their audiences. In 2010, SpotX launched its real-time bidding solution, which helps companies tailor their bids on an impression-by-impression basis when bidding on in- stream and in-banner video ad inventory. In July 2016, RTL Group announced its 65% majority stake purchase of SpotX at $144 million and completed its 100% acquisition of the company in October 2017. The acquisition can be attributed to a recent initiative by RTL Group, the RTL Digital Hub, which is aimed at leveraging the combined value of the company's complementary portfolio of digital video businesses (referring to companies whose products or services are focused on digital video). Such companies include, SpotX, BroadbandTV, StyleHaul, and clypd. The RTL Digital Hub was implemented to bolster RTL Group's position in the high growth markets of multi-channel networks (MCNs) and digital advertising sales. In 2015, SpotXchange rebranded as SpotX. In 2017, SpotX relaunched its website on a new domain. ==References== Category:Online advertising services and affiliate networks ",
