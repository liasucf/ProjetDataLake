    "text": "Labbacallee Labbacallee wedge tomb ( \"Hag's Bed\") is a large pre-historic burial monument, located north-west of Fermoy and south-east of Glanworth, County Cork, Ireland. It is the largest Irish wedge tomb and dates from roughly 2300 BC. ==Features== The site has three large capstones which slope downwards towards the back, the largest being long and weighing . The gallery below is made up of a large rectangular chamber, with a small one behind it, divided by a slab. The gallery is triple-walled, buttressed at the back by three slabs set parallel to the axis of the tomb. To the front of the gallery are the remains of a large rectangular unroofed antechamber which is wider than the gallery and separated from it by a large slab. Outside this there was a further row of stones running off at an angle, but few of the original stones remain. ==Excavations== In 1934 excavations revealed a number of inhumations, fragments of a late Stone Age decorated pot, and fragments of bone and stone. Local folklore associates the site with the Celtic Hag-Goddess Cailleach Bheur, and during the excavations the site was found to contain the remains of a woman. Although the body had been positioned within one chamber of the tomb, her skull was found in another chamber. ==References== ==Sources== * *Noonan, Damien (2001). \"Castles & Ancient Monuments of Ireland\", Arum Press. ==External links== *Megalithic Ireland - Photographs of Labbacallee wedge tomb *Megalithomania - Site plan and photographs of Labbacallee Wedge Tomb * Ancient Ireland - Photographs of Labbacallee - Leaba Callighe - Hag's Bed Category:Megalithic monuments in Ireland Category:Archaeological sites in County Cork Category:Burial monuments and structures Category:National Monuments in County Cork ",
