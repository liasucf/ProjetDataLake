    "text": "Double copy theory is a theory in theoretical physics which suggests that there is a perturbative duality between gauge theory and gravity. The theory says that scattering amplitudes in non-Abelian gauge theories can be expressed so that replacement of color information by additional kinematic dependence, in a well-defined way, automatically leads to gravity amplitudes.http://www.ph.ed.ac.uk/events/2014/73779-yang-mills-einstein- theory-as-a-double-copyBern, Zvi, Dixon, Lance J., and Kosower, David A. (2012). \"Loops, Trees and the Search for New Physics\". Scientific American 306(5), 34\u201341. The theory (also known as the BCJ duality after its creators) was first written down by Zvi Bern, John Joseph Carrasco and Henrik Johansson in 2010. It can be used to make calculations of gravity amplitudes simpler by instead calculating the Yang\u2013Mills amplitude and squaring it. This was proven to work at tree level but has also been shown to work at higher orders. ==See also== * Duality * Yang\u2013Mills theory ==References== Category:General relativity Category:Theoretical physics ",
