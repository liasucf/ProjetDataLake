He studied first under Louis Fanart (the choirmaster at Reims Cathedral) and later at the Paris Conservatoire under Ambroise Thomas. He won the Prix de Rome in 1861. In 1868, he became choirmaster at the Church of the Madeleine, and in 1871 took over from C\u00e9sar Franck as choirmaster at the Basilica of Sainte-Clotilde. In 1877, Dubois returned to the Church of the Madeleine, succeeding Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns as organist there. From 1871 he taught at the Paris Conservatoire, where his pupils included Pierre de Br\u00e9ville, Guillaume Couture, Gabrielle Ferrari, Gustave Doret, Paul Dukas, Achille Fortier, Xavier Leroux, Alb\u00e9ric Magnard, \u00c9douard Risler, Guy Ropartz, Spyridon Samaras, and Florent Schmitt. Dubois in 1905 Dubois was director of the Conservatoire from 1896 (succeeding Thomas on the latter's death) to 1905, continuing his predecessor's intransigently conservative regime.Nichols, p. 35; and Orenstein, p. 26 The music of Auber, Hal\u00e9vy and especially Meyerbeer was regarded as the correct model for students, and old French music such as that of Rameau and modern music, including that of Wagner were kept rigorously out of the curriculum.Nectoux, p. 269 Dubois was unremittingly hostile to Maurice Ravel who, when a Conservatoire student, did not conform to the faculty's anti-modernism, and in 1902 Dubois unavailingly forbade Conservatoire students to attend performances of Debussy's ground-breaking new opera, Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande.Orledge, p. 65 In June 1905 he was forced to bring his planned retirement forward after a public scandal caused by the faculty's blatant attempt to stop Ravel winning the Prix de Rome.Nectoux, p. 267 Gabriel Faur\u00e9 was appointed to succeed Dubois as director, with a brief from the French government to modernise the institution.Nectoux, p. 268 Although he wrote many religious works, Dubois had considerable hopes for a successful career in opera. His fascination with Near-Eastern subjects led to the composition to his first staged work, La guzla de l'\u00e9mir, and his first four- act opera, Aben-Hamet, which broke no new ground. His other large-scale opera, Xavi\u00e8re, is a wildly dramatic tale set in the rural Auvergne. The story revolves around a widowed mother who plots to kill her daughter, Xavi\u00e8re, with the help of her fianc\u00e9's father to gain the daughter's inheritance. However, Xavi\u00e8re survives the attack with the help of a priest, and the opera finishes with a conventional happy ending. The music of Dubois also includes ballets, oratorios and three symphonies. His best known work is the oratorio Les sept paroles du Christ (\"The Seven Last Words of Christ\" [1867]), which continues to be given an occasional airing; his Toccata in G (1889), for the organ, is a recital staple, by no means solely in France. The rest of his large output has almost entirely disappeared from view. He has had a more lasting influence in teaching, with his theoretical works Trait\u00e9 de contrepoint et de fugue (on counterpoint and fugue) and Trait\u00e9 d'harmonie th\u00e9orique et pratique (on harmony) still being sometimes used today. ==Selected works== ===Operas=== * La prova di un'opera seria, (unpublished, composed in Rome, 1863). * La guzla de l'\u00e9mir, op\u00e9ra comique (1 act, J.
