It earned him a move to Spanish outfit Real Sociedad only to return to Austria and join Sturm Graz a year later. He also had one season at Sturm, then rejoined Rapid for another two and sealed a second move abroad when he signed for German Bundesliga side TSV 1860 Munich. He returned to Austria in 2004 but only played one match for Admira Wacker M\u00f6dling and then went on to play at lower league sides. ==International career== P\u00fcrk made his debut for the Austria national team in April 1995. He replaced Herfried Sabitzer in the 69th minute of the UEFA Euro 1996 qualifier against Liechtenstein before scoring in the 84th minute of the 7\u22120 victory at Stadion Lehen in Salzburg. He earned a second cap in August 2002 when he featured in the friendly against Switzerland at St. Jakob-Park in Basel. ==International statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !colspan=\"3\"|Austria national team |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |1995||1||1 |- |1996||0||0 |- |1997||0||0 |- |1998||0||0 |- |1999||0||0 |- |2000||0||0 |- |2001||0||0 |- |2002||1||0 |- !Total||2||1 |} ==Honours== Rapid Wien * Austrian Cup: 1994\u201395 Sturm Graz * Austrian Cup: 1996\u201397 ==References== ==External links== * Marcus P\u00fcrk at Austria Archive * Marcus P\u00fcrk at Rapid Archive * * Marcus P\u00fcrk at Fussballportal Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Austrian footballers Category:Austria international footballers Category:FK Austria Wien players Category:SK Rapid Wien players Category:Real Sociedad footballers Category:SK Sturm Graz players Category:TSV 1860 Munich players Category:FC Admira Wacker M\u00f6dling players Category:First Vienna FC players Category:SV Stockerau players Category:Austrian Football Bundesliga players Category:La Liga players Category:Bundesliga players Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Expatriate footballers in Germany Category:Austrian expatriate sportspeople in Spain Category:Austrian expatriate sportspeople in Germany Category:Association football midfielders ",
