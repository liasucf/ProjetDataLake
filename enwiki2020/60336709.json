He graduated from Dorsey High School in Baldwin Hills, Los Angeles, studied piano, and began writing songs and working in his father's recording studio. After serving in the US military in Europe, he returned to help set up Class Records with his father and his business partner Preston Love. Googie Ren\u00e9 oversaw the label, which had its greatest success later in the 1950s with Bobby Day's hit \"Rockin' Robin\". Ren\u00e9 began recording himself in 1956, with the instrumental \"Wham Bam\", credited to the Googie Ren\u00e9 Combo. Later records by the Combo featured - as well as Ren\u00e9 on piano and organ - many of the leading session musicians in Los Angeles, including guitarists Johnny Watson, Ren\u00e9 Hall, Howard Roberts, and Jimmy Nolen; bassist Red Callender; saxophonists Plas Johnson and Clifford Scott; and drummer Earl Palmer. Their recordings covered jump blues, rock and roll, and jazz.Dik de Heer, \"Googie Ren\u00e9\", Black Cat Rockabilly.
