    "text": "Martin Schleyer (; 18 July 1831 \u2013 16 August 1912) was a German Catholic priest who invented the constructed language Volap\u00fck. His official name was \"Martin Schleyer\"; he added the name \"Johann\" (in honor of his godfather) unofficially. ==Life and work== Schleyer was born in Oberlauda (Baden). According to his own report, the idea of an international language arose out of a conversation he had with one of his parishioners, a semi-literate German peasant whose son had emigrated to America and could no longer be reached by mail because the United States Postal Service could not read the father's handwriting. He was ordained in 1856. From 1867 to 1875 he was pastor at Krumbach near Me\u00dfkirch. At the end of this time he was jailed for four months for preaching against socialism during the Kulturkampf. From 1875 to 1885 he was pastor of Ss. Peter and Paul parish in Litzelstetten. He later wrote that the first seven years in Litzelstetten were among the happiest of his life. At this time he was editor of the magazine Sionsharfe, devoted mainly to Catholic poetry. In May 1879 he published an article on Volap\u00fck in this magazine. This sketch was followed by a full-length book in 1880. The language spread widely and new clubs sprung all over Europe. After 1885 Schleyer had to retire from his pastoral duties due to ill health, though he was still involved in the Volap\u00fck movement until it fell apart a few years later. In 1894 Pope Leo XIII made him a papal prelate. Schleyer died in Konstanz in 1912. A campaign to beatify him was started in June 2001, based in his home parish of Litzelstetten. The high school Martin-Schleyer-Gymnasium Lauda-K\u00f6nigshofen in Lauda is named for him. ==References== == External links == * * *Information on Schleyer and the campaign for his beatification Category:1831 births Category:1912 deaths Category:People from Lauda-K\u00f6nigshofen Category:German Roman Catholic priests Category:Constructed language creators Category:People from the Grand Duchy of Baden Category:Speakers of international auxiliary languages Category:Volap\u00fck Category:Volap\u00fckologists Category:19th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:20th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:German Servants of God ",
