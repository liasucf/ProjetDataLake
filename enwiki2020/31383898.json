    "text": "The Sagaing Fault is a major fault in Burma, a mainly continental right- lateral transform fault between the Indian Plate and Sunda Plate. It links the divergent boundary in the Andaman Sea with the zone of active continental collision along the Himalayan front. It passes through populated cities of Mandalay, Yamethin, Pyinmana, the capital Naypyidaw, Toungoo and Pegu before dropping off into the Gulf of Martaban, over 1200 kilometers. The total slip rate across the Indian\u2013Sunda Plate boundary is about 35 mm/yr, of which 18 mm/yr is accommodated by the Sagaing Fault, according to GPS data. The measured maximum displacement along the fault is about 100 km, although several authors have proposed between 360 km to 400 km. == Earthquakes == See also: List of Earthquakes in Myanmar The Sagaing Fault has produced several major earthquakes along various segments in historical years: * 1839 Ava Earthquake: Powerful quake that destroyed the city of Inwa. * 1930 Bago Earthquake: Magnitude 7.3 quake and likely a local tsunami at Bago, causing over 500 deaths. * 1930 Pyu Earthquake: Magnitude 7.4 event with an intensity of IX resulted in great destruction and deaths. * 1931 Myitkyina Earthquake: On January 28, a large magnitude 7.6 quake struck Kachin State. * 1946 Sagaing Earthquake: A Magnitude 8.0 earthquake struck Sagaing Region on September 12. * 1956 Sagaing Earthquake: Magnitude 7.1 quake resulted in over 30 deaths. * 2012 Shwebo Earthquake: Magnitude 6.8 quake killed 26 people and left 12 missing. ==See also== * West Andaman Fault ==References== ==External links== * Earth Observatory of Singapore: Myanmar earthquake of March 24th - Magnitude 6.8 (Regional Tectonics Explained) * In-depth Sagaing Fault Study of 2012 quake Category:Seismic faults of Asia Category:Geology of Myanmar Category:Strike-slip faults ",
