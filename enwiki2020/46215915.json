    "text": "Safonfok is a prehistoric archaeological site near Walung, on the island of Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia. At the time of its discovery in 1999, it was one of the largest prehistoric industrial complex found in the islands of the Pacific. The site, whose extent has not been fully determined, was excavated in 1999-2000, revealing a major complex where an estimated hundreds of workers manufactured coral fish hooks and other tools. Unique among the finds are a basalt knife and a diamond-shaped bead. The site was listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places in 2002. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in the Federated States of Micronesia ==References== Category:Archaeological sites in the Federated States of Micronesia Category:Ruins in the Federated States of Micronesia Category:History of Micronesia Category:National Register of Historic Places in the Federated States of Micronesia Category:Kosrae ",
