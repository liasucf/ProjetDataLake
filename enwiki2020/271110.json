In 370, the Arians elected Demophilus to fill the bishopric vacancy after the death of Eudoxius of Antioch. The Nicene Christians and the deposed bishop of Antioch Eustathius chose Evagrius for that see; but a few months later he was banished by the emperor Valens, and remained in exile until his death. Some sources claim that he was elected a second time in 379 or 380, after the expulsion of Demophilus by emperor Theodosius I. == References == Category:380 deaths Category:4th-century archbishops Category:Opponents of Arianism Category:4th- century Romans Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Archbishops of Constantinople ",
