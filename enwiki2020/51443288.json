Nevertheless, support for S\u00f3crates and the Socialists eroded and the ruling party lost its majority in the 2009 election. The second government of Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates faced a deterioration of the economic and financial state of the country, with skyrocketing deficit and growing debt. Austerity was resumed in 2010 while the country entered a hard financial crisis in the context of the European debt crisis. On 23 March 2011, S\u00f3crates submitted his resignation to President An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva after the Parliament rejected a new austerity package (the fourth in a year), leading to the 2011 snap election. Financial status of the country deteriorated and on 6 April S\u00f3crates caretaker government requested a bail-out program which was conceded. The \u20ac78 billion IMF/European Union bailout to Portugal thus started and would last until May 2014. S\u00f3crates lost the snap election held on 5 June 2011 and resigned as Secretary-General of the Socialist Party. For most of his political career, S\u00f3crates was associated to several corruption cases, notably Independente University and Freeport cases.. == References == Category:2009 establishments in Portugal Category:2011 disestablishments in Portugal Category:Cabinets established in 2009 Category:Cabinets disestablished in 2011 Category:Constitutional Governments of Portugal ",
