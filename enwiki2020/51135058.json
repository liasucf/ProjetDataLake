    "text": "The Chickenfoot Summer Tour 2009 (also known as the Summer Tour 2009) was a worldwide concert tour by the American supergroup Chickenfoot featuring guitarist Joe Satriani, former Van Halen members singer Sammy Hagar and bassist Michael Anthony as well as Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith. The tour took place to promote their debut studio album Chickenfoot, released in 2009. The Rock band played a series of concerts in both North America and Europe spanning from June until December 2009. It followed the sell-out Road Test Tour which took place in spring of 2009. == Background == Before going on an international world tour in 2009, the band organized a series of shows in the United States to seak critical acclaim and reaction of their fans. These nine dates which took place in the spring of 2009 were titled as the Chickenfoot Road Test Tour 2009. As the tour was quickly sold out, the band shared in a press release on April 21, 2009: \"The band was blown away by your response and can't wait to take the show on the road. Chickenfoot will be back [\u2026]\". On June 5, 2009, Chickenfoot promoted both the upcoming album as well as the summer tour on the program Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien. On November 6, 2009, the band promoted their final concerts on the show Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Ultimately, the Chickenfoot Summer Tour 2009 was announced on June 3, 2009. The tour started with a total of 14 planned shows in Europe before the tour would be concluded in North America with two shows in Canada, 31 shows in the United States as well as one show in Mexico. In Europe, the band played in Austria, Ireland, England, the Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, France, Sweden and Switzerland. However, some of the shows were cancelled (see notes). == Set list == This set list is representative of the show on 23 September 2009. # \"Avenida Revolucion\" # \"Sexy Little Thing\" # \"Soap on a Rope\" # \"My Kinda Girl\" # \"Down the Drain\" # \"Bitten By The Wolf\" # \"Oh Yeah\" # \"Learning to Fall\" # \"Get It Up\" # \"Turnin' Left\" # \"Future in the Past\" # \"Bad Motor Scooter\" # \"My Generation\" == Tour dates == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |+ List of concerts, showing date, city, country and venue |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Date ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\"| City ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Country ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Venue |- ! colspan=\"4\" | Europe |- | 20 June 2009 | Nickelsdorf | Austria | Nova Rock Festival |- | 23 June 2009 | Cork | Ireland | Live at the Marquee |- | 25 June 2009 | London | England | Shepherd's Bush Empire |- | 26 June 2009 | Heerhugowaard | Netherlands | Waerdse Tempel |- | 28 June 2009 | Dessel | Belgium | Graspop Metal Meeting |- | 29 June 2009 | Paris | France | Olympia |- | ~~2 July 2009~~ | ~~Madrid~~ | ~~Spain~~ | ~~Palacio de Deportes~~ |- | 3 July 2009 | Pistoia | Italy | Blues Festival |- | 4 July 2009 | Montreux | Switzerland | Jazz Festival |- | 5 July 2009 | Udine | Italy | Riverside Beach |- | ~~8 July 2009~~ | ~~Hamburg~~ | ~~Germany~~ | ~~Gro\u00dfe Freiheit~~ |- | ~~9 July 2009~~ | ~~Copenhagen~~ | ~~Denmark~~ | ~~Vega Hall~~ |- | 10 July 2009 | Kilafors | Sweden | Rockweekend Festival |- | 12 July 2009 | Weert | Netherlands | Bospop Festival |- ! colspan=\"4\" | North America |- | 2 August 2009 | Halifax | rowspan=\"2\" | Canada | Citadel Hill |- | ~~4 August 2009~~ | ~~Toronto~~ | ~~Sound Academy~~ |- | ~~5 August 2009~~ | ~~Pittsburgh~~ | ~~United States~~ | ~~Riverplex Amphitheatre~~ |- | 5 August 2009 | Toronto | Canada | Sound Academy |- | 7 August 2009 | Chicago | rowspan=\"30\"| United States | The Theatre |- | 8 August 2009 | Detroit | The Fillmore |- | 11 August 2009 | Kansas City | Uptown Theatre |- | 13 August 2009 | Comstock Park | Fifth Third Ballpark |- | 15 August 2009 | Cleveland | Rock and Roll Hall of Fame |- | 17 August 2009 | New York City | Beacon Theatre |- | 18 August 2009 | Baltimore | Lyric Opera House |- | 20 August 2009 | Uncasville | Mohegan Sun Arena |- | 21 August 2009 | rowspan=\"2\" | Atlantic City | Music Box |- | 22 August 2009 | House of Blues |- | 23 August 2009 | Hampton Beach | Casino Ballroom |- | 24 August 2009 | Boston | Bank Of America Pavilion |- | 26 August 2009 | Portsmouth | nTelos Pavilion |- | 27 August 2009 | Charlotte | Uptown Amphitheatre |- | 29 August 2009 | North Myrtle Beach | House of Blues |- | 30 August 2009 | Atlanta | The Tabernacle |- | 5 September 2009 | Lake Tahoe | Resort Hotel and Casino |- | rowspan=\"2\" | 11 September 2009 | Denver | The Fillmore |- | Columbus | Ohio State Fair |- | 12 September 2009 | Grand Junction | Loudwire Music Festival |- | 14 September 2009 | Tulsa | Brady Theater |- | 16 September 2009 | Houston | Verizon Wireless Theater |- | 17 September 2009 | Corpus Christi | Concrete Street Pavilion |- | 18 September 2009 | Austin | Travis County Expo |- | 20 September 2009 | San Antonio | Sunset Station |- | 21 September 2009 | Grand Prairie | Nokia Theatre |- | 23 September 2009 | Phoenix | Dodge Theatre |- | 25 September 2009 | Berkeley | Greek Theatre |- | 26 September 2009 | Valley Center | Open Sky Theater |- | 27 September 2009 | Universal City | Gibson Amphitheater |- | 10 October 2009 | Cabo San Lucas | Mexico | Cabo Wabo Cantina |- | 5 December 2009 | Las Vegas | United States | The Joint |} == Notes == == References == ==External links == * Official Chickenfoot website Category:2009 concert tours ",
