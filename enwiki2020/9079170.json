    "text": "One Summer of Happiness () is a 1951 Swedish film by director Arne Mattsson, based on the 1949 novel Sommardansen (The Summer Dance) by Per Olof Ekstr\u00f6m. It was the first Swedish film to win the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival. It was also nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 1952 Cannes Film Festival. Today, the film is mainly known for its nude scenes, which caused much controversy at the time and, together with Ingmar Bergman's Summer with Monika (1953), spread the image of Swedish \"free love\" around the world. ==Plot== The film tells the story about the university student G\u00f6ran who spends a summer on his uncle's farm, where he meets the young Kerstin. They instantly fall in love, but Kerstin is ruled by very strict relatives, so they must hide their love story from everyone, not the least from the extremely strict vicar. They experience an intense summer together, and G\u00f6ran dreads the idea of returning to university in the autumn. A twist of fate changes their lives forever. ==Main cast== * Ulla Jacobsson as Kerstin * Folke Sundquist as G\u00f6ran * Edvin Adolphson as Anders Persson * Irma Christenson as Sigrid * John Elfstr\u00f6m as The Vicar * Nils Hallberg as Nisse * Gunvor Pont\u00e9n as Sylvia * Berta Hall as Anna ==Reception== The film caused much international controversy, because of a nude swimming sequence and a love scene which included a close-up of Ulla Jacobsson's breasts, but also because of its very anti-clerical message by portraying a local priest as the main villain. So, in spite of its awards, the film was banned in Spain and several other countries,The Swedish Film Database: Hon dansade en sommar (1951) - Kommentar Svensk filmografi (in Swedish) Linked 2014-03-01 and was not widely released in the United States until 1955,IMDb: One Summer of Happiness (1951) - Release info Linked 2014-03-01 although it was showing in San Francisco as early as October 1953. ==Awards== ;Won * 2nd Berlin International Film Festival - Golden Bear * 1952 Cannes Film Festival - Best Music. ;Nominated * 1952 Cannes Film Festival - Palme d'Or ==See also== *Nudity in film ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1951 films Category:1951 romantic drama films Category:Swedish films Category:Swedish romantic drama films Category:Swedish-language films Category:Golden Bear winners Category:Films directed by Arne Mattsson Category:1951 drama films ",
