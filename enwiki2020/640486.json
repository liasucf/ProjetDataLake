The now defunct girl group The 411 provided backing vocals for a number of tracks. ==Background== Sony Music signed Lemar to a five-record deal after his success on the BBC Television programme Fame Academy in 2002. His first single \"Dance (with U)\" was written with Craig Hardy and Fitzgerald Scott who had previously worked with Keith Sweat. The second single \"50/50\" was recorded by the Norwegian Stargate production team. Fingaz, who has produced hits by British group Big Brovaz, also produced the song \"What About Love\". Lemar also recorded a version of \"Let's Stay Together\" by Al Green which was one of his featured songs by Fame Academy. ==Commercial performance== The first single from the album, \"Dance With U\", reached number 2 on the UK singles charts in early 2003. His first album Dedicated was released late in 2003 with additional singles \"50/50\" and \"Another Day\" also achieving chart success in the UK. Following the success of the album, he commenced his first headlining tour of the UK. Dedicated was certified double platinum by the BPI for sales in excess of 600,000 copies. ==Track listing== # \"Dedicated (Intro)\" (Lemar Obika) \u2013 1:08 # \"Dance (with U)\" (Craig Hardy, Obika, Fitzgerald Scott) \u2013 3:08 # \"Fresh\" (Abdul Bello, Obika) \u2013 3:25 # \"50/50\" (Austan, Hermansen, Mikkel Mille, Obika) \u2013 3:24 # \"Another Day\" (Scott, Skyler Sinclair, William Whedbee) \u2013 4:02 # \"Sweet Love\" (Karl Daniel, Obika) \u2013 3:35 # \"No Pressure\" (Jas Jorgensen, Andy Love, Obika) \u2013 3:38 # \"Body Talk\" (Darren Brown, Terry Brown, Giles Craig, Obika) \u2013 3:20 # \"What About Love?\" (Obika, Scott) \u2013 3:39 # \"Good Woman\" (Brown, Brown, Craig, Obika) \u2013 3:47 # \"Let's Stay Together\" (Al Green, Al Jackson, Willie Mitchell) \u2013 3:48 # \"Hot Summer\" (Brown, Brown, Craig, Obika) \u2013 3:25 # \"Alright With Our Love\" (Nigel Lowis, Obika, Scott) \u2013 4:20 # \"Lullaby\" (Ainslie Henderson, Obika) \u2013 3:22 # \"All I Ever Do (My Boo)\" (Obika) \u2013 3:20 == Personnel == *Jarl Ivar Andersen \u2013 multi instruments *Pete Beachill \u2013 trombone *Joe Belmaati \u2013 keyboards, programming *Dave Bishop \u2013 saxophone *Tim Briley \u2013 assistant engineer, mixing assistant *James Cruz \u2013 mastering *Snake Davis \u2013 saxophone *Joe Fields \u2013 engineer *Fingaz \u2013 keyboards, producer *The 411 \u2013 background vocals *Matt Furmidge \u2013 assistant engineer *Carrie Grant \u2013 vocal arrangement *Simon Hale \u2013 horn arrangements, string arrangements, horn conductor, string conductor *Michael Hansen \u2013 percussion *Craig Hardy \u2013 producer *Lawrence Johnson \u2013 vocals, choir arrangement *Marc Lane \u2013 engineer *Vanessa Letocq \u2013 production coordination *The London Session Orchestra \u2013 strings *Andy Love \u2013 producer *Nigel Lowis \u2013 producer *Paul Meehan \u2013 arranger, programming, producer *Roy Merchant \u2013 engineer, mixing *Mikkel SE \u2013 multi instruments *Matz Nilsson \u2013 mixing *Nicole Nodland \u2013 photography *Adam Phillips \u2013 guitar *Nick Raphael \u2013 A&R; *Brian Rawling \u2013 arranger, producer *Fitzgerald Scott \u2013 vocal arrangement, vocal engineer, vocal producer *Alan Simpson \u2013 guitar *Alexis Smith \u2013 assistant engineer *Stargate \u2013 producer *Ren Swan \u2013 mixing *John Themis \u2013 guitar *Derek Watkins \u2013 trumpet *Gavyn Wright \u2013 orchestra leader *Jong Uk Yoon \u2013 engineer, mixing ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2004) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\" |- ! scope=\"row\" |} ==References== ==External links== *Lemar Online page *Lemar Top of The Pops Interview Category:2003 debut albums Category:Lemar albums Category:RCA Records albums Category:Albums produced by Stargate Category:Albums produced by Brian Rawling ",
