It was first recorded in the 14th century but its present appearance is that of an 18th- century rebuild by Maximilien-Henri de Horion, which turned it from a stronghold into a pleasure palace, with interiors decorated by Paul-Joseph Delcloche. It and its park were acquired in 1963 by the University of Li\u00e8ge. ==Bibliography (in French)== *Universit\u00e9 de Li\u00e8ge. Cahiers du Sart Tilman.
