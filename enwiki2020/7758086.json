Their lyrics deal mainly with death, apocalypse and warfare. The band recorded only one EP; other versions of the featured songs were featured on split releases with Mayhem and Swordmaster. The band Zyklon featuring members of Zyklon-B is often incorrectly thought to be the same band. The name refers to Zyklon B, a gas used in gas chambers during the Holocaust. Despite the name the band states that \"Zyklon-B is not related to any political or racial preference\". == Discography == *Blood Must Be Shed EP (1995) *#\"Mental Orgasm\" \u2013 2:54 *#\"Bloodsoil\" \u2013 2:25 *#\"Warfare\" \u2013 5:35 *Blood Must Be Shed / Wraths of Time split EP with Swordmaster (1996) *#\"Mental Orgasm\" \u2013 2:54 *#\"Bloodsoil\" \u2013 2:25 *#\"Warfare\" \u2013 5:35 *#\"Wraths of Time\" \u2013 5:37 *#\"Upon Blood and Ashes\" \u2013 5:17 *#\"Conspiracy - Preview\" \u2013 2:56 *Necrolust / Total Warfare split single with Mayhem (1999) *#\"Necrolust (Unreleased Studio Version)\" \u2013 3:43 *#\"Total Warfare (Sea Serpent Remix)\" \u2013 5:46 Category:Norwegian black metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1995 Category:1995 establishments in Norway Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1999 Category:1999 disestablishments in Norway Category:Musical groups from Norway with local place of origin missing ",
