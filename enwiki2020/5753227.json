Timo\u010dani settled in the Balkans in the 6th century and became later subjects of the Avar Khaganate. In 805 that area was conquered of the Bulgar Khanate under Khan Krum. In 818 during the rule of Omurtag of Bulgaria (814-836) they, together with other border tribes of the First Bulgarian Empire, revolted because of an administrative reform that deprived them of much of their local authority. They, together with other Slavic tribes, searched protection from Holy Roman Emperor Louis the Pious in the same year, meeting him at his court at Herstal. Omurtag decided to settle the matter by means of diplomacy in 824-826, though his letters were not replied to by Louis. This prompted Omurtag to undertake a boat campaign on the Drava in 827 and invade the lands of the Timo\u010dani at Sirmium, successfully imposing Bulgar rule again and appointing local governors. Many Timochans fled to Transdanubia, later becoming part of the Balaton Principality. Today, \"Timo\u010dani\" can be used as an informal name for the inhabitants of the Timok Valley in Serbia and Bulgaria. ==See also== *List of Medieval Slavic tribes ==References== Category:Slavic tribes in Thrace and Moesia Category:First Bulgarian Empire Category:9th century in Serbia ",
