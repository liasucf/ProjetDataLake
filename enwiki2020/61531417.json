    "text": "La Llorona, also known as The Weeping Woman, is a 2019 Guatemalan drama film directed by Jayro Bustamante. It was screened in the Contemporary World Cinema section at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival. ==Plot== In the 1980s, Guatemalan dictator Enrique Monteverde orchestrated the brutal genocide of native Mayans. Decades later, after being tried and convicted, the guilty verdict is overturned because of a technicality, allowing him to return to his home. The decision is met with disgust and unrest by the public, who hold protests outside the Monteverde home. Despite this, the family lives in relative peace until Enrique's increasingly erratic and senile behavior forces most of his staff to quit. Shortly afterward, a young woman named Alma arrives as a new worker, and supernatural activity ensues. ==Cast== * Mar\u00eda Mercedes Coroy as Alma * Sabrina De La Hoz as Natalia * Margarita Ken\u00e9fic as Carmen * Julio Diaz as Enrique Monteverde * Mar\u00eda Tel\u00f3n as Valeriana * Juan Pablo Olyslager as Letona * Ayla-Elea Hurtador as Sara ==Release== La Llorona had its world premiere on 30 August, 2019 at the Venice Film Festival (Giornate degli Autori) and later screened at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival. On 6 August 2020 the film premiered on the horror streaming service Shudder. ==Reception== Critical reception for La Llorona has been positive and the film received praise from the A.V. Club and New York Times. RogerEbert.com rated it at three stars, stating that \"\u201cLa Llorona\u201d is filled with bewitching imagery and tension, even if it\u2019s less full of surprises and jump scares than other horror movies. Bustamante uses the old haunted tale not to scare us, but to force his audience to reflect on the ways they are complicit in oppression.\" Horror website Bloody Disgusting 2 1/2 out of 5 skulls, writing \"Bustamante delivers a sobering evocation for justice, and in the case of La Llorona, it\u2019s by the hands of a folkloric vengeance seeker. Certain aspects of the story are emotionally powerful, while other threads feel underdeveloped. The predictability of the overarching direction means the slow-burn pacing can drag, and the horror elements are very minimal. If you go in expecting something more historically relevant and genre adjacent, it\u2019s easier to find an in to a narrative that's not always easily accessible.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 films Category:2019 drama films Category:Guatemalan films Category:Spanish-language films Category:La Llorona ",
