    "text": "Tetramethylthiuram sulfide is an organosulfur compound with the formula ((CH3)2NCS)2S. It is a yellow solid that is soluble in organic solvents. It is the parent member of a large class of tetraalkylthiuram sulfides. It is used as an activator in the sulfur vulcanization of natural and butyl rubbers. ==Synthesis and structure== It is prepared by desulfuration of tetramethylthiuram disulfides with triphenylphosphine or cyanide: :(Me2NCSS)2 \\+ PPh3 \u2192 (Me2NCS)2S + SPPh3 According to X-ray crystallography, the molecule consists of two planar (CH3)2NCS subunits joined by a sulfide. The dihedral angle between the subunits is close to 90\u00b0. ==References== Category:Organosulfur compounds ",
