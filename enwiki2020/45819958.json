His father, Subir Kumar Ghosh, was a professor of geology at Jadavpur University and his mother, Sheila Ghosh (n\u00e9e Sen), is a homemaker. He attended St. Lawrence High School (1971-1981) and South Point High School (1981-1983). As a child, he learned Sanskrit from his grandmother Ila Ghosh (n\u00e9e Roy), a language he still speaks and reads fluently. He obtained a B. Sc. (Honours) in chemistry from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India, in 1987, winning the University Medal of the Faculty of Science. The same year, he moved to the University of Minnesota, where he completed a PhD under the supervision of Regents' Professor Paul G. Gassman in 1992 and subsequently also postdoctoral research with Professor Lawrence Que, Jr. During this period, he also collaborated extensively with Professor Jan Alml\u00f6f. He did a brief, second postdoc with Professor David Bocian at the University of California Riverside. ==Career== After postdoctoral stints in Minnesota and California, he moved to UiT \u2013 The Arctic University of Norway in 1996, where he has remained ever since. He has had several secondary positions/affiliations: Senior Fellow of the San Diego Supercomputer Center at the University of California San Diego (1997-2004), Outstanding Younger Researcher awardee of the Research Council of Norway (2004-2010), a co-principal investigator at the national center of excellence Centre for Theoretical and Computational Chemistry (2007-2017), and a Visiting Professor at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, on many occasions (2006-2016). He edited two books, The Smallest Biomolecules: Diatomics and their Interactions with Heme Proteins (Elsevier, 2008), a monograph on the subject, and Letters to a Young Chemist (Wiley, 2011), a popular science book on careers in chemistry research.\"What's it like to be a chemist?\". Royal Society of Chemistry Website. review by Simon Cotton In 2014, he coauthored Arrow Pushing in Inorganic Chemistry: A Logical Approach to the Chemistry of the Main Group Elements (Wiley) with Steffen Berg, which won the 2015 Prose Award for 'best textbook in the Physical Sciences and Mathematics'. He has served on the editorial advisory board of the Journal of Biological Inorganic Chemistry (1999\u20132001, 2005\u20132007) and currently serves on the editorial boards of the Journal of Porphyrins and Phthalocyanines (2000\u2013) and Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry (2007\u2013present). As of 2020, he has authored/coauthored over 230 scientific papers, which have been cited nearly 10,000 times with an h-index of approximately 56. ==Research== Dr. Ghosh has contributed to many areas of porphyrin-related research. His early contributions include the use of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to study short-strong hydrogen bonds in porphyrin-type molecules and also some of the first large-scale ab initio calculations applied to porphyrins and other bioinorganic systems. He has had an abiding interest in the phenomenon of ligand noninnocence and has contributed substantially to studying the phenomenon in transition metal nitrosyl and corrole derivatives. In recent years, he has developed the field of heavy element corrole derivatives, which are unusual size-mismatched metal-ligand assemblies that incorporate a large 4d or 5d transition metal ion within the sterically compressed central cavity of a corrole. In this area he has reported some of the first examples of 99Tc, rhenium, osmium, platinum, and gold corroles. Despite their size-mismatched character, many of these complexes have proved rugged and found applications as near-IR phosphorescent photosensitizers in oxygen sensing and photodynamic therapy as well as in dye-sensitized solar cells. In collaboration with linguist Paul Kiparsky, Ghosh has recently written about the possible influence of P\u0101\u1e47ini's Sanskrit grammar, in particular the periodic Sanskrit alphabet (the Shiva sutras), on Mendeleev's conception of the periodic table, a potentially important, new insight into the history of the periodic table. == References == ==Further reading== * == External links == * www.example.com * Google Scholar report Category:21st-century Indian chemists Category:University of Auckland faculty Category:Indian science writers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:University of Troms\u00f8 faculty Category:University of Minnesota alumni Category:20th-century Indian chemists ",
