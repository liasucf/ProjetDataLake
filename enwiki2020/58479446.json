    "text": "Shake the Spirit is the second studio album by American singer/songwriter Elle King, released on October 19, 2018 by RCA Records. It was recorded in rural Denton, Texas. Commercially, Shake the Spirit peaked at No.9 on the US Top Rock Albums(Billboard) and No.6 on the US Top Alternative Albums(Billboard) Upon the albums release it received critical acclaim from music critics. Many stated since King's global success with \"Ex's and Oh's\" it proves that she has much more to offer, stating it is infused with divorce, self-doubt, medicinal drinking, and PTSD all of which King suffered in her personal life after being in the spotlight. ==Music== Variety described Shake the Spirit as \"confessional rock and roll\". Billboard said it is \"a cathartic, rough-edged diary entry of a project that couldn't be more personal\". ==Critical reception== Chris Willman of Variety called the album \"a first-rate second album that deals frankly with a rough year or two the singer has had since \"Ex's and Oh's\" took her big-time. It's infused with divorce, self-doubt, medicinal drinking, PTSD and, well, more divorce.\" Eric R. Danton of Paste said the album \"plays like a kind of musical revue, with nods at muscular rock, old-school spy movie songs, vintage soul, '60s girl groups and tunes that blend elements of all four\", but that they do not \"hang together as a group, which gives Shake the Spirit a scattershot feel. It's an Elle King album, to be sure\u2014her voice is what stitches these songs together, though what is probably supposed to be evidence of her range often feels like she's trying on musical costumes. The result is a lack of cohesion that turns Shake the Spirit into a series of genre exercises.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Adapted credits from the liner notes of Shake the Spirit. ;Vocals *Lead vocals \u2013 Elle King, Cameron Neal *Background vocals \u2013 Denton Choir, Paul DeVincenzo, Jesse Gibbon, Joey McClellan, Cameron Neal, Cherish Robinson, Dave Scalia *Gang vocals \u2013 Tim Pagnotta, Brian Phillips ;Instruments *Alto, Tenor, Flute and Clarinet \u2013 David Monsch *Bari Sax \u2013 Mike Morisson *Bass \u2013 Paul DeVincenzo, Elle King, Greg Kurstin, Brian Phillips, Paul Unger *Cellos \u2013 Shawna Hamilton, Buffi Jacobs *Drums and percussion \u2013 Elliott Jacobson, Elle King, Greg Kurstin, Dave Scalia *Guitars \u2013 Elle King, Greg Kurstin, Rebecca Lovell, Joey McClellan, Cameron Neal, Tim Pagnotta *Keyboards \u2013 Jesse Gibbon, Brian Phillips *Lap Steel \u2013 Elle King, Megan Lovell *Trombone \u2013 David J.
