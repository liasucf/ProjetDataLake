His first movie, Hello Smile! (originally Bonjour Sourire) was released in 1956. He earned international attention with The Things of Life (Les choses de la vie, 1970), which he wrote and directed, like the rest of his later films. Featuring Michel Piccoli in the male lead, it was shown in competition at the 1970 Cannes Festival. The film also revived the career of Romy Schneider; she acted in several of Sautet's later films. In his next film Max and the Junkmen (Max et les Ferrailleurs, 1971) Schneider played a prostitute, while in C\u00e9sar and Rosalie (C\u00e9sar et Rosalie, 1972) she portrayed a married woman who copes with the reappearance of an old flame. Vincent, Fran\u00e7ois, Paul and the Others (Vincent, Paul, Fran\u00e7ois, et les Autres, 1974) is one of Sautet's most acclaimed films. Four middle-class men meet in the country every weekend mainly to discuss their lives. As well as Piccoli, it featured Yves Montand, G\u00e9rard Depardieu, and St\u00e9phane Audran. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian in a 2020 tribute article to Michel Piccoli thought it was \"arguably the best\" of the \"five very well-regarded movies\" on which the actor and director collaborated. Sautet achieved even further critical success with Mado (1976). His film A Simple Story (Une Histoire simple, 1978) was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The film featured Schneider again, this time as a dissatisfied working woman in her 40s. She won the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Actress for her performance. In the 1980s, he made only two films Waiter! (Gar\u00e7on!, 1983), a drama starring Yves Montand as a middle-aged waiter, and the comedy A Few Days with Me (Quelques Jours Avec Moi, 1988). Claude Sautet won the Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival and the C\u00e9sar Award for Best Director for A Heart in Winter (Un c\u0153ur en hiver, 1992) and received the C\u00e9sar once more for Nelly and Mr. Arnaud (Nelly et Monsieur Arnaud, 1995). Both films starred Emmanuelle B\u00e9art. Apart from his own directing, he also wrote screenplays for other directors.
