WSOY, 2009. . == Finnish Civil War == As the Finnish Civil War started in January 1918, Bulatsel was the Commander of the 1st Brigade of the 106th division in Tampere. In the late February, Hugo Salmela replaced Mikhail Svechnikov as the Commander-in-Chief of the Red Guards. Salmela did not have any kind of military training, so Bulatsel became his advisor. After the Battle of Tampere, Bulatsel was arrested by the Whites and executed on 28 April. He was buried at the Kalevankangas Cemetery. Bulatsel's two sons, 13-year-old Woldemar and 15-year-old Nikolai, were shot just couple of days later in the Vyborg massacre. == References == Category:1875 births Category:1918 deaths Category:Musicians from Kharkiv Category:People from Kharkov Governorate Category:Imperial Russian Army personnel Category:Russian military personnel of the Russo-Japanese War Category:Russian military personnel of World War I Category:People of the Finnish Civil War (Red side) Category:Russian people executed abroad Category:Executed Russian people Category:People executed by Finland by firing squad Category:20th-century executions by Finland ",
