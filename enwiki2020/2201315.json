    "text": "Skye McCole Bartusiak (September 28, 1992 \u2013 July 19, 2014) was an American child actress and child model. She appeared in The Patriot (2000), Don't Say a Word (2001), as Rose Wilder in Beyond the Prairie: The True Story of Laura Ingalls Wilder (2002), 24 (2002\u201303), Boogeyman (2005), and Kill Your Darlings (2006). Bartusiak died at the age of 21 in her apartment behind her parents' home. Her death was ruled the result of an accidental drug overdose. Bartusiak's mother stated her daughter suffered epileptic seizures as a baby and believed it had a role in her death. ==Early life== Skye McCole Bartusiak was born in Houston, Texas, where she lived with her parents, Helen (n\u00e9e McCole) and Donald Bartusiak, until her death. ==Career== Bartusiak first starred in Stephen King's Storm of the Century as young Pippa Hatcher. In 2000, she appeared in The Patriot as the youngest child of a militia leader portrayed by Mel Gibson. She played the young Marilyn Monroe in the TV miniseries Blonde, and the psychiatrist's daughter in Don't Say a Word alongside Michael Douglas and Brittany Murphy, both in 2001. She also played young Charlie McGee in Firestarter: Rekindled and Megan Matheson during season two of the television series 24 (2002\u20132003). Bartusiak made an appearance in the short film The Vest in 2003 and played the part of The Girl in Once Not Far from Home in 2005. She also tried her hand at theatre, playing in The Miracle Worker alongside Hilary Swank at the Charlotte Repertory Theatre in North Carolina. In 2003, Bartusiak returned to period drama with Love Comes Softly, and a year later she played young Jackie in Against the Ropes alongside Meg Ryan. In 2005, she received main billing for her role as Franny Roberts in the hit horror film Boogeyman. She starred in the \"Kids\" episode of hospital drama series House, and took a lead role as Sunshine in the film Kill Your Darlings, playing a troubled teen willing to do anything to get the attention of her busy father. ==Death== On July 19, 2014, Bartusiak died in her apartment behind her parents' Houston home. Her mother told CNN and the Associated Press that Skye's boyfriend found the actress sitting up in her bed; Helen began CPR on her daughter before the arrival of paramedics, who then worked \"for 45 minutes\" to resuscitate her. Her mother said Skye \"had been healthy and did not drink or do drugs\", but had recently been suffering from epileptic seizures; she believed that this fact had likely played a role in her daughter's death. A memorial service was held in Houston six days later; her brother Stephen told mourners: \"If you want to know what makes Skye happy, go out and plant a tree.\" The Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences ruled in October 2014 that Bartusiak's death was an accident. The \"combined toxic effects of hydrocodone and difluoroethane with carisoprodol\" were listed as the main cause of death, possibly from inhaling as a means of getting herself a drug \"high\". Her mother, Helen McCole Bartusiak, died on May 22, 2015, 10 months after her daughter. == Filmography == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Film roles |- ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Role ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes |- | 1999 | The Cider House Rules | Hazel | |- | 2000 | The Prophet's Game | Adele Highsmith (child) | |- | 2000 | The Patriot | Susan Martin | |- | 2001 | Don't Say a Word | Jessie Conrad | |- | 2001 | Riding in Cars with Boys | Amelia - Age 8 | |- | 2001 | The Affair of the Necklace | Dove | (scenes deleted) |- | 2002 | Flashpoint | Lizzie | |- | 2003 | Love Comes Softly | Missie Davis | |- | 2003 | The Vest | Sara | Short |- | 2004 | Against the Ropes | Little Jackie Kallen | |- | 2005 | Boogeyman | Franny Roberts | |- | 2006 | Kill Your Darlings | Sunshine | |- | 2006 | Once Not Far from Home | The Little Girl | Short |- | 2006 | Razor Sharp | Isis/Ice-6 | Short |- | 2008 | A Fix | Natalie Coleman | Short |- | 2008 | Pineapple | Alex | |- | 2009 | Wild About Harry | Daisy Goodhart | |- | 2011 | Good Day for It | Rachel | |- | 2011 | University of Penn Relay Carnival | |Director |- | 2012 | Twelve Hungry Men | Jesse | Short |- | 2012 | Dr. Oscar Griffith: Hollywood Psychiatrist | The Pop Star / Rachel | Short |- | 2012 | Sick Boy | Lucy | |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Television roles |- ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Role ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes |- | 1999 | Storm of the Century | Pippa Hatcher | 2 episodes |- | 1999 | JAG | Rachel Sherkston | Episode: \"Shakedown\" |- | 1999 | Judging Amy | Marcy Noble | Episode: \"Presumed Innocent\" |- | 1999 | Witness Protection | Suzie Batton | HBO Movie |- | 2000 | Providence | Jessie | Episode: \"Taking a Chance on Love\" |- | 2000 | Frasier | Girl with Drawing | Episode: \"The Three Faces of Frasier\" |- | 2000 | Law & Order: Special Victims Unit | Jennifer | Episode: \"Legacy\" |- | 2000 | The Darkling | Casey Obold | TV film |- | 2001 | Touched by an Angel | Sarah | Episode: \"The Birthday Present\" |- | 2001 | Blonde | Young Norma Jeane Baker | TV film |- | 2002 | Firestarter: Rekindled | Young Charlie McGee | TV film |- | 2002 | Beyond the Prairie: The True Story of Laura Ingalls Wilder | Rose Wilder | TV film |- | 2002\u201303 | 24 | Megan Matheson | 8 episodes |- | 2003 | Love Comes Softly | Missie Davis | TV film |- | 2004 | George Lopez | L'il Bit | 2 episodes |- | 2005 | House | Mary Carroll | Episode: \"Kids\" |- | 2005 | Lost | Young Kate Austen (voice) | Episode: \"Born to Run\"; uncredited |- | 2005 | CSI: Crime Scene Investigation | Susan Lester | Episode: \"Bite Me\" |- | 2007 | Close to Home | Amber | Episode: \"Fall from Grace\" |} == Awards and nominations == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
