    "text": "A Boolean-valued function (sometimes called a predicate or a proposition) is a function of the type f : X \u2192 B, where X is an arbitrary set and where B is a Boolean domain, i.e. a generic two-element set, (for example B = {0, 1}), whose elements are interpreted as logical values, for example, 0 = false and 1 = true, i.e., a single bit of information. In the formal sciences, mathematics, mathematical logic, statistics, and their applied disciplines, a Boolean-valued function may also be referred to as a characteristic function, indicator function, predicate, or proposition. In all of these uses, it is understood that the various terms refer to a mathematical object and not the corresponding semiotic sign or syntactic expression. In formal semantic theories of truth, a truth predicate is a predicate on the sentences of a formal language, interpreted for logic, that formalizes the intuitive concept that is normally expressed by saying that a sentence is true. A truth predicate may have additional domains beyond the formal language domain, if that is what is required to determine a final truth value. ==See also== * Bit * Boolean data type * Boolean algebra (logic) * Boolean domain * Boolean logic * Propositional calculus * Truth table * Logic minimization * Indicator function * Predicate * Proposition * Finitary boolean function * Boolean function ==References== * Brown, Frank Markham (2003), Boolean Reasoning: The Logic of Boolean Equations, 1st edition, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA. 2nd edition, Dover Publications, Mineola, NY, 2003. * Kohavi, Zvi (1978), Switching and Finite Automata Theory, 1st edition, McGraw\u2013Hill, 1970. 2nd edition, McGraw\u2013Hill, 1978. * Korfhage, Robert R.
