    "text": "Ours is an American-based rock band led by singer, songwriter, and multi- instrumentalist Jimmy Gnecco. ==History== ===Harmony Bandits and Sour=== Gnecco in November 2014.Since their creation in 1990, the line-up has evolved many times, but Gnecco has always felt that having a rotating group of musicians who could play off each other was important. In high school, Gnecco was in the band Lost Child and later, The Harmony Bandits, which eventually evolved into what is now Ours. In 1994, Ours released their first album titled Sour under their own label entitled \"Beatnik Records\" owned by Mike Marri. Afterward, the band dissolved and did not reform again for several years. ===Distorted Lullabies and Precious=== In 1997, Gnecco restarted Ours again and quickly drew industry attention. Ours signed with DreamWorks Records and after four years, released their first major label album Distorted Lullabies in 2001. Produced by Steve Lillywhite of U2 fame, the album received mixed reviews but led to successful tours with acts such as Ocean Colour Scene, Pete Yorn, and The Cult. The track \"Sometimes\" peaked at #31 on the US Billboard Modern Rock charts that year, while the music video saw moderate airtime on MTV. Ours performed in Toronto at the Opera House in October, 2001.\"LIVE: Ours October 05, 2001\".Chart Attack. Review by Erik Missio. The album Precious followed soon after in 2002; Precious featured a more stripped-down sound and received much more positive reviews and led to a slot opening for The Wallflowers. ===Dancing for the Death of an Imaginary Enemy=== In 2004, Ours relocated from New Jersey to Los Angeles to work with Rick Rubin. The resulting album, Dancing for the Death of an Imaginary Enemy was released on April 15, 2008. ===The Heart=== In 2010, Gnecco released his self-produced first solo acoustic effort, The Heart, and followed it in 2011 with the release of The Heart: X Edition, in which Gnecco built upon the intimacy of his solo album with a lush full band version of the record. ===Ballet The Boxer 1=== In 2012, Ours launched a PledgeMusic campaign to fund the recording of their new album, Ballet The Boxer 1. The band managed to reach 136% of the goal for their crowdfunding, and subsequently finished the album recording in 2013. Following a few setbacks, the album was eventually released on May 4 for those who participated in the crowdfunding, and a public release followed on June 11. Ours and Gnecco have received worldwide acclaim from critics and fans for their live shows and for Gnecco's dynamic voice and songwriting style, and both have developed a cult-like following that continues to grow. ==Band members== ;Current members * Jimmy Gnecco \u2013 lead vocals, guitar * Static \u2013 guitar * April Bauer \u2013 piano * Chris Goodlof - Bass * Race \u2013 guitar/keys * Chris Iasiello - drums ;Former members * Locke \u2013 keyboards * Dave Milone - guitar * James Bray - Bass, guitar, keyboards * Pit Gnecco \u2013 drums (tours only) ==Tours== Ours has toured with Marilyn Manson, Blue October, Circa Survive, Plain Jane Automobile, Fear Before the March of Flames, The Dear Hunter, and Dear and the Headlights.
