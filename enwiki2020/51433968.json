She was initially chosen to be the third prince Hongshi's difujin (official wife), but fell out of the bride selection. Hongli's mother, Niohuru Zhenhuan, reveals to the Emperor that the Empress had killed the former Empress. Ruyi's aunt, Empress Yixiu, is locked away and she is poisoned by Zhenhuan. Before Ruyi's aunt dies, she tells Ruyi to become Hongli's Empress. With the Ulanara clan in disgrace after Empress Yixiu falls out of favor with the Emperor, Ruyi (Zhou Xun) learns the politics of the harem. She faces the schemes of Fuca Langhua the Empress, and her underling Gao Xiyue. Ruyi is eventually forced to reside in the Cold Palace and separated from the Emperor. There, she meets Ling Yunche, an imperial guard who helps her survive. She also finds out the bracelet that Empress Fuca Langhua gave her on her wedding day prevented her from having a child. In order to help Ruyi, her close friend Keliyete Hailan decides to win Qianlong's favor and Ruyi is saved from the Cold Palace. After Gao Xiyue is exposed, she loses the favor of the Emperor. Ruyi approaches Gao Xiyue and tells her that the reason why she wasn't able to have a child is because of the bracelet that Fuca Langhua gave her. Gao Xiyue is saddened and eventually dies in the snow, after exposing Fuca Langhua's evil deeds to Emperor Qianlong. Xiyue's servant causes Fuca Langhua's son to die to comfort her owner. Fuca Langhua's daughter, Jingse, is also married to a Mongol Prince after Empress Dowager Zhenhuan refused to send her daughter for heqin. After Fuca Langhua almost drowns, she succumbed to illness out of grief. Gao Xiyue and Fuca Langhua's downfall is actually the result of the scheming Jin Yuyan, a Korean woman in love with the King of Joseon. After Jin Yuyan's plans are revealed, she dies heartbroken when the King of Joseon refused to see her one last time. Another consort, Su Luyun also lost Emperor Qianlong's favor after she wanted her son to become the next Emperor. Consort Shu Yehenara Yihuan loves the Emperor, but willingly set herself on fire after realizing the Emperor never wanted her to have his children. Even after surviving multiple conspiracies at the hands of scheming concubines and successfully proving her innocence, Ruyi's relationship with Qianlong (Wallace Huo) eventually becomes irreparable. She eventually becomes disillusioned with her husband and the harsh reality of life in the palace. With the love and trust between them fading, Ruyi is put aside by Qianlong in favor of Wei Yanwan, who seeks to one day displace Ruyi as Empress. Wei Yanwan is eventually promoted to the rank of Imperial Noble Consort (one rank before Empress), but her ruthless and biased actions in managing the Emperor's harem create enemies amongst notable concubines such as Hailan, Balin Meiruo, and Han Xiangjian, who work to take her down. Ling Yunche, who was Yanwan's previous lover, tells Hailan about her endeavors and sacrifices himself to save Ruyi. Eventually, Wei Yanwan's numerous evil deeds are exposed, and Qianlong delivers a stoic apology to Ruyi, knowing their relationship cannot be repaired. Ruyi eventually peacefully dies in her sleep after suffering from tuberculosis, saddening the Emperor heavily and hauntingly. Wei Yanwan is given a slow-acting and extremely painful poison, for which she must ingest the antidote on a regular basis to prolong her suffering. Emperor Qianlong and Empress Dowager, knowing that if Wei Yanwan lives until her son becomes emperor she will live a life of luxury, permit her the release of death. The series ends with Emperor Emeritus Qianlong cutting a lock of his white hair and intertwining it with the lock of black hair that Ruyi cut decades earlier when she declared she no longer wanted to be his Empress. Qianlong dies with the two locks of hair in his hand as Ruyi's favorite plant, the green plum, blooms for the first time in decades. ==Cast== ===Main=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"width:14%\"|Actor !! style=\"width:20%\"|Character !! style=\"width:14%\"|Residence !!

She was the childhood friend and lover of Hongli (who later ascends to the throne as Emperor Qianlong). She later becomes one of Qianlong's secondary wives. When Empress Jingren is deposed for her crimes, Qingying's standing in the palace is affected. So, she has to make amends with Empress Dowager Chongqing. Wanting to distance herself from the past, Qingying asks the Empress Dowager to give her a new name, to make a fresh start. The Empress Dowager then gives her the name Ruyi; \u5982\u61ff, meaning 'beautiful and quiet' (\u7f8e\u597d\u5b89\u975c), reminding her that she must be calm if she wants to have a peaceful life in the palace. After Hongli ascends to the throne, becoming Emperor Qianlong, Ruyi is granted the position of a consort. Due to events of the past, Ruyi is hated by other wives like Fuca Langhua, Gao Xiyue, and Jin Yuyan. Often targeted by their machinations, she survives with her strength and determination, as well as with the help of her close friends, eventually rising up the ranks in the harem to become Empress. Later on, due to many misunderstandings between her and the Emperor, mainly plotted by Wei Yanwan and Princess Hejing, their relationship is greatly strained. The last blow to their relationship occurred on one of the Emperor's tours to Southern China when he tries to take a courtesan, Shui Linglong, as a concubine to his harem. Disillusioned, Ruyi cuts her hair, wanting to end the relationship between her and the Emperor and declaring that she no longer wants to be his Empress. This angers the Emperor, who punishes the Empress by putting her under house arrest in Yikun Palace. In the end, she reveals all of Wei Yanwan's wrongdoings to the Emperor, but she refuses to reconcile with him. She dies not long after from tuberculosis. Her death causes great pain and guilt to Qianlong Emperor up till the day he died. |- | Wallace Huo || Aisin Gioro Hongli (\u7231\u65b0\u89c9\u7f57\u00b7\u5f18\u5386), Qianlong Emperor || Prince Bao Manor Yangxin Palace || Qianlong Emperor (\u4e7e\u9686\u7687\u5e1d) Prince Bao of the First Rank \u2192 Qianlong Emperor Hongli is the fourth son of the Yongzheng Emperor.

As he grew older, he becomes more erratic. When Han Xiangjian appeared, the Emperor lost control and hurt Ruyi. Despite Han Xiangjian's continuous denial of his feelings, Qianlong orders Ruyi to convince Xiangjian to accept him, which hurts Ruyi.

The series also employed William Chang and Tongxun Chen as their overall style director, Han Zhong as art director and Peng Xuejun as cinematography director. ===Development=== Wu Xuelan, also known as Liu Lianzi, started to write the original novel in 2011, and changed her work several times to achieve the best version in the next five years. New Classics Media picked up the series for a 90-episode season (later shortened to 87), and each episode cost approximately S$1.95 million, making it the most expensive television series in China. ===Casting=== On January 14, 2016, it was announced that Zhou Xun will play the leading role of Hoifa-Nara, the Step Empress. The role of Qianlong Emperor, the male lead, was announced to be portrayed by Wallace Huo on May 27. On August 3, actors Janine Chang, Vivian Wu, Dong Jie, Tong Yao, Jing Chao, Xin Zhilei, Li Chun, Zeng Yixuan and Chen Haoyu were cast in major supporting roles for the drama. Around 5,000 actors competed for roles in the drama. ===Filming=== Shooting began on 23 August 2016 and took place in various locations including Hengdian World Studios, Beijing, Inner Mongolia, and Hangzhou. The series wrapped up filming on May 5, 2017. ==Soundtrack== ==Reception== The series received mixed responses from viewers. Many felt underwhelmed by the unaggressive heroine, who was not able to face off the villain consorts even in the second half of the drama, thus making her character design flawed and unconvincing. The drama was also criticized for its anti-climatic story and depressive tone. Critics felt that it was ironic and unbelievable for the protagonist to pursue monogamy in a highly feudalistic context. The slow pacing in the first half of the drama was pointed out, with critics believing that the screenwriters neglected to write with compact story-telling to flesh out the characters. The series has also received criticism over the age of the leading performers, with viewers saying they made unconvincing teenagers, and criticized the series' producers for not using younger actors to portray the lovestruck teens. Viewers were also divided over the lack of dubbing for Zhou Xun\u2019s 15-year-old character, as they felt that her voice was \u201ctoo raspy\u201d and \u201cmature\u201d for a teenager. However, there were also praises for the drama. Zhang Hanyue, a writer and critic, said \u201cThe show becomes more and more heart-tugging as the story goes deeper.\" Many viewers agree that Ruyi bears many characteristics of a modern female. Vogue magazine commented that the drama actually recorded \u201cthe failure of a high-end girl\u201d because what Ruyi had been pursuing was spiritual connections with her spouse; and such a pursuit represents the taste and ideal of the modern middle class. Critics agree that the drama introduces a new light to and narrative of palace dramas, deviating from the existing patterns of treacherous harem games. The drama won acclaim for its exquisite props, lavish sets, and stellar cast. === Censorship === On January 25, the Beijing Daily, an official government newspaper, criticized the program for failing to promote socialist values. Four days later, on January 29, the Chinese government cancelled the program and similar programs such as Story of Yanxi Palace.
