    "text": "Ronald A Roy (born 10 December 1956) is an American engineer, physicist, and academic, who is a leading expert in physical acoustics and its applications to ultrasonics, biomedical acoustics, acousto-optics, cavitation and bubble swarm acoustics. He is the current Head of Department of Engineering Science (Dean of Engineering) at the University of Oxford. He has served as the Statutory Professor of Mechanical Engineering since 2013 and is a Professorial Fellow at Harris Manchester College. Prior to joining Oxford, he spent 17 years as a Professor of Mechanical Engineering at Boston University where, while serving as Department Chair from 2007-2013, he oversaw the successful merger of the former Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, and the Department of Manufacturing Engineering. Professor Roy also held posts at the University of Washington\u2019s Applied Physics Laboratory (1991-1996) and the University of Mississippi\u2019s National Center for Physical Acoustics (1988-1991). Roy is a Fellow of the Acoustical Society of America, and served as the Society\u2019s Vice President in 2016-2017. In 2006-2007 he spent a year at Balliol College (University of Oxford) as the 65th George Eastman Distinguished Visiting Professor. He served on the editorial boards for the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America and IEEE-UFFC and was Editor in Chief of Acoustic Research Letters Online (now JASA-EL). He has engaged industry by way of numerous consultancies and service on directorial and advisory boards, most recently First Light Fusion Ltd., an Oxford spin-out focused on novel technology for fusion energy production. == Education == Roy completed his B.S. in Engineering Physics in 1981 at the University of Maine, where he concentrated in electrical engineering. In 1984, he earned his M.S. in Physics (with thesis) from the University of Mississippi. In 1987 he was conferred the Ph.D. in Engineering and Applied Science from Yale University, where he concentrated in mechanical engineering. == Awards and honours == ==Personal life== Roy is married to Ms Nancy S. Roy. He has 2 children and 1 grandchild. ==References== ==External links== * https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/ronald-roy/ * https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronaldaroy/ * Oxford Suzhou Centre for Advanced Research * Harris Manchester College, Oxford Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Mechanical engineers Category:Bubbles (physics) Category:Yale University alumni Category:Fellows of Harris Manchester College, Oxford ",
