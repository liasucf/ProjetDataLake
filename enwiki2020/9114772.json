    "text": "Harvey Karman Harvey Leroy Karman (April 26, 1924 \u2013 May 6, 2008) was an American psychologist and the inventor of the Karman cannula, a flexible suction cannula used for early abortion. Karman was born Harvey Walters in Clatskanie, Oregon. He took his stepfather's surname. ==Conviction== In 1955, Karman, who at the time was working towards his doctorate in psychology and who was not licensed to practice medicine, used a speculum and a nutcracker to perform an abortion on a woman in a California motel room, who subsequently died. He was convicted of providing abortion, which was illegal in California at the time.District Court of Appeal, Second District Division 3, California. People v. Karman. Cr. 5583. November 13, 1956 He served two-and-a-half years in state prison. ==\"Super coils\"== Karman also developed the \"super coil\" abortion technique, which he believed would enable lay practitioners to perform second-trimester abortions with little training or equipment. The coils were inserted into the uterus, where they caused irritation leading to the expulsion of the fetus. The first trial of the super coil method was on Bangladeshi rape victims under the sponsorship of the International Planned Parenthood Federation. These generally resulted in high rates of injury to the patient.James Taranto, \"Back-Alley Abortion Never Ended\", The Wall Street Journal, April 18, 2013 One trial of the super coil method took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on May 13 and 14, 1972. Fifteen women in their second trimester traveled from Chicago to Philadelphia, where Kermit Gosnell performed the abortions using Karman's method. A public television crew from a station in New York City filmed the procedures at Karman's invitation. Nine of the 15 had complications, three of those with major complications. ==Flexible cannula== Karman invented a soft, flexible cannula for abortions. At the time of his death in 2008, it was still in wide use around the world. ==Personal Life== Karman was the father of Janice Karman, a singer-songwriter better known as Theodore Seville of Alvin and the Chipmunks. ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:1924 births Category:2008 deaths Category:American abortion providers Category:People from Clatskanie, Oregon ",
