As of the 2000 Zambian Census, the district had a population of 28,790 people. It is rural and undeveloped, lacking roads and infrastructure. Its southern boundary is the Luapula River which divides it from DR Congo and the district lies roughly between the Chembe Ferry to Mansa road in the west and the Kapalala Ferry to Samfya road in the east. A single dirt road runs through the central part of the district from Chembe in the west following the north-west bank of the Lwela River, passing through Milenge Boma, Milambo and Lwela Mission, eventually connecting to the provincial capital, Mansa in the north- west.Terracarta/International Travel Maps, Vancouver Canada: \"Zambia, 2nd edition\", 2000.
