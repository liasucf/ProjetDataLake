    "text": "All Tomorrows: A Billion Year Chronicle of the Myriad Species and Mixed Fortunes of Man is a 2006 speculative evolution and science fiction book written and illustrated by the Turkish artist C. M. Kosemen under the pen name Nemo Ramjet. All Tomorrows explores a hypothetical future path of human evolution set from the near future to a billion years from the present, with several future human species evolving through natural means and through genetic engineering, conducted by both humans themselves and by a mysterious and superior alien species called the Qu. == Summary == Beginning in the near future, All Tomorrows chronicles the imagined entire future history of humanity over the course of the next several hundred million years. Over the course of the book, humanity experiences several triumphs and failures and diverges into several different distinct forms through evolution and genetic engineering. Following the colonization of Mars, a quick but catastrophic civil war between Earth and Mars and a large-scale colonization initiative carried out by genetically-engineered humans through the galaxy, All Tomorrows introduces a malevolent and superior alien race known as the \"Qu\", whose religion motivate them to remake the universe through genetic engineering. Following a brief war in which humanity is quickly defeated by the Qu, the aliens bioengineer the surviving humans as punishment, creating several different strange forms, many of them unintelligent, which are left to evolve on their own as the Qu leave the galaxy. Bioengineered forms of human created by the Qu range from worm-like humans and semi-sentient reptile-like forms to insect-eaters and strange modular and cell-based species. The book then proceeds to chronicle the evolution of these new 'ersatz humans', following them as they either go extinct or regain sentience as wildly different forms. Eventually, one race replaces their bodies with mechanical forms known as the Gravital, and colonize the rest of the galaxy while annihilating most life within. The final chapters of the book detail humanity's rebound as a posthuman species, and their first contact with another galaxy's life. ==See also== *Transhuman *Posthuman *Last and First Men (1930) by Olaf Stapledon \u2013 a book which similarly explores future humans and their descendants. *Man After Man (1990) by Dougal Dixon \u2013 another book which similarly explores future humans and their descendants. *All Yesterdays (2012) by John Conway, Darren Naish and Kosemen \u2013 a similarly titled book on paleoart, co-authored by Kosemen. ==References== == External links == *PDF download Category:2006 novels Category:2006 science fiction novels Category:Turkish science fiction novels Category:Human-derived fictional species Category:Hypothetical life forms Category:Books about evolution Category:Human evolution books Category:Speculative evolution Category:Novels set in the future ",
