    "text": "Ashok Das (born March 23, 1953) is an Indian American theoretical physicist, an author and award-winning teacher of Physics. He is professor of physics at University of Rochester and Adjunct professor of Physics at Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, Kolkata, India and Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar, Bhubaneswar, India. Das was born in Puri, Odisha. He received his BS (honours) in 1972 and MS in 1974 in physics from University of Delhi. He did his graduate studies in supersymmetry and supergravity at State University of New York at Stony Brook. He received his PhD (Spin 3/2 Fields and Supergravity Theories) in 1977. He was a research associate at the City College of New York, the University of Maryland and at Rutgers University before joining the University of Rochester in 1982. He was promoted to professor in 1993 and is still there. He is also the adjunct professor of physics at Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in India. Das' research is in the area of theoretical high energy physics. He works on supersymmetry and supergravity. In recent years, he has worked extensively on non-linear integrable systems, which are systems which in spite of their complicated appearance can be exactly solved. He has also been working on finite temperature field theories, generalization of the Standard Model to incorporate CP violation, and problems in quantum field theory and string theory. Although he has published widely with physicists around the world, his particularly strong collaboration with Latin American physicists is well known. In fact, he has coauthored over 100 published research papers with Brazilian physicists alone. In 2006 he was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to teach physics in Brazil.University of Rochester. Physics professor Ashok Das Receives Fulbright to Teach in Brazil He is known for his teaching and has received university and department awards for his teaching including the Department Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching, Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Rochester four times (1987, 1990, 1997 and 2006), the Edward Peck Curtis Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching (1991), and the 2006 William H. Riker University Award for Excellence in Graduate teaching. He has written numerous books and monographs on various disciplines of theoretical physics in advanced and undergraduate and graduate level, like A Path Integral Approach (World Scientific publishers), Finite Temperature Field Theory (World Scientific publishers), Integrable Models (World Scientific Lecture Notes in Physics), Lectures on Gravitation (World Scientific publishers), and Lectures on Electromagnetism: second edition (World Scientific publishers) etc. In 2002 Das was made a fellow of the American Physical Society \"For contributions in the areas of supergravity, integrable models and finite temperature field theory\".APS Fellows Archive ==References== ==External links== *personal home page *Institute Home Page of Dr. Ashok Das *papers from arXiv *Books of Ashok Das @ Amazon.com Category:University of Delhi alumni Category:Indian emigrants to the United States Category:Indian nuclear physicists Category:Living people Category:1953 births Category:21st-century American physicists Category:American male scientists of Indian descent Category:People from Puri district Category:University of Calcutta faculty Category:Indian theoretical physicists Category:American academics of Indian descent Category:Scientists from Odisha Category:20th-century Indian physicists Category:Fulbright Scholars Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society ",
