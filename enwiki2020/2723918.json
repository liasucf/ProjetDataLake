    "text": "The Trapp mixture is a specific mixture of organic solvents that allows chemical reactions to take place at very low temperatures. It is made up of THF:diethyl ether:pentane in a 4:4:1 ratio which remains liquid down to \u2212110 \u00b0C and the same solvents in a 4:1:1 ratio remain a liquid down to \u2212120 \u00b0C. This solvent system retains a low viscosity until just before freezing and it allows a lower temperature reaction than pure THF, which melts at \u2212108.4 \u00b0C. An illustrative application of Trapp solvent is the preparation of vinyllithium by lithium halogen exchange from vinyl bromide and tert- butyllithium.Eric K. Eisenhart, Bernard Bessieres \"Vinyllithium\" e-EROS Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, 2001. . The low temperatures suppress the reaction of the strongly basic organolithium reagent with the THF. == References == Category:Solvents ",
