    "text": "Mili Smith (born March 1, 1998) is a Scottish curler from Perth. She currently plays second on Team Gina Aitken. ==Career== ===Juniors=== Smith was a member of Team GB at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics, playing lead on a team skipped by Ross Whyte. The team finished 5th overall. In the mixed doubles event, Smith was paired with South Korea's Hong Yun-jeong. They lost their lone match and were eliminated. Smith joined the Sophie Jackson junior rink in 2016. In 2017, the Jackson team won the World Junior B championships, earning the right to represent Scotland at the 2017 World Junior Curling Championships. At the World Juniors, the team won the silver medal. ===Women's=== The Jackson junior team continued to play together following their junior career. In 2019, the team was invited to play in the third leg of the 2018\u201319 Curling World Cup, where they finished with a 2\u20134 record. Two weeks later, the team won the 2019 Scottish championship, defeating perennial winners Eve Muirhead in the final. Team Jackson had committed to play in the 2019 Winter Universiade (which ended just before the World Championships), so Scottish Curling initially wanted to send Muirhead to the 2019 World Women's Curling Championship as Scotland's representative. However, Team Jackson asked for a review of the rules, which stated the winner of the Scottish championship gets to represent the country at the World Championships. The review was successful, and Team Jackson went on to represent Scotland at the 2019 Worlds. They also played in the Universiade, where they finished fourth. At the 2019 World Women's Curling Championship, Team Jackson finished in 10th place with a 4\u20138 record. ==Personal life== Smith's brother is Kyle Smith who was the skip of the British team at the 2018 Winter Olympics. She attended the University of Stirling and Perth Academy with whom she won the Scottish Schools' Curling Championship in 2016. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:1998 births Category:Scottish female curlers Category:Sportspeople from Perth, Scotland Category:People educated at Perth Academy Category:Alumni of the University of Stirling Category:Competitors at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics Category:Competitors at the 2019 Winter Universiade ",
