    "text": "Before the Pleistocene Ice Age, circa two million years before present (YBP), the rivers in North, South Dakota and eastern Montana drained northeast into Canada and then into Hudson Bay.The Missouri River; John P. Bluemle; North Dakota Geological Survey; Bismarck, North Dakota; 02-Jan-2008 The Keewatin Lobe of the continental ice sheet, block the flow of water northward and impounded it along the ice front. Lakes formed, until the waters could find a new way to drain. Initially, the north flowing rivers followed the front of the glacier eastward and into a valley that passed between Garrison and Riverdale, to the Turtle Lake area, and on into Sheridan County. This is known as the preglacial McClean River. This valley became blocked by the glacier and the glacial lake identified as Lake McKenzie formed. Eventually, water level rose to crest the south ridge a point near Riverdale \u2014 at the site of the modern Garrison Dam and a diversion trench was cut. The modern Missouri River follows this pathway. ==See also== *List of prehistoric lakes *Proglacial lakes of the Missouri River Basin **Lake Cut Bank **Lake Chouteau **Lake Great Falls **Lake Musselshell **Lake Jordan. **Lake Circle **Lake Glendive **Lake McKenzie ==References== ==Bibliography== *Alden, W.
