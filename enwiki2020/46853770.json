He served in the 2nd Lancers Regiment of the Portuguese Army, where he took part in July 1837 in a failed attempt to restore the Constitutional Charter of 1826. After this failed attempt, he took refuge in Spain. He returned to Portugal when a popular revolt grew against the anticlerical government of Costa Cabral, resulting in the 23 March 1846 Revolution of Maria da Fonte, which he joined. He placed himself at the orders of General S\u00e1 da Bandeira. For his bravery in action he was awarded a knight of the Order of the Tower and Sword. However his faction lost, he collected debts of taxes he could not pay, and was expelled from the army. Soon after he became a notorious bandit. He was eventually captured in 31 March 1859, and presented to court in Porto 9 December 1859. He was sentenced to exile to the Portuguese colony of Angola where he lived for the remainder of his life. He is regarded as a Portuguese equivalent of Robin Hood.Stead, Rorison & Scafidi p.296 ==Popular culture== Z\u00e9 do Telhado's exploits rapidly became part of Portuguese folklore and have been an inspiration for a number of plays and novels. Several films have been made about him, including the 1929 silent film Jos\u00e9 do Telhado, the 1945 film Jos\u00e9 do Telhado and The Return of Jos\u00e9 do Telhado in 1949. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Mike Stead, Sean Rorison, Oscar Scafidi.
