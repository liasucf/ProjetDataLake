In 1987, Marks became CEO of what had then become Smith New Court when NM Rothschild had taken a stake. In 1995, he took over from Sir Michael Richardson as executive chairman of the firm, overseeing its sale to Merrill Lynch that same year. Marks left Merrill Lynch in 2003 to set up a new boutique investment house with other ex- Merrill Lynch colleagues. In a nod to their earlier days, the new venture was called NewSmith Capital Partners. Marks, along with co-founder Stephen Zimmermann, retired from NewSmith in 2014. Marks was also a non-executive director of the London Stock Exchange between 1994 and 2004. During that time, Merrill Lynch advised the London Stock Exchange on its ill-fated merger with Deutsche B\u00f6rse in 2000; but it stepped down from that role after that proposed transaction unravelled. Marks was appointed a CBE for services to the financial services industry in the 1999 New Year Honours list. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1941 births Category:1940s births Category:British bankers Category:Merrill (company) people ",
