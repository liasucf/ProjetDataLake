In 932, Raymond Pons with his uncle, Count Ermengol of Rouergue, and the Duke of Gascony, Sancho IV, travelled north to do homage to King Rudolph. In 936, Raymond Pons founded the monastery of Chanteuges. Between 940 and 941, he controlled Auvergne. In 944, when Hugh the Great and King Louis IV entered Aquitaine, the former met Raymond at Nevers and confirmed his titles while the Toulousain returned with the king to the royal court. Raymond Pons married a daughter of Garc\u00eda II of Gascony, who was either the same person as his known wife Gersenda or a distinct earlier wife. His successor was another Raymond, probably his son. ==Notes== ==Sources== * Category:Counts of Toulouse Category:10th-century French people ",
