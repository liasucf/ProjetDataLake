    "text": "Iris station is one of the few grade-level stations on the Southwest Ottawa Transitway. It is located on Iris Street, a collector road in western Ottawa. It is both one of the smallest Transitway stations and one of the least used, likely because it is only 400 m (1/4 mi) south of Queensway station, has no trip generators apart from residential commuters in the area, and does not have any major routes connecting at the station. Only two suburban feeder routes (routes 50 and 58) enter the Transitway at this station. ==Service== The following routes currently serve Iris: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=\"2\"|Iris Station Service |- | Rapid routes || |- | Local routes || |- | Shopper's Routes || |- | Event Routes || |} ==References== ==External links== *OC Transpo station page *OC Transpo area map Category:OC Transpo Category:Railway stations scheduled to open in 2025 ",
