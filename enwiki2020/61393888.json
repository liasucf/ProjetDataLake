    "text": "The Sydney Cricket Ground in 2016. In cricket, a ground is a location where cricket matches are played, comprising a cricket field and any associated buildings and amenities. A batsman's ground is the area behind the popping crease at their end of the pitch. ==Location for matches== In addition to the cricket field, the ground may include a pavilion, viewing areas or stadium, a car park, shops, bars, floodlights, sight screens, gates, and conference facilities. ==Parts of the pitch== A batsman's ground is the area behind the popping crease at his end of the pitch. In general, a ground belongs only to the batsman who is closest to it, and stays so until the other batsman gets closer to it. A batsman who is in one ground is considered to be the same distance away from the other ground as the distance between the grounds. Whether a batsman is in or out of his ground is defined by Law 30 of the Laws of Cricket. So long as the batsman has his body or his bat (that he is holding) touching the ground, he is in it. If a batsman is out of his ground, he may be dismissed by being run out or stumped. Batsmen can run from one ground to the other to score runs. ==References== Category:Cricket terminology ",
