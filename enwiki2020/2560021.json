Music & Media commented that \"it looks like they're having a party on the border between hip hoponia and the land of swingbeat. Shake it, don't fake it!\" Wendi Cermak from The Network Forty noted that \"here we have a song that everyone who's anyone is talking about. Currently in heavy rotation in On The Tip, this jam has picked up over 300 plays in its first week!\" Gavin Reeve from Smash Hits gave the song 5 out of 5, describing it as \"power rap\". He added that it \"will be exploding on turntables everywhere this summer.\" ==Chart performance== \"Boom! Shake the Room\" proved to be successful on the charts on several continents.
