    "text": "The Old Palace in the city of York, North Yorkshire, England, is also known as the Minster Library and is in Dean's Park. It houses York Minster\u2019s library and archives as well as the Collections Department and conservation studio. Its name is a new one and renders homage to the part of the building that used to be the chapel of the Archbishop of York, which was built in the 13th century. It was refurbished in 1810 and shortly thereafter became the home of the Minster library. Notable items held in the collection include cathedral records dating to back to 1150 and a copy of the 1631 Wicked Bible. It is a Grade I listed building. An extension was added in 1998. ==References== ==External links== * Treasures and Collections: Library, York Minster website * About the York Minster Library University of York website Category:Cathedral libraries Category:Grade I listed buildings in York Category:Libraries in North Yorkshire Category:Archives in North Yorkshire Category:Episcopal palaces in England Category:York Minster ",
