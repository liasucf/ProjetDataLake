They were a dance and vocal unit of collective girl group E-girls alongside Happiness, Dream and three other original E-girls members. The group consisted of one vocalist and four performers at the time of their disbandment. ==History== Flower was formed firstly as a performance group, with LDH recruiting four EXPG (Exile Professional Gym) students: Elina Mizuno, Manami Shigetome, Mio Nakajima, and Shuuka Fujii in 2009.
