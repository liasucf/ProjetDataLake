Germplasm are living genetic resources such as seeds or tissues that are maintained for the purpose of animal and plant breeding, preservation, and other research uses. These resources may take the form of seed collections stored in seed banks, trees growing in nurseries, animal breeding lines maintained in animal breeding programs or gene banks, etc. Germplasm collections can range from collections of wild species to elite, domesticated breeding lines that have undergone extensive human selection. Germplasm collection is important for the maintenance of biological diversity and food security. ==See also== *Animal genetic resources for food and agriculture *Conservation biology *Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources *Forest genetic resources *International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture *Plant genetic resources *Seed saving ==References== *Day-Rubenstein, K and Heisey, P. 2003.
