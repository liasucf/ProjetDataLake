It is located 65 kilometers from Tegucigalpa. ==History== The municipality of Yuscar\u00e1n was founded in 1730. After gold, silver and other precious metals were found in its foothills in 1746, Spanish mining companies flooded the area and Spaniards settled the town. Thus, Yuscar\u00e1n was constructed in the traditional colonial style of 18th-century Spain. Years of exploitation by the Spanish and later by North American mining companies followed, bringing both advantages and disadvantages. At its height, Yuscar\u00e1n was a wealthy mining town and home to some of Honduras's most influential families. It was one of the first places in Honduras to get electricity in 1898 \u2013 even before Tegucigalpa. Because of its importance, it was declared the capital of the El Para\u00edso Department in 1869. However, after the mining stopped, most of the foreigners supporting Yuscar\u00e1n abandoned the town, taking their money and possessions with them. In 1979 Yuscar\u00e1n was declared a National Monument. In its center there are more than 200 colonial homes. Natives of Yuscar\u00e1n include the painter Teresita Fort\u00edn. ==Geography== The mountain of Montserrat towers over the town to the southeast. This biological reserve is also the main source of water for the area, the same water that the villagers use to produce the Yuscaran-brand sugar cane alcohol aguardiente. ==Economy== With the decline of the mining industry came the rise of another industry, from which Yuscar\u00e1n gets its present-day fame: the fabrication of aguardiente, or guaro. The Yuscar\u00e1n factory, also called the Distileria del Buen Gusto, was founded in 1939. Category:Municipalities of the El Para\u00edso Department ",
