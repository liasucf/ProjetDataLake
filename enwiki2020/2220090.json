These defence modernization plans are formulated on a rolling basis pursuant to strategic, political and budgetary factors and pressures. Current program modernizations are anchored in the commitment to an ongoing force of 15 large frigate/destroyer sized ships (the \"first rank\" surface combatants). Modernization also encompasses other core and supporting capabilities including the nuclear-powered submarine fleet, the patrol vessel force and major support ships. As of 2020, principal modernization projects include: * 8 FREMM multipurpose frigates \u2013 Eight ships were ordered as part of the 2003\u201308 defence programming law and a further three were planned to be ordered. Two ships will be optimised for anti-aircraft warfare to replace the two cancelled ships. Construction of the first ship in this class began in 2007 and she was commissioned in 2012.Saunders (2007), pg 245. In 2015 the order was cut to 8 in order to allow the purchase of five FTI Mid-Size Frigates from 2023. As of 2020, six vessels oriented toward anti-submarine operations are in service, with two ships oriented toward air-defence warfare scheduled to follow in 2021 and 2022. * 5 FTI/FDI (Fr\u00e9gate de D\u00e9fense et d'Intervention) Mid-Size Frigates from 2023. The lead ship of the FDI class, Admiral Ronarc'h, began construction in October 2019. https://www.defensenews.com/global/europe/2019/10/25/naval-group-starts- construction-on-frances-newest-frigate/ * Six nuclear attack submarines of the Barracuda-class. The contract for the first three of these submarines was signed in 2006. The construction of the first boat in the class also began in 2006 and she is scheduled to be commissioned in 2020. The additional boats in the class will enter service through the 2020s, with the sixth submarine planned for service entry in 2030.https://www.janes.com/article/89843/france- launches-first-barracuda-ssn * The will be replaced under the FLOTLOG project by four derivatives of Italy's Vulcano-class logistic support ship, to be delivered in 2022\u201329. * Six 80-metre POM-type patrol vessels to be delivered between 2022 and 2025 to protect the exclusive economic zone of French overseas territories in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific.https://www.navalnews.com/naval-news/2020/05/nexeya-to-supply-cms-for- french-navys-pom-offshore-patrol-vessels/ The vessels were ordered in December 2019https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2019/12/06/france-orders-six-patrol- ships-equipped-with-drones-and-able-to-secure-prisoners/ and began construction in October 2020.https://www.navalnews.com/naval- news/2020/10/socarenam-begins-construction-on-french-navys-pom-opv/ * The Navy is also planning to replace its A-69 D'Estienne d'Orves-class avisos/offshore patrol vessels based in both the Atlantic and Mediterranean, and PSP Flamant- class coast guard vessels based in Cherbourg, with up to 10 ocean-going patrol vessels.
