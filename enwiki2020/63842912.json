Cir. 2017), is a United States court case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the \"individual right to carry common firearms beyond the home for self defense\u2014even in densely populated areas, even for those lacking special self-defense needs\u2014falls within the core of the Second Amendment\u2019s protections.\" This decision struck down the District of Columbia's requirement that applicants for concealed carry permits demonstrate a \"good reason,\" including a \"special need for self-protection distinguishable from the general community as supported by evidence of specific threats or previous attacks that demonstrate a special danger to the applicant's life,\" for carrying a firearm in public. == References == Category:United States Second Amendment case law Category:2017 in United States case law Category:United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit cases ",
