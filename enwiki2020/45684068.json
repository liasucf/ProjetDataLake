Born in Longview, Washington, he moved to Portland, Oregon at an early age and took up the drums and guitar as a young child. Jones' first experience in his early career was with Count Dutch, an organist from Amsterdam who hired Jones to work with him as a drummer. His first album was Unsafe which was published in 1998. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Jones moved to Portland Oregon at an early age. He began playing the drums and guitar as a young child and had some instruction from local Jazz Pianist and Educator Arletta O'hearn Jones spent his high school years soaking in the vibrant local music scene. \"I saw Dexter Gordon when I was in high school,\" recalls Jones, who sneaked in an upstairs window to soak up the music before he was caught and ejected\". Jones was inspired by Jazz musicians Saxophonist Sonny King, John Stowell and Mel Brown as well as Jim Pepper and David Friesen who would help establish his early career. One of the first such experiences was provided by an organist from Amsterdam named Count Dutch, who hired Jones to work with him on the road after hearing him play at one of Dutch's jam sessions. These tours also presented an opportunity to play extensively with Saxophonist Jim Pepper, a relationship that Jones would build on in the future. This musical period lasted until Dutch's premature death three years later. ===The 1980s: early tours and New York=== After moving to Boston in 1980 Jones graduated from the Berklee College of Music where he studied with the jazz drummer Alan Dawson.

In the early 1990s Jones continued to perform with Friesen as a member of his quartet with saxophonist John Gross and Trumpeter Gary Barone. ===1996\u20142004: The Alan Jones Sextet=== Upon returning to Portland in 1996, Jones stepped further into the roll of band leader and composer with the formation of The Alan Jones Sextet.

As a composer, Jones' work was described by music critic Jim Strupp as \"intelligent explorations on familiar jazz forms\" whose \"arrangements are interesting and accessible\". This group went on to record three albums and the sextet which emphasized Jones compositions, represented a chance for Jones to more fully explore his creative output as a composer. \"It's Jones' compositions that are primarily responsible for the excitement\" wrote Lynn Darroch of The OregonianLynn Darroch September 8, 1996 The Oregonian which is echoed in yet another review from this period \"The Sextet's sound is primarily the result of Jones' vision and courage.\"December 12, 1997 The Oregonian Arts and entertainment guide In 2001 Jones was commissioned by production designer and puppet artist Michael Curry to write the music for a large stage production called Spirits.
