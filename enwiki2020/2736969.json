    "text": "Axel Danielsson Axel Danielsson (15 December 1863, V\u00e4rmland \u2013 30 December 1899, Elsterberg, Germany) was a Swedish socialist agitator, journalist and writer. He was a prominent leader of the early Swedish Social Democratic Party. Danielsson retranslated Karl Marx's The Communist Manifesto into Swedish in 1886. Danielsson faced legal charges of blasphemy for a controversial article published in Hjalmar Branting's Social-Demokraten: the legal process culminated in the conviction of both men. Imprisoned in 1888, Danielsson celebrated the event by composing a pamphlet on the labour theory of value while serving out his sentence. During his imprisonment, his paper was managed by his fianc\u00e9e, Elma Danielsson. ==References== ==External links== *August Palm, Axel Danielsson, \"The Labor Issue\" in Social-Demokraten, September 25, 1885 (at Marxists.org) Category:1863 births Category:1899 deaths Category:Marxist journalists Category:People convicted of blasphemy Category:People from Arvika Municipality Category:Swedish journalists Category:Swedish Social Democratic Party politicians Category:19th-century journalists Category:Male journalists Category:19th-century male writers ",
