Located north of Hazelton, the community is situated within the Kispiox Indian ReserveBC Names entry \"Kispiox (community)\"BC Names entry \"Kispiox 1 (Indian Reserve)\" and is managed by the Kispiox Band Council. Kispiox is perhaps most known to outsiders for its totem poles, some of which were the subject of Emily Carr paintings in the early 20th century. Additionally, the Kispiox River has in fact been host to two world-record steelhead catches: a 33-pounder and a 36-pounder. Kispiox has remained a favorite tourist attraction for its historical village, traditional artifacts and superb fishing. The original and traditional name of Kispiox Village is \"Anspay'axw\", loosely translated from the Gitxsan language; this means \"The Hiding Place\". ==Notable people from Kispiox== Alvin Weget Elder, Hereditary Chief Gitluudahlxw *Walter Harris, O.C., Artist and Gitxsan Hereditary Chief *Delgamuukw Earl Muldoe, Gitxsan Hereditary Chief ==References== ==External links== *Gitxsan Chiefs Office *Skeena River Totem Poles *Paintings of Kispiox *Kispiox Valley Homepage *Kispiox Band Reserves Category:Gitxsan Category:Skeena Country Category:Unincorporated settlements in British Columbia ",
