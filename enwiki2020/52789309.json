    "text": "National Union Party () was a royalist party in Iran, established as an offshoot of the fraction of the same name in the Iranian Parliament. The party advocated supporting the Shah and pursuing social conservative programs, while seeking American aid, especially military aid to counterbalance the influence of Britain and Soviet Union. With a conservative background, the party spoke on advantages of socialism and renamed itself to People's Party in August 1944 to challenge Tudeh Party of Iran. ==References== Category:1944 establishments in Iran Category:Anti-communist parties Category:Centrist parties in Iran Category:Conservative parties in Iran Category:Defunct conservative parties Category:Defunct socialist parties in Iran Category:Monarchist parties in Iran Category:Political parties established in 1944 Category:Political parties in Pahlavi Iran (1941\u20131979) Category:Political parties with year of disestablishment missing ",
