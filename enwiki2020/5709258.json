    "text": "King Payne (died 1812) was a son of the Seminole high chief Cowkeeper and succeeded him as leading chief of the Seminoles upon his death in 1783. He led his people against the Spanish and Americans from Georgia and established a number of towns and villages, including Paynes Town in Paynes Prairie, both of which are named for him. Paynes Prairie is in present-day Alachua County, Florida, between Gainesville and Micanopy. U.S. Route 441 and Interstate 75 cut through the prairie. Payne was shot and killed in 1812 during a surprise raid by Colonel Daniel Newnan. He was succeeded as leading chief by his brother Bolek, called Bowlegs by the Anglo-Americans.Bergman Peters, Virginia (1979). The Florida Wars.
