Joju George, Nyla Usha, and Chemban Vinod Jose portrays the titular characters, and also features Rahul Madhav, Vijayaraghavan, and Sudhi Koppa in supporting roles. The original soundtrack of the film was composed by Jakes Bejoy. The story is loosely based on events that occurred in 1980s-1990s Thrissur. The film was released in theatres across India on 23 August 2019 to positive reviews. It turned out to be a commercial success. It was the 5th film of 2019 after Lucifer, Kumbalangi Nights, Uyare and Virus to successfully complete 100 days in theaters. == Plot == In 1965, Porinju Joy and Puthanpally Jose are best friends in their youth, and Jose tries to persuade Porinju to confess his love to Alappattu Mariyam Varghese, but a then timid Porinju could not. One day at school, a boy bullies Mariyam and a fight ensues between Porinju and the boy. Since the boy was from an influential family and Porinju was from a poor family, the teacher punishes Porinju alone, striking him repeatedly. Porinju and Jose shout at the teacher and leave the school never to come back. Mariyam openly condemns the teachers attitude in front of the class, for which she is scolded. In 1985, Porinju is known as Kattalan (hunter, literally 'man of the forest') Porinju, now a village butcher and henchman of Iype Muthalali, a wealthy and powerful man at the locality. Porinju is very close to Iype, but Iype's sons do not like their relationship. Jose is an aspiring disco-dancer and performs his moves at the annual Perunnal of the church. Mariyam is now a money lender. The three of them still keep a close relationship, even though Mariyam has now become critical of Porinju and Jose for their troublesome life. Porinju now often openly woos Mariyam, which she ignores. On a perunnal night, a procession is going on in front of Mariyam's house, Jose dances along with Mariyam. Meanwhile, Iype's grandson Prince gropes Mariyam, she humiliates him in front of public. Jose beats Prince and drives him away back to his house. As the procession advances later towards Iype's house, Prince tells his uncles about the incident and together they beat Jose. Porinju breaks up the fight, but Prince still beats him, leading to him and Jose beating up Prince and the uncles. Iype, though seeing his sons getting beaten up, ignores it. In a flashback, Mariyam was about to elope with Porinju but her father Varghese ties a rope around his neck and threatens to hang from a tree if she ran away. However, he loses his grip and accidentally hangs himself. Due to this, she lives alone without marrying Porinju. A year later, as the Perunnal nears, Prince arranges hitmen to kill Porinju and Jose. Jose gets killed while at a movie theater. For this, Porinju takes revenge and hacks Prince to death in front of the Perunnal procession. Prince's uncles arrange other hitmen to kill Porinju, but Porinju kills them and scares the uncles away, sparing them. Meanwhile, Mariyam arranges to get bail for Porinju in case he goes to court for the killings. Iype's household, including Iype himself, is mourning for Prince's death. The Perunnal procession passes by the house, and he comes out to greet them. Porinju also arrives and the two dance together happily. However, Iype takes out a hidden knife and stabs Porinju multiple times, saying that his grandson's life matters to him, but not Porinju's. The bystanders surround Iype, but Porinju snatches the knife and tells everyone to back off, and orders Iype to go back to his own house. Mariyam arrives, and he dies in her arms. In the end, Mariyam stands in front of Porinju's gravestone. The stone also has her name inscribed on it, with a vacant death date. Mariyam then watches a fight going on between some children while they are playing football, and she smiles. == Cast == *Joju George as Kattalan Porinju *Nyla Usha as Alappattu Mariyam Varghese *Chemban Vinod Jose as Puthanpally Jose *Vijayaraghavan as Iype Muthalali *Rahul Madhav as Prince *Sudhi Koppa as Puthanpally Babu *Salim Kumar as Beedi Joy (Porinju's father) *TG Ravi as Anthony (Jose's father) *Sarasa Balussery as Jose's mother *Nandhu as Varghese (Mariyam's father) *Swasika as Lizy Jose *Malavika Menon as Lilly *Parvathi T. as Susanna (Prince's mother) *Sadhika Venugopal as Alice *Remya panikkar as Sherly *I.
