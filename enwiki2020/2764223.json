In Georgetown, SH 29 is known as University Avenue and is the main east-west artery through the city, passing in front of Southwestern University, which has been on the same road since its Georgetown campus opened in 1873. An open house meeting at East View High School in Georgetown was held on September 1, 2015. The meeting's purpose was to review the upcoming plans on widening SH 29 from 2 lanes (80 ft.) to 6 lanes (160 ft.). Construction will not start until after the Summer of 2016 and will occur from Southwestern Blvd extending all the way to Hwy 95 in Circleville, TX. ==Previous routes== left SH 29 was proposed on October 8, 1917 on a route from Port O'Connor to Austin.
