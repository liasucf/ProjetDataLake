The single was released on January 28, 2003 and a music video was released around the same time. ==Music video== The music video directed by Arni and Kinski features the band playing in an enclosed space. Each band member is in an inescapable situation: Bert is buried alive in a coffin; Quinn is tied upside down in a bedroom; Branden is trapped in a hall of mirrors; and Jeph is stuck and drowning in an underground sewer. ==Track listing== US promotional single # \"Buried Myself Alive\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 3:36 == Personnel == * John Feldmann \u2013 engineer, mixed by, producer ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"center\"|Chart (2003) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|US Modern Rock Tracks[ Billboard.com - Artist Chart History - The Used] |align=\"center\"|13 |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"| Region !scope=\"col\"| Date !scope=\"col\"| Format !scope=\"col\"| Label |- ! scope=\"row\"| United States | January 28, 2003 | Modern rock radio | Reprise |- |} ==Notes== ==External links== * Category:The Used songs Category:2002 singles Category:2002 songs Category:Reprise Records singles Category:Post-hardcore songs Category:Songs written by Quinn Allman Category:Songs written by Jeph Howard Category:Songs written by Bert McCracken Category:Song recordings produced by John Feldmann Category:Songs written by Branden Steineckert ",
