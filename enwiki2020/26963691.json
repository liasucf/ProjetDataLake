A single SPAD S.A-1 was converted with a small circular section pulpit nacelle mounting a mock-up of a fixed forward-firing machine-gun and smaller wings. At least one SPAD S.A-2 was converted to carry three fixed forward-firing machine-guns by the Imperial Russian Air Service in a similar fashion to the S.G. ==Specifications (S.G) == ==References== G2 Category:Aircraft first flown in 1915 Category:1910s French fighter aircraft Category:Biplanes Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft ",
