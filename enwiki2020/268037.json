At approximately , it is the largest lake in Finland, and the fourth largest natural freshwater lake in Europe. ==History== It was formed by glacial melting at the end of the Ice Age. Major towns on the lakeshore include Lappeenranta, Imatra, Savonlinna, Mikkeli, Varkaus, and Joensuu. About 6000 years ago, ancient Lake Saimaa, estimated to cover nearly at the time, was abruptly discharged through a new outlet. The event created thousands of square kilometres of new residual wetlands.Markku Oinonen et al. (2014) Event reconstruction through Bayesian chronology: Massive mid-Holocene lake-burst triggered large-scale ecological and cultural change; url=http://hol.sagepub.com/content/24/11/1419.abstract Following this event, the region saw a population maximum in the decades following only to later return to an ecological development towards old boreal conifer forests which saw a decline in population. ==Topography== The Vuoksi River flows from Saimaa to Lake Ladoga. Most of the lake is spotted with islands, and narrow canals divide the lake in many parts, each having their own names (major basins include Suur-Saimaa, Orivesi, Puruvesi, Haukivesi, Y\u00f6vesi, Pihlajavesi, and Pyh\u00e4selk\u00e4). Thus, Saimaa exhibits all major types of lake in Finland at different levels of eutrophication.Making of J\u00e4rven tarina. Hietasaari island on Lake Saimaa Olavinlinna fortress on Lake Saimaa In places in the Saimaa basin (an area larger than the lake), \"there is more shoreline here per unit of area than anywhere else in the world, the total length being nearly . The number of islands in the region, 14,000, also shows what a maze of detail the system is.\" Karelian Country Cottages, Lake Saimaa ==Natural resources== Pusa hispida saimensis, also known as Saimaa Ringed Seal, in 1956. An endangered freshwater seal, the Saimaa Ringed Seal, lives only at Saimaa. Another of the lake's endangered species is the Saimaa salmon. Due to its rich, easily accessible asbestos deposits, the shores of the lake are the most probable origin of asbestos-ceramic, a type of pottery made between c. 1900 BC \u2013 200 AD. The areas around Saimaa lake are very popular location for summer cabins as well as lake cruises. ==Saimaa canal== The Saimaa Canal from Lauritsala, Lappeenranta to Vyborg connects Saimaa to the Gulf of Finland. Other canals connect Saimaa to smaller lakes in Eastern Finland and form a network of waterways. These waterways are mainly used to transport wood, minerals, metals, pulp and other cargo, but tourists also use the waterways.

He wrote to his divorced wife Ekaterina, writing \"it's beautiful here, like a fairy tale\".Figes, Orlando: A People's Tragedy: The Russian Revolution 1891\u20131924.
