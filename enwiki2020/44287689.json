    "text": "The St. Charles Battle Site is the area near St. Charles, Arkansas where the Battle of Saint Charles took place on June 17, 1862, during the American Civil War. The battle was a land and naval engagement, in which Union gunboats engaged Confederate shore batteries and gunboats in a firefight, while infantry troops were landed on the western bank of the White River and eventually drove the Confederate forces from their shore batteries. The battle site occupies about on the west bank the River southeast of Saint Charles. There are no signs left of the Confederate batteries, and the area is an undeveloped swampland, as it was in 1862. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The battle is also commemorated by a monument in Saint Charles. ==See also== *Arkansas in the American Civil War *National Register of Historic Places listings in Arkansas County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Geography of Arkansas County, Arkansas Category:Battlefields of the Western Theater of the American Civil War Category:Arkansas in the American Civil War Category:American Civil War on the National Register of Historic Places Category:National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas County, Arkansas Category:Conflict sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas ",
