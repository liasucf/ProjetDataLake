    "text": "Sayyid Husain Khing Sawar or Hussein Khangsawar, also known as Miran Sahib, was the garrison commander (qiladar) of Taragarh Fort in Ajmer. When Muhammad of Ghor looted Ajmer, he appointed Husain as his chief tax collector. His job was to collect massive taxes from \"Kafirs\" (non muslims). Husain was killed in 1202 when Rajput warriors reconquered their fort and saved their people from barbaric Islamic invaders. A shrine was erected there in his honour, near Mu'in ad-Din Chishti's shrine. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing Category:History of Ajmer Category:1202 deaths ",
