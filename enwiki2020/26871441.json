(Original description) The subulate shell has a pale flesh colour. It is polished and shining. It contains 15 whorls. These are sculptured with closely set longitudinal costae, crossed near the upper end by a slight spiral groove, thus forming an infra- sutural crenate band. The interstices between the costae are spirally punctate. The punctations of the upper row are coarser than the rest. The small aperture is narrow. The columella descends rather obliquely. The peristome is simple. The base of the shell is marked with three revolving punctate grooves.Preston, H. B. \"Descriptions of new species of land, marine and freshwater shells from the Andaman Islands.\" Records of the Indian Museum 2.2 (1908): 187\u2013210 (described as Terebra carnicolor) ==Distribution== This marine species occurs in the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean off Madagascar, Aldabra and the Mascarene Basin; also off the Andaman Islands and Fiji. ==References== * Bratcher T. & Cernohorsky W.O.
