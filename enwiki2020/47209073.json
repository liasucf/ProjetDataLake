The site's critical consensus reads: \"The Shannara Chronicles wears its influences heavily on its sleeve and needs to find surer footing before it can tap its true potential, but it still might suffice for viewers in search of a teen-friendly Game of Thrones.\" The second season received a 100% approval rating based on five reviews. Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times wrote: \"So give this reasonably absorbing series a little credit, even though it often seems to be merely reworking various fantasy formulas. It moves quickly and does a nice job of weaving together two story lines involving an elfin world that is threatened when a giant tree, known as the Ellcrys, begins to die.\" Maureen Ryan of Variety wrote: \"Sure, Shannara, which harks back to the golden age of syndicated genre fare, is a standard quest journey in which there are trolls, gnomes, living trees and magic books, and characters say things like, 'If Allanon is here, there are dark days ahead.' But there's conviction in the show's execution.\" ===Ratings=== ====Season 1 (2016)==== ====Season 2 (2017)==== ===Accolades=== The series was nominated for a Saturn Award for \"Best Fantasy TV Series\" for the 2015\u20132016 season. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2010s American teen drama television series Category:2016 American television series debuts Category:2017 American television series endings Category:American fantasy television series Category:English-language television shows Category:MTV original programming Category:Spike (TV network) original programming Category:Post-apocalyptic television series Category:Television shows based on American novels Category:Television series set in the 6th millennium Category:Television shows set in San Francisco Category:Television shows filmed in New Zealand Category:Shannara Category:High fantasy television series ",
