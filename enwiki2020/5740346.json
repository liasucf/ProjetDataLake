    "text": "The Electric Indian was a studio group assembled and produced by the Dovells lead singer Len Barry which included Daryl Hall of Hall & Oates fame. Barry had an interest in Native American history, possibly inspired by watching The Lone Ranger TV series as a child. The song \"Keem-O-Sabe\" was titled after the word (defined as faithful friend or trusty scout) that The Lone Ranger and his friend Tonto used to refer to each other. The song was released first on the small Marmaduke Inc. label where it gained regional airplay around Philadelphia. It was soon picked up for national release on the United Artists label in 1969 and reached the U.S. Top 20 in the Billboard Hot 100. It also made #6 on Billboard's Easy Listening survey, and crossed to the R&B; chart. In Canada, the song reached #19 on the RPM Magazine top singles charts. \"Keem- O-Sabe\" was written by Barry's mother, Bernice Borisoff, and Swan Records owner Bernie Binnick. The tune is built around an old instrumental riff often used in old western movies when Indians were approaching, and includes hints of The Lone Ranger theme which itself is the \"William Tell Overture\" by Gioachino Rossini. An album of similar material was recorded, and the follow- up, an Indian style cover version of \"Land of a Thousand Dances,\" (#95, 1969) charted. No future releases were forthcoming. Many of the tracks on the LP were engineered by Joseph Tarsia and recorded at his Philadelphia-based Sigma Sound Studio, with many of the musicians later becoming members of the studio's notable in-house group, MFSB which had the 1974 hit song \"T.S.O.P.\" ==References== Category:American rock music groups ",
