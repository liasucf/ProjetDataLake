The tournament was a multi-stage competition, consisting of a round-robin group stage and followed by a single elimination knockout round, starting with the semi-finals and ending with the gold medal match, with all matches hosted on Katara Beach. Brazil claimed the gold medal after winning the final 9\u20133 against Russia who settled for silver. Meanwhile, Iran defeated Italy in the bronze medal match to claim the remaining place on the podium. ==Competition schedule== The tournament began on 11 October, one day before the opening ceremony, and ended on the final day of the Games, 16 October.
