    "text": "The National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) (Filipino: Pambansang Demokratikong Prente ng Pilipinas (PDPP)) is a coalition of revolutionary social and economic justice organizations, agricultural unions, trade unions, indigenous rights groups, leftist political parties, and other related groups in the Philippines. It belongs to the much broader National Democracy Movement and the CPP-NPA-NDF insurgency. == History == Prior to the creation of the NDF, many of its affiliated organizations had already existed, including the Kabataang Makabayan and the Malayang Kilusan ng Bagong Kababaihan, which united many members of the youth, women, peasants and workers for a revolutionary national democratic cause. In 1971, the Preparatory Commission for the National Democratic Front was formed, under the initiative of the Communist Party of the Philippines, in order to bring together all the various revolutionary organizations that had been forced underground by the Martial Law. The Preparatory Commission formally published a Ten Point Program on April 24, 1973, marking the founding of the NDF as a \"revolutionary united front organization of the Filipino people fighting for national freedom and for the democratic rights of the people.\" Ever since its founding, the NDF has served as the political wing of the CPP, building diplomatic relations abroad and representing it in peace negotiations. Its primary work includes expanding political work in the cities through workers' strikes, student boycotts and protests, and actively aiding the revolution in the countryside. The NDF has continued its work among the various sectors of Filipino society, often rejecting and protesting against various laws and development programs that they deem as aggravating the \"basic problems of the masses\" including CARP, Philippines 2000, Visiting Forces Agreement and counter-insurgency programs. ==Objectives== The NDFP adopted the following 12-point program to bring about \"national liberation and democracy [that] seeks to provide a broad basis of unity for all social classes, sectors, groups and individual Filipinos here and abroad desirous of genuine national freedom and democracy, lasting peace and a progressive Philippines.\": #Unite the people for the overthrow of the semi-colonial and semi-feudal system through a people's war and for the completion of the national democratic revolution. #Establish a people's democratic republic and a democratic coalition government. #Build the people's revolutionary army and the people's defense system. #Uphold and promote the people's democratic rights. #Terminate all unequal relations with the United States and other foreign entities. #Implement genuine agrarian reform, promote agricultural cooperation, raise rural production and employment through the modernization of agriculture and rural industrialization and ensure agricultural sustainability. #Break the combined dominance of the U.S. and other imperialists, big compradors and landlords over the economy.
