    "text": "BCAFL Logo The British Collegiate American Football League (BCAFL) was an American football league consisting of players from various colleges and universities in the United Kingdom. In 2007 it was succeeded by the British Universities American Football League. The league officially began in the 1985\u20131986 season with 4 teams, with founder members Newcastle Skolars, led by Mike Rea, and Hull University, and celebrated its 20th anniversary with 37 teams competing the 2005\u20132006 campaign. The final season was contested by 39 teams, with some teams consisting of players from more than one institution. Throughout its existence, BCAFL was plagued by the fact that some of its teams played at a vastly higher skill level than others. During its final years the British Student American Football Association (BSAFA), who was responsible for the operations of BCAFL, made great strides towards competitive balance; increasing the skill level on the field and expanding the game throughout the UK. However, after extended public disagreements with the policies of the governing body of the British American Football Association (BAFA), the BAFA dissolved the BSAFA with all the teams being forced to transfer to the new British university American Football League (BUAFL). ==Rules== BCAFL largely followed the rules of American college football (though there were restrictions on the number of North American players allowed on the field at any one time). As opposed to the conference and \"bowl game\" set-up used in American college football BCAFL divided itself into two conferences and used a season-ending playoff system, similar to the NFL (however, below the Bowl Subdivision of Division I, the NCAA uses a season-ending playoff system to crown national champions). At the end of an 8-game regular season, 16 teams would advance to the playoffs (the playoffs expanded from 12 to 16 teams in the 2004\u20132005 season), with the 4 division champions and 4 \"wild card\" teams from each conference participating. The playoffs culminated with a championship game, called the \"College Bowl\" which features the champions of the Northern and Southern Conferences. ==Teams== ===Full Member records=== Teams are listed within their divisions, with their all-time regular season record listed (records include ONLY official BCAFL regular season games through the 2006\u201307 season, as recorded in the BCAFL official all-time records). {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Team !Conference !Division !W !L !T !Winning Pct. !Division Champ. !Conference Champ. !BCAFL Champ. |- |Caledonian Roughriders |Northern |Scottish |10 |21 |1 |.328 |0 |0 |0 |- |Edinburgh Timberwolves |Northern |Scottish |10 |14 |0 |.417 |0 |0 |0 |- |Glasgow Tigers |Northern |Scottish |92 |55 |13 |.616 |9 |3 |1 |- |Paisley Pyros |Northern |Scottish |20 |60 |6 |.267 |0 |0 |0 |- |Stirling Clansmen |Northern |Scottish |67 |70 |15 |.484 |5 |1 |1 |- |Leeds Celtics |Northern |Eastern |97 |26 |10 |.767 |7 |3 |1 |- |Newcastle Raiders |Northern |Eastern |65 |80 |8 |.451 |1 |1 |0 |- |Sunderland Kings |Northern |Eastern |19 |72 |5 |.224 |0 |0 |0 |- |UT Cougars |Northern |Eastern |74 |76 |13 |.494 |6 |3 |2 |- |UCH Sharks |Northern |Western |78 |72 |13 |.518 |5 |3 |4 |- |Lancaster Bombers |Northern |Western |62 |59 |7 |.512 |2 |0 |0 |- |Lincoln Colonials |Northern |Western |0 |7 |1 |.063 |0 |0 |0 |- |Sheffield Sabres |Northern |Western |46 |62 |10 |.432 |1 |0 |0 |- |Sheffield Hallam Warriors |Northern |Western |13 |16 |3 |.453 |1 |0 |0 |- |Derby Braves |Northern |Central |31 |52 |3 |.378 |0 |0 |0 |- |UEA Pirates |Northern |Central |77 |75 |5 |.506 |2 |1 |0 |- |Leicester Longhorns |Northern |Central |67 |87 |9 |.439 |1 |2 |0 |- |Loughborough Aces |Northern |Central |121 |27 |2 |.813 |12 |6 |3 |- |Nottingham Outlaws |Northern |Central |44 |43 |1 |.506 |1 |0 |0 |- |Tarannau Aberystwyth |Southern |Central |52 |64 |4 |.450 |3 |1 |0 |- |Birmingham Lions |Southern |Central |93 |41 |10 |.681 |7 |2 |1 |- |Oxford Cavaliers |Southern |Central |65 |58 |5 |.527 |4 |2 |1 |- |Staffordshire Stallions |Southern |Central |63 |47 |10 |.567 |3 |1 |0 |- |Warwick Wolves |Southern |Central |52 |81 |9 |.398 |1 |0 |0 |- |ARU Phantoms |Southern |Eastern |2 |30 |0 |.063 |0 |0 |0 |- |Essex Blades |Southern |Eastern |19 |25 |3 |.436 |1 |0 |0 |- |Greenwich Mariners |Southern |Eastern |13 |10 |0 |.565 |1 |0 |0 |- |Hertfordshire Hurricanes |Southern |Eastern |72 |26 |6 |.721 |7 |5 |4 |- |Kent Falcons |Southern |Eastern |29 |60 |0 |.326 |0 |0 |0 |- |Royal Holloway Vikings |Southern |Eastern |4 |12 |0 |.250 |0 |0 |0 |- |Bath Killer Bees |Southern |Western |61 |48 |11 |.554 |3 |0 |0 |- |Bristol Bullets |Southern |Western |46 |61 |13 |.438 |2 |1 |1 |- |Cardiff Cobras |Southern |Western |103 |41 |14 |.696 |11 |2 |1 |- |Plymouth Blitz |Southern |Western |14 |32 |2 |.313 |0 |0 |0 |- |Brighton Tsunami |Southern |Southern |14 |16 |2 |.469 |0 |0 |0 |- |Portsmouth Destroyers |Southern |Southern |1 |6 |1 |.188 |0 |0 |0 |- |Reading Knights |Southern |Southern |27 |121 |8 |.199 |0 |0 |0 |- |Southampton Stags |Southern |Southern |89 |44 |11 |.656 |5 |3 |3 |- |Surrey Stingers |Southern |Southern |50 |49 |5 |.505 |2 |0 |0 |} ===Associate members=== * Bristol Barracuda 2007/8 * Durham Saints 2007/8 ===Defunct Teams=== * Aberdeen Steamroller (0\u20138\u20130, .000) * Aston Rhinos (10\u201343\u20133, .205) * Cambridge Pythons (38\u201316\u20132, .696) * Dundee Bluedevils (1\u20137\u20130, .125) * Manchester MPs (3\u201312\u20132, .235) * Strathclyde Hawks (64\u201341\u201315, .596) ==BCAFL/College Bowl History== * 1986 \u2013 Hull Sharks (5\u20130) * 1987 \u2013 College Bowl I: Hull Sharks def.
