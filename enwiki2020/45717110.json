    "text": "The Blackburn House is a historic house at Main and College Streets in Canehill, Arkansas. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a cross- gable hip roof and a stone foundation. The house has the asymmetrical massing and decorative wood shingle siding in its gables that are characteristic of Queen Anne architecture, and shed-roof porch extending across its main facade, supported by box columns. The porch has a gabled pediment above the stairs leading to the main entrance, and a symmetry more typical of the Colonial Revival. Built in 1898 by a local doctor, this house is a well-preserved local example of this transitional form. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1898 Category:Houses in Washington County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Washington County, Arkansas ",
