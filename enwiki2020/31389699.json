    "text": "The discography of the Creatures, an English alternative band, consists of four studio albums, three live albums, three compilation albums, two extended plays and eight singles. This list does not include material recorded by band members with Siouxsie and the Banshees or solo work by Siouxsie Sioux. This page lists albums, singles and compilations by the Creatures, alongside their chart positions and release dates in the United Kingdom. Most of their back catalogue has long been out of print physically. Only the CD compilation A Bestiary Of (which reunites all their early material recorded between 1981 and 1983) is still available in record stores. Their second album Boomerang is available on iTunes and other media players whereas their third and fourth albums released on Sioux Records are not available on any official digital platform except Spotify.
