    "text": "Caesarean text-type is the term proposed by certain scholars to denote a consistent pattern of variant readings that is claimed to be apparent in certain Koine Greek manuscripts of the four Gospels, but which is not found in any of the other commonly recognized New Testament text-types; the Byzantine text-type, the Western text-type and the Alexandrian text-type. In particular a common text-type has been proposed to be found: in the ninth/tenth century Codex Koridethi; in Codex Basilensis A. N. IV. 2 (a Greek manuscript of the Gospels used, sparingly, by Erasmus in his 1516 printed Koine New Testament); and in those Gospel quotations found in the third century works of Origen, which were written after he had settled in Caesarea.Kirsopp Lake, Codex 1 of the Gospels and its Allies (TS 7; Cambridge: UP, 1902); B. H. Streeter, The Four Gospels: A Study of Origins Treating of the Manuscript Tradition, Sources, Authorship, & Dates (1st ed., 1924; 2d ed., London: Macmillan, 1926). The early translations of the Gospels in Armenian and Georgian also appear to witness to many of the proposed characteristic Caesarean readings, as do the small group of minuscule manuscripts classed as Family 1 and Family 13. == Description == A particularly distinctive common reading of the proposed text- type is in Matthew 27:16-17, where the bandit released by Pontius Pilate instead of Jesus is named as \"Jesus Barabbas\" rather than \u2014 with all other surviving witnesses \u2014 just \"Barabbas\". Origen notes particularly that the form \"Jesus Barabbas\" was common in manuscripts in Caesarea, whereas he had not found this reading in his previous residence in Alexandria. Otherwise the Caesarean readings have a mildly paraphrastic tendency that seems to place them between the more concise Alexandrian, and the more expansive Western text-types. None of the surviving Caesarean manuscripts is claimed to witness a pure type of text, as all appear to have been to some degree assimilated with readings from the Byzantine text-type. Some writers have questioned the validity of this grouping, claiming that the classification is the result of poor research. Insofar as the Caesarean text-type does exist (in Matt, Luke and John is not well defined), then it does so only in the Gospels. The proposed Caesarean witnesses do not appear to have any common distinctive readings in the rest of the New Testament. Some of the Caesarean manuscripts have the so-called Jerusalem Colophon. The Caesarean text-type was discovered and named by Burnett Hillman Streeter in 1924.B.H. Streeter, The Four Gospels: A Study of Origins Treating of the Manuscript Tradition, Sources, Authorship, & Dates (1st ed., 1924; 2d ed., London: Macmillan, 1926). According to some scholars, it is only a hypothetical text-type (Aland).Kurt Aland, and Barbara Aland, \"The Text of the New Testament: An Introduction to the Critical Editions and to the Theory and Practice of Modern Textual Criticism\", transl. Erroll F. Rhodes, William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 1995, p. 336. There are no pure Caesarean manuscripts. In many cases, it is difficult to decide the original reading of the group, for instance in Mark 1:16:Lake K., Codex 1 of the Gospels and its Allies, Texts and Studies, volume vii, Cambridge, 1902, p. LIII. : \u2014 f13 565 : \u2014 f1 : \u2014 700 : \u2014 28 == Classification == H. von Soden \u2014 Iota (Jerusalem) (I), in part (most strong \"Caesarean\" witnesses are found in Soden's I\u03b1 group, with family 1 being his I\u03b7 and family 13 being I\u03b9). Kirsopp Lake, an outstanding British textual critic, developed the hypothesis of the relationship between f1, f13, \u0398, 565, 700, and 28.K. Lake and R. P. Lake, The Text of the Gospels and the Koridethi Codex, HTR 16 (1923), pp. 267-286. Streeter carried Lake's work another step forward by pointing to Caesarea as the original location of the family.Frederik Wisse, The Profile Method for Classifying and Evaluating Manuscripts Evidence Studies and Documents vol. 44, Wm.
