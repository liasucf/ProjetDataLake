The sister of famed historian of Nazism George Mosse, she, along with fellow psychiatrist Fredric Wertham, helped to form the Lafargue Clinic in Harlem, New York.

She attended medical school at the University of Basel, and emigrated to the United States in 1939. == Work in Harlem == In 1946, Mosse helped to found the Lafargue Clinic, a progressive, low-cost mental hospital for residents of Harlem.
