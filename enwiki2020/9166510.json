    "text": "The Mungo ESK (Einsatzfahrzeug Spezialisierte Kr\u00e4fte) is an air-transportable, armoured multirole transport vehicle of the German Army for its Airmobile Operations Division and Division Special Operations. The Mungo is based on the Multicar M30/FUMO and is produced by Krauss-Maffei Wegmann. Delivery of 396 Mungos to the German Army began in 2005. In 2007 all Mungos deployed to the ISAF mission were withdrawn, because the Mungo proved incapable of withstanding the harsh terrain and road conditions of Afghanistan. However, in 2008 the problems were fixed and Mungos were redeployed in Afghanistan. On May, 19th 2009 the German Army ordered a prototype and 25 serial NBC (Nuclear, Biological and Chemical) reconnaissance versions of the Mungo with increased internal volume. ==See also== * AGF (Light infantry vehicle) * Rheinmetall MAN Military Vehicles YAK * ATF Dingo * LAPV Enok ==References== ==External links== *Mungo on the homepage of the manufacturer KMW *Mungo on the homepage of the German Army Category:Military trucks Category:Post\u2013Cold War military vehicles of Germany Category:Armoured personnel carriers Category:Military vehicles introduced in the 2000s Category:Rheinmetall ",
