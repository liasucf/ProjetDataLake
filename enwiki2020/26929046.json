    "text": "Salt hillock in C\u00e1huil C\u00e1huil (, ) is a Chilean village located south of Pichilemu, in the outfall of Nilahue Lake, in the O'Higgins Region. The economy is based on the production of coastal salt, oysters, and choros. C\u00e1huil Lagoon is a place suitable for fishing, swimming, and boat travel. == Salt deposits == The production of salt is a very old practice in the area. It is known that the indigenous people extracted salt in a very rudimentary way. Production has increased using modern methods. As of 1978, more than a 60% of the population of C\u00e1huil lives on the proceeds of salt production, in production not related to industrial enterprises. To promote tourism in C\u00e1huil, the Municipality of Pichilemu created the \"Salt Route\", that takes the tourists to places where salt is produced. This tour starts in Pichilemu and includes C\u00e1huil, Barrancas, La Villa, El Bronce, La Palmilla, and La Plaza. Along the route are two rural ranches, \"Oro Blanco\" and \"El Bronce\". == Fauna == At least 46 birds species are found in the C\u00e1huil zone, many of them in danger of extinction. Some of them are the coscoroba swan, brown-hooded gull, and white-necked heron. The area hosts at least seven duck species. ==See also== * List of towns in Chile == External links == * Los Trazados de la Sal - Salinas de Cahuil, VI Regi\u00f3n Category:Populated places in Pichilemu ",
