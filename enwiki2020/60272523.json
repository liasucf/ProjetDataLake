    "text": "The Cape May Peninsula AVA is an American Viticultural Area located in extreme southern New Jersey. The wine appellation includes most of Cape May county and a small portion of Cumberland county. The region is characterized by well- drained sandy or sandy loam soils of low to moderate fertility, and a relatively long growing season. The climate is strongly moderated by the influence of the Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay. The region is in hardiness zones 6b, 7a, and 7b. The AVA is entirely contained within the larger Outer Coastal Plain AVA, but is distinguished from it primarily by a more moderate temperature, providing for a longer growing season. == Boundary == The Federal Register describes the Cape May Peninsula AVA as having the following boundaries: > (1) The beginning point is on the Ocean City quadrangle at the intersection > of the 10-foot elevation contour and the Garden State Parkway, on the > southern shore of Great Egg Harbor, northwest of Golders Point.
