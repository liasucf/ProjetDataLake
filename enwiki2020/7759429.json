    "text": "Rouge Herald of Arms Extraordinary () is the title of one of the officers of arms at the Canadian Heraldic Authority in Ottawa. Herald Extraordinary is an honorary position reserved for people who have made notable contributions to Canadian heraldry. Like the other heralds at the Authority, the name is derived from the Canadian river of the same name. The colour of the herald's badge is appropriately red (rouge), and the five fleur-de-lis symbolize the French voyageurs who used the river to travel into the interior of what is now Ontario. The fleur-de-lis also form a stylized white central rose, indicative of \"York\", the old name of Toronto. The office was created on 27 October 2006.Press Release from the Office of the Governor General of Canada ==Holders of the office== *2006-present: Roger Alexander Lindsay ==See also== *Royal Heraldry Society of Canada ==References== ==External links== *Canadian Heraldic Authority * Royal Heraldry Society of Canada Category:Offices of arms Category:Canadian Heraldic Authority ",
