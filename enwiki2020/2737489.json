    "text": "Warrington's Own Buses is a municipal bus company which operates a network of services within the Borough of Warrington and the surrounding area, including Altrincham, Leigh, Earlestown, Wigan, Halton and Northwich. The company previously traded as Warrington Borough Transport up until 2006 and as Network Warrington between 2006 and 2018. With the launch of the 'Cheshire Cats' brand in 2018 the company rebanded as Warrington's Own Buses. ==History== Warrington Corporation Tramways started operating a network of five radial tramways from the town centre in 1902, with the first motor bus service starting in 1913. Buses replaced trams on routes starting in 1931, with the infrastructure starting to require major renewal which could not be justified economically. The last tram operated in 1935. Services expanded rapidly after the Second World War as new housing estates grew in areas such as Orford and Great Sankey. The conversion of bus routes with conductors into one-man operated services began in 1965. Warrington was designated as a new town in 1968, which led to new housing estates planned in the Birchwood and Westbrook areas of town. As such, Warrington Borough Council Transport Department started operating new services to these new developments as they started to grow in the 1970s and beyond. The department also began operating new services jointly with Crosville upon the split of the old Stockport based North Western Road Car Company in 1972. To comply with the Transport Act 1985, Warrington Borough Transport was incorporated in 1986. The company's mission was that if money could be made by operating services deemed uneconomic by other operators, then it should assume operation. This policy led to an increase in services operated as other bus companies who ran into the area decided to concentrate on their own core areas. A Marshall C37 bodied Dennis Dart new in 1995 Competition from other operators flared up in 1995, with Warrington Goldlines duplicating the vast majority of the existing bus network following Lancashire Travel's decision to stop competing after a few months. In retaliation to North Western, Warrington Borough Transport commenced operating services to places such as Wigan, St Helens, Widnes, Runcorn, Chester and Liverpool, as well as commencing a local minibus service in Northwich. After eighteen months of intense competition, both companies agreed a truce. Warrington Borough Transport kept routes to Prescot and St Helens, whilst giving up operations in the Birchwood area of town, which were operated North Western. North Western was rebranded as Arriva North West in 1997. In February 2002, Arriva North West decided to close its depot in Warrington and transferred the interurban routes to depots in Liverpool and St Helens. Warrington Borough Transport resumed operation of town routes to Birchwood, Cinnamon Brow and Woolston, but transferred the St Helens route back to Arriva. Further withdrawals by Arriva led to the takeover of routes to Leigh in 2005 and Altrincham in 2006. Throughout the mid-late 2000s, Warrington Borough Transport made several cuts to their longer distance services as part of preparations for their eventual rebrand. In 2006, the company was rebranded and became known as Network Warrington, with a new livery designed by Samantha Beeley.https://web.archive.org/web/20061007220806/http://www.warringtonboroughtransport.co.uk/new/timetables.htmhttps://web.archive.org/web/20061206040615/http://www.warringtonboroughtransport.co.uk/new/timetables.htmhttp://www.networkwarrington.co.uk/assets/library/original/pdf/3/future- timetable-5-6-35-47--- september-2015_web.f54ab2443c9033e4eaa57f9cff682eaf.1439555183.pdf However, this did lead to a streamlining of other routes, both long distance and in the town centre, which were operated with increased frequencies to shorten journey times.https://web.archive.org/web/20061007220855/http://www.warringtonboroughtransport.co.uk/new/tables_pdf/45%20TT.pdfhttps://web.archive.org/web/20061007220932/http://www.warringtonboroughtransport.co.uk/new/tables_pdf/45%20Map.pdfhttps://web.archive.org/web/20060524045909/http://www.warringtonboroughtransport.co.uk/new/tables_pdf/43%20TT%20Summary.pdf Budget cuts by Warrington Borough Council resulted in the network of Sunday evening services being completely withdrawn from 27 June 2010, as these socially necessary services no longer receive any subsidy from the council. The company continues to operate a service during daytime shopping hours on a commercial basis. In April 2018, the company was rebranded as Warrington's Own Buses. ==Routes== Warrington's Own Buses operate a number of routes across the Warrington borough, Cheshire and Greater Manchester. ==Ticket types== Warrington's Own Buses offer a wide range of ticket options for passengers, including singles, returns and all day tickets.
