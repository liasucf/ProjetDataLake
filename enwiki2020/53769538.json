It was here that Stanis\u0142aw August learnt he was elected monarch of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The palace changed hands several times, in 1843 it became property of Seweryn Uruski, the marshal of the nobility of the Warsaw governorate, a secret counselor, and the mayor of the Imperial Court. Uruski chose to demolish the palace to make way for a new building. The project was commissioned by architect Andrzej Go\u0142o\u0144ski, who gave the new building its Renaissance architectural style. The construction work lasted from 1844 to 1847. In the years 1893-1895 the palace was renovated under the direction of J\u00f3zef Huss, who built a new outhouse to its north. The palace was burned down during the Warsaw Uprising. After 1947, the palace became property of the University of Warsaw. The rebuilt palace (1948-1951) was modified, namely without an entrance gate to its north. Presently, the palace houses the Faculty of Geography and Regional Studies of the University of Warsaw.
