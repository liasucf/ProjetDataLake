    "text": "Lauren Grandcolas (August 31, 1963 \u2013 September 11, 2001) was one of the passengers on board United Airlines Flight 93 on September 11, 2001, who made calls, providing information about the hijacking of the flight as part of the September 11 attacks. She made a call to her husband on an airphone, and left a message telling him of the \"problem with the plane\". ==Biography== Grandcolas (n\u00e9e Catuzzi) was born on August 31, 1963, in Bloomington, Indiana. She attended Stratford High School in Houston, Texas, and later the University of Texas at Austin where she was a member of Alpha Delta Pi. She met her husband, Jack Grandcolas, at the university. She worked for a law firm and for PricewaterhouseCoopers before becoming a marketing expert for Good Housekeeping. Grandcolas was also writing a book on self-help for women, covering finance and other topics. At the time of her death, a publisher was interested in her book. Three weeks prior to the September 11 attacks, she left her job at Good Housekeeping in order to dedicate herself to the book. Her sisters worked together with the publisher, Chronicle Books, to get the book published after her death. The book, entitled You Can Do It!: The Merit Badge Handbook for Grown-Up Girls, was published on April 10, 2005. It provides a guide, modeled on the Girl Scouts' merit badge system, covering skills, such as negotiations, and life goals, such as horseback riding, scuba diving, and completing a triathlon. Book excerpts have appeared in Parade, Glamour, Shape, Good Housekeeping, and other magazines. Grandcolas's sisters appeared on Good Morning America on April 19, 2005, to discuss the book. The proceeds from sales of the book go to the Lauren Catuzzi Grandcolas Foundation, which contributes funds to a college scholarship program, and charitable organizations across the United States. Grandcolas was also involved with charitable organizations, including the United Way, March of Dimes, Project Open Hand, Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, Breast Cancer Awareness, and Glide Memorial. She was also a certified emergency medical technician. ==September 11 attacks== {|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1.5em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 85%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\" | style=\"text-align: left;\" | \"Jack, pick up sweetie, can you hear me?
