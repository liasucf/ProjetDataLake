Howard, 2019, Junk News During the EU Parliamentary Elections: Lessons from a Seven-Language Study of Twitter and Facebook. ==History and editorial policy== Sieci (as well as the similar competing Do Rzeczy) was founded following a conflict within Uwa\u017cam Rze which led to the termination of many journalists. The first issue of Sieciwas published on 26 November 2012.JAS-KOZIARKIEWICZ, Marta. \"POLISH OPINION WEEKLIES ABOUT BREXIT IN 2015 AND 2016.\" Online Journal Modelling the New Europe 29 (2019). Sieci's editorial policy is inline with the Law and Justice (PiS) party, and has been opposed to the competing Civic Platform party since its founding. The editorial line follows identity journalism which aims not to inform, but to integrate and mobilise supporters of a particular political option.In context of Do Rzeczy in: Brzoza, Katarzyna and Kornacka-Grzonka, Monika (2017) Narracja medialna wyra\u017cona na ok\u0142adkach wybranych tygodnik\u00f3w opinii podczas parlamentarnej kampanii wyborczej 2015 roku, (Polish), Polityka i Spo\u0142ecze\u0144stwo, No. 4(15), p. 115. The magazine regularly features interviews with people connected to the PiS platform and presents social issues in a dichotomous manner that is divided between PiS supporters and detractors. The magazine places an emphasis on politics, presenting political affairs in a monochromatic fashion referring frequently to economic freedom and Christian values. In 2016, the right-wing wSieci magazine ran a cover with a white women assaulted by dark males under the title \"The Islamic Rape of Europe\" which evoked outrage,The Everyday Politics of Migration Crisis in Poland: Between Nationalism, Fear and Emphathy, Palgrave Macmillan, chapter by Krzysztof Jaskulowski, 2019, pages 31-53 and has been compared to WWII propaganda with the same imagery.Go\u017adziak, El\u017cbieta M., and P\u00e9ter M\u00e1rton. \"Where the wild things are: Fear of Islam and the anti-refugee rhetoric in Hungary and in Poland.\" Central and Eastern European Migration Review 17.2 (2018): 125-151.The so-called 'Islamic rape of Europe' is part of a long and racist history, Washington Post, 16 February 2016 ==References== ==External links== Category:2012 establishments in Poland Category:Conservatism in Poland Category:Conservative magazines Category:Magazines established in 2012 Category:Magazines published in Warsaw Category:Polish-language magazines Category:Political magazines published in Poland Category:Right-wing populism in Poland ",
