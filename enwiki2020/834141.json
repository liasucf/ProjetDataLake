The \u0160iroki Brijeg area is located on the direction of tectonic units Rakitno-Hrgud and spreads over Rakitno, Vardi mountains, Mostarsko Blato, Rotimlje and Hrgud to Trebi\u0161njica in the southeast. The area is made-up of up late Jurassic sediments, followed by Cretaceous and Paleogene age layers, then Neogene and Quaternary deposits. Highlights are early Cretaceous dun, well stratified limestone and dolomites. Late Cretaceous deposits, cenoman-turon, are represented by white and pink, massive limestone with the shoot. In Paleogenic layers function Liburnijska and alveolinic-nummulitic limestones, then eocenic flysch, which is represented by marl, sandstone, calcarenite and conglomerates. Neogenic layers are built of marl, sandy clay, sandstone and conglomerates, and can be found in the vicinity of Grabovo Drage and Mostarsko Blato. Quaternary banks of pebbles, sand and water karst saturated found on almost all rocky fields and drifts along the river beds. Between the lower mountain Vardi, Gvozd, Rujan and Trtle (altitude 600-900m) is a karstic depression Ko\u010derinsko, Trnsko, Mokarsko and Ru\u017eevo field and Mostar Blato (altitude of 220-300m). \u0160iroki Brijeg area belongs to typical bauxite courts Lokve Black - Kida\u010dke Njive, Resnica - deposit and Uzari\u0107i - Kne\u0161polje.

Brinje whose rudiments north of Bogodola, below kote Kulic (1199) runs to the west and on their way to Li\u0161tica receives at Prskalo stream Ladin, and 2.5 kilometers below, the stream of water Dobrinski. These streams buy all surface waters during the period of abundant precipitation and dissolution of snow on the south-western parts of the mountain \u010cabulje. Surface waters come to Rakitno field are being dried by water points, Jelica, Zmijinac and during major precipitation formed a periodic watercourse Ugrova\u010da that going deeply carved canyon Brin, receiving side stream, and in the village of Trn, Ko\u010derin water fields, and on the road to Blato Mostarskog, in Siroki Brijeg center connects with the river Li\u0161tica. == History == === Ancient period === The ruins from the Illyrian period confirm that the area of \u0160iroki Brijeg had a large population in pre-historic times. The evidence can be seen on the hill Gradina on the frontier of Mokro and \u010cerigaj. There is also evidence on the walls of the forts where they had been in past. During the ancient period there was plenty of life in that region. From the Roman period there are remains of a fort (refugium) in the village of Biograci and a basilica in Mokro; there are remain of the forts and roads there. === Middle ages === Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos mentions that Mokriskik was in that area . The basilica in Mokri was built and destroyed several times in the Middle Ages and it was used for its purpose. In her neighbourhood is nekrepola with ste\u0107ak,which are present elsewhere. There number and size indicate that this region was (from 12th till 15th century) has been very populated and rich. From that period on Ko\u010derin was kept the longest tablet on ste\u0107ak written with Bosnian Cyrillic, known as Ko\u010derinska plo\u010da (\u201eKo\u010derin tablet\"). The residues of middle-age fort can be found in the Bork, close to the source of river Li\u0161tica. === Ottoman rule === After the Turkish conquest in the middle of 15th century the population was mainly rural and in the mountains. Until the middle of 19th century, Herzegovina was cut off from social, cultural and political events in other European countries. === Austria-Hungary === === World War II and Yugoslavia === Italian fort above \u0160iroki Brijeg During the Second World War the Usta\u0161e held the city together with Italian troops. During their presence, the Italians built several forts for observation of the city. Like some cities in West Herzegovina, \u0160iroki Brijeg was labeled as a pro-Usta\u0161e and a pro-fascisct region. It was therefore demonized by the officials of Yugoslavia and was renamed Li\u0161tica (by the name of the river) instead of \u0160iroki Brijeg (Wide Hill). Investment in the city was also very poor. A number of people emigrated to Zagreb and Dalmatia, as well as to Germany as gastarbeiters. In 1985, the local Communist Party built a monument to the Yugoslav Partisans in the centre of the town with Partisans ostensibly reburied beneath it. On 3 May 2013 the monument was removed to explore the mass grave, revealing the remains of 95 people. The remains were characteristic of those killed by the Partisans themselves, with bodies being tied up with wire and some German dog tags being recovered. == Settlements == == Economy == === Agriculture === Agricultural production in the municipality of \u0160iroki Brijeg is mostly reduced to the production for their own use on yards and a minor part of the arable land. It is the production of agricultural products for the market is very small compared to the alternatives, and refers primarily to the production of wine, a little bit in the production of vegetables and flowers, very little in the livestock and milk production. This resulted in a large percentage of agricultural land is not used- according to latest statistics - even 60% that could be used for agricultural land is not processed. The lack of clear government strategy and orientation towards the launching and development of agricultural production is also very important feature of the present situation in agriculture . ==== Prior to the war ==== Unlike twenty years ago, is now in agricultural production there is no fundamental cultural production, production that would be meaningful and possible in a larger area of the municipality. For many years it was tobacco. Together with the war has fallen down and the existing state system and thus the former system of organization of agricultural production. In the entire period since then until today, the new system was established. It is the whole country, especially the area where the municipality brought nekontroliranom import all kinds of things. So the majority of agricultural products has become cheaper to import than produce. The result has already been mentioned drastically reducing obra\u0111ivanih area, reducing the number of cattle and even up to five times, the entire reduction in volume of agricultural production. Finally it came to life the feeling that it is impossible to engage in agricultural production as the production activity of which can be live or something and make money. ==== After the war ==== The municipality's overall economic performance is stronger than that of the surrounding municipalities - primarily in the Entrepreneurial Sector, and the time orientation and working-age population by non-sector higher. Therefore, the percentage of uncultivated land is the largest in the municipality in comparison to the surrounding ones- 60% (Posu\u0161je 59%, 49% Ljubu\u0161ki and Grude 47%). The number of residents who are engaged solely in agriculture is relatively smallest in Siroki Brijeg. ==Industry== In the area of industrial production in the municipality are significantly represented meat industry and metal industry, and to a smaller production of footwear, manufacture of construction products and stone processing, production of insulation materials, graphic activity, etc. Official statistics, which regularly publishes the Federal Bureau of Statistics tracked the movement of industrial production at the level of the Federation and cantons, so that these (official) data for the municipality does not have. However, the basic features of industrial production in this region in the West would be essentially similar and reflect the movement of industrial production for the municipality of Siroki Brijeg. In the period 2004/2005 the recorded slight growth of the index of industrial production (101.3). When the production of metals and production of metal products recorded a significant growth (index 2005./2004. = 134.3 and 180.4), production of paper products (index = 110.7), while other areas of industrial production recorded a significant decrease ( such as food and beverages: Index = 80.0, mining: index = 71.4). For further growth of industrial production are essential investments in the development of existing industrial capacity in the areas that are currently represented in the municipality and which employ a large number of workers. This primarily refers to the production of metals and metal products. These activities according to official statistics reported a continued growth during 2005 year. The establishment and construction of new or expansion of existing business and industrial zones is prerequisite for the growth of manufacturing sector, attract domestic and foreign capital and create new jobs. == Sport == \u0160iroki Brijeg has multiple national champion in many sports, including football and basketball. NK \u0160iroki Brijeg is a double champion and conqueror of BiH Cup champion five consecutive league HB, and their domestic matches played on stadium Pecara, which meets all the criteria of the UEFA-e, while Mostar in the mud works modern Sports-recreation center / training camp Musa-Kara\u010di\u0107 with the ambulance, equipped with shower, two natural and one playground with artificial grass.
