Born in Isnot\u00fa, Trujillo State, he became a highly renowned doctor, more so after his death.Fern\u00e1ndez Ju\u00e1rez, Gerardo (2004). Salud e interculturalidad en Am\u00e9rica Latina: perspectivas antropol\u00f3gicas. Editorial Abya Yala. == Life == ===Early life and education === Jos\u00e9 Gregorio Hern\u00e1ndez Cisneros was born on October 26, 1864 in Isnot\u00fa, a small village in the state of Trujillo in the United States of Venezuela (now Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.) He was the first of seven children of Benigno Mar\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez Manzaneda and his wife Josefa Antonia Cisneros Mansilla. He spent the entirety of his childhood in his hometown, where his mother worked as a housekeeper and his father sold pharmaceuticals and livestock. Hern\u00e1ndez was baptised on January 30, 1865 in the Colonial Temple of Escuque (now the Parochial Church of Ni\u00f1o Jes\u00fas de Escuque.) He received the sacrament of Confirmation on December 6, 1867 by Juan Bonet, Bishop of M\u00e9rida. At the age of thirteen, Hern\u00e1ndez expressed to his parents his desire to go to law school and become a lawyer, but was convinced by his mother to pursue a career in medicine. So, in 1878, he began his long and rigorous journey from the Andes Mountain Range in Trujillo to Caracas. He enrolled in Colegio Villegas, one of the country's most prestigious schools at the time, where, in 1882, he graduated with a baccalaureate in philosophy. After completing his high school education, Hern\u00e1ndez enrolled in Universidad Central de Venezuela (UCV) to begin his medical studies. Throughout his six years of at UCV, he was described by his professors as a student of outstanding academic performance and conduct. === Career === In 1888 Hern\u00e1ndez graduated as a medical doctor at Universidad Central de Venezuela, in Caracas. The Venezuelan government awarded him a grant to continue his studies in Europe. Hern\u00e1ndez traveled to Paris, where he studied other fields of medicine such as: bacteriology, pathology, microbiology, histology, and physiology. Following his return to Venezuela, he became a leading doctor at the Hospital Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Vargas. Between 1891 and 1916, Hern\u00e1ndez dedicated himself to teaching, medicine, and religious practice. He sought priesthood on two occasions, but his fragile physical conditions would ultimately prevent him from achieving that status. He studied at the Monastery of Lucca in Italy for ten months in 1908. In 1913, he enrolled at the Latin American P\u00edo School of Rome to continue the priestly career, but had to return to Venezuela for health reasons. Among his scientific publications are The Elements of Bacteriology (1906), About the Angina Pectoris of Malaric Origin (1909) and The Elements of Philosophy (1912). Hern\u00e1ndez treated the poor for free and even bought them medicines with his own money. With the arrival of 1918 Spanish flu in Venezuela, Hern\u00e1ndez attended the contagious in Caracas. Hern\u00e1ndez died in 1919, after being struck by a car. His remains are housed in La Candelaria Catholic Church in Caracas, Venezuela. == Canonization == After his death, Hern\u00e1ndez' stature began to reach mythic proportions. People around the country started claiming to have been granted miracles after praying for his intercession to God.Dinneen, Mark (2001). Culture and customs of Venezuela, Greenwood Publishing Group, pp. 32-34. At present, Hern\u00e1ndez is commonly invoked as \"Jos\u00e9 Gregorio\" by both doctors and patients for healing purposes. He is also called upon for protection during overland journeys. Eventually, his name became known all over Latin America and Spain. In 1949, Venezuelan Catholic Church officials began the process of determining whether or not Hern\u00e1ndez was eligible for sainthood. The Vatican granted him the title of Venerable in 1985. The next step in the process for Hern\u00e1ndez is that of beatification. In June 2020, Pope Francis ordered the beatification of Hern\u00e1ndez, after the recovery of a girl that was shot in the head, reported as a miracle attributed to Hern\u00e1ndez. ==Legacy== Statue of Dr. Jos\u00e9 Gregorio Hern\u00e1ndez in Guacara, Venezuela He is, also, revered by Venezuela's alternative and syncretic religion the cult of Maria Lionza. Historian Steven Palmer also has drawn parallels between the Hern\u00e1ndez cult and that of the assassinated Costa Rican physician and politician Ricardo Moreno Ca\u00f1as.Palmer, Steven Paul (2003).
