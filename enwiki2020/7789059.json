    "text": "\"Release the Pressure\" is the third single by the English electronic duo Leftfield and the first to involve Paul Daley with writing duties after he joined the group. The song was released exclusively on 12\" in 1992. Unlike previous releases that had been released on the Outer Rhythm record label, Leftfield had now officially split from Outer Rhythm. Major labels had offered them deals but neither member wanted to give up creative control to any major company. They formed the Hard Hands record label with \"Release the Pressure\" being the label's first official release. The song featured reggae singer Earl Sixteen on vocals, with a lyric taken from his 1981 single \"Trial and Crosses\". \"Release the Pressure\" made the top 20 in the UK charts and featured at number one in the Melody Maker \"Stone Free Chart of the Year\". It was used in Telef\u00f3nica O2 and O2 (UK) commercials during its first year. ==Track listing== ===12\"=== # \"Release the Pressure\" (The Vocal Mix) 8:08 # \"Release the Pressure\" (The Rough Dub) 8:40 # \"Release the Pressure\" (The Desert Edit) 5:02 ==1996 version== In 1996, an updated version of \"Release the Pressure\" was released as the eighth single under the Leftfield name.
