Located within the Warwick Farm Racecourse site, it hosted numerous major events including the Australian Grand Prix. The first big meeting at the track, a round of the Tasman Series in January 1961, drew a crowd of 65,000 spectators. However, the circuit was expensive to run, as two \"crossings\" had to be placed over the horse racing track, and thus large crowds were needed to sustain racing. By the early 1970s the Australian Jockey Club (AJC) was receiving financial support from the TAB, and thus did not need the relatively low returns from motor racing, and didn't want to improve the circuit. When the Confederation of Australian Motorsport requested to have Armco fencing erected around the circuit, the AJC refused, and the circuit closed. The last major race was a round of the 1973 Australian Touring Car Championship on the 15th of July, which was won by Peter Brock. ==Transport== Warwick Farm railway station is on the Inner West & Leppington, Bankstown and Cumberland lines of the Sydney Trains network. A branch line ran to Warwick Farm Racecourse for race day trains until closed in August 1990.Warwick Farm Racecourse Branch NSWrail.net The Hume Highway is the main arterial road through the suburb.
