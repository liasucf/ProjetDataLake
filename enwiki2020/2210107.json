The game features Colorado Rockies outfielder Larry Walker on the cover. ==Reception== The Nintendo 64 version received favorable reviews, while the Game Boy version received average reviews, according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Next Generation called the former \"the best baseball game of the bunch for Nintendo 64. Minor AI problems and a slower pace keep it from becoming a classic, but it's definitely a big step in the right direction.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1998 video games Category:Acclaim Entertainment games Category:Baseball video games Category:Game Boy games Category:Major League Baseball video games Category:Nintendo 64 games Category:Video games developed in the United States ",
