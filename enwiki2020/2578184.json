    "text": "\"Rock 'n' Roll Star\" is a song by English rock band Oasis. It is the opening track from their debut album, Definitely Maybe (1994). Like the majority of the band's songs from this era, it was written by lead guitarist Noel Gallagher. Noel said that \"Rock 'n' Roll Star\" was one of only three songs in which he wanted to say something: \"I've pretty much summed up everything I wanted to say in \"Rock 'n' Roll Star\", \"Live Forever\" and \"Cigarettes & Alcohol\", after that I'm repeating myself, but in a different way\". It was released as a radio single in America. The song's video, directed by Nigel Dick, consists of clips of the band performing the song from their Live by the Sea gig, interspersed with clips of them on Southend Pier, in and around the amusement park, 'Adventure Island' then named 'Peter Pan's Playground' and in the bowling alley which was located on Southend Pier, which subsequently burnt down. The song was featured on the band's 2000 live album and DVD, Familiar to Millions, and another live version was recorded at a 2 July 2005 concert at the City of Manchester Stadium and released on the band's single \"Let There Be Love\" in late 2005. Liam Gallagher performed the song as part of the One Love Manchester charity concert on 4 June 2017 in aid of those affected by the Manchester Arena bombing. ==Personnel== *Liam Gallagher \u2013 lead vocals, tambourine *Noel Gallagher \u2013 lead guitars, backing vocals *Paul McGuigan \u2013 bass *Paul Arthurs \u2013 rhythm guitar *Tony McCarroll \u2013 drums ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart !Peak position |- |US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks |align=\"center\"|36 |} ==Certifications== ==References== ==External links== * Category:Oasis (band) songs Category:1994 songs Category:1995 singles Category:Music videos directed by Nigel Dick Category:Songs written by Noel Gallagher Category:Song recordings produced by Noel Gallagher Category:Song recordings produced by Liam Gallagher Category:Music television program theme songs ",
