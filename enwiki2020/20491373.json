Ossian Hall was one of three large residences, along with Oak Hill, and Ravensworth, owned by the Fitzhugh family in Fairfax County. ==Location== Ossian Hall was located north of Braddock Road and east of the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495).http://virginia.hometownlocator.com/maps/feature- map,ftc,3,fid,1778890,n,ossian%20hall.cfm ==History== Ossian Hall was built on the Ravensworth land grant by Nicholas Fitzhugh, son of Henry Fitzhugh. In 1804, Dr. David Stuart, a commissioner for the Federal City, purchased Ossian Hall and relocated there with his wife, Eleanor Calvert Custis Stuart, and their children. Francis Asbury Dickins, a Washington attorney, used the home as a summer residence until the outbreak of the Civil War, when it became his year-round residence. All three of the Fitzhugh estates were protected by orders from both sides throughout the war. Joseph L. Bristow, an American politician from Kansas, purchased Ossian Hall in 1918 and died there on July 14, 1944. On September 3, 1959, Ossian Hall was burned as a training exercise for the Annandale Fire Department. ==Image gallery== File:Ossian Hall 161290pu.JPG|Rear elevation File:Ossian Hall 161291pu.JPG|Rear elevation File:Ossian Hall 161293pu.JPG|Front elevation File:Ossian Hall 161294pu.JPG|Front elevation File:Ossian Hall 161295pu.JPG|Front entrance File:Ossian Hall 161296pu.JPG|Side elevation File:Ossian Hall 161297pu.JPG|Side elevation File:Ossian Hall 161298pu.JPG|Interior staircase File:Ossian Hall 161299pu.JPG|Interior paneling File:Ossian Hall 161300pu.JPG|Interior mantelpiece ==See also== *Historic houses in Virginia ==References == ==External links== * * Category:Landmarks in Virginia Category:Historic American Buildings Survey in Virginia Category:Colonial architecture in Virginia Category:Houses in Fairfax County, Virginia Category:Fitzhugh family residences Category:Custis family residences Category:Annandale, Virginia Category:Plantation houses in Virginia Category:Burned houses in the United States Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1959 Category:1959 disestablishments in Virginia ",
