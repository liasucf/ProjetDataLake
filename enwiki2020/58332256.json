    "text": "The \u00c9cole alsacienne is a co-educational private school located in the 6th arrondissement of Paris. The school was founded by a group of French Alsatians after the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. It then became a model for reforming the school system under the Third Republic, and is still to this day a leading establishment of the French secondary education system. == History == The school was officially founded in 1874,. after three years of functioning, by teachers and Protestant academics from AlsaceNatacha Polony, \u00ab \u00c9cole alsacienne : les raisons d'un succ\u00e8s \u00bb, Le Figaro, 21 June 2010, . who came to France after the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine by the German Empire during the Franco-Prussian War. The new school was an establishment for secondary education based on the model of the Jean Sturm Gymnasium, with the ambition of \"producing a type of man who was cultivated, and combines the virtues of the regional soul with the general qualities of the humanist\". The two first headmasters of the school, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Rieder (from 1874 to 1891) and Th\u00e9odore Beck (from 1891 to 1922), were both pastors and former students of the Jean-Sturm Gymnasium. Later, the school was headed by Henri P\u00e9quignat (1922-1936), Jacques Vallette (1936-1945), Jean Neel (1945-1953), Georges Hacquard (1953-1986), Jean-Pierre Hammel (1986-1988), Ren\u00e9 Fuchs (1988-2001), Pierre de Panafieu (since 2001). The school rapidly became one of the testing grounds for public education, known as a \"pilot school\". Non-religious since 1874, mixed in 1908,The history of the education of women in France meant that mixed education was not generally used in the French education system until the 1960s. it insisted from its inception on the importance of French (rather than Latin) and foreign languages. It opened a gymnasium and science labs in 1881. Audiovisual methods of teaching were introduced in 1963, with the introduction of CCTV. Running from kindergarten to final year, the \u00c9cole alsacienne is one of the most reputable schools in Paris. Students from the \u00c9cole alsacienne often come from amongst the most privileged sectors of society, due to their selection and admission policies, and its geographic location. However, thanks to its scholarship system and due to the limited price of admission, it has maintained a relative social diversity, with strong attendance from the middle class. The establishment offers relatively few integrated places, as many students stay there throughout their school life. The admissions are mainly made in 6th Form (beginning of middle school), as more than half of the student body is admitted at this time. The school considered opening an establishment in Argenteuil, but the project never took place, due to lack of public investment. == Teaching == === General === The school uses active methods of teaching. Therefore, the growth of the child is placed at the heart of the education system, even to the detriment of spaces. Teaching of sport, plastic arts, and music is central, including in the creation of a classe \u00e0 horaires am\u00e9nag\u00e9s musique in the college. In order to empower students and their families, the school practices education without punishment or reward. Languages take an important role in the education. German is taught in the first years in the school, but Chinese has been taught since 1963. English courses are obligatory from the beginning of elementary school, and leads to intensive language courses in college and lyc\u00e9e, particularly in the European (specifically English) and Oriental (particularly Chinese) sections. Since the 2000s, the Ecole alsacienne has offered exchange programs with some partner schools which includes Beijing Jingshan School, Sydney Grammar School, Theresianum Akademie, Daly College, St. Paul's School (New Hampshire), Maru A Pula School, Hotchkiss School, The Dalton School, Lakefield College School, Ashbury College. === Cost === As the establishment is a private school, education is paid for 912 euros per trimester; there are also scholarships. Entrance is selective: in 2014, there were 300 applications for entry to the 6th Form, for 60 places.Colombe Schneck, \u00ab \u00c9cole alsacienne, les liens du rang \u00bb, GQ, September 2015, pages 94-98. === Languages studied === * German (LV1 until 6th form) * English (from primary, LV1 until 6th form with a class reserved for bilingual students by level, European section from the 4th year.) * Chinese (LV2 until 6th form, LV3 from second, Oriental section from the 4th year) * Spanish (LV2 from the 5th year, LV3 from the second) * Ancient Greek (option from the second) * Italian (LV2 from the 5th year) * Latin (obligatory from the 5th year, optional from the 4th) * Russian (LV3 from the 4th year) == Lyc\u00e9e ranking == In 2015, the lyc\u00e9e was ranked 12th of 109 at departmental level in terms of teaching quality, and 130th at national level.Classement d\u00e9partemental et national du lyc\u00e9e The ranking was based on three criteria: baccalaur\u00e9at results, the proportion of students who obtain their baccalaur\u00e9at having studied at the school for their last two years, and \"added value\" (calculated based on the social origin of students, their age, and their diploma results).M\u00e9thodologie du classement national des lyc\u00e9es fran\u00e7ais The Ecole alsacienne is ranked 7th in Paris, and 11th in nationwide for 2020. == Location == The school is found at 109, rue Notre- Dame-des-Champs in Paris, in the 6th arrondissement of Paris (between the Petit Coll\u00e8ge and the Premi\u00e8res/Terminales at 128, rue d\u2019Assas), not far from the Port-Royal and the Jardin du Luxembourg. == Notable former pupils == === A === * Paul Ackerman (peintre) * Catherine All\u00e9gret * Jean Claude Ameisen * Gabriel Attal * Axel Auriant * Jean-Christophe Averty === B === * \u00c9lisabeth Badinter * \u00c9douard Baer * Nathalie Baye * Pierre Bellemare * Jean-Paul Belmondo * Pervenche Ber\u00e8s * Nicolas Berggruen * Adrien Bertrand * Rapha\u00eble Billetdoux * Nino Boccara * Marc Boegner * Jean de Boishue * Alain Bombard * Michel Boujenah * Emmanuel Bove * Juan Branco * Thierry Breton * Jean de Brunhoff * Denis Buican * Michel Butel * Agn\u00e8s Buzyn === C === * Carlos (chanteur) * Benjamin Castaldi * Jean-Baptiste Charcot * Gilles Clavreul === D === * Thomas Dutronc === E === * Luce Eekman * Isabelle Eschenbrenner === F === * Delphine Forest === G === * Laurent Gaud\u00e9 * Andr\u00e9 Gide * Stanislas Guerini * Boris Guimpel === H === * Laurens Hammond * Marina Hands * Natacha Henry * Christian Herter * St\u00e9phane Hessel * Iz\u00efa Higelin === I === * Marc Iselin * Jacques Isorni === J === * Jacques Ehrmann (homme d'affaires) * Alexandre Jardin * Joyce Jonathan * Jul (auteur) === K === * Wilfrid Kilian === L === * Jean-Yves Lafesse * St\u00e9phan L\u00e9vy-Kuentz * Pierre Lou\u00ffs * Daniela Lumbroso === M === * Horace Mallet * Elli Medeiros * Marc Minkowski * Henry de Monfreid * Antoine Monis * J\u00e9r\u00f4me Monod * Th\u00e9odore Monod * Vincent Moscato === P === * Jean-Jacques Pauvert * Gilles P\u00e9lisson * Guillaume Pepy * Francis Perrin (physicien) * Michel Piccoli * Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Pottecher === R === * Fran\u00e7ois Rachline * Jean Rosenthal (r\u00e9sistant) * Patrick de Rousiers === S === * L\u00e9a Salam\u00e9 * Claude Sarraute * Jo\u00ebl Schmidt * Colombe Schneck * Georges Scott * Michel Seydoux * Benjamin Siksou * Sacha Sperling === V === * Marion Van Renterghem * Jean Veil * Pierre-Fran\u00e7ois Veil * Vercors (\u00e9crivain) * Louis- Charles Viossat === W === * Paul Wenz * Sonia Wieder-Atherton === Z === * Marie-C\u00e9cile Zinsou == Gallery == Ecole alsacienne 2006-001.jpg|Building 1 and the courtyard of the 6th and 5th Ecole alsacienne 2006-002.jpg|The Auburtin building Ecole alsacienne 2006-003.jpg|View of the school from the terrace of 128, rue d'Assas Ecole alsacienne 2006-004.jpg|Stairs from the basement of Philippe Bosseau Ecole alsacienne 2006-006.jpg|Auburtin building, next to the IT lab Ecole alsacienne 2006-007.jpg|Sports court Ecole alsacienne 2006-008.jpg|\u00ab La Maison blanche \u00bb of 107, rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs, bought in 1973 : used as a headmaster's office.
