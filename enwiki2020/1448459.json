    "text": "Ethnopoetics is a method of recording text versions of oral poetry or narrative performances (i.e. verbal lore) that uses poetic lines, verses, and stanzas (instead of prose paragraphs) to capture the formal, poetic performance elements which would otherwise be lost in the written texts. The goal of any ethnopoetic text is to show how the techniques of unique oral performers enhance the aesthetic value of their performances within their specific cultural contexts. Major contributors to ethnopoetic theory include Jerome Rothenberg, Dennis Tedlock, and Dell Hymes. Ethnopoetics is considered a subfield of ethnology, anthropology, folkloristics, stylistics, linguistics, and literature and translation studies. ==A need for ethnopoetics: Rothenberg== Jerome Rothenberg coined the term ethnopoetics in the 1960s. According to Catherine S. Quick, Rothenberg had recognized that \u201cmost translations of Native American oral traditions . . . failed to capture the power and beauty of the oral performances on the written page,\u201d especially when \u201cWestern poetic styles\u201d were imposed upon these written texts (1999, 96).Quick, Catherine. 1999. \"Ethnopoetics.\" Folklore Forum 30(1/2): 95\u2013105. Rothenberg\u2019s influence has increased public awareness of the rich narrative and poetic traditions of cultures all over the world. ==Ethnopoetic theory: Tedlock and Hymes== The development of ethnopoetics as a separate subfield of study was largely pioneered from the middle of the 20th century by anthropologists and linguists such as Dennis Tedlock and Dell Hymes. Both Tedlock and Hymes used ethnopoetic analysis to do justice to the artistic richness of Native American verbal art, and while they have disagreed on some analytic details, they agree on the fundamental issues and purposes of ethnopoetics. ===Dennis Tedlock=== On the one hand, Dennis Tedlock argues not only that pauses in oral performances indicate where poetic line breaks should occur in the written texts, which he compares to musical scores, but also that words on the page should be formatted to reflect the more subtle qualities of speech used in oral performances. Tedlock explain his perspective in this way, > An ethnopoetic score [or text] not only takes account of the words but > silences, changes in loudness and tone of voice, the production of sound > effects, and the use of gestures and props. . . . Ethnopoetics remains open > to the creative side of performance, valuing features that may be rare or > even unique to a particular artist or occasion.Tedlock, Dennis. Syllabus. > \u201cEnglish 699: Ethnopoetics.\u201d Colleges of Arts and Sciences. University at > Buffalo. Accessed 22 November 2011. In other words, Tedlock argues that by visually representing oral performance features in the written texts, ethnopoetic methods more accurately convey the aesthetic qualities of the performance than uniformly formatted text in prose paragraphs ever could. Tedlock himself defines ethnopoetics as \u201ca decentered poetics, an attempt to hear and read the poetries of distant others, outside the Western [poetic] tradition as we know it now.\" ===Dell Hymes=== On the other hand, Dell Hymes believes that even previously dictated texts retain significant structural patterns of poetic repetition that \u201care the \u2018reason why\u2019\u201d storytellers use pauses in their oral performances (1999, 97\u201398). Hymes\u2019s ethnopoetic theories focus on repetitions in the grammar and syntax of transcribed and translated texts that he suggest can still be analyzed and retranslated. For example, accordingly to folklorist Barre Toelken, the poetic beauty and power of Native American texts like \u201cThe Sun's Myth\u201d have been restored \u201cbecause a dedicated anthropological folklorist and linguist, Dell Hymes, dedicated a good part of his life to resuscitating a dry, written text collected . . . by a long-dead anthropologist [i.e., Franz Boas] and stored away in a dusty volume\u201d (2003, 122).Toelken, Barre. 2003. The Anguish of Snails. Vol. 2, Folklife of the West, edited by Barre Toelken and William A. Wilson. Logan: Utah State University Press. When Hymes retranslated \u201cThe Sun\u2019s Myth,\u201d he recovered the poetic and stylistic devices that were used in the original recorded performance, but which had been lost in the myth\u2019s earlier translation by Franz Boas. > Hymes\u2019 ethnopoetics revolves around a conception of narratives as primarily > organized in terms of formal and aesthetic\u2014\u2018poetic\u2019\u2014patterns, not in terms > of content or thematic patterns. Narrative is therefore to be seen as a form > of action, of performance, and the meanings it generates are effects of > performance. Narratives, seen from this perspective, are organized in lines > and in groups of lines (verses, stanzas), and the organization of lines in > narratives is a kind of implicit patterning that creates narrative effect. . > . . Content, in other words, is an effect of the formal organization of a > narrative: What there is to be told emerges out of how it is being told. > (Blommaert 2007, 216)Blommaert, Jan. 2007. \u201cApplied Ethnopoetics.\u201d > Narrative\u2013State of the Art. Edited by Michael G. W. Bamberg. Amsterdam: John > Benjamins Publishing Company. Benjamins Current Topics Series (Number: > 595215). 215\u2013224. Also, understanding the native language of oral performers is essential for accurate, ethnopoetic translation of their words into written texts. For example, folklorist Barre Toelken explains that Hymes\u2019s \u201cknowledge of the extant Chinookan languages\u201d helped him to \u201cnotice stylistic devices that highlighted certain actions and themes and even performance styles that brought scenes into sharp focus\u201d (2003, 122). In other words, without his knowledge of the native language of oral performers, Hymes could not have placed his ethnopoetic translation of \u201cThe Sun\u2019s Myth\u201d within its specific Native American cultural context. ==Ethnopoetics: aesthetic movement or academic discipline?== Various other writers and poets can be said to have contributed to the field of ethnopoetics as an aesthetic movement. For example, Tristan Tzara created calligrams and William Bright worked with the Karuk tribe to preserve their native language. However, within the fields of linguistics, folkloristics, and anthropology, ethnopoetics refers to a particular method of analyzing the linguistic features and syntactical structures of oral literature (such as poetry, myths, narratives, folk tales, ceremonial speeches, etc.) in ways that pay attention to poetic patterns within speech. Overall, then, ethnopoetic methods and theories strive to capture on the written page the unique aesthetic elements of individual cultures\u2019 oral poetry and narrative performance traditions, or what folklorists would call their verbal lore. Classicist Steve Reece has attempted to envision how folklorists like Dennis Tedlock or Elizabeth Fine, if transported to an eighth-century BCE social gathering in Ionia where Homer was performing a version of the Odyssey, would transcribe that oral performance into a textual form. This exercise is not entirely hypothetical: Homer\u2019s Odyssey was, after all, written down at some point in history; otherwise it would not have survived.Reece, Steve. \"Toward an Ethnopoetically Grounded Edition of Homer's Odyssey.
