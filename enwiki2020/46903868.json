    "text": "Favorite Hawaiian Songs, Volume Two is a compilation album of phonograph records by Bing Crosby released in 1946 featuring songs that were sung in a Hawaiian-type genre. This was the fifth Hawaiian-themed album release for Crosby. ==Release history== This is not to be confused with the two earlier albums of the same name. An album was released in 1940 called Favorite Hawaiian Songs. By 1946, Crosby had recorded four more Hawaiian songs and Dick McIntire's Harmony Hawaiians recorded two more. Decca hadn't used \"Paradise Isle\" and \"Aloha Kuu Ipo Aloha\", on Decca 3797, in an album yet - so, the first album, consisting of twelve songs - along with those eight more unused songs (twenty songs on ten 78 rpm records), was split into two 5-disc (10 song) 78 rpm albums of the same name - Volume One and this album. ==Reception== The reviewer for Billboard commented, inter alia: :This is an over-ambitious attempt to coin extra-added out of Bing Crosby\u2019s early recordings. In this instance the label is packaging Der Bingle\u2019s Hawaiian diskings, putting 10 sides in a set. And there\u2019s enough here for two such sets, using the same cover design of smiling Bing against a geographical picture of the islands with a descriptive booklet accompanying each set. For the first set, they are all slow and dreamy spinners, with instrumental and vocal support from Dick McIntire, Lani McIntire and the Paradise Island trio. Top faves in the first volume include \"Song of the Islands\" and \"Sweet Leilani\" \u2026 Both McIntire strumming ensembles are included in the second album, also of 10 sides, with two sides cut with Harry Owens\u2019s full band. Second set includes several selections at a livelier beat, with \"Trade Winds\" the top song favorite \u2026 For Der Bingle and hula fans, there\u2019s enough in these two packages to last a lifetime. ==Track listing== These previously issued songs were featured on a 5-disc, 78 rpm album set, Decca Album No. A-461. {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width: 100%; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #FCFDFF; border-collapse: collapse;\" |-bgcolor=#D3D3D4 | Side / Title || Writer(s) || Recording date || Performed with || Time |- bgcolor=#F2F0E6 | colspan=5|Disc 1 (25021): |- | A. \"When You Dream About Hawaii\" || Bert Kalmar, Harry Ruby, Sid Silvers || September 11, 1937 || Lani McIntire and His Hawaiians || 3:02 |- | B. \"Sail Along, Silv'ry Moon\" || Harry Tobias, Percy Wenrich || September 11, 1937 || Lani McIntire and His Hawaiians || 2:44 |- bgcolor=#F2F0E6 | colspan=5|Disc 2 (25022): |- | A. \"Sweet Hawaiian Chimes\" || Lani McIntire, George B.
