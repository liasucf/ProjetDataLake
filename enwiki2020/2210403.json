    "text": "Sam John Farrar (born June 29, 1978) is an American musician, singer and record producer. He is best known as a member of the pop rock band Maroon 5, in which he plays several instruments. A frequent collaborator with the band since the 1990s, he joined as a touring member in 2012 and was promoted to an official member in 2016. He has also been the bassist for the rock band Phantom Planet since their formation in 1994. ==Musical career== ===1994\u20132012: Phantom Planet and other side projects=== Farrar is the bass guitar player for the American rock band Phantom Planet. He also joined a band called Operation Aloha with members of Gomez and Maroon 5. He and his wife, Stephanie, have started their own music project, called Bubble and Strife. ===2012\u2013present: Maroon 5=== In 2012, Farrar became a touring member of Maroon 5, playing various instruments including: guitars, bass guitar (occasionally), percussion and additional keyboards, singing backing vocals and providing samples and other special effects (using the MPC). He formerly co-wrote and co-produced a few of the band's songs on almost all of their studio albums and also remixed one of their songs, which is called \"Woman\", on Call and Response: The Remix Album, released in 2008. On August 31, 2012 - during a show in Argentina on the Overexposed Tour - Farrar filled-in for Mickey Madden on the bass guitar for the very first time. He subsequently filled-in for Madden on the next few shows of the tour. After touring with the band as a touring member for the next couple of years, Farrar appeared in an official, promotional photo of Maroon 5 for the first time, in late 2016. He is also featured on the cover of the band's sixth studio album, Red Pill Blues (2017) - all of this can be seen as confirmation, that Farrar became an official member of Maroon 5, making them a seven-piece band. ==Personal life== Farrar was born in Los Angeles, California, to Australian parents. His father, John Farrar, was a member of The Shadows and also carved a successful songwriting career, penning many of Olivia Newton-John's big hits as well as producing nearly every one of her albums during her most successful years. His mother, Pat Carroll, was a successful Australian pop singer in the 1960s. He attended The Buckley School. Sam is married to Stephanie Eitel, formerly a member of the band Agent Sparks. Their daughter Vesper Pearl Farrar was born on August 6, 2009 and their son Flynn Roscoe Farrar was born on January 14, 2014.
