    "text": "Sapanca station is a railway station along the Istanbul-Ankara railway in the town of Sapanca, Turkey. It is serviced by the Istanbul-Arifiye limited-stop regional train, the Ada Express. Until 2012, Sapanca was a stop on the Haydarpa\u015fa-Adapazar\u0131 Regional, which operated frequently. Other express trains heading for Ankara and points beyond would skip the station. Today, the high- speed Y\u00fcksek H\u0131zl\u0131 Tren service passes the station on its own right of way. Sapanca is away from Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal in Istanbul. ==References== Category:Railway stations in Sakarya Province Category:Railway stations opened in 1891 Category:1891 establishments in the Ottoman Empire ",
