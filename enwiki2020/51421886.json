Founded in 1866, the current building was completed by builder Joseph Gridley (1820-1902) in 1868 on land donated by philanthropist Marvin Kent and rests on a bedrock of sandstone.Robert R. Fildes, March 1994, (historical archives at Kent State University), The History Of The Congregation And The Church Building, Retrieved September 12, 2016, \"... donated by Marvin Kent. ... sandstone ...\" It is the only church still using its original 19th century building in the city of Kent and in 1976 the site was designed as a \"significant restored building site\". In the early and middle twentieth century when there were few women clergy anywhere in the United States, the church is notable for having several women ministers: Abbie Danforth in 1889, Carlotta Crosley in 1903, and Violet Kochendoerfer in 1972. Membership is between 140 and 200 full-time adults as well as 100 children in its religious education programs. The church runs a summer camp called Kent Hogwarts which is a Harry Potter-themed camp for young kids, which emphasizes chemistry, poetry, singing and community service. The church advocates social justice, environmental awareness, democracy and acceptance of diverse peoples including all religions. The Kent church follows the seven basic principles of Unitarian Universalism. The church hosts funeral and memorial services, concerts including classical and jazz music, public meetings on local issues, speeches advocating democracy, and other community events. It holds an annual book sale. In 2016, Rev. Melissa Carvill-Ziemer led the church on a course of structural expansion, seeking variances to expand its physical size. As part of a renovation project, the ceiling of the sanctuary will be removed to expose the vaulted beams from the earlier roof as well as a stained glass window. Reverend Carvill-Ziemer was appointed chief minister in 2005. In 2010, the church ordained Rev. Renee Ruchotzke and appointed her as its Affiliated Community Minister.

According to a demographic analysis by Google, the city of Kent is the \"most racist\" in northeastern Ohio. Carvill-Ziemer advocated against white privilege. In 2010, Ziemer and fellow Unitarian Universalists from Kent traveled to Arizona to protest the state's immigration legislation; she was arrested in Phoenix for allegedly blocking traffic in front of a sheriff's office. A judge later found her not guilty and she was released. The church has a long history of social action. In 1900, minister Abbie Danforth created and led the Portage County suffrage association and chaired a two-day conference on women's suffrage.Abbie Danforth, Washington State Library, August 8, 1910, Letters from Abbie Danforth, Retrieved September 12, 2016, WSL Manuscripts; MS 171, Box 2, ... womens suffrage; clubs and organizations Danforth had studied at Canton Theological School and had been ordained in 1878, just 15 years after suffragist Olympia Brown, who was the first woman ever to be ordained in the United States.Note: Brown, like Danforth, was a Universalist.\"Some famous Universalists include Clara Barton, Olympia Brown, ...
