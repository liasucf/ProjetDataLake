A professional since 2008, he is both a former Welterweight and interim welterweight champion in Cage Warriors. ==Mixed martial arts== ===Background and early career=== Nicolas Dalby started learning karate as a teen to defend himself against bullies. He moved from S\u00f8nderborg to Copenhagen to be around his friends. After five years of training karate, he started training in Rumble Sports, one of the biggest MMA gyms in Copenhagen. He had a total of five amateur fights, losing the first one by decision and winning the rest of them. Dalby was quickly recognized for his powerful striking and knockout power. He became one of the most feared strikers in Europe after many brutal knockouts. ===Cage Warriors Fighting Championship=== In 2014, Dalby gained two victories in the Cage Warriors, including a TKO stoppage of Sergei Churilov to earn the CWFC Welterweight Championship. ===Ultimate Fighting Championship=== Dalby made his promotional debut against Elizeu Zaleski dos Santos on 30 May 2015 at UFC Fight Night 67. He won the fight via split decision. Dalby next faced Darren Till on 24 October 2015 at UFC Fight Night 76. The bout ended in a majority draw. Both fighters were awarded Fight of the Night honors. Dalby was expected to face Bartosz Fabinski on 10 April 2016 at UFC Fight Night 86. However, on March 2, Fabi\u0144ski was removed from the card due to undisclosed reasons and replaced by Zak Cummings. Dalby lost the fight via unanimous decision. Dalby next faced Peter Sobotta on 3 September 2016 at UFC Fight Night 93. He lost the fight by unanimous decision and was subsequently released from the promotion. ===Return to the UFC=== Despite struggling with depression and alcoholism stemming from unsuccessful UFC stint, Dalby racked up 3\u20131 (1 NC) record in Cage Warriors including winning interim Welterweight Championship. Dalby was re-signed to the UFC in mid-2019 and faced Alex Oliveira on 28 September 2019 at UFC on ESPN+ 18. He won the fight via unanimous decision. Dalby was scheduled to face Danny Roberts on March 21, 2020 at UFC Fight Night: Woodley vs. Edwards. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the event was eventually postponed . The bout with Roberts was rescheduled and was expected to take place on July 26, 2020 at UFC on ESPN 14. However, Roberts pulled out of the bout citing injury and he was replaced by Jesse Ronson. Dalby lost the fight via a rear-naked choke in round one. Dalby is scheduled to face Orion Cosce on November 21, 2020 at UFC 255. ==Championships and accomplishments== ===Mixed martial arts=== *Ultimate Fighting Championship **Fight of the Night (One time) vs. Darren Till *Cage Warriors Fighting Championship **CWFC Welterweight Championship (One time) ***One successful title defense **Interim CWFC Welterweight Championship (One time) *European MMA **EMMA Welterweight Championship (One time) *Fighter Gala **FG Welterweight Championship (One time) **One successful title defense *Nordic MMA Awards -
