It houses a collection of 20th- century modern art -- from Pablo Picasso to Oskar Schlemmer, Joan Mir\u00f3 and Joseph Beuys. The building layout bears resemblance to Schinkel's Altes Museum, with a series of connected galleries around three sides of a central rotunda. However, the front of the museum is not as symmetrical as the Altes Museum and the traditional configuration is slanted with the entrance set at an angle.Giebelhausen, M.
