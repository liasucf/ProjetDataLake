    "text": "Thalassinoides is an ichnogenus of trace fossil used to refer to \"dichotomously or T-branched boxworks, mazes and shafts, unlined and unornamented\". Facies of Thalassinoides increased suddenly in abundance at the beginning of the Mesozoic. Such burrows are made by a number of organisms, including the sea anemone Cerianthus, Balanoglossus and fishes, but are most closely associated with decapod crustaceans of the (former) infraorder Thalassinidea. ==Gallery== Image:Sherborne Thalassinoides 2 large.jpg|Thalassinoides burrow system in the Sherborne Building Stone (Jurassic, Bajocian) of Dorset, England; slab cut parallel to bedding.
