In these slow-mo dance anthems, every element somehow becomes more dilated and psychedelic.\u201d the cosmic sound,Baldelli's term; Wang 2005. free-style sound,Beppe Loda's term, also written free style; no connection to the Latin freestyle genre; Ashton 2007. and combinations thereof (cosmic Afro,Oldfield.

Hearing several of their Discossession mixes, I realised that the dudes had carved out their own sound, not only citing Italo, Disco and Cosmic, but also added psychedelic, jazz fusion and rock elements into the occasion.\u201d (Nishimura:) \u201cMy favorite Japanese DJ is Toriyama from Sendai. He is very young, but the very best in Afro/Cosmic vein in Japan.\u201d) are used somewhat interchangeably to describe various forms of synthesizer-heavy and/or African-influenced dance music and methods of DJing that were originally developed and promoted by a small number of DJs in certain discoth\u00e8ques of Northern Italy from the late 1970s through the mid-1980s. The terms slow-motion discoFrom the name of a 2006 compilation by DJ Mooner, Elaste Vol. 1: Slow Motion Disco, released on the Compost Records label. and Elettronica MeccanicaCampbell 2006. Elettronica Meccanica is the name of a series of mixtapes and planned records by DJ Beppe Loda, and in the interview, he says \u201cHere are some of the artists and styles I like best: \u2026Conrad Schnitzler; Meccanica Popular (the latter two inspiring my Elettronica Meccanica style)\u2026\u201d are also associated with the genre. Italian DJs Beppe Loda and Daniele Baldelli both independently claim to have invented the genre and mixing style. ==Descriptions== The Afro/cosmic mixing style is freeform in that it allows for short hip-hop style transforms as well as long, beat-matched segues; it sometimes incorporates added percussion and effects; and it permits major speed variations to force songs into a 90\u2013110 BPM range.Wang. \u201cThe tempo is often between 105 and 110 bpm.\u201dWang. (Baldelli:) \u201c\u2026the music was very slow. I mean, in that period, the music was like 90\u2013105 bpm.\u201d Baldelli would also play 45 RPM records at 33 and vice versa. The cosmic sound included a very diverse range of musical styles, from electro and funk to jazz fusion and Brazilian music. Peter Shapiro described Baldelli's music as a \"combination of spaced-out rock and tribal percussion.\" One genre that was usually not part of this mix was Italo disco, which Baldelli believes was generally too mainstream and commercial. In a 2005 feature on Daniele Baldelli, one of the style's founding DJs, music journalist Daniel Wang describes Baldelli's style as \u201cpsychedelic, churning, hypnotic.\u201d In the interview, Baldelli emphasizes playing diverse selections of classical, African and Brazilian folk, and synth-pop at improper speeds, mixed with effects and drum machines: Cosmic music has been cited as a \"touchstone\" for contemporary \"space disco\" artists like Lindstr\u00f8m collaborator Prins Thomas and Andy Meecham of Chicken Lips. It has also been cited as an influence on some later Italian house songs, such as Sue\u00f1o Latino. ==Etymology== \"Cosmic\", \"cosmic disco\", or \"the cosmic sound\" derives from Cosmic Club; referring to the sound of that venue.Campbell. (Loda:) \u201cIn Italy, until 1982, people used to define music by the club\u2019s name: Typhoon sound (Beppe Loda), Les Pois sound (Daniele Mix), Chicago sound (Ebreo, Fari and Spranga), Cosmic sound (Daniele Baldelli and TBC), Les Cigales sound (Meo, Rubens, Daniele Mix and Joele), Arena sound (DJ Lollo), and so on.\u201d As such, the term is principally associated with Baldelli, who makes a claim to its invention.Wang. (Baldelli:) \u201cFrom 1980\u201384 \u2026 My passion and instinct for music drove me to create a sound \u2014 some people have called it \u2018afro\u2019 music, but this term is incorrect. It\u2019s better to call it the Cosmic Sound, \u2014 that is what they say now \u2014 the sound that Daniele Baldelli created in the Cosmic Disco.\u201d \"Afro\" is Loda\u2019s term for 1. his selections from African-influenced disco, soul, funk and jazz fusion genres; 2. his selections of alternative and experimental dance music that typically comprised the first hour of his sets; 3. his general mixing style; and 4. a 1982\u20131984 series of his mixtapes. In recent interviews, he has suggested a preference for the term \"freestyle\" rather than Afro, and he makes a distinction between cosmic and his style, claiming that cosmic music is the sound of mid-1980s and later pretenders, is a misnomer popular only outside of Italy, and isn\u2019t even a real genre.Ashton. (Loda:) \u201cMost people around the world consider me a \u2018cosmic\u2019 DJ but this is not true. \u2018Cosmic\u2019 music is a kind of music and also a sort of German collective (founded by an Austrian DJ) with whom I have no connections. In fact, cosmic music doesn\u2019t actually exist! Most people outside the Italian borders consider cosmic music a mixture of electronic/pop/progressive and new-wave which I played during the first hour at Typhoon club. It\u2019s obviously also popular in the Cosmic Club itself. Personally, I think that this terminology is reductive and I don\u2019t like it because the movement which also included cosmic was much wider and articulated and was more commonly known as \u2018Afro\u2019. This movement was based in the North of Italy in the Typhoon disco, a popular meeting point for many DJs and a starting point for new kinds of music, at least until 1987\u2026\u201dCampbell. (Loda:) \u201cI think the term cosmic music (often used outside of Italy) is not the most accurate way to define the melange of electronic/new wave/prog/pop that was very popular here in the 80\u2019s (and which I played a lot at cosmic and during the first hour of my sets).\u201dTantum. \u201cThe Afro sound is sometimes lumped in with the similar \u2018cosmic disco\u2019, another wide-ranging sonic cioppino that was centered around Lazise, Italy\u2019s Cosmic Club in the same era, championed by DJs such as Daniele Baldelli and Stefano Secchi. But Loda disavows any connection (even though he briefly played at Cosmic), or that cosmic even ranks as a genre. \u2018I say that the so-called cosmic style doesn\u2019t exist at all,\u2019 he claims. \u2018It\u2019s just a completely wrong designation, mainly used outside Italy, to indicate that mix of electronica, new wave, pop and progressive that I used to play at Cosmic.\u2019\u201d Baldelli claims that during his military service around 1984, there was a \u201cguest\u201d DJ who became famous playing Baldelli\u2019s selections at Cosmic Club.Wang. (Baldelli:) \u201cWell, at first I was the sole resident DJ, and only after 2 years did we have to bring in another person, because I had military service. But people know that this guy \u2014 let\u2019s call him Tibicci \u2014 just played records which I chose for him. I don\u2019t know why \u2014 well, because I would spend all day in the shop looking for music, stay at home listening to records, and then in the evening I would say to him, you can play this, this record will work for you. He also got a bit famous from doing this, but now, I no longer have any connection with this person. He\u2019s not really a good friend anymore.\u201d Baldelli's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Claudio \u2018TBC\u2019 Tosi Brandi, performed at Cosmic Club around that time, as did Beppe Loda. Loda counters that no one person invented the genre and style of mixing; he says he coined the term Afro in 1979 to collectively refer to the eclectic, African-influenced music that he and other Northern Italian DJs were playing at the time,Campbell. (Loda:) \u201c\u2026each of us would lean more in one direction: towards electronic music, jazz, funk, Brazilian music, African music, reggae, etc. No one had yet defined what we were doing as a group, though. I \u2026 developed an interest in African/tribal music. I was very impressed by a mixed (European/African) group of percussionists I saw in Amsterdam. I also noticed the \u201cAfro\u201d hair salons in the Pigalle neighborhood of Paris. Many of us loved and played a lot of afrobeat (Fela, Dibango, Olatunji) and I realized, when you think about it, almost all the music we were playing had African roots. People kept asking me, \u2018What do you call this melting pot of music?\u2019 I connected the dots and my Afro series of mix tapes was born. So you see, no one DJ can claim to be the originator of the Afro style. It is the result of the ideas and efforts of a group of DJs. I can only claim to have contributed my part and a general term to define it. My new style of DJing was born at Le Cupole in 1979 and, yes, it was a mix of different styles, but it was not the Afro style as a whole.\u201d and later applied it to the integration of Baldelli\u2019s electronic style with his own.Campbell. (Loda:) \u201cMy short residence at Cosmic would be crucial to what people now call Cosmic music. It was at that time that Baldelli\u2019s electronic style melded with my own Afro style \u2014 a term I came up with before Typhoon while playing at Le Cupole in Manerbio.\u201dNishimura. (Loda:) \u201cBy 1979, I had started a weird mix of musical genres at Le cupole discotheque at Manerbio and proceeded with such musical proposals at Bisbi and Good Moon \u2026 I kept these same vibes at \u2018Typhoon\u2019 thereby improving both the proposal and the techniques, and in 1982, \u2018Afro\u2019 music got to \u2026 success thanks in the beginning, also to a series of my tapes known of course as \u2018Afro\u2019. The term \u2018Afro\u2019 was born out of the need to define with a single keyword, the mix of various alternative musical genres the other DJs and I used to play in that period. \u2018Afro\u2019 is therefore a container holding various alternative musical genres and which well identifies the DJ\u2019s mixed style.\u201d The liner notes of a mid-2000s Cosmic Club tribute album featuring Baldelli uses both Afro and cosmic in reference to the music. \u201cAll of the trend setters of the Peninsula booked a Saturday evening at Cosmic, anxious to participate and listen to that musical phenomenon labelled \u2018Afro\u2019. Naturally, even if it is still used today, this term was inappropriate, unless one considers Afro as the only root which influenced the various musical styles of Daniele Baldelli. In fact, even if various periods in the history of \u2018cosmic\u2019 can be distinguished (that of funky\u2013disco in the first year to that of electronic in 1980\u201382, followed by moments more influenced by reggae, fusion, jazz and Brazil), [here the author clearly borrows one of Baldelli's quotes from the Wang interview] Daniele Baldelli\u2019s Afro style was expressed when he played Ravel\u2019s bolero overlapping it with a track by Africa Djola, or an experimental piece by Steve Reich on which he would mix a Malinke chant from New Guinea. Mixing the T-Connection with Moebius and Rodelius, discovering in the album Izitso the only hypnotic- tribal track by Cat Stevens, extracting Africa from Depeche Mode by playing them at 33 rpm or vice versa by creating music using a Reggae voice played at 45 rpm. Mixing 20 or so African tracks on the same electronic drum pattern or by playing them together in batucada with Kraftwerk, using the same electronic effects of a synthesiser to overlap pieces by Miram Makeba, Jorge Ben or Fela Kuti and also by uniting the Indian melodies of Ofra Haza or Sheila Chandra with the German electronic sounds of SKY RECORD.\u201d The term \"afro-cosmic\" was also used by one music journalist in 2006 to describe the late-1960s/early-1970s music of saxophonist Pharoah Sanders. ==Regional variations and gatherings== In 1983, after hearing the music in Italy, Austrian DJ Enne and Stefan \"Cosmic-Dieter-Bohlen\" Egger brought it to the club Galaxy in Innsbruck, Austria, and at some point introduced it to German audiences while on tour. Beginning in 1987, Egger started mixing it with more straightforward, slightly faster (but still relatively slow) dance records of the day. His style, once dubbed \"Eben cosmic music\" by Hannes Alshut & Rob Neureiter, remains popular in Austria and Southern Germany to the present day. Regular gatherings of Afro/cosmic enthusiasts have occurred in Germany, Austria and Italy since the music's early days. Afroraduno, the first such gathering of Afroraduni, took place in Gambara, Brescia (Italy) in 1983.Paolo Scotti's liner notes for the Typhoon: Portrait of the Electronic Years compilation CD (2008). ==Selected discography== * Daniele Baldelli \u2013 COSMIC: The Original 1979\u20131984 2-CD compilation + book * Daniele Baldelli presents Baia degli Angeli 1977\u20131978 compilation + book * Daniele Baldelli presents Baia degli Angeli 1977\u20131978 vol. 2 compilation + book * Elaste vol. 1 \u2013 Slow Motion Disco: Originals from the Cosmic Era, compiled by DJ Mooner compilation * Typhoon: Portrait of the Electronic Years compilation by Beppe Loda * Roberto-Lodola-Mondo Blu-TheGoldenYears compilation mixed by Roberto Lodola * Roberto-Lodola-Mondo Blu-TheGoldenYears 2 compilation mixed by Roberto Lodola * Roberto-Lodola-Mondo Blu-TheGoldenYears 3 compilation mixed by Roberto Lodola ==See also== * Balearic beat ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * * (in German); (in English); also published in Romanian, in the magazine OMAGIU. * and questions 8\u201316; both retrieved on 2007-11-05 * * * * and * * Category:20th-century music genres Category:Disco Category:Italian popular music ",
