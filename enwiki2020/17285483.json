    "text": "is a Japanese trance song sung by Lia, written by Jun Maeda, composed by Shinji Orito, and arranged by Kazuya Takase. The song was recorded at Paramount Studio in Los Angeles by the visual novel studio Key through their record label Key Sounds Label for use as the opening theme of Key's 2000 visual novel Air. A short version of the song was first released on I've Sound's July 2000 compilation album Verge. The full version of \"Tori no Uta\" first appeared on the limited edition remix album Ornithopter (September 2000) originally bundled with the first printing release of the Air game, though \"Tori no Uta\" was not remixed on the album. The song was later widely distributed on the Air Original Soundtrack (2002), the soundtrack of the visual novel. The song was later featured as the opening theme to the Air anime series in 2005. The Japanese variety radio show Moteken used \"Tori no Uta\" as the ending theme to their October 15, 2007 broadcast. Shinji Orito commented on the song in the Air Original Soundtrack booklet where he remarked, \"Even though I have made up my mind that the song \"Tori no Uta\" best captures the themes of Air, arriving at this was extremely difficult. Besides being under a lot of pressure, I'm still quite inexperienced in the field of music; this is the area I want to become stronger in most of all.\"Untranslated quote: ==Musical structure== Example of the first key shift from B minor to G-sharp minor between measures 26 and 27. \"Tori no Uta\" is the longest track featured in Air, spanning 6:08 minutes. \"Tori no Uta\" is a trance song in common time which begins in the B minor key and waits until the eighth measure for Lia to begin singing. The song is kept in B minor for the first verse, shifts to G-sharp minor for the second, and again shifts to the previous key's supertonic, A-sharp minor (or enharmonically B-flat minor) for the third, then after a brief modulation to C-sharp minor, continues into the first measure of the fourth verse where it shifts back to B minor for the rest of the verse. After a short break, the key goes back to G-sharp minor and continues the same pattern as before. At the end of this sequence in verse seven, the first verse is repeated as the sole chorus in B minor. An instrumental coda is used to close the song which lasts for about one-sixth of the entire piece's length. The song's instrumentation primarily uses a synthesizer as a base, but does include a short piano sequence lasting for the first eight measures, along with piano accompaniment throughout the song. The song moves at 122 beats per minute, and Lia's vocal range spans almost two octaves from F-sharp4 to D6. ==Release history== \"Tori no Uta\" has been released many times in original and remix versions. The song was first released as a shortened version spanning 3:09 minutes on I've Sound's July 2000 compilation album Verge.

Yu's current album, The Best of Shaun Yu, features a track called \"Melody\" which sounds like the Air theme. Though Key made no official statement at the time, an investigation was initiated. On September 21, 2005, it was reported that a second song on The Best of Shaun Yu may have been plagiarized from a song composed by Hiroyuki T\u014dshima, \"Tenshi no Kyujitsu\". Yu had stated that his producers, YesMusic, had arranged both tracks, and that he was unaware of the situation. YesMusic, in turn, had stated that it licensed the rights to the song from Key/VisualArt's for mainland China distribution, but that the album came out in Taiwan before licensing could be arranged for that territory. However, Key/VisualArt's denied this, as per a statement on Key's website: :Official Announcement Regarding Plagiarism of \"Tori no Uta\": :Thank you very much for supporting products of our humble company. According to information provided by fans, we've learned that Shaun Yu's distributed by Sony BMG Entertainment (Taiwan) is suspected plagiarizing our music\u2014\"Tori no Uta\". We apologize for worrying supporting fans. We have filed a formal complaint to Sony BMG Entertainment and made following demands: :*Apologize publicly on the web. :*Credit the composer of \"Tori no Uta\" to Shinji Orito clearly. :*If the above two requirements are fulfilled, we will not ask for financial compensations. :We have been negotiating with Sony BMG Entertainment (Taiwan) with those terms. Regrettably, Tommy Chi, director of YesMusic, the production company of this CD, has made a false announcement today that he had purchased distribution rights from us. It is a pity and is regrettable. In order to show our objection to his plagiarizing actions and his dishonest attitude, we shall not license any of our creation to them, including Tori no Uta. These days, we have received supports from both Japanese and Taiwanese fans. You have our immense gratitude. Please keep supporting our humble company, Key, in the future. :Translation from Anime News Network, not the official website. On September 29, 2005, Sony BMG Taiwan posted a statement of apology in both Chinese and Japanese on their official website. CD shipments were cancelled and recalled. ==Notes and references== ==External links== *Key Sounds Label's official website *Lia's personal website Category:2000 songs Category:Key Sounds Label Category:Lia (singer) songs Category:New-age songs Category:Trance songs ",
