On 27 July 1941, Bogunovi\u0107, who was forester before the World War II, commanded the Serb rebels who captured Bosansko Grahovo from Usta\u0161e. He joined Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland (Chetniks) and became the commander of the \"Gavrilo Princip\" Chetnik Regiment, a part of Dinara Chetnik Division. After about a year the regiment under his control became a brigade. In 1942 Bogunovi\u0107 was awarded by Slobodan Jovanovi\u0107, president of the Yugoslav Government in Exile with Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star, while commander of the Dinara Chetnik Division, Ilija Trifunovi\u0107 Bir\u010danin promoted Bogunovi\u0107 to rank of voivode. With main intention to save Serbs from their most bloodthirsty enemy - Usta\u0161e, Bogunovi\u0107 and other local Chetnik commanders had temporarily to accept rule of Italians and Germans. This strategy did not suite revolutionary aims of communist forces who sentenced Bogunovi\u0107 to death. In December 1944 Bogunovi\u0107 was captured by the communists and died in prison in 1945. == Early life == Before the World War II, Bogunovi\u0107 was forester.:\"Pukom \u00bb Gavrilo Princip \u00ab komandovao je Brane Bogunovi\u0107 ( po zanimanju lugar ) sa sjedi\u0161tem u Bosanskom Grahovu .\" == During the World War II== Bogunovi\u0107 was one of the commanders of the rebel units during the Drvar uprising.
