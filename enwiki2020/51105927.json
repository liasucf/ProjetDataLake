Oxford University Press, June 2016. Web. 18 July 2016. and \u03b3\u03c1\u1fd6\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2 (gr\u00eephos, pl. \u03b3\u03c1\u1fd6\u03c6\u03bf\u03b9 gr\u00eephoi). The two terms are often used interchangeably, though some ancient commentators tried to distinguish between them.Christine Luz, 'What has it got in its Pocketses? Or, What Makes a Riddle a Riddle?', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 83-99 (pp 96-98). Riddles appear to have been a popular component of ancient symposia, and have at various points in the history of the Greek-speaking world also been a significant literary form. ==Ancient period== ===Sources=== Most surviving ancient Greek riddles are in verse.Christine Luz, 'What has it got in its Pocketses? Or, What Makes a Riddle a Riddle?', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 83-99 (p. 84). Though there may already have been anthologies of riddles written down in the Hellenistic period, these do not survive.Jan Kwapisz, 'Were there Hellenistic Riddle Books?', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 148-67. By far the largest extant collection of Antique Greek riddles is Book 14 of the Greek Anthology, as preserved in Codex Parisianus suppl. Graecus 384, which contains about 50 verse riddles.E. S. Forster, 'Riddles and Problems from the Greek Anthology', Greece & Rome, 14 (1945), 42-47. They are in a group of about 150 puzzles: the first fifty or so are oracles; the second fifty or so are arithmetical problems; and the third fifty or so riddles in the traditional sense. The date when this compilation was originally made is uncertain, and the dates of individual riddles even less clear: the oldest may go back to Archaic Greek, the youngest to Byzantine;Christine Luz, 'What has it got in its Pocketses? Or, What Makes a Riddle a Riddle?', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 83-99 (p. 83, n. 1). but the emergence of the compilation in its present form is generally associated with Constantine Cephalas, working in the tenth century.Jan Kwapisz, 'Were there Hellenistic Riddle Books?', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 148-67 (p. 148). Most concern everyday objects such as smoke, a fish, a mirror, wine, or pipes; the second largest group concern mythological figures, taxing the audience's knowledge of the details of their stories.Christine Luz, 'What has it got in its Pocketses? Or, What Makes a Riddle a Riddle?', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 83-99 (pp. 91-93). It is likely that among the forerunners of the Greek Anthology, the ninth-century anthology of Cephalus contained riddles.A. Cameron, The Greek Anthology from Meleager to Planudes (Oxford: Clarendon, 1993) 207-16. Allegedly, Athenaeus of Naucratis (fl. c. 200 AD) compiled a copious anthology of ancient Greek riddles citing some 1,250 authors under the title Epitome. ===Ancient riddles and riddle- culture=== According to Naerebout and Beerden, > In the competitive Greek societies, words were a primary locus of > competition: there can be no doubt about the popularity of wordplay in the > Greek world. Riddles shared in this popularity: sympotic riddles are > particularly well attested--it seems there was no symposium without a fair > number of riddles. The contest-riddle was a known form of riddling. So > riddling pervaded Greek life on many levels and during many > occasions.Frederick G. Naerebout and Kim Beerden, ' \"Gods Cannot Tell Lies\": > Riddling and Ancient Greek Divination', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and > Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and > Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 121-47 (p. 140). A key source for this culture is Athenaeus.Erin Sebo, 'In scirpo nodum: Symphosius\u2019 Reworking of the Riddle Form', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski, Beitr\u00e4ge zur Altertumskunde (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 184-95 (p. 184). The most famous Classical riddle is the Riddle of the Sphinx: Oedipus killed the Sphinx by grasping the answer to the riddle it posed.Oedipus Tyrannus, lines 380 onward. This is just one example, however, of a considerable body of riddlic oracles in Ancient Greek literature: the gods' enigmatic answers to people asking questions of oracles appears to have been a significant literary trope, amongst other things a way to warn listeners of the perils and difficulties of seeking divine guidance.Frederick G. Naerebout and Kim Beerden, ' \"Gods Cannot Tell Lies\": Riddling and Ancient Greek Divination', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 121-47. Heraclitus's enigmatic style overlaps to some extent with riddles.Lisa Maurizio, \u2018Technopaegnia in Heraclitus and the Delphic Oracles: Shared Compositional Techniques', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 100-120. Although Plato reports that ancient Greek children did indeed engage in riddle play (Republic 479c), he also recognized the important function that riddles can play in showing what cannot literally be said about ultimate truths (Letters, book 2, 312d). Aristotle considered riddles important enough to include discussion of their use in his Rhetoric. He describes the close relationship between riddles and metaphors: \"Good riddles do, in general, provide us with satisfactory metaphors; for metaphors imply riddles, and therefore a good riddle can furnish a good metaphor\".1405b4-6; cf. 1458a; cf. Christine Luz, 'What has it got in its Pocketses? Or, What Makes a Riddle a Riddle?', in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 83-99 (p. 97). Aristotle is not known to have composed riddles, but 'among his pseudepigrapha there apparently was a collection of metaphorical, riddle-like phrases and expressions', now lost. Some of the riddles in the Greek Anthology may date back to the ancient period. The following, for example, is an example of the widespread year-riddle attributed to Cleobulus (fl. C6 BCE): > There is one father and twelve children; of these each > Has twice thirty daughters of different appearance: > Some are white to look at and the others black in turn; > They are immortal and yet they all fade away.Quoted from Christine Luz, > 'What has it got in its Pocketses? Or, What Makes a Riddle a Riddle?', in > The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan > Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. > 83-99 (p. 86). (The answer is the year and its days and nights.) Other examples from the Greek Anthology, as translated by E. S. Forster, include: > My mother I bring forth, she brings forth me: > I'm sometimes greater, sometimes less than she. (xiv.41) > I look at you whene'er you look at me; > You see but I see not; no sight have I; > I speak but have no voice; your voice is heard; > My lips can only open uselessly. (iv.56) > One wind there is: ten sailors row amain > Two vessels, and one steersman steers the twain. (xiv.14) > I am a black child sprung from a bright sire, > A wingless bird, fleeting to heaven from earth. > Each eye that meets me weeps, but not from grief, > And in thin air I vanish at my birth. (xiv.5) > A blackened lump am I-and fire begat me: > My mother was a tree on mountain steep. > I save from wounds the chariot of the sea, > If my sire melts me in a vessel deep. (xiv.61) The answer are: night and day; a reflection in a mirror; double flute played by one person with ten fingers; smoke; pitch, used for caulking ships.E. S. Forster, 'Riddles and Problems from the Greek Anthology', Greece & Rome, 14 (1945), 42-47 (pp. 43-44). The last of Greece's known literary non-Christian riddle-masters is the Emperor Julian. ==Byzantine period== Greek riddles copied by the Byzantine monk Maximus Planudes in the last two decades of the thirteenth century in Florence, Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, Plutei 32.16, f. 382v. Literary riddles were also composed in Byzantium, from perhaps the tenth century with the work of John Geometres, into the fifteenth century, along with a neo-Byzantine revival in around the early eighteenth century. There was a particular peak around the long twelfth century: Christopher of Mytilene's \u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03c7\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 ('Various Verses') contain riddles, while John Mauropous, Michael Psellos, Basilios Megalomites, Theodore Prodromos, Eustathios Makrembolites, and Manuel Moschopoulos were all part of this movement.Archer Taylor, The Literary Riddle before 1600 (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1948), pp. 42-52. In form, > Byzantine riddles differ from classical ones more in terms of metre than in > terms of subject-matter. [...] The structure of the riddle is basically the > same. Most often a riddle is built around a paradoxical or ironical > antithesis. The subject nearly always speaks of itself in the first person > (in a personified form). Its speech usually begins with an explanation of > its origins, provenance, birth, etc., in terms like: 'my mother was such- > and-such, my father is so-and-so', or 'without my mother's help my father > has given birth to me' (a very popular formula). At the end of its speech > the subject will occasionally address the reader and dare him to use his > brains and find the correct answer. ===Forms and subjects=== The main edition of Byzantine riddles, by \u010celica Milovanovi\u0107, covers 214 of about 300 known riddles. Milovanovi\u0107 divides the corpus into the following genres, and identifies riddles on the following subjects (alongside 29 without a known solution [nos. 186-214]; the lists below give the numbers of each riddle in her edition).\u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1: \u0412\u0438\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0458\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043a\u0435 [Byzantina aenigmata: Vizantijske zagonetke/\u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03b9\u03bd\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1: Les \u00c9nigmes Byzantines, ed. and trans.

When shut I am silent, but I speak when you unfold me. Ares alone is the confidant of my conversation', where Ares is not only the name of a god, but a poetic term for a stylus.

In some cases, this involves subtracting a letter from a word. Thus a riddle attributed to Basilos Megalomites says 'A tiny animal, I am not edible; my name consists of three letters only; should you take away the first of my letters, I'd be a large one, and ready for eating'. The answer is both \u03bc\u03c5\u03c2 ('mouse') and \u03c5\u03c2 ('hog').

This corpus is attested from the early fifth century onwards. One example of the form runs 'Who upon dying was not buried, and yet was not stinking? The wife of Lot, fleeing from Sodom, became a pillar of salt and is standing to this day'. Adam 171 182; Adam and Eve 152 161; baptism in the Jordan 184; body and soul 151 177; Cain and Abel 158; Christ and the Virgin 150; Christ and the Thieves 165; Christ and the Samaritan 164; Christ and Salome 172; clapper 168; death 163; earth and sky 148; Eve 170; fish in the sea 167; flood 146; grain and mill 169; St Helen and the Holy Cross 160; John the Baptist 159; John the Baptist and Christ 149; the prophet Jonah 176; Judas and the Rooster 147; Lot's wife 173; meeting of the Mother of God and Elizabeth 180; the miracle of Moses on the Red Sea 157; month 153; Noah's Ark 162 185; Peter, Adam and David 156; saliva 116; shrimp 110; song 114; sea 166; sleep 181; soul 179; suffering of Christ 155; Tobit 145; truth 174; twelve months 178; the Virgin 154; world (cosmos) 175; year 183. ==Modern Greek== A key collection of modern Greek riddles is N. G. Polites, 'Demode Ainigmata', in Neohellenika Analekta, I (Athens, 1870), 193-256. ==Influence== It is likely that Greek riddles were among the influences on the seventh- to eighth-century Anglo-Latin poet Aldhelm. ==Editions and translations== * Beta, Simone, 'An Enigmatic Literature: Interpreting an Unedited Collection of Byzantine Riddles in a Manuscript of Cardinal Bessarion (Marcianus Graecus 512)', Dumbarton Oaks Papers, 68 (2014), 211-240 * Beckby, H. 1968.
