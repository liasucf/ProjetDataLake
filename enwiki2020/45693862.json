    "text": "Chandler Bats are wooden baseball bats made by the company Chandler. On June 27, 2019, Yoenis C\u00e9spedes acquired the company after the original owners filed for bankruptcy. Chandler is an American manufacturer located in East Norriton, Pennsylvania, and was founded in 2010 by David Chandler. Chandler Bats are made out of two types of wood: maple and ash. They are a product of RxSport. == History == Furniture maker David Chandler opened of Chandler bats in 2010. David started RxSport in Germantown, Pennsylvania, and quickly turned around to get into making Chandler bats in Norristown. In the first year that Chandler bats were available on the public market, they sold 11,000 bats out of a warehouse. Chandler has increased production every year since their opening. In 2013, the company received a $500,000 investment from Benjamin Franklin Technology Partners of Southeastern Pennsylvania for expansion. A large portion of these funds was put towards purchasing more raw materials, maple and ash wood, in an effort to further increase production of bats. Chandler has partnered with EvoShield, a baseball apparel and equipment company, to make a new bat, the EvoShield Swing Series. They are also looking to expand beyond strictly wood bats, and are exploring the idea of creating metal bats. On June 27, 2019, Yoenis C\u00e9spedes acquired the assets of Chandler Bat Company after they filed for bankruptcy earlier that year. == Chandler Baseball == Once the company established itself, Chandler decided it was going to start its own local youth baseball organization. Chandler Baseball is an organization that gives young baseball players in the Philadelphia area a chance to showcase their skills. The teams play in different tournaments throughout the United States. ==References== Category:Manufacturing companies based in Pittsburgh Category:Sporting goods brands Category:2010 establishments in Pennsylvania ",
