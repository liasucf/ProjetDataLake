    "text": "Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Bednov (, ; 29 August 1969 \u2013 1 January 2015) was a rebel commander of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic in Ukraine. He was the leader of the pro-Russian Batman Rapid Response Group. He was assassinated in Luhansk, with conflicting reports on who was responsible. ==Death== Bednov commanded the Rapid Response Group \"Batman\" (also known as the Batman Battalion) until he was killed in an attack on his convoy on 1 January 2015. Members of the group said that the attack was ordered by head of the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) Igor Plotnitsky. According to them, Bednov and his fighters were killed \"by order of Plotnitsky\" because he was \"ordered to sweep all intransigent commanders.\" Following this attack, the LPR arrested some of Bednov's men, and dissolved the battalion. Some of its personnel were dispersed into other LPR units, while Donetsk People's Republic field commanders Givi and Motorola invited former members to join their battalions. After Bednov's assassination, Igor Girkin criticized the killing as a \"murder\" and \"gangster ambush\", and suggested that other commanders seriously consider leaving Donbass to Russia, as he did. == See also == * Separatist forces of the war in Donbass * * Roman Voznik * Aleksey Mozgovoy * * * Gennadiy Tsypkalov * Arsen Pavlov * Valery Bolotov * List of unsolved murders * Mikhail Tolstykh * Alexander Zakharchenko ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== Category:1969 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Male murder victims Category:People from Luhansk Category:People murdered in Ukraine Category:People of Antimaidan Category:People of the Luhansk People's Republic Category:Pro-Russian people of the 2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine Category:Pro-Russian people of the war in Donbass Category:Unsolved murders in Ukraine ",
