    "text": "The Mayor of Rione Sanit\u00e0 () is a 2019 Italian crime drama film directed by Mario Martone, based on the 1960 play of the same name by Eduardo De Filippo. It's intended as a modern take on the play, inspired by the theatrical adaptation directed by Martone in 2018, with several members of the cast returning. It was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 76th Venice International Film Festival. ==Plot== In the Rione Sanit\u00e0 neighborhood of Naples, Antonio Barracano \u2013known as \u201cThe Mayor\u201d\u2013 is an undisputed authority amongst both common people and the Camorra, whose job is to settle disputes outside the law, even by unorthodox methods. When he's asked to help a young man determined to kill his father, however, Barracano will have to make a choice regarding his self-imposed moral code. ==Cast== == Release == The film will have its world premiere on 30 August 2019 at the Venice International Film Festival. It will have a limited release in Italy from 30 September to 2 October 2019 by Nexo Digital. == Reception == The film received an eight- minute standing ovation during its premiere in Venice. Game Today Magazine prized the acting proof of the cast ensemble, in particularly the performance of Francesco Di Leva, and defined the film: \"[...] a Greek tragedy philologically wiped out by shootings, blood and violence , all kept off- screen. A chamber drama of funereal impassivity but of moral heartbeats fortunately more visceral than verbose [...]\". Cineuropa wrote that: \"At a great distance from the Gomorra of television, Martone's film is a story without time or place, about guilt, redemption and hope \u2014 as shown by the protagonist\u2019s responsible gesture at the film\u2019s end, open and non-pacifying, and which De Filippo, already 60 years ago, had written without any sense of false optimism. With The Mayor of Rione Sanit\u00e0, the Neapolitan director once more creates a contact between cinema and theatre, inspired by Polanski, Fassbinder, Kurosawa and certainly Hitchcock, moving his characters in large but closed spaces, and putting them in focus with lengthy close-ups\". The Hollywood Reporter's Deborah Young wrote that Martone's film: \"[..] is a challenging work whose verbal violence is engrossing but also repellent. It is certainly one of the director\u2019s more successful films, but it suffers from the same intellectual barriers that have made his work so difficult to access for general audiences. As fascinating as the actors\u2019 performances are to watch, their meaning is not so easy to interpret, and many willing viewers will leave the film more bemused than enlightened\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 films Category:2019 crime drama films Category:Italian films Category:Italian crime drama films Category:Italian films based on plays Category:Italian-language films Category:Films about the Camorra Category:Films directed by Mario Martone ",
