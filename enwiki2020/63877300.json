    "text": "The Wali Negara of Pasundan (literally 'State Guardian', ) was the head of state and the highest political office in the short-lived State of Pasundan (1948-1950). According to the Regulations of the Constitutional Organization of Pasundan, the Wali Negara has the authority to dissolve the Parliament, appoint and discharge the Prime Minister, enact decrees, and submit law drafts and the state budget to the Parliament. If the Wali Negara dies or resigns prior to the end of the term, the Speaker of the Parliament, who also acts as the Deputy Wali Negara, replaces his position. == History == === Election === The first election to the position of Wali Negara was held on 4 March 1948, during the Third West Java Conference. There were two candidates competing in this election, nominated by different factions between the delegates. Wiranatakusumah V, former Chairman of the Supreme Advisory Council, was nominated by the unitary faction, while Hilman Djajadiningrat, former Regent of Sukabumi, was nominated by the federalist faction. Wiranatakusumah won the election by 54 to 46 votes. The Speaker of the Parliament, Djuarsa, broadcast the results of the election to the territory of the Republic of Indonesia, and stated that Wiranatakusumah has a week to accept his election. Even though the Republic of Indonesia government consider the election undemocratic, Wiranatakusumah was given permission by the Indonesian government to accept his election. Thus, the government of Pasundan send a group of three, consisted of Soejoso, Adil Puradiredja, and Thung Jie Leh, to Jogjakarta and escort Wiranatakusumah to the State of Pasundan. Although initially Wiranatakusumah went against the formation of the State of Pasundan, he and the Indonesia government accepted it because considering that it was better for the position to fall on someone pro-Indonesian rather than falling to pro- Dutch people such as Hilman. Masjkur, the Minister of Religious Affairs of Indonesia, stated that the \"victory of Wiranatakusumah in the State of Pasundan is also the victory of the Republic of Indonesia\". His position as the Chairman of the Supreme Advisory Council of Indonesia was relieved, and was given to Ario Soerjo. === Arrival === On 19 March 1948, Wiranatakusumah finally arrived in the Andir Airfield (now Husein Sastranegara International Airport) in Bandung. He was greeted by the populace of the State of Pasundan. Unexpectedly, a rousing welcome accompanied by a cry of Merdeka (which was an Indonesian salute) prompted the Dutch to arrest several teachers and students who were thought to be responsible for these cry. === Inauguration === The inauguration of Wiranatakusumah was done on 24 April 1948. The inauguration was attended by the Lieutenant Governor General of the Dutch East Indies, Hubertus van Mook, the General Secretary of the Provisional Federal Government, Abdul Kadir Widjojoatmodjo, and the head of the Recomba (transitional government) of West Java, Hilman Djajadiningrat. == Resignation == After the formation of the United States of Indonesia, there war a growing demand by the Pasundan populace to dissolve the state.
