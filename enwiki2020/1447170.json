He primarily played as left midfielder, but was also often deployed as a left-back. Babi\u0107 began his senior career with Osijek in 1997. However, he only made 16 league appearances before moving to Germany to join Bayer Leverkusen. He became a regular for the club, and made 144 league appearances before joining Spanish side Real Betis. He was less successful here, and made 12 league appearances in two years, while his spells at Hertha BSC and Real Zaragoza were brief. In 2010, Babi\u0107 returned to Osijek, but struggled to re-establish himself, and made just 26 league appearances in two years. A switch to LASK Linz followed in 2013, but this yielded just eight league matches before he left the club and afterwards retiring from professional football. Having represented Croatia at under-15, under-17, under-18, under-19, and under-20 levels between 1996 and 2001, Babi\u0107 made his under-21 and senior international debut in 2002, and made 49 appearances for the senior international appearances. However, he was omitted from Croatia's UEFA Euro 2008 squad, and did not play for the national team ever again.

Real Betis presented the player to the press and fans on 17 July 2007. Early reports suggested he had signed on a free transfer as his contract had ended. On 23 July 2007, Babi\u0107 made his Betis debut in a friendly match against San Fernando. His competitive debut came in the La Liga season against Recreativo de Huelva on 26 August 2007. In January 2009, Babi\u0107 left Spain to play for Hertha BSC on a free transfer and gave up the non-EU quota to Ricardo Oliveira. He left Hertha six months later. On 8 August 2009, he signed a two-year contract with Real Zaragoza. On 6 September 2010 his contract was terminated. On 2 March 2011, Babi\u0107 signed a one-and-a-half-year contract with former club Osijek. After leaving Osijek in 2012, he signed with Austrian club LASK Linz, for who he played until 2013, after which he decided to retire from professional football at tha age of 32. ==International career== Babi\u0107 made his Croatia national team debut in May 2002 against Hungary. He was part of the Croatian squad at UEFA Euro 2004, but did not make an appearance. He played all three matches at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, stationed as a left wing-back in a 3\u20135\u20132 formation.
