No. 264. p. 4810 == Biography == Peliti's restaurant in Calcutta, Pelity was born in Carignano. Descended from a family of surveyors from Valganna, Peliti studied sculpture under Vincenzo Vela at the Accademia Albertina in Turin. He graduated in 1865 and joined the Third Italian War of Independence as a cavalier in the 1st Nizza regiment. Here he met some confectioners and pastry makers and learned theirs skills. Richard Bourke, V Earl of Mayo, Viceroy of British India in 1869 searched for a chef in Paris and held a competition which was won by Peliti. Peliti then moved to India and settled in Calcutta. In 1872, his employer Lord Mayo was assassinated and Peliti established O'Neill & Peliti, a bakery at No. 41 Bentinck Street. The partnership broke up and Peliti moved to 18/1 Chowringhee road in 1875. In 1881 he opened a restaurant at Esplanade East which became popular among British high society and in the same year he also extended his operations in Shimla, the summer capital of British India. The cafe which was next to the Combermere bridge in Shimla had a terrace overlooking the valley and was very popular. He built a home in Mashobra called Villa Carignano (after the place of his birth) where he stayed. He was much sought after caterer. He catered for a lunch hosted by the Prince of Wales in Burma in 1891. Peliti also took to the hotel industry by establishing Peliti's Grand Hotel in Shimla at Bentinck castle. In 1884 he started a company that canned food for export. In 1883\u20131884 he won a medal at the Calcutta International Exhibition for confectionery; another medal in 1889 at the Universal Exhibition in Paris, and in 1895 Calcutta. In 1898 he received three gold medals at the National Exhibition of Turin including one for his photography. Peliti also trained a few other Italian confectioners such as Angelo Firpo from Genoa who set up another restaurant in Calcutta. Felice Cornaglia, another associate took over the business in Bombay. He married Judith Molloy, the daughter of an Irish British-Indian government official. In 1902 he started a new office in Calcutta and then handed over management to his sons Edoardo and Federico. He then moved back to Carignano in Italy where he died in 1914. A road in Carignano is named after him. == In literature == Peliti's Grand Hotel at Shimla was destroyed in a fire in 1922. Peliti's restaurants were the centre of social activity both at Shimla and at Calcutta. The restaurant and cafe at Shimla was very popular with Shimla high society and Rudyard Kipling mentions Peliti's restaurant in several of his works. In his poem Divided Destinies (1885) he compares the life of a beggar with his (a Shimla resident's) and his beggar's claim to virtue is that he does not flirt with the wives of others at Peliti's. A poem to Peliti published in Punch magazine (1919) notes the flavour of the place. The restaurant at Calcutta was also a meeting place for some scholarly societies like the Calcutta Historical Society and the Institution of Electrical Engineers. == Photography == Peliti trained in photography under Felice Bardelli (1849\u20131910) and set up a photography lab at his villa in Mashobra. He took an interest in documenting the picturesque, ethnic and exotic subjects. He associated himself with the Photographic Society of Bombay and with other pioneering photographers including Felice Beato, Bourne & Shepherd, Lala Deen Dayal and others. He also documented his pastry creations and catering events. ==Notes== == References == * Hobbs, Harry (1938) Talkeetalkeewallahs and Others. Calcutta. * Miraglia, Marina (editor) 1995.
