    "text": "Cecil Alfred Ruddell (23 May 1917 \u2013 10 December 1990) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Essendon in the Victorian Football League (VFL) during the 1940s. Ruddell was a key player in Essendon's defence in what was a strong decade for the club, just once in his nine seasons did they miss out on the finals. Usually a fullback, it was in that position that he played in the Bomber's 1942 and 1946 premiership sides. He filled in as coach of Essendon for a game in 1945 and another the following season. An ankle injury ended his VFL career. He was later captain-coach of Camberwell in the Victorian Football Association for two seasons. ==References== * *Holmesby, Russell and Main, Jim (2007).
