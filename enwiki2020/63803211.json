    "text": "The gens Justinia was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. No members of this gens are mentioned in ancient writers, but several are known from inscriptions, chiefly from Gaul and Germania. ==Origin== The root of the nomen Justinius is the cognomen Justus, referring to someone known for being \"just\" or \"fair\".New College Latin & English Dictionary, s.v. justus. This was one of a large class of surnames derived from the character of an individual.Chase, pp. 110, 111. From the surname arose both Justinus, a diminutive cognomen, and the nomen Justius. Justinius must have been formed from one of these two, using the gentile-forming suffix ', which could form new gentilicia from either nomina or cognomina.Chase, pp. 125, 126. ==Praenomina== The only praenomina associated with the Justinii appearing in inscriptions are Marcus, Gaius, and Tiberius, of which the first two were very common at all periods of Roman history, while Tiberius was favoured by a smaller range of families. ==Members== * Justinia, named on a piece of pottery from Londinium in Britannia.. * Marcus Justinius Albus, mafe an offering to Nehalennia at Ganventa in Gallia Belgica, dating to the latter half of the second century, or the first half of the third., . * Justinius, made an offering to the local goddess near the present site of Pesch, near Bad M\u00fcnstereifel, formerly part of Germania Inferior, in the latter half of the second century, or the first half of the third.. * Justinia Eutychia, buried at Porolissum in Dacia, aged forty-five, in a tomb built by her husband, the decurion Livius Rufus, between AD 150 and 270.. * Justinia Apra, buried at Iuvavum in Noricum, aged thirty- seven, with a monument from her husband, Marcus Lollius Victor, dating between AD 150 and 300.. * Gaius Justinius Favor, along with Desiderata, perhaps his wife, made an offering to Jupiter Optimus Maximus and Juno Regina at Mogontiacum in Germania Superior.. * Tiberius Justinius Fortunatus, buried at Tucca in Mauretania Caesariensis, aged fifty-five, with a monument from his son.. * Justinia Justina, buried at Noviomagus Nemetum in Germania Superior, with a monument from her husband, Drombinius Sacer.. * Justinia Lupula, buried at Arelate in Gallia Narbonensis, with a monument from her husband, Fannius Paternus, a soldier in the Legio XXX Ulpia Victrix.. * Marcus Justinius Marcellus, an infant buried at Lugdunum in Gallia Lugdunensis, aged one year, forty-seven days, with a monument from his parents, Marcus Justinius Secundus and Primania Marcellina.. * Justinius Mercurialis, made an offering to the local Genius at Suromagus in Gallia Belgica.. * Justinia Paterna, dedicated a tomb for Firminus, perhaps her hussband, at the present site of Rheder, formerly part of Germania Inferior, between AD 170 and 230.. * Marcus Justinius Secundus, along with his wife, Primania Marcella, built a tomb at Lugdunum for their infant son, Marcus Justinius Marcellus. * Tiberius Justinius Titianus, a beneficarius, an administrative officer in the Legio XXII Primigenia, who along with Servandia Augusta, perhaps his wife, made an offering to Mercury at Mogontiacum in AD 210.
