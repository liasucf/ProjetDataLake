    "text": "Quintus Plautius was a Roman senator, who was active during the Principate. He was consul ordinarius for the year 36 as the colleague of Sextus Papinius Allenius.Alison E. Cooley, The Cambridge Manual of Latin Epigraphy (Cambridge: University Press, 2012), p. 460 Nothing more is known about his senatorial career. He was the son of Aulus Plautius suffect consul in 1 BC, and Vitellia, possibly the great-aunt of the future Roman emperor Aulus Vitellius. Quintus had an older brother, Aulus Plautius suffect consul in 29 and conqueror of Roman Britain, and a sister, Plautia, who has been identified as the wife of Publius Petronius, consul in 19 AD.Anthony Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981, p 38f Although the name of his wife is not known, Quintus Plautius has been identified as the father of two sons: * Plautius Lateranus, who was accused of an affair with Valeria Messalina in 48 AD, and was executed in 65 AD for involvement in the Pisonian conspiracy. * Another Aulus Plautius. Suetonius writes that he was murdered by Nero during the purges following the death of Poppaea Sabina in 65. Nero, before he put Aulus Plautius to death, subjected him to oral rape, after which he is said to have gloated, 'Now let my mother go and kiss my successor'; the suggestion being that Agrippina (though she had been murdered in 59 AD) had encouraged him to take Nero's position as Emperor.
