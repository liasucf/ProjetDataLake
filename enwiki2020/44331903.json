Oermann of MusicRow magazine gave the song a glowing review. \"The churning production is terrifically exciting,\" writes Oermann, \"Luckily, [Smith's] got the vocal chops to keep up with it, and the driving song has hooks aplenty.\" ==Commercial performance== In Canada, \"Wastin' Gas\" debuted and peaked at number forty-one on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100 on the chart issued November 15, 2014.
