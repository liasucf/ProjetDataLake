Teema & Fem is Yle's channel for culture, education, and science. It focuses on recordings of performing arts, classical music, art, and history documentaries, films, and themed programming. The channel also broadcasts Swedish-language news (including yle's Swedish- language evening bulletin TV-nytt), factual and children's programmes and entertainment. It also shows many Nordic films and series and Sami-language O\u0111\u0111asat. Finnish and Swedish subtitles are available for many programmes not originally in those respective languages.
