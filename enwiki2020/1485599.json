    "text": "Cl\u00e1udio Andr\u00e9 Mergen Taffarel (; born 8 May 1966) is a Brazilian retired footballer who played as a goalkeeper, and is the goalkeeping coach of the Brazil national team and Galatasaray. During an 18-year career he played professionally for five different clubs in both Brazil and Europe. He began his senior career in 1985 with Brazilian side Internacional, whereas his latter clubs were Parma, Reggiana, Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro, and Galatasaray; he ended his career in 2003, after a second spell with Italian team Parma. The recipient of more than 100 caps for Brazil, Taffarel helped the national team win the 1994 World Cup, also appearing in other eight major international tournaments over the course of one full decade, most notably helping Brazil to a second place in the 1998 World Cup, and two Copa Am\u00e9rica titles in 1989 and 1997; he also won a silver medal at the 1988 Summer Olympic Games. ==Club career== Born in Santa Rosa, Rio Grande do Sul, Taffarel began his career playing for Sport Club Internacional but only appeared in 14 S\u00e9rie A games during his five-year spell, being however awarded the Golden Ball award for the 1988 season. In 1990, he moved abroad and joined Parma A.C. in Italy, a club which had been freshly promoted to Serie A for the first time in its history; according to a 2003 article by Andrea Schianchi of La Gazzetta dello Sport, Taffarel's move to Parma was also carried out for commercial reasons, as at the time, Calisto Tanzi, the then\u2013owner of Parmalat \u2013 the company that owned the club \u2013, was looking to have the Brazilian goalkeeper become the face of the corporation's new advertising campaign following its recent expansion into Brazil. Taffarel became the first non\u2013Italian goalkeeper to play in Serie A, and proceeded to appear in all 34 league games in the following campaign under manager Nevio Scala, as the Emilia-Romagna side finished in sixth position and qualified to the UEFA Cup. He won the Coppa Italia in 1992 and the Cup Winners' Cup in 1993 during his first spell with the club, although following a series of unconvincing performances, and the regulations at the time that only allowed three non\u2013Italian players in the team's starting XI (with Faustino Asprilla, Tomas Brolin, and Georges Gr\u00fcn usually being selected to start by Scala), he was relegated to the bench over the course of the next two seasons, initially behind Marco Ballotta and later Luca Bucci. In 1993, Taffarel, now only a back-up at Parma, signed for fellow Serie A team A.C. Reggiana 1919, where he was first-choice throughout the following season in a narrow escape from relegation. However, he was subsequently dropped from the first team in 1994, and remained without a professional club in the run up to and following that year's World Cup in the United States, playing instead at amateur level with his local church team, and even featuring as a centre- forward on occasion. Afterwards, he returned to his home country in 1995 and played three years with Clube Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro. Aged 32, Taffarel returned to Europe and joined Galatasaray S.K., winning six major trophies during his three-year stint, most notably two S\u00fcper Lig titles and the 1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup; in the final of the latter competition \u2013 a 4\u20131 penalty shootout victory over Arsenal following a 0\u20130 draw after 120 minutes \u2013 he was chosen as Man of the match.Andre Claudio Taffarel (1966\u2013); at Galatasaray S.K. He closed out his career with former club Parma, joining the team in 2001; he mainly featured as a second-choice keeper behind S\u00e9bastien Frey during his second spell with the club, but started in both legs of the 2002 Coppa Italia Final, which saw Parma triumph over the newly crowned Serie A champions, Juventus. He retired in 2003, after one-and-a-half seasons with the club, at the age of 37, and after having refused an offer from Empoli FC: his car broke while he was going to sign the contract, which he later described as a \"sign of God\". ==International career== Taffarel made his debut for Brazil on 7 July 1988 in the Australia Bicentenary Gold Cup, playing all four games and conceding two goals as his team won the tournament. He was also in goal for the following year's Copa Am\u00e9rica, which Brazil also won (during his ten-year international career, he appeared in five editions of the latter tournament, winning the title for a second time in 1997, and collecting runners-up medals in 1991 and 1995). At the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, he won a silver medal, saving three penalties against West Germany in the semi-finals of the tournament: one in regulation time, and two in Brazil's successful shoot-out. He was also a member of the Brazilian team that took part at the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy, where Brazil were eliminated in the round of 16 following a 1\u20130 defeat to rivals and defending champions Argentina, with Taffarel conceding only two goals in total throughout the tournament. Taffarel was the starter for the nation during the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States, only allowing one goal in the first round and two in the knock-out phases, excluding two penalty kicks in the final shootout victory against Italy. Four years later, in France, he helped his national team to a second consecutive World Cup final, which proved to be his final international appearance; on this occasion, however, Brazil lost out 3\u20130 to the hosts. In the run-up to the final, Taffarel had notably saved two penalties in the team's 4\u20132 shootout victory over the Netherlands in the semi-finals. He was also a member of the Brazilian side that finished in third place at the 1998 CONCACAF Gold Cup. In total, Taffarel played 101 times with the Sele\u00e7\u00e3o, making him Brazil's most capped goalkeeper of all time, and one of the few Brazilian players to have made at least 100 caps for the national side.Claudio Andr\u00e9 Mergen Taffarel \u2013 Century of International Appearances; at RSSSF Upon his retirement in 2003, coach Carlos Alberto Parreira offered to arrange a farewell match but the player refused, stating that he was not interested in such fanfare; he did return to play alongside Rom\u00e1rio in late 2004 against Mexico, to commemorate the 1994 World Cup victory at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. ==Style of play== Regarded as one of the greatest Brazilian goalkeepers of all time, Taffarel was known to be a rational, effective, and generally consistent keeper, with good fundamental goalkeeping technique, who favoured an efficient rather than spectacular playing style. His main attributes were his explosive reflexes, positional sense, and calm composure in goal, as well as his penalty-stopping abilities; due to the muscle power in his legs that he developed while playing beach volleyball in his youth, he was known for his surprising spring and elevation from a standstill position, despite his modest stature, which gave him significant hang time and aided him in stopping penalties. Furthermore, he was known to be quick when coming off his line, and was also highly regarded for his flair and skill with the ball at his feet, having played as a forward in his youth. Due to his lack of height, however, as well as his poor handling and decision-making, he struggled at times when dealing with crosses, and was not particularly confident or decisive when coming off his line to catch high balls; as such, critical reception of Taffarel was often divided throughout his career. While he drew praise from the Brazilian fans and media for his decisive performances with the Brazilian national team, which even earned him the nickname \"Saint Taffarel\" in the Brazilian media, he also drew criticism at times from Italian pundits over the mental aspect of his game, and his lack of development during his time in Serie A, which made him unreliable and prone to technical errors on occasion, despite his shot-stopping ability and generally high-quality gameplay, as well as his capacity to produce excellent saves. Moreover, his struggles to cope with his nerves are thought to have impeded him from succeeding consistently at the highest level with top European clubs throughout his career, despite his success and reputation. Ahead of the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final, Mike Penner of the Los Angeles Times speculated that Taffarel, and the goalkeeping position more broadly, was the \"weak link\" of an otherwise world class Brazilian national side, due to the lack of top goalkeepers in Brazilian football at the time; indeed, prior to the tournament, Reuters had dismissed Taffarel as: \"One of around a dozen goalkeepers in Brazil of roughly the same standard.\" ==Post-retirement == Taffarel with Galatasaray in 2012 Taffarel and his former Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro teammate Paulo Roberto started up a player agency, with the focus mainly on promising youngsters. During the 1998 World Cup, when the Brazilian national team was training at Trois-Sapins stadium in Ozoir-la-Ferri\u00e8re, a suburb southeast of Paris, the town's mayor proposed renaming the stadium after him. In 2004, Taffarel rejoined Galatasaray as goalkeeper coach \u2013 under former teammate Gheorghe Hagi \u2013 returning to the club for the 2011\u201312 season, again with Fatih Terim as manager. He currently works as a goalkeeper coach for both Galatasaray and the Brazilian national team. ==Personal life== Born in Santa Rosa, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, Taffarel is of German and Italian descent. Taffarel is a born-again Christian who has actively shared his faith in numerous venues. He was a member of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes since 1988, and has 17 children, 15 of them adopted. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|National Cup !colspan=2|Continental !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- !colspan=2| !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|National Cup !colspan=2|Continental !colspan=2|Total |- |rowspan=7|Internacional||1985||rowspan=7|S\u00e9rie A||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||1||0 |- |1986||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||2||0 |- |1987||10||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||10||0 |- |1988||14||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||14||0 |- |1989||12||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||12||0 |- |1990||11||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||11||0 |- !colspan=1|Total !50||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||50||0 |- |rowspan=4|Parma||1990\u201391||rowspan=4|Serie A||34||0||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||36||0 |- |1991\u201392||34||0||3||0||1||0||38||0 |- |1992\u201393||6||0||1||0||1||0||8||0 |- !colspan=1|Total !74||0||6||0||2||0||82||0 |- |rowspan=2|Reggiana||1993\u201394||rowspan=2|S\u00e9rie A||31||0||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||33||0 |- !colspan=1|Total !31||0||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||33||0 |- |rowspan=5|Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro||1995||rowspan=5|Serie A||22||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||22||0 |- |1996||27||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||27||0 |- |1997||24||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||24||0 |- |1998||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||24||0 |- !colspan=1|Total !73||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||73||0 |- |rowspan=4|Galatasaray||1998\u201399||rowspan=4|1.Lig||32||0||8||0||8||0||48||0 |- |1999\u201300||30||0||3||0||16||0||49||0 |- |2000\u201301||27||0||3||0||14||0||44||0 |- !colspan=1|Total !89||0||14||0||38||0||141||0 |- |rowspan=3|Parma||2001\u201302||rowspan=3|Serie A||6||0||8||0||colspan=2|\u2014||14||0 |- |2002\u201303||0||0||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||2||0 |- !colspan=1|Total !6||0||10||0||colspan=2|\u2014||16||0 |- !colspan=3|Career total !323||0||32||0||40||0||395||0 |} ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! colspan=3 | Brazil |- !
