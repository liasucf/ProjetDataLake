    "text": "Old Folks is a 1938 popular song and jazz standard composed by Willard Robison with lyrics by Dedette Lee Hill, the wife and occasional colleague of Billy Hill. The lyrics tell of an old man nicknamed \"Old Folks\" and reference his service in the American Civil War, his habit of smoking with a \"yellow cob pipe\", and the prospect of his death. A 1938 version by Larry Clinton and His Orchestra and vocalist Bea Wain charted at No. 4; around this time it was also recorded by Mildred Bailey and Bing Crosby and performed on radio by Benny Goodman and Fats Waller. It was recorded on saxophone by Don Byas in 1946 and saxophonist Ben Webster, who made more than a dozen recordings of the song and often performed it in concert as a ballad, first recorded it in 1951. Its most famous jazz version is by trumpeter Miles Davis on Someday My Prince Will Come (1961). ==Other notable recordings== * Ernestine Anderson \u2013 Never Make Your Move Too Soon (1981) * Kenny Dorham \u2013 Quiet Kenny (1960) * Keith Jarrett \u2013 Standards in Norway (1989) * Pat Metheny \u2013 Question and Answer (1990) * Carmen McRae \u2013 At the Great American Music Hall (1976) * Wes Montgomery \u2013 Far Wes (1958) * Charlie Parker \u2013 Big Band (1953) * Max Roach \u2013 Award-Winning Drummer (1959) * Jimmy Smith \u2013 Open House (1968)< ==See also== *List of 1930s jazz standards ==References== Category:1938 songs Category:1930s jazz standards Category:Songs with music by Willard Robison Category:Songs about old age ",
