    "text": "In Romanian folklore, Muma P\u0103durii () is an ugly and mischievous or mad old woman living in the forest (in the heart of virgin forests, in a hut/cabin or an old tree). She is the opposite of fairies such as Z\u00e2n\u0103. She is also the protector of the animals and plants, brewing potions and helping injured animals. She cures the forest if it is dying and she keeps unwanted trespassers away by driving them mad and scaring them. She can be associated with witches (like the witch from the story of \"Hansel and Gretel\"), but she's a neutral \"creature\", harming only those who harm the forest. ==Etymology== Muma P\u0103durii literally means \"mother of the forest\", though \"mum\u0103\" is an archaic version of \"mam\u0103\" (mother), which has a fairy tale overtone for the Romanian reader (somewhat analogous to using the archaic pronouns like \"thou\" and \"thy\" in English). A few other such words, typically protagonists of folktales, have this effect. ==Characteristics== Muma P\u0103durii is a spirit of the forest in a very ugly and old woman's body. Sometimes she has the ability to change her shape. She lives in a dark, dreadful, hidden little house. She is thought to attack children and because of this a large variety of spells (desc\u00e2ntece in Romanian) are used against her. This (step-) mother of the forest kidnaps little children and enslaves them. In one popular story, at some point, she tries to boil a little girl alive in a soup. However the little girl's brother outsmarts Muma P\u0103durii and pushes the woman-monster in the oven instead, similar to the story of Hansel and Gretel. The story ends on a happy note when all kids are free to go back to their parents. ==In modern culture== Instead of saying \"She's ugly\", Romanians sometimes say \"She looks like Muma P\u0103durii\". Muma P\u0103durii was adapted into a monster for Advanced Dungeons and Dragons 2nd Edition: http://www.lomion.de/cmm/mumapadu.php ==See also== *Culture of Romania *Religion in Romania *Baba Yaga *Black Annis *Boo Hag *Crone *Hag *Mother Nature *Nocnitsa *Onibaba (folklore) *The Witch (fairy tale) ==References== *L\u0103z\u0103rescu, George, Dic\u0163ionar de mitologie.
