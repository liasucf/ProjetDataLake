On 21 April 1921, the Republic of Eastern Karelia (It\u00e4 Karjala) was declared independent. Between October 1921 and February 1922 Karelian military troops, supported by the KUG, moved from Finnish territory into Eastern Karelia. From December 1922 until February 1923 East Karelia was occupied by the Soviet Union. On 23 July 1923, the Permanent Court of Arbitration refused to state an advisory opinion on the status of Karelia regarding the Treaty of Tartu. Later that year the exile government was dissolved. ==References== Category:States and territories established in 1920 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1923 Category:Karelia Category:History of Karelia Category:1920s in Finland Category:Russian Civil War ",
