Galizia as Superintendent of Public Works in 1880 Emanuele Luigi Galizia (7 November 1830 \u2013 6 May 1907) was a Maltese architect and civil engineer, who designed many public buildings and several churches. He is regarded as \"the principal Maltese architect throughout the second half of the nineteenth century\". Victoria Gate in Valletta Our Lady of Sorrows church at the Addolorata Cemetery, Paola Villa Alhambra in Sliema Turkish Military Cemetery in Marsa ==Biography== Galizia graduated as a civil engineer and architect from the University of Malta, and in 1846 entered government service as an apprentice of William Lamb Arrowsmith. He became government perito in 1856 and, four years later, the chief perito, being responsible for all the government's public works. He became Superintendent of Public Works in 1880, which came with a seat on Malta's Legislative Council. Galizia was made a knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great by Pope Leo XIII, and he became a member of the Order of the Medjidie during Sultan Abd\u00fclaziz's visit to Malta in 1867 in recognition of Galizia's completion of the Turkish Military Cemetery in Marsa, which was commissioned by the Sultan. He became a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1886, and a fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1888. That year, the government sent him on a tour of Italy, France and England to broaden his knowledge of Gothic Revival architecture, and possibly also to provide advice on Tower Bridge in London (completed in 1894), and the Victorian restoration works at the Brighton Pavilion. Galizia was also an examiner at the faculty of civil engineering at the University of Malta. He was also commissioned by the Imperial Government to visit Cyprus soon after the British occupation of the island and report upon its possible colonisation. The first visit was made in conjunction with Sir Adrian Dingli and Professor Schinas; subsequently he travelled in the company of Marquis Testaferrata Olivier. The reports of the visits and surveys were printed and published under the authority of the Government at the time.An Institute of Civil Engineers obituary published in 1907 praised his \"tact and affability [which] endeared him to the whole community, whilst the ability and thoroughness which he displayed in all his work gives him a permanent place in the record of professional achievement in Malta.\" According to Derek Moss, Galizia > \"adopted an exotic and flamboyant arabesque style with horseshoe arches and > carvings which he applied to building three large terraced single storey > houses (Alcazar, Pax, Alhambra) in Rudolf Street on the main access into the > heart of Sliema. These were the first scheduled houses in Sliema, surrounded > by fields, which dominated the rural landscape, and were seen from afar. He > also designed the Police Station at the Ferries landing place and St. > Gregory\u2019s church. The Diana fountain erected in St Anne Square to > commemorate the supply of fresh water to Sliema is also by Galizia\u2019s hand. > Today this stands in Balluta square.\"Sliema's Built Heritage, FAA ==Personal life== James became Superintendent of Public works, like his father before him, and then Treasury Secretary in Malta's imperial administration. His second son Godwin, also an architect, was known for his neo-Romanesque architecture such as the Church of Saint Peter in Birzebbugia and the Church of Saint Gregory in Sliema, but his works until recently received less attention than those of his father. Godwin was also appointed by private families to design chapels and mausoleums at the Addolorata Cemetery, which was designed by his father. Giovanna married the constitutional lawyer and civil law professor John Caruana, son of Maltese archaeologist A.A. Caruana. Their eldest son Anton, a prominent lawyer killed in an air raid in Malta in World War II, took the surname Caruana Galizia, followed by his siblings. ==Buildings attributed to Galizia== The following is a list of notable buildings which are known to have been designed by Emanuele Luigi Galizia or are attributed to him: *Ta' Braxia Cemetery, Piet\u00e0 (1855) *Addolorata Cemetery and chapel, Paola (1860) *Prince of Wales Road (1862) *Rinella polverista (1864) *Armier Aqueduct between Qormi and the Three Cities (1867) *Ta' Qali reservoir (1867) *Some granaries at Floriana (1869) *Second Carmelite Church, Balluta (1871) *Turkish Military Cemetery, Marsa (1873\u201374) *Bugeja Institute Technical School, \u0126amrun (1880) *Vincenzo Bugeja Institute *Aqueduct of Sliema and Birkirkara (1882) *Victoria Gate, Valletta (1884\u201385) *Our Lady of Lourdes Church, M\u0121arr, Gozo (1888) *St. Alphonse church and convent, Birkirkara (1893\u201395) *Marsamxett Police Station, Valletta *Marsa Police Station *Sliema Police Station *Marsaxlokk quay *Marsamxett quay *Villa Alhambra, Sliema (1880s), Moghul and Moorish exterior - Baroque and Victorian interior, designed by and summer residence of Galizia.Is Cal\u00ec turning in his grave?.More on the Alhambra.Saving Alhambra. *Galizia family chapel at the Addolorata Cemetery, where he is buried. *The Church of Our Lady of Sorrows, St Paul's Bay (1902) The Valletta Market (1859\u201361) and St. Vincent de Paule Hospital (1886) were built under Galizia's direction, although they were designed by other architects. ==References== Category:1830 births Category:1907 deaths Category:19th-century Maltese architects Category:Maltese civil engineers Category:Maltese knights Category:Knights of St. Gregory the Great Category:Fellows of the Institution of Civil Engineers Category:Fellows of the Royal Institute of British Architects Category:Alumni of the University of Malta Category:University of Malta faculty Category:Gothic Revival architects Category:Architects of Roman Catholic churches Category:Recipients of the Order of the Medjidie ",
