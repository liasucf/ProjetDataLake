It is a re-work of the original song which features on Sheeran's album x. The song reached number two on the UK Singles Chart. In an interview with The Sun, regarding the collaboration, DJ Locksmith said, \"We were working in LA and Ed Sheeran rocked up to our studio with The Game and Ellie Goulding. We made four tracks and revisited one this year to give it a Rudimental spin. We've known Ed for years. I remember when we first saw him getting noticed by everyone, he gave us one of his tracks to remix and he said it was one of the best remixes he'd ever had. We'd never recorded with him before, but we kept the connection and he's a massive name now. The song is so sick, so insane. We can't wait to show it to people.\" * \"Never Let You Go\", featuring Foy Vance, was released as the album's second single on 12 June 2015. The track premiered on 27 April 2015 as BBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac's Hottest Record in the World.
