    "text": "Roger Stern (born September 17, 1950 in Noblesville, Indiana) is an American comic book author and novelist. ==Biography== ===Early career=== In the early 1970s, Stern and Bob Layton published the fanzine CPL (Contemporary Pictorial Literature), one of the first platforms for the work of John Byrne. CPL rapidly became a popular fan publication, and led to the two forming an alliance with Charlton Comics to produce and publish \"the now-famous Charlton Bullseye magazine\". During the mid-1970s, both Marvel and DC were publishing in-house \"fan\" publications (FOOM and The Amazing World of DC Comics respectively), and Charlton wished to make inroads into the superhero market, as well as \"establish a fan presence,\" leading to the alliance with CPL to produce the Charlton Bullseye. This led to Charlton giving Layton and Stern \"access to unpublished material from their vaults by the likes of Steve Ditko, Jeff Jones and a host of others.\" === Comics === Hobgoblin character co- created by Stern. Art by John Romita Jr.. Stern broke into the industry as a writer in 1975 as part of the Marvel Comics \"third wave\" of creators, which included artists John Byrne and Frank Miller, and writers Jo Duffy, Mark Gruenwald and Ralph Macchio. Stern worked as an editor from 1976 to 1980. Jim Shooter claims that Stern co-plotted (as a ghostwriter) his last few stories for DC Comics in 1976. Stern wrote the \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" feature in Marvel Presents #10-12 in 1977. He briefly collaborated with Byrne on Captain America. The two produced a story wherein Captain America considered running for the office of President of the United States, an idea originally developed by Roger McKenzie and Don Perlin. Stern, in his capacity as editor of the title, had originally rejected the idea but later changed his mind about the concept. McKenzie and Perlin received credit for the idea on the letters page at Stern's insistence. Stern became the writer of The Spectacular Spider-Man with issue #43 (June 1980). He then took over The Amazing Spider-Man with issue #224 (January 1982).Manning \"1980s\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 126: \"Writer Roger Stern moved from the helm of Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man to sit behind the wheel as the new regular writer of The Amazing Spider-Man with this issue.\" In addition to his Spider-Man work, Stern is known for his lengthy stints on Doctor Strange, and The Avengers. In 1982, he co-created Marvel's second Captain MarvelDeFalco \"1980s\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 209: \"Created by writer Roger Stern and artist John Romita, Jr., this new Captain Marvel soon went to New York to ask the Avengers to teach her how to control her new abilities.\" and the Hobgoblin, both with artist John Romita Jr..Manning \"1980s\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 133: \"Writer Roger Stern and artists John Romita, Jr. and John Romita, Sr. introduced a new - and frighteningly sane - version of the [Green Goblin] concept with the debut of the Hobgoblin.\" Stern wrote \"The Kid Who Collects Spider-Man\" in The Amazing Spider-Man #248 (January 1984), a story which ranks among his most popular.Cronin \"Stern and guest-artist Ron Frenz tell the heartfelt tale of a little boy who might be Spider-Man's biggest fan. Spidey visits the boy and has a nice talk with him (and naturally, there is a twist to the tale).\" Stern ended his run with Amazing Spider-Man #250 (March 1984), chiefly due to his difficulty working with new Spider-Man editor Danny Fingeroth. Later that same year, he co- created the Avengers spin-off The West Coast Avengers, with artist Bob Hall. In 1987, after a dispute with editor Mark Gruenwald over upcoming storylines, Stern was fired from The Avengers.Gruenwald, Mark. \"Mark's Remarks,\" Avengers #288 (March 1988). He began freelancing for DC Comics, where he was one of the core Superman writers for almost a decade, working on Superman (vol. 2), Action Comics, and Superman: The Man of Tomorrow. He contributed to such storylines as \"Panic in the Sky\" and \"The Death of Superman\" which revived interest in the character in the early 1990s. He created the Eradicator in Action Comics Annual #2 and later incorporated the character into the \"Reign of the Supermen\" story arc beginning in The Adventures of Superman #500.Manning \"1990s\" in Dolan, p. 259: \"The issue also featured four teaser comics that introduced a group of contenders all vying for the Superman name...The Eradicator returned in a preview tale by writer Roger Stern and artist Jackson Guice.\" Stern wrote the 1991 story wherein Clark Kent finally revealed his identity as Superman to Lois Lane.Manning \"1990s\" in Dolan, p. 249: \"With their nuptials looming, Clark thought it was time to reveal his dual identity to the love of his life, in this landmark issue by writer Roger Stern and artist Bob McLeod.\" In Summer 1995, Stern and artist Tom Grummett created a new quarterly series, Superman: The Man of Tomorrow.Manning \"1990s\" in Dolan, p. 271: \"Superman gained a new quarterly title to ensure his weekly appearance on comic book store racks in...Superman: The Man of Tomorrow #1, by writer Roger Stern and penciller Tom Grummett.\" Additionally, Stern was one of the many creators who worked on the Superman: The Wedding Album one-shot in 1996 which featured the title character's marriage to Lois Lane.Manning \"1990s\" in Dolan, p. 275: \" The behind-the-scenes talent on the monumental issue appropriately spanned several generations of the Man of Tomorrow's career.

Stern collaborated with Avengers writer Kurt Busiek on Iron Man and the miniseries Avengers Forever, and with John Byrne on Marvel: The Lost Generation. After a major editorial shuffle at Marvel in 2000 left him without assignments, Stern began writing for European publisher Egmont, for whom he produced scripts for Fantomen (The Phantom), and Panini UK, for whose Marvel Rampage magazine he wrote Spider-Man and Hulk stories. Stern and Busiek co-wrote the Darkman vs. Army of Darkness limited series which was drawn by artist James Fry and published by Dynamite Entertainment. In 2007, Stern wrote an issue of The All-New Atom and reunited with Byrne to produce a five-issue story arc for JLA Classified for DC in 2008.
