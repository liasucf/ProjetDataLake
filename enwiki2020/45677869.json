From 1421 onwards, they were represented in the city government alongside the patrician lineages of the Seven Noble Houses of Brussels,David M. Nicholas, The Later Medieval City: 1300\u20131500 (Routledge, 2014), p. 139. later also in the States of Brabant as members of the Third Estate. As of 1421, they were also able to become members of the Drapery Court of Brussels. Together with the Seven Noble Houses, they formed the bourgeoisie of the city. Some of their guildhouses can still be seen as part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of the Grand Place in Brussels. alt= ==Composition== Rather than being limited to a specific trade, each of the nine \"nations\" grouped a number of guilds.
