    "text": "London Buses route 111 is a Transport for London contracted bus route in London, England, running between Heathrow Central bus station and Kingston. It is operated by London United. ==History== Route 111 was converted to driver- only single-deck operation with AEC Swifts on 23 August 1969. It initially operated only between Cranford (weekday peaks and Sundays) or Hounslow Garage (weekday off-peaks and Saturdays) and Hanworth. At the same time a self- service system was introduced on routes 110 and 111, with passengers buying tickets from a machine. From 1 December 2007, route 111 was converted into a 24-hour service; before its introduction a number of residents in Hampton complained to the local newspaper and TfL, who named the alternative of more route 481 buses bypassing Hampton to the north-east. Supporters of the extension in hours of operation included the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames. Weekday peak hours service increased to every 8\u20139 minutes in 2010. ==Current route== Route 111 operates via these primary locations:Route 111 Map Transport for London Transdev London Plaxton President bodied Volvo B7TL in Kingston on Thames in December 2008 *Heathrow Central bus station *Harlington Corner Bath Road hotels *Cranford *Heston *Lampton Corner *Hounslow East station *Hounslow bus station *Hanworth *Hampton station *Hampton Thames Street *Hampton Court Palace *Kingston Wood Street *Kingston Cromwell Road Bus Station for Kingston station ==References== ==External links== * Category:Bus routes in London Category:Transport in the London Borough of Hillingdon Category:Transport in the London Borough of Hounslow Category:Transport in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Category:Transport in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames 111 ",
