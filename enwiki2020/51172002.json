Davis, along with game master Crittenden, play a fantasy roleplaying campaign in front of a live audience, while each episode features a special guest player. It premiered on the subscription streaming service Seeso in July 2016.

On October 19, 2016, HarmonQuest was renewed for a second season, but due to uncertainty around Seeso's future, rights to HarmonQuest were sold to Otter Media's VRV streaming service in June 2017. The second season premiered on VRV Select on September 15 and concluded on November 17, 2017. In October 2018, it was announced that VRV has renewed the show for a third season, which debuted on August 18, 2019. ===Season 1 (2016)=== ===Season 2 (2017)=== ===Season 3 (2019)=== ==Production== ===Development=== Prior to the creation of HarmonQuest, Harmon had included a Dungeons & Dragons-style segment, hosted by Crittenden, at the end of the weekly podcast Harmontown. When Harmon pitched the idea of HarmonQuest, which was originally conceived as a low-budget online show, NBC Universal executive vice-president of digital enterprises Evan Shapiro became interested in the idea. When Seeso was developed as an NBC- owned comedy channel, an order for ten episodes of HarmonQuest was confirmed. The show is produced by Universal Cable Productions and Starburns Industries. ===Filming and animation=== The show is recorded in front of a live audience at Victory Studios in Glendale, California, with parts of the stories being animated later. Filming typically takes place over an hour, which is then edited down to the 25-minute runtime. Harmon has cited The Ricky Gervais Show as an influence, as it also features a mix of live and animated footage. ==Reception== The series has been likened to Critical Role, a web series streaming on Twitch and later uploaded to the Geek & Sundry YouTube channel since 2015. Unlike Critical Role episodes which are long-form, full-play D&D; podcasts often exceeding 4hrs, HarmonQuest has been praised for its accessibility towards casual and beginner audiences. Javon Phillips of the LA Times said, \"The show makes its ventures a lot less time-consuming and ups the watchability quotient by throwing in animated segments in digestible half-hour episodes. Gamemaster Spencer Crittenden approaches the show as just that \u2014 a show. It\u2019s not just players playing the game and showing off their multi-sided dice-rolling skills.\" ==See also== * Critical Role * The Adventure Zone ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2016 web series debuts Category:American adult animated comedy television series Category:American adult animated web series Category:American comedy web series Category:English-language television shows Category:Seeso original programming Category:American television series with live action and animation Category:Television series created by Dan Harmon ",
