    "text": "Dandy Gilver is the protagonist of a historical mystery series by Catriona McPherson. The stories are set in Scotland in an era beginning shortly after World War I and extending (to date) into the early 1930s. Dandy (short for Dandelion) is an upper-class Englishwoman whose career as a private detective fills the void in her comfortable but unfulfilled life within a world of landownership and child-rearing for which she is temperamentally unsuited and a marriage that is short on emotional and sexual warmth. The novels feature dry humor and colorful characters in the cozy mystery tradition, along with a quantity of historical detail.Dandy Gilver, http://catrionamcpherson.com/dandygilver.
