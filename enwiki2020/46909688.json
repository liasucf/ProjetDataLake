While their adventure does not end exactly as planned, Kate and Humphrey discover that \"Home is where the Family Is.\" ===Alpha and Omega 3: The Great Wolf Games (2014)=== All the alphas in the packs set aside their differences for some friendly competition. When an unexpected accident puts many of the packs' star alpha wolves out of commission, a new team is assembled that includes forest friends not in the pack. After Stinky, Claudette, and Runt find a group, including a bear and porcupine, they compete in a relay race to win the prize against an all alpha team. At the end, Humphrey's team wins and, in a fit of rage after Fleet yells at his father for pushing his own dreams on him, Fleet's father raises a paw to strike Fleet.
