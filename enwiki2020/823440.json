The city is surrounded by typical moraine landscape with low hills and valleys created by glaciers during the last ice ages. Horsens is south of Aarhus and north of Vejle, and approximately from Copenhagen. ==History== It is believed the name Horsens derives from the old Danish words hors (horse) and n\u00e6s (naze, headland). The name 'Horsens' has been in use since the 12th century. The earliest traces of a city are remains of a pagan burial site and houses dating back to the 10th century. In the 12th century, the kings Sweyn III and Valdemar I issued coins in the city. In the 13th century the city got its own legal code. Excavations have shown that the city was expanded around 1300, with a moat going around the city and its harbour. Industrialization started from the middle of the 19th century. The population rose dramatically when people from the countryside moved to the city to work in the factories. The first Danish iron foundry outside of Copenhagen was opened as well as tobacco and textile factories. ==Economy== The city is currently undergoing a positive development with new industry moving to Horsens, or expanding their activities already in Horsens.

A notable prisoner was former minister of justice Peter Adler Alberti. The last execution in peacetime in Denmark happened in the prison in 1892 when Jens Nielsen was decapitated in the courtyard. Carl August Lorentzen was a safe cracker who became famous for his escape from the prison in 1950 when he dug a tunnel from his cell and out to freedom with a spoon. When the guards discovered he was missing they found a note from him with the words \"Where there is a will there is a way\". Lorentzen was captured a few days later on a nearby farm. The old run-down buildings were not fit for a modern prison. In 2006 the prison was closed and the newly built State Prison of East Jutland was opened. The new prison, which is placed near Horsens, held the mass murderer Peter Lundin for a period. Since its closure as a prison, Horsens Statsf\u00e6ngsel has housed a crime and prison museum, and conference and business facilities. The prison grounds have been used for concerts. It was considered as the venue of the Eurovision Song Contest 2014, along with two other cities in Denmark.
