This castle was mentioned in the Domesday Book. It was a motte and bailey and contained a college of secular clergy which was founded before 1210 and dissolved after 1373. Earthworks with stone foundations are still present and the remains of a 13th-century semicircular flanking tower are incorporated into a farmhouse. ==References== *Fry, Plantagenet Somerset, The David & Charles Book of Castles, David & Charles, 1980.
