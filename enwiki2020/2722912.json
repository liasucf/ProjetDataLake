It consolidated provisions related to offences against the person (an expression, which, in particular, includes offences of violence) from a number of earlier statutes into a single Act. For the most part these provisions were, according to the draftsman of the Act,Greaves. The Criminal Law Consolidation and Amendment Acts 1861 pp. 3\u20134 incorporated with little or no variation in their phraseology. It is one of a group of Acts sometimes referred to as the Criminal Law Consolidation Acts 1861. It was passed with the object of simplifying the law. It is essentially a revised version of an earlier Consolidation Act, the Offences Against the Person Act 1828 (and the equivalent Irish Act), incorporating subsequent statutes.Davis, James Edward. The Criminal Law Consolidation Statutes of the 24 & 25 of Victoria, Chapters 94 to 100. Butterworths. 1861. Pages vi and vii. Internet Archive. Although it has been substantially amended, it continues to be the foundation for prosecuting personal injury, short of murder, in the courts of England and Wales. The Act was also adopted in British possessions. For example, New Zealand adopted the Act in 1866. In England and Wales and in Northern Ireland, the sexual offences under the Act have all been repealed. For legislation referring to sexual offences, see the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008. In Northern Ireland, the 1861 Act was the basis for a ban on abortion until 2019 when it was amended by the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019. ==Commentary== The Act as originally drafted listed specific methods whereby harm might be caused. For example, section 18 originally included an offence of shooting which could be committed with any of the specified intents. Sections 11 to 15 specified various means by which a person might attempt to commit murder. In some cases, these reflected political issues then of great significance. For example, the Fenians were promoting their political case by leaving barrels of explosives in public places. Hence, sections 28 to 30 and 64 specifically address the problem, whether injury results or not. Similarly, children were throwing stones at passing railway trains, and these provisions remain in force. As originally enacted, the Act had 79 sections. In England and Wales, 37 sections remain in force, namely sections 4, 5, 9, 10, 16 to 18, 20 to 38, 44, 45, 47, 57 to 60, 64, 65, 68 and 78. Of those, only sections 25, 34 to 36 and 78 have not been either partially repealed or otherwise amended. Different subsets of its provisions remain in force in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland. ==Dangerous offenders== See the Criminal Justice Act 2003 for further provisions about sentencing for manslaughter and for offences under sections 4 and 16 to 47 of this Act. ==Homicide== ===Sections 1 to 3 \u2013 Murder=== Sections 1 to 3 dealt with the death penalty for murder and have been repealed. In the Republic of Ireland, the references to murder in these sections were changed to references to capital murder by section 15 of the Criminal Justice Act 1964. They were repealed by section 9(1) of, and the second schedule to, the Criminal Justice Act 1990.[ But the repeal of section 1 did not affect the operation of sections 64 to 68.(s.9(2)) ====Section 1 \u2013 Penalty for murder==== This section replaced the corresponding provision in section 3 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828 (9 Geo 4 c 31) and section 4 of the corresponding Irish Act (10 Geo 4 c 34). ====Section 3 \u2013 Disposal of body==== This section provided that the body of every person executed for murder was to be buried within the precincts of the last prison in which he had been confined, and that his sentence was to direct that this should happen. It replaced the corresponding provision in section 16 of the Anatomy Act 1832 (as amended by section 1 of the next mentioned Act) and replaced section 2 of the Hanging in Chains Act 1834 (4 & 5 Will 4 c 26). ===Section 4=== The penalty for offences under this section was increased by article 5(1) of the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1977,S.I. 1977/1249 (N.I. 16) but not in relation to offences \"committed before the commencement\" of that order (art.5(3)). ====Soliciting to murder==== This section creates the offence of soliciting to murder. ====Conspiracy to murder==== This section creates the offence of conspiracy to murder in the Republic of Ireland. The repeal of as much of this section as related to the offence of conspiracy to murder for England and Wales was consequential on the codification of conspiracy by Part I of the Criminal Law Act 1977. The effect of this section, in relation to conspiracy to commit murder abroad, was preserved by section 1(4) of that Act. The repeal of as much of this section as related to the offence of conspiracy to murder for Northern Ireland was consequential on the codification of conspiracy by Part IV of the Criminal Attempts and Conspiracy (Northern Ireland) Order 1983 (S.I. 1983/1120 (N.I. 13)). ===Section 5 \u2013 Manslaughter=== This section now provides that a person convicted of manslaughter in English law is liable to imprisonment for life or for any shorter term. In England and Wales it now reads: ====Repeals==== The words \"or to pay\" to the end were repealed by Part I of Tenth Schedule to the Criminal Justice Act 1948. The other words were repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1892. ====\"Penal servitude for life\"==== This means imprisonment for life: See section 1(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1948 and section 1(2) of the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953 and section 11(2) of the Criminal Law Act 1997. ===Other matters=== Sections 6 to 8 have been repealed. They respectively dealt with the form of the indictment for murder and manslaughter, with excusable homicide and with petty treason. Section 6 replaced section 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1851 (14 & 15 Vict c 100). This section was repealedThe Criminal Justice Administration Act, 1924, section 16(1) and the second schedule for the Republic of Ireland on 22 August 1924.The Criminal Justice Administration Order, 1924, section (1) Section 7 replaced section 10 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1828. Section 8 replaced section 2 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1828. ===Sections 9 and 10: Jurisdiction=== Murder or manslaughter abroad. Section 9 gives the courts in England, Wales and Ireland extra-territorial jurisdiction over homicides committed by British subjects overseas. (Note however the restricted definition of \"subject\" under section 3 of the British Nationality Act 1948.) Section 10 gives these courts jurisdiction over fatal acts committed by British subjects overseas where the death occurs in England, Wales or Ireland, and jurisdiction over fatal acts committed in England, Wales or Ireland by anyone, including aliens, where the death occurs abroad. (The word \"criminally\" in that section has been held to exclude fatal acts done by aliens overseas although the death occurs in England, Wales or Ireland, since such acts are not punishable under the criminal law.) Sections 9 and 10 respectively replace sections 7 and 8 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828. Section 10 was first enacted in 1728/29 by 2 Geo 2 c 21. ==Attempts to murder== Sections 11 to 15 dealt with attempts to murder and have been repealed. See now the Criminal Attempts Act 1981. Section 11 \u2013 Administering poison or wounding or causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder This section replaced section 2 of the Offences against the Person Act 1837 (7 Will 4 & 1 Vict c 85). Section 12 \u2013 Destroying or damaging a building with gunpowder with intent to murder This section replaced section 2 of the Arson Act 1846 (9 & 10 Vict c 25) (Malicious injuries by fire) Section 13 \u2013 Setting fire to or casting away a ship with intent to murder Section 14 \u2013 Attempting to administer poison, or shooting or attempting to shoot, or attempting to drown, suffocate or strangle with intent to murder This section replaced section 3 of the Offences against the Person Act 1837. Section 15 \u2013 Attempting to commit murder by any other means ==Threats to kill== Section 16 The making of a threat to kill is an offence wherein the defendant intends the victim to fear it will be carried out. It is immaterial whether it is premeditated or said in anger. Although the normal maximum sentence is ten years, offenders deemed to present a \"significant risk\" of \"serious harm\" to the public can now receive a life sentence under the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Other threats of violence may be prosecuted summarily under section 4 of the Public Order Act 1986. This section, as originally enacted, replaced the offence of sending, delivering or uttering a letter or writing threatening to kill or murder under section 1 of the 10 & 11 Vict c 66 (1847); the other offences under that section being consolidated elsewhere. In Northern Ireland, this section was substituted by article 4 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 1977 (S.I. 1977/1249 (N.I. 16)). In the Republic of Ireland, this section has been repealed and replaced by section 5 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. ==Bodily harm== In the Republic of Ireland, sections 16 to 26 and 28 to 34 of this Act were repealed by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 Section 17 \u2013 Impeding a person endeavouring to save himself or another from shipwreck Shipping was the lifeblood of the Empire, thus, specific offences to protect seamen were common. Wounding and grievous bodily harm The offences under sections 18 and 20 of this Act are discussed in detail in the article grievous bodily harm. ===Section 18=== This section creates the offences of wounding and causing grievous bodily harm, with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, or to resist arrest. It is punishable with life imprisonment. This section replaces section 4 of the Offences against the Person Act 1837. Charges under this section are, under CPS guidance, reserved for crimes with very high intent which cause serious (potentially life-threatening harm) or showed malicious intent and caused really serious life-threatening or life-altering harm. The former offences under this section of shooting and attempting to shoot with intent have been repealed. It is also no longer possible to charge the remaining offences of wounding and causing grievous bodily harm as having been committed with intent to maim, disfigure or disable as the relevant words have been repealed. ===Section 19=== This section defined the expression \"loaded arms\". The repeal of this section was consequential on the repeal of the offences of shooting and attempting to shoot with intent under sections 14 and 18 above. ===Section 20=== This section creates the offences of wounding and inflicting grievous bodily harm. The CPS guidance prefers this section to be used instead of section 18 when the harm done was more consequential rather than intentional, and/or the wounding was less serious. These are therefore less serious than the offences created by section 18 and carry a maximum prison sentence of 5 years. This section replaces section 4 of the Prevention of Offences Act 1851 (14 & 15 Vict c 19). The offence of wounding either with or without a weapon or instrument under this section replaces the offence of stabbing, cutting or wounding under that section. ===Garrotting, etc. \u2013 Administering chloroform, etc.=== Sections 21 and 22: Attempting to choke, &c.;, to commit or assist in the committing of any indictable offence. Certain forms of attack have always been viewed with particular horror and the use of strangulation or drugs to render someone unconscious with a view to committing a crime require special treatment. Contemporary crime including date rape following the use of hypnotic drugs such as Flunitrazepam show that little has changed save that where the intended offence is of a sexual nature, separate legislation applies (see Sexual Offences Act 2003). Section 22 replaces section 3 of the Prevention of Offences Act 1851. ===Sections 23 and 24: Poisoning=== Sections 23 and 24 cover the insidious forms of attack based on administering poisons or other dangerous chemicals and substances intending to injure another. Although rarely used today, the offences remain available should the specific circumstances arise, e.g. sending a package containing a dangerous substance to an embassy. Section 25 permits a jury to find a person charged with an offence under section 23 guilty of an offence under 24. Sections 23 to 25 respectively replace sections 1 to 3 of the 23 & 24 Vict c 8 (1860) (unlawful administering of poison). ===Section 26 \u2013 Neglecting or causing bodily harm to servants=== This section deals with the problem of neglect by an employer who failed to provide adequate food, clothing and accommodation for staff and servants. It is punishable on conviction on indictment with imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. This section replaces section 1 of the Poor Law (Apprentices, &c.;) Act 1851 (14 & 15 Vict c 11). The offence of assault under that section has been replaced by one of doing or causing bodily harm. See also the summary offence under section 6 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875 which could be committed by neglecting to provide medical aid. ===Section 27 \u2013 Abandoning or exposing a child under the age of two=== The offence is in practice obsolete, as it has been superseded by the offence of cruelty to persons under sixteen under section 1 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. The exception to this is that it can be committed by a person who does not have responsibility for the child within the meaning of the 1933 Act (assuming that such a person can unlawfully abandon or expose a child), and also by a person who is under sixteen. ===Explosives, etc.=== Sections 28, 29, 30, and 64 created a range of criminal offences supplementing the Explosive Substances Act 1883 and the Explosives Act 1875. These remain in force, although the Criminal Damage Act 1971 covers all aspects of the resulting damage to property and the Terrorism Act 2000 deals with possession for terrorist purposes. Section 28 replaces section 3 of the Arson Act 1846 (malicious injuries by fire). Section 29 replaces section 4 of the Arson Act 1846. Section 30 replaces the corresponding offence under section 6 of that Act; the other offences under that section being consolidated elsewhere. ===Section 31 \u2013 Setting spring guns with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm=== This section addresses the problem of those who wish to protect their property with hidden traps. This section replaces sections 1 to 4 of the 7 & 8 Geo 4 c 18 (1827) (An Act to prohibit the setting of spring guns, mantraps and other engines calculated to destroy human life or inflict grievous bodily harm). ===Causing danger on railways=== Sections 32 to 34 protect the railways from those who place obstructions on the line, throw stones at the passing trains, and generally endanger the passengers. Section 32 replaced the offence of attempting to endanger the safety of passengers under section 6 of the Prevention of Offences Act 1851; the other offence being consolidated elsewhere. Section 33 replaced section 7 of that Act. ===Section 35 \u2013 Drivers of carriages injuring persons by furious driving=== In England and Wales and Northern Ireland this section creates the offence of causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving. It is repealed in the Republic of Ireland. ==Assaults== In 1993, the Law Commission recommended that sections 36 and 37 and 39 and 40 be repealed.The Law Commission. Legislating the Criminal Code: Offences against the Person and General Principles. Law Com 218. Cm 2370. 1993. Para 22.1 and note 245 at page 41. In 1980, the Criminal Law Revision Committee recommended that sections 42 to 45 be repealed.Criminal Law Revision Committee. Fourteenth Report. 1980. Cmnd 7844. ss 163 and 164. ===Section 36 \u2013 Assaulting or obstructing a clergyman in the execution of his duties=== In England and Wales and Northern Ireland, this section reads: Repeals The words omitted at the end were repealed by section 1(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1948 and the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953. This section was repealed in the Republic of Ireland by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. \"Divine service\" See Matthews v King [1934] 1 KB 505, 50 TLR 62, 30 Cox 27 \"Misdemeanor\" See the Criminal Law Act 1967 and the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967. Proposal for repeal In 1985, the Law Commission said that this offence was no longer used and recommended that it be repealed.The Law Commission. Criminal Law: Offences against Religion and Public Worship. Law Com 145. HMSO. London. 1985. Paragraph 3.25 at page 39. ===Section 37 \u2013 Assault on any person authorised to preserve any shipwrecked vessel or goods=== This offence is triable only on indictment and punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years. This section was repealed in the Republic of Ireland by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. ===Section 38=== The marginal note to this section reads \"Assault with intent to commit felony, or on peace officers, &c.;\" It is unreliable.Legislation.gov.uk. Revised annotated copy of section 38. Note X1. (This revision dates to 1 February 1991). This section was repealed for Northern Ireland by section 7(3) of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) 1968 (c.28) (N.I.). The offences of assault with intent to resist arrest and assaulting, etc. a peace officer under this section were replaced by section 7(1) of that Act. Assault with intent to resist arrest In England and Wales, this section creates the offence of assault with intent to resist arrest and provides the penalty to which a person is liable on conviction of that offence on indictment. Assaulting, resisting or wifully obstructing a peace officer in the execution of his duty This offence was repealed and replaced by section 51 of the Police Act 1964. An assault on a constable in the execution of his duty can now be prosecuted summarily under section 89(1) of the Police Act 1996. Assault with intent to commit felony The repeal of this offence was consequential on the abolition of the distinction between felony and misdemeanour. ===Section 39 \u2013 Assaults with intent to obstruct the sale of grain, or its free passage=== Immediately before its repeal, in England and Wales, this section read: Repeals The words \"and kept to hard labour\" were repealed for England and Wales by section 1(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1948 and for Northern Ireland by section 1(2) of the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953. This section was repealed as it applied to England and Wales by section 1(1) of, and Group 5 of Part I of Schedule 1 to, the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1989. It has not been replaced. This section was repealed for the Republic of Ireland by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. Derivation This section was derived from the corresponding provision in section 26 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828, and replaced both that provision and section 2 of the 14 & 15 Vict c 92 (which applied to Ireland). The words in square brackets in the text of section 39 above are different from those in section 26 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828.Davis, James Edward.

They said that the Home Office agreed that sections 39 and 40 served no further useful purpose. They recommended that both sections be repealed.The Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission.

Pages 11 and 71. ===Section 40 \u2013 Assaults on seamen, etc=== Immediately before its repeal, in England and Wales, this section read: Repeals Words replaced with \"\u2026\" were repealed in England and Wales by s. 1(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1948 and in Northern Ireland by the same section of the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953. The section was repealed in the first jurisdiction by section 1(1) (enacting Group 5 of Part I of Schedule 1) to the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1989. It has not been replaced. This section was repealed in the Republic of Ireland by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. Derivation This section lately replaced the essentially identical section 26 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828. This in turn replaced section 2 of the Shipping Offences Act 1793. Appeal The said either party could appeal to one of the superior courts of common law if they were dissatisfied with the determination of the justices as being erroneous in point of law.Davis, James Edward. The Criminal Law Consolidation Statutes of the 24 & 25 of Victoria. Butterworths. 1861. p. 267 Proposals for repeal As to the recommendations of the Criminal Law Revision Committee, Law Commission, and Scottish Law Commission, see the preceding section's summary above. ===Section 41 \u2013 Assault arising from combination=== The repeal of this section was consequential on the decriminalisation of trade unions. See the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1871 and the Trade Union Act 1871. ===Section 42 \u2013 Common assault and battery=== In England and Wales, this section has been repealed and has been replaced by section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988. The Criminal Law Act 1977, Schedule 6, increased the maximum fine to \u00a3200. (Entries relating to Offences Against the Person Act 1861 repealed by Criminal Justice Act 1988 (c. 33, SIF 39:1), s. 170, Sch. 8 para. 16, Sch. 16). Section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 made the offence a summary only offences, and a person guilty of either assault or battery liable to a fine not exceeding level 5 (\u00a35,000) on the standard scale and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both. In Northern Ireland, this section was substituted by section 23(1) of the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1953 (c.14) (N.I.). Section 23(2) of that Act provides that any reference to this section in section 46 of the Summary Jurisdiction Act (Northern Ireland) 1953, or in any other enactment, is to be construed as a reference to this section as amended by that Act. This provision is said to be for the removal of doubt. This section was repealed in the Republic of Ireland by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. ===Section 43 \u2013 Aggravated assault and battery=== This section replaces section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1853 (16 & 17 Vict c 30) (aggravated assaults upon women and children) In England and Wales, this section has been repealed and has not been replaced. The Criminal Law Act 1977, Schedule 6, increased the maximum fine to \u00a3500. In Northern Ireland, this section makes provision for the summary prosecution of aggravated assaults on women and children. The maximum fine for this offence was increased by section 60(2) of the Summary Jurisdiction and Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1935 (c.13) (N.I.)

This section was repealed in the Republic of Ireland by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. Assault occasioning actual bodily harm In England and Wales, and in Northern Ireland, this section creates the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and provides the penalty to which a person is liable on conviction of that offence on indictment. In the Republic of Ireland this offence has been replaced by the offence of assault causing harm under section 3 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. Common assault In England and Wales, the provision in this section relating to common assault has been repealed. This is an either way offence. In Northern Ireland, it is written that a person who is convicted on indictment (before a Crown Court thus for more serious instances) of common assault is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years. This amounts to a doubling (of the maximum) by article 4(2)(b) of the Criminal Justice (No.2) (Northern Ireland) Order 2004. ==Rape, abduction and defilement of women== ===Section 48 \u2013 Rape=== This section provided that a person guilty of rape was liable to be kept in penal servitude for life or for any term not less than three years or to be imprisoned (with or without hard labour) for any term not exceeding two years. It was a revised version of section 16 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828, incorporating the non-textual amendments made to that section by section 3 of the Substitution of Punishments of Death Act 1841 (4 & 5 Vict c 56) and section 2 of the Penal Servitude Act 1857. It replaced section 16 of the 1828 Act and the corresponding provision in section 3 of the 1841 Act, which were repealed. In England and Wales, this section was repealed and replaced by section 1(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. In Northern Ireland, repeal of this section was consequential upon the codification of the law relating to sexual offences by the Sexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 2008. ===Section 49 \u2013 Procuring, by false pretences, false representations or other fraud, a girl under 21 to have illicit carnal connexion with any man=== The expression 'illicit carnal connexion' means extramarital sexual intercourse. This section replaced section 1 of the 12 & 13 Vict c 76 (1849) (procuring the defilement of women). This section was repealed and replaced by section 2(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 ===Section 50 \u2013 Carnal knowledge of girls under 12=== Section 50 replaced section 17 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828 and the corresponding provision in section 3 of the Substitution of Punishments of Death Act 1841 (4 & 5 Vict c 56) and incorporated the non-textual amendment made by section 2 of the Penal Servitude Act 1857. Sections 50 and 51 were repealed by section 2 of the Offences against the Person Act 1875. They were replaced by sections 3 and 4 of that Act (also replaced) which had a broader scope. ===Section 52 \u2013 Indecent assault upon a female=== In England and Wales, this section was repealed and replaced by section 14(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. In Northern Ireland, repeal of this section was consequential upon the codification of the law relating to sexual offences. ===Section 53 & 54 \u2013 Abduction=== Sections 53 to 56 were repealed in the Republic of Ireland by section 31 of, and the Schedule to, the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. Sections 53 and 54 created various offences of abduction, including: Forcible abduction of any woman with intent to marry or carnally know her. This would be charged as the common law offences of kidnapping and false imprisonment, or rape, and/or human trafficking under the Sexual Offences Act 2003. In England and Wales, section 53 was repealed and replaced by sections 17 and 18 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. In England and Wales, section 54 was repealed and replaced by section 17(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. In Northern Ireland, repeal of these sections was consequential upon the codification of the law relating to sexual offences. ===Section 55 \u2013 Abduction of a girl under 16=== In England and Wales, this section was repealed and replaced by section 20 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. In Northern Ireland, repeal of this section was consequential upon the codification of the law relating to sexual offences. ==Child stealing== Section 56 created the offence of child stealing. In England and Wales, it has been repealed and replaced by the Child Abduction Act 1984. ==Bigamy== Section 57 \u2013 Bigamy This section creates the offence of bigamy. It replaces section 22 of the Offences against the Person Act 1828. ==Abortion== Section 58 - offence of using drugs or instruments to procure abortion, replaced section 6 of the Offences against the Person Act 1837, and provides: :58. Every woman, being with child, who, with intent to procure her own miscarriage, shall unlawfully administer to herself any poison or other noxious thing, or shall unlawfully use any instrument or other means whatsoever with the like intent, and whosoever, with intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman whether she be or be not with child, shall unlawfully administer to her or cause to be taken by her any poison or other noxious thing, or unlawfully use any instrument or other means whatsoever with the like intent, shall be guilty of felony, and being convicted thereof shall be liable . . . to be kept in penal servitude for life . . .Revised text of section 58 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861. Legislation.gov.uk. Section 59 - offence of supplying or procuring poison or instruments for the purpose of criminal abortion, and provides: :59.
