Batangas City is classified as one of the fastest urbanizing cities of the Philippines, and is known as the \"Industrial Port City of Calabarzon\".

Finally, in 1581, Spanish authorities governing the Philippines created a pueblo in the area which included the hill (now Hilltop) where the present Provincial Capitol of Batangas stands after the formal end of the Coumintang Kingdom. The town was named \"Batangan\" because huge logs, locally called \"batang\", abounded in the place. The Spanish government appointed Don Agustin Casilao as Batangan's first gobernadorcillo. Said title of \"little governor\" as head of the pueblo or municipio was replaced in 1894 by \"capital municipal\". It is not clear who succeeded Casilao nor is it known whether there were subsequent appointments of capital municipal. Don Agustin Casilao is sometimes referred to as Agustino or Augustino in some sources. By 1870, its barangays were Balagtas, Bilogo, Bolbok, Bukal, Catandala, Konde, De La Paz, Kumintang Ibaba, Matuko, Mapagong, Paharang Kanluran, Pairang, Pinamucan, Patulo, Sampaga, San Agapito, San Isidro and Talahib. At the coming of the Americans in the early 1900s, local civil government of Batangas was set up. It took effect on July 4, 1901 with Jose Villanueva elected as \"Municipal President.\" His term expired in 1903. Subsequent elections installed the following as municipal presidents: Juan Palacios, 1904\u20131905; Jose Arguelles, 1906; Marcelo Llana, 1907; Sisenando Ferriols, 1908\u20131909; Ventura Tolentino, 1910\u20131914; Julian Rosales, 1915; Juan Gutierrez, 1916\u20131919; Julian Rosales, 1920\u20131922; Juan Buenafe, 1923\u20131930; Perfecto Condez, 1931\u20131937; Juan Buenafe, 1938\u20131940.
