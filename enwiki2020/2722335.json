After attending a magnet school as a music student for four years, she graduated in 1953 from Adelphi University, where she studied literature and creative writing, noting, \u201cI feel that writing is a gift which should be perfected. English is a beautiful language. Why muck it up?\u201dAdelphi University: Alumni Profiles === First marriage === When she was 19, she married Ted Jungreis, and the couple moved to Huntington, Long Island, where she raised three children. With a master's degree in secondary education from C. W. Post, she taught English as a second language. She joined a local community theater, where she composed original scores for three musical comedies, in addition to singing, dancing, and directing the music in productions of Gypsy, Damn Yankees, Guys and Dolls, South Pacific, and other musical comedies. During this time, she also became a member of the Huntington Choral Society. === Comic strip writing career === Mezz and Jungreis separated after 21 years together, and not long after that, she landed a job with cartoonist Bill Hoest, creator of The Lockhorns, who needed an assistant to help compile his cartoons into books. She recalled, \"I was 40 years old. My kids were 20, 18, and 15.\" Hoest, who had six children, was also recently divorced. The two married in 1973. She reflected, \"Marrying Bill meant taking on a whole different kind of life, a new direction with much responsibility. He needed a working partner as well as a marriage partner. It was scary and challenging. I thought, what the hell, I'll give it a shot.\" Soon she was writing captions for The Lockhorns, and eventually they worked together on the scripts for their other features. After Bill Hoest's death in 1988, she continued the cartoons and strips, working closely with illustrator John Reiner, who began as Bill Hoest's assistant in 1986.
