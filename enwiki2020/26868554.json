She was very plain, dressed severely, deplored swearing, and quoted the Bible. She must have been mad. : From a 1964 interview with Joan Blondell: Goggle newspaper archive of \"Joan Blondell Is Now Fastest Man-Chaser on Television\", Sarasota Herald-Tribune (May 7, 1964) page 16 :: That part got even for all the sweetness and light I've portrayed for years.

This was live TV, too! He recalled being given material to read to prepare for his role -- and he still had what he was given: Warren Brown's history from the 1952 Putnam series, The Chicago White Sox.

Packaged by David Susskind, it effectively utilizes a formula first laid out by more modest shows like Day in Court and The Verdict Is Yours: the simulated hearing or trial. The first episode grilled a fictional \"Lucky\" Luciano. While the case did not unfold too coherently, and the crowd noises in the simulated hearing room were badly overdone, the program spectacularly captured the disorderly drama of committee hearings, with all their rambling language and flashing anger. Telly Savalas, a comparatively unknown actor, was superb as Luciano\u2014full of gutter cynicism, arrogance, brutality, and yet at moments pathetic. The show's spontaneity derived partly from the fact that the lawyers involved were real, some of the best courtroom performers in New York (Richard Steel William Geoghan Jr., Charles Haydon,' Benedict Ginsberg), who ad-libbed much of their argument.\" However, several months later, daily newspaper television columns disagreed-- for example: : Despite medical care and extensive surgery, CBS' \"The Witness\" series will succumb after the Feb. 2 show. The end, when it comes, is the result of faulty ratings which even a change of climate--from an earlier to a later slot in the Thursday night schedule--failed to improve. ==References== ==External links== * \"The Witness\" webpage at the IMDB website * \"The Witness\" webpage at the TV.COM website Category:1960 American television series debuts Category:1961 American television series endings Category:CBS original programming Category:1960s American television series Category:Television series by Talent Associates Category:Cultural depictions of Al Capone Category:Cultural depictions of John Dillinger Category:Cultural depictions of Lucky Luciano Category:Cultural depictions of Bugsy Siegel ",
