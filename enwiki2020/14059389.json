In 1994 he was appointed by South African President Nelson Mandela to chair a Prison Audit Committee and was subsequently involved in the creation of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.

Currin now co-chairs the Sentence Review Commission in Northern Ireland, which decides on the early release of prisoners who have committed terrorism-related offences. In 2000, he became an independent mediator in the Drumcree parading dispute and said that he hoped he could achieve a breakthrough in the mediation role because he was a completely independent outsider. But he quit his role in December 2001, saying that as Portadown Orangemen had withdrawn from dialogue, he was \"unable to take the process any further\".Drumcree parade mediator quits, Bbc.co.uk; accessed 29 August 2017. ==Involvement in the Basque Conflict== Currin has been involved since 2004Interview with Brian Currin - \"Alliance Magazine\", 16 May 2012.
