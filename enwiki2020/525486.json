    "text": "The Mission is a 1986 British period drama film about the experiences of a Jesuit missionary in 18th-century South America. Directed by Roland Joff\u00e9 and written by Robert Bolt, the film stars Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, Ray McAnally, Aidan Quinn, Cherie Lunghi, and Liam Neeson. It won the Cannes Film Festival Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. In April 2007, it was elected number one on the Church Times Top 50 Religious Films list. Furthermore, it is one of fifteen films listed in the category \"Religion\" on the Vatican film list. The music, scored by Italian composer Ennio Morricone, ranked 1st on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) Classic 100 Music in the Movies. ==Plot== In the 1740s, Spanish Jesuit priest Father Gabriel enters the northeastern Argentina and eastern Paraguayan jungle to build a mission station and convert a Guaran\u00ed community to Christianity. The Guaran\u00ed are not initially receptive to Christianity or outsiders in general, and they tie a priest to a wooden cross and send him over the Iguazu Falls. Father Gabriel travels to the falls, climbs to the top, and plays his oboe. One of the Guaran\u00ed warriors, seeing that the stranger is European, breaks the oboe, throws it down into the water, then stalks off. Father Gabriel does not react, however, and the impressed Guarani, who were captivated by the music, allow him to live. Mercenary and slaver Rodrigo Mendoza makes his living kidnapping natives such as the Guarani community and selling them to nearby plantations, including the plantation of the Spanish Governor Don Cabeza. After returning from another kidnapping trip, Mendoza is told by his assumed fianc\u00e9e, Carlotta, that she loves his younger half-brother Felipe. Mendoza later finds them in bed together and in a fit of rage kills Felipe in a duel. Although he is acquitted of the killing of Felipe, Mendoza spirals into depression. Father Gabriel visits and challenges Mendoza to undertake a suitable penance. Mendoza accompanies the Jesuits on their return journey, dragging a heavy bundle containing his armour and sword. After initially tense moments upon reaching the outskirts of the natives' territory, since they recognize their former persecutor, the natives soon come to embrace a tearful Mendoza and cut away his heavy bundle. Father Gabriel's mission is depicted as a place of sanctuary and education for the Guaran\u00ed. Moved by the Guaran\u00ed's acceptance, Mendoza wishes to help at the mission and Father Gabriel gives him a Bible. In time, Mendoza takes vows and becomes a Jesuit under Father Gabriel and his colleague Father Fielding. The Jesuit missions were safe, because they were protected under Spanish law. The Treaty of Madrid (1750) reapportioned South American land on which the Jesuit missions were located, transferring the area to the Portuguese, who allowed slavery. The Portuguese colonials seek to enslave the natives, and as the independent Jesuit missions might impede this, Papal emissary Cardinal Altamirano, a former Jesuit priest, is sent from the Vatican to survey the missions and decide which, if any, should be allowed to remain. Under pressure from both Cabeza and Portuguese representative Hontar, Cardinal Altamirano is forced to choose between two evils. If he rules in favour of the colonists, the indigenous peoples will become enslaved; if he rules in favour of the missions, the entire Jesuit Order may be condemned by the Portuguese and the European Catholic Church could fracture. Altamirano visits the missions and is amazed at their industry and success, both in converting the Indians and, in some cases, economically. At Father Gabriel's mission of San Carlos, he tries to explain the reasons behind closing the mission and instructs the Guaran\u00ed that they must leave, because it is God's will. The Guaran\u00ed question the validity of his claim, and argue God's will was to settle and develop the mission. Father Gabriel and Mendoza, under threat of excommunication, state their intention to defend the mission alongside the Guaran\u00ed if the plantation owners and colonists attack. They are, however, divided on how to do this, and they debate how to respond to the impending military attack. Father Gabriel believes that violence is a direct crime against God. Mendoza, however, decides to break his vows by militarily defending the Mission. Against Father Gabriel's wishes, he teaches the natives the European art of war and once more takes up his sword. When a joint Portuguese and Spanish force attacks, the mission is initially defended by Mendoza, Fielding, and the Guaran\u00ed. They are no match for the military force, and Mendoza is shot and fatally wounded after the soldiers destroy a trap, allowing them to enter the village. Fielding sacrifices himself by killing the Portuguese commander before he is killed. Upon seeing the church at the mission village the soldiers become reluctant to fire. When the soldiers enter the mission village, they encounter the singing of Father Gabriel and the Guaran\u00ed women and children who march in the procession. Father Gabriel leads, carrying a monstrance with the Blessed Sacrament. Ignoring this, the Spanish commander orders the attack; Father Gabriel, the rest of the priests and most of the Guaran\u00ed, including women and children, are gunned down. After Father Gabriel is shot, a child picks up the Blessed Sacrament and leads the procession. Only a handful escape into the jungle. In a final exchange between Cardinal Altamirano and Hontar, Hontar laments that what happened was unfortunate but inevitable: \"We must work in the world; the world is thus.\" Altamirano rejoins: \"No, thus have we made the world. Thus have I made it.\" Days later, a canoe of young children return to the scene of the Mission massacre and salvage a few belongings. They set off up the river, going deeper into the jungle, with the thought that the events will remain in their memories. A final title declares that many priests have continued to fight for the rights of indigenous people into the present day. The text of John 1:5 is displayed: \"The light shineth in the darkness, and the darkness hath not overcome it.\" ==Cast== *Robert De Niro as Captain Rodrigo Mendoza *Jeremy Irons as Father Gabriel *Ray McAnally as Cardinal Altamirano *Aidan Quinn as Felipe Mendoza *Cherie Lunghi as Carlotta *Ronald Pickup as Hontar *Chuck Low as Don Cabeza **Fred Melamed provides Don Cabeza's voice (uncredited) *Liam Neeson as Father John Fielding *Bercelio Moya as Indian Boy *Sigifredo Ismare as Witch Doctor *Asuncion Ontiveros as Indian Chief *Alejandrino Moya as Chief's Lieutenant *Daniel Berrigan as Sebastian *Rolf Gray as Father Ralph *\u00c1lvaro Guerrero as Jesuit ==Historical basis== The Mission is based on events surrounding the Treaty of Madrid in 1750, in which Spain ceded part of Jesuit Paraguay to Portugal. A significant subtext is the impending suppression of the Jesuits, of which Father Gabriel is warned by the film's narrator, Cardinal Altamirano, who was once himself a Jesuit. Altamirano, speaking in hindsight in 1758, corresponds to the actual Andalusian Jesuit Father Luis Altamirano, who was sent by Jesuit Superior General Ignacio Visconti to Paraguay in 1752 to transfer territory from Spain to Portugal. He oversaw the transfer of seven missions south and east of the R\u00edo Uruguay, that had been settled by Guaran\u00ed and Jesuits in the 17th century. As compensation, Spain promised each mission 4,000 pesos, or fewer than 1 peso for each of the approximately 30,000 Guaran\u00ed of the seven missions, while the cultivated lands, livestock, and buildings were estimated to be worth 7\u201316 million pesos. The film's climax is the Guaran\u00ed War of 1754\u20131756, during which historical Guaran\u00ed defended their homes against Spanish-Portuguese forces implementing the Treaty of Madrid. For the film, a re-creation was made of one of the seven missions, S\u00e3o Miguel das Miss\u00f5es.James Schofield Saeger (1995) \"The Mission and Historical Missions: Film and the Writing of History.\" The Americas, Vol. 51, No. 3, pp. 393\u2013415. Father Gabriel's character is loosely based on the life of Paraguayan saint and Jesuit Roque Gonz\u00e1lez de Santa Cruz. The story is taken from the book The Lost Cities of Paraguay by Father C. J. McNaspy, S.J., who was also a consultant on the film. The waterfall setting of the film suggests the combination of these events with the story of older missions, founded between 1610\u20131630 on the Paranapanema River above the Gua\u00edra Falls, from which Paulista slave raids forced Guaran\u00ed and Jesuits to flee in 1631. The battle at the end of the film evokes the eight-day Battle of Mboror\u00e9 in 1641, a battle fought on land as well as in boats on rivers, in which the Jesuit-organised, firearm-equipped Guaran\u00ed forces stopped the Paulista raiders. ===Historical inaccuracies=== The historical Altamirano was not a cardinal sent by the Pope, but an emissary sent by the Superior General of the Society of Jesus, Ignacio Visconti, to preserve the Jesuits in Europe in the face of attacks in Spain and Portugal. ==Filming locations== The film was mostly filmed in Colombia, Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. The tunnels of Fort Amherst in Kent were used as part of the monastery where Mendoza (Robert De Niro) was held. ==Soundtrack== The soundtrack for The Mission was written by Ennio Morricone. Beginning with a liturgical piece (\"On Earth as It Is in Heaven\") which becomes the 'Spanish' theme, it moves quickly to the 'Guaran\u00ed' theme, which is written in a heavily native style and uses several indigenous instruments. Later, Morricone defines The Mission theme as a duet between the 'Spanish' and \"Guaran\u00ed\" themes. The soundtrack was recorded at CTS Lansdowne Studios in London. Other themes throughout the movie include the 'Penance', 'Conquest', and 'Ave Maria Guaran\u00ed' themes. In the latter, a large choir of indigenous people sing a rendition of the \"Ave Maria\". ==Reception== ===Box Office=== The film grossed $17.2 million at the US and international box office against a budget of \u00a316.5 million, which at the time was the US equivalent of $25.4 million, making this film a commercial flop. Goldcrest Films invested \u00a315,130,000 in the film and received \u00a312,250,000 in returns, netting Goldcrest a \u00a32,880,000 loss. ===Critical=== The Mission received mixed reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 64% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 25 reviews, with an average rating of 6.32/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \"The Mission is a well-meaning epic given delicate heft by its sumptuous visuals and a standout score by Ennio Morricone, but its staid presentation never stirs an emotional investment in its characters.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100 based on 18 critic reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". ==Awards and honours== Academy Awards *Best Picture \u2013 Fernando Ghia and David Puttnam (nominated) *Best Director \u2013 Roland Joff\u00e9 (nominated) *Best Art Direction \u2013 Stuart Craig and Jack Stephens (nominated) *Best Cinematography \u2013 Chris Menges (won) *Best Costume Design \u2013 Enrico Sabbatini (nominated) *Best Film Editing \u2013 Jim Clark (nominated) *Best Original Score \u2013 Ennio Morricone (nominated) BAFTA Film Awards *Best Film \u2013 Fernando Ghia, David Puttnam and Roland Joff\u00e9 (nominated) *Best Director \u2013 Roland Joff\u00e9 (nominated) *Best Actor in a Supporting Role \u2013 Ray McAnally (won) *Best Original Screenplay \u2013 Robert Bolt (nominated) *Best Cinematography \u2013 Chris Menges (nominated) *Best Costume Design \u2013 Enrico Sabbatini (nominated) *Best Film Editing \u2013 Jim Clark (won) *Best Film Music \u2013 Ennio Morricone (won) *Best Production Design \u2013 Stuart Craig (nominated) *Best Sound \u2013 Ian Fuller, Bill Rowe and Clive Winter (nominated) *Best Special Visual Effects \u2013 Peter Hutchinson (nominated) Cannes Film Festival *Palme d'Or \u2013 Roland Joff\u00e9 (won) *Technical Grand Prize \u2013 Roland Joff\u00e9 (won) Golden Globe Awards *Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama (nominated) *Best Director \u2013 Roland Joff\u00e9 (nominated) *Best Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama \u2013 Jeremy Irons (nominated) *Best Screenplay \u2013 Robert Bolt (won) *Best Original Score \u2013 Ennio Morricone (won) ===Others=== The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2005: AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores \u2013 #23 ==See also== *Iguazu Falls ==References== ==External links== * * * *The Mission at the Arts & Faith Top100 Spiritually Significant Films list Category:1986 films Category:British films Category:Films directed by Roland Joff\u00e9 Category:Films set in Brazil Category:Films set in Paraguay Category:Films set in jungles Category:Palme d'Or winners Category:Films about religion Category:Films about Catholicism Category:British historical films Category:1980s historical films Category:Goldcrest Films films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in the 1750s Category:Spanish-language films Category:Latin-language films Category:Society of Jesus Category:Films with screenplays by Robert Bolt Category:Films about Catholic priests Category:Films whose cinematographer won the Best Cinematography Academy Award Category:Films shot in Foz do Igua\u00e7u Category:Films shot in Colombia Category:Films set in South America Category:British epic films Category:Films about hunter-gatherers Category:Indigenous cinema in Latin America Category:Films scored by Ennio Morricone Category:Films produced by David Puttnam Category:Fratricide in fiction ",
