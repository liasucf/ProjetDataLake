In 1917, he wrote the book Warfare of the Future. ==Early life and education== Jervey was born on June 5, 1866. He attended The University of the South, graduating in 1884. He attended United States Military Academy and graduated first in the class of 1888. ==Military service== Three years after graduating from USMA, Jervey graduated from the Army Engineering School of Application. Following that, he worked in various civil engineering roles with the US Army Corps of Engineers, improving the Mississippi River from 1898 to 1899, and managing rivers and harbors on the west coast of Florida from 1899 to 1900. From 1901 to 1903, Jervey served in the Philippines during the Philippine\u2013American War in an undocumented capacity. Afterwards, he was an instructor at USMA from 1903 to 1905. Jervey returned to engineering work in 1905, managing rivers, harbors, and defenses of the Mobile District.Marquis Who's Who, Inc. Who Was Who in American History, the Military.

In 1917 he was promoted to Brigadier general and assigned to the 66th Field Artillery Brigade, a unit in the 41st Infantry Division (United States). Shortly after, he assumed command of the entire division from September 20, 1917 to January 8, 1918. Following that, he did a brief stint as the commandant of U.S. Army Engineer School (the former Army Engineering School of Application). In February 1918, he was moved to the War Department General Staff where he was made Director of Operations (G-3). This led to his promotion to Major general in October 1918. He was decorated with the Distinguished Service Medal for his service as Director of Operations. Following the end of the war in November 1918, he was reverted to his previous rank of Brigadier general and assumed command of the 11th Field Artillery Brigade in Hawaii. Jervey retired on April 10, 1922. During his service, he wrote one book, Warfare of the Future, which was published in 1917, prior to the outbreak of World War I and his promotion to Brigadier general. In it, he states that the US would not be likely to send expeditionary forces to another country if drawn into a conflict with a \"first-rate\" power, a prediction that would be proven false only a few months later.Jervey, Henry.
