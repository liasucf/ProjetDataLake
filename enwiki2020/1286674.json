During its time of existence, it was a very prestigious South American club football contest, similar to the UEFA Cup. Clubs qualified for the competition based on their performance in their national leagues and cup competitions. Teams that were not able to qualify for the Copa Libertadores would play in this tournament. The tournament was played as a knockout cup. The tournament ended in 1999, following the expansion of Copa Libertadores to 32 teams. The Copa Mercosur and Copa Merconorte, which both started in 1998, replaced the Copa CONMEBOL; both cups would later be merged in the current Copa Sudamericana.Historia de la Copa Conmebol en p\u00e1gina oficial Conmebol.com CONMEBOL Retrieved May 18, 2010.CONMEBOL Cup / UEFA Cup RSSSF Retrieved May 18, 2010.Informaci\u00f3n sobre la Copa Conmebol infofutbolonline.com Retrieved May 18, 2010THE BEST CLUB OF SOUTH AMERICA RSSSF Retrieved January 9, 2014Globo Esporte Retrieved December 10, 2007Terra Brazil- Retrieved December 5, 2012Santander F\u00fatbol- Retrieved July 16, 2012 The last champion of the competition was Talleres, while Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro is the most successful club in the cup history, having won the tournament two times.

The best teams from the previous season that did not qualify for the Copa Libertadores through their league qualified for the Copa CONMEBOL. The tournament itself was played in two-legged knockout stages. The champion of the Copa CONMEBOL disputed the Recopa Sudamericana, the Copa de Oro and the Copa Master de CONMEBOL, albeit irregularly. ===Tournament=== The tournament started in the first stage in which 16 clubs were paired in a series of two- legged knockout ties in the round of 16, the first of four stages that worked on a single elimination phase knockout system that culminated in the finals. During each stage of the tournament, ties were decided on points, followed by goal difference, away goals, then a penalty shootout after full-time of the second leg, if necessary. ==Finals== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=#F2F2F2 !width=3%|Year !width=7%|Country !width=11%|Home team !width=4%|Score !width=11%|Away team !width=7%|Country !width=20%|Venue !width=18%|Location !width=3%|Refs |- |rowspan=3 align=center|1992 | |Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro |align=center|2\u20130 |Olimpia | |Mineir\u00e3o |Belo Horizonte, Brazil |rowspan=3 align=center| |- | |Olimpia |align=center|1\u20130 |Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro | |Estadio Defensores del Chaco |Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay |- |colspan=7 align=center bgcolor=#FFFF99|2\u20132 on points; Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro won 2\u20131 on aggregate # |- |rowspan=3 align=center|1993 | |Pe\u00f1arol |align=center|1\u20131 |Botafogo | |Estadio Centenario |Montevideo, Uruguay |rowspan=3 align=center| |- | |Botafogo |align=center|2\u20132 |Pe\u00f1arol | |Est\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3 |Rio de Janeiro, Brazil |- |colspan=7 align=center bgcolor=#CEDFF2|2\u20132 on points and 3\u20133 on aggregate; Botafogo won 3\u20131 in a penalty shootout * |- |rowspan=3 align=center|1994 | |S\u00e3o Paulo |align=center|6\u20131 |Pe\u00f1arol | |Est\u00e1dio do Morumbi |S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil |rowspan=3 align=center| |- | |Pe\u00f1arol |align=center|3\u20130 |S\u00e3o Paulo | |Estadio Centenario |Montevideo, Uruguay |- |colspan=7 align=center bgcolor=FFFF99|3\u20133 on points; S\u00e3o Paulo won 6\u20134 on aggregate # |- |rowspan=3 align=center|1995 | |Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro |align=center|4\u20130 |Rosario Central | |Mineir\u00e3o |Belo Horizonte, Brazil |rowspan=3 align=center| |- | |Rosario Central |align=center|4\u20130 |Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro | |Estadio Gigante de Arroyito |Rosario, Argentina |- |colspan=7 align=center bgcolor=CEDFF2|3\u20133 on points and 4\u20134 on aggregate; Rosario Central won 4\u20133 in a penalty shootout * |- |rowspan=3 align=center|1996 | |Lan\u00fas |align=center|2\u20130 |Santa Fe | |La Fortaleza |Lan\u00fas, Argentina |rowspan=3 align=center| |- | |Santa Fe |align=center|1\u20130 |Lan\u00fas | |Estadio El Camp\u00edn |Bogot\u00e1, Colombia |- |colspan=7 align=center bgcolor=FFFF99|3\u20133 on points; Lan\u00fas won 2\u20131 on aggregate # |- |rowspan=3 align=center|1997 | |Lan\u00fas |align=center|1\u20134 |Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro | |La Fortaleza |Lan\u00fas, Argentina |rowspan=3 align=center| |- | |Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro |align=center|1\u20131 |Lan\u00fas | |Mineir\u00e3o |Belo Horizonte, Brazil |- |colspan=7 align=center|Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro won 4\u20131 on points |- |rowspan=3 align=center|1998 | |Santos |align=center|1\u20130 |Rosario Central | |Est\u00e1dio Vila Belmiro |Santos, Brazil |rowspan=3 align=center| |- | |Rosario Central |align=center|0-0 |Santos | |Estadio Gigante de Arroyito |Rosario, Argentina |- |colspan=7 align=center|Santos won 4\u20131 on points |- |rowspan=3 align=center|1999 | |CSA |align=center|4\u20132 |Talleres | |Est\u00e1dio Rei Pel\u00e9 |Macei\u00f3, Brazil |rowspan=3 align=center| |- | |Talleres |align=center|3\u20130 |CSA | |Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Chateau Carreras |C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina |- |colspan=7 align=center bgcolor=FFFF99|3\u20133 on points; Talleres won 5\u20134 on aggregate # |} ===Winners=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Club !Winners !Runners-up !class=\"unsortable\" width=\"130\"|Years won !class=\"unsortable\" width=\"130\"|Years runner-up |- | Atl\u00e9tico Mineiro||align=center|2||align=center|1||1992, 1997||1995 |- | Rosario Central||align=center|1||align=center|1||1995||1998 |- | Lan\u00fas||align=center|1||align=center|1||1996||1997 |- | Botafogo||align=center|1||align=center|0||1993|| |- | S\u00e3o Paulo||align=center|1||align=center|0||1994|| |- | Santos||align=center|1||align=center|0||1998|| |- | Talleres||align=center|1||align=center|0||1999|| |} ==See also== *Copa Sudamericana *Copa Mercosur *Copa Merconorte *Copa Interamericana *Copa Libertadores *Copa Master de CONMEBOL == References == ==External links== *CONMEBOL Cup at RSSSF *Copa Conmebol *Informaci\u00f3n sobre la Copa Conmebol *Globo Esporte Category:Defunct CONMEBOL club competitions Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1992 Category:Recurring events disestablished in 1999 ",
