    "text": "Nogometno dru\u0161tvo Gorica, commonly referred to as ND Gorica or simply Gorica, is a Slovenian football club playing in the town of Nova Gorica. They are one of the most successful Slovenian clubs with four Slovenian PrvaLiga and three Slovenian Cup titles. The club plays its matches at the Nova Gorica Sports Park stadium with the capacity of 3,100 seats. As of the 2020\u201321 season, Gorica plays in the Slovenian PrvaLiga, the top-tier league in Slovenia. ==History== ===Beginnings (1947\u20131991)=== The history of Slovenian association football in the Gori\u0161ka region goes back to 1907, when the first football club Jugoslavija was formed by the Slovenes of Gorizia. October 1947 marks the beginning of the club with the foundation of FD Gorica in \u0160empeter pri Gorici, where it operated until 1963. They started in the second-level but quickly promoted to the Slovenian Republic League in 1950 under the new name \u017delezni\u010dar Nova Gorica. Five years later they became republic champions and qualified for the Yugoslav Second League, which was club's biggest achievement during the time of Yugoslavia. In 1963 the club merged with Branik Solkan and the club's activity was transferred to Nova Gorica, where it remains ever since. They stabilised as a mid-table club in the 1960s, renamed to NK Vozila in 1971 and achieved better results only in the last years before the Slovenian independence. Managed by Pavel Pinni, Vozila finished third in the 1988\u201389 season of the Slovenian Republic League. ===Slovenian independence (1991 to present)=== After the independence of Slovenia in 1991, the club played in the 1. SNL under the name HIT Gorica and during the 1995\u201396 season, Gorica won the Slovenian championship for the first time. In the next season, the club played its first Slovenian Supercup final and won their second trophy with a 3\u20131 victory over Olimpija. During the league domination of Maribor, the club managed to win two Slovenian cup titles in a row (2000\u201301 and 2001\u201302). On the last day of the 2003\u201304 season on 30 May 2004, Gorica won its second title after one of the most dramatic rounds in the Slovenian league history. Before the last round, Maribor was leading the table with 54 points, one point ahead of Gorica. In the final round, Maribor played an away match against their rivals Mura and Gorica played at home against Koper. Maribor lost the game 2\u20131 after a second-half comeback by Mura, meaning that Gorica, who eventually won against Koper 2\u20130, had secured their second title. The second title started an impressive run for Gorica as the team won another two league titles in a row (2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306). After the last title, Gorica was a runner-up in the 2006\u201307 and 2008\u201309 seasons, while finishing third in 2007\u201308 and 2009\u201310. In 2013, Gorica became associated with Parma. On 21 May 2014 they won their first trophy after eight years as they defeated Maribor 2\u20130 in the cup final. After 28 seasons in the top division, Gorica was relegated for the first time in the 2018\u201319 season after losing a relegation play-offs against Tabor Se\u017eana. ==Current squad== As of 28 August 2020 ==Honours== League *Slovenian First League: 4 :: 1995\u201396, 2003\u201304, 2004\u201305, 2005\u201306 Cup *Slovenian Cup: 3 :: 2000\u201301, 2001\u201302, 2013\u201314 *Slovenian Supercup: 1 :: 1996 ==Notable managers== The following managers have won at least one trophy when in charge of Gorica after the independence of Slovenia in 1991: * Milan Miklavi\u010d (1995\u20131996) * Toni Toma\u017ei\u010d (2001) * Pavel Pinni (2001\u20132006) * Luigi Apolloni (2013\u20132014) ==Domestic league and cup results== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !Season !League !Position !Pts !Played !W !D !L !GF !GA !Cup |- |1991\u201392 |1.
