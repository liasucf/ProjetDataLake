Federman was raised on stories of that period, and considers his own beliefs similar to those of Avraham Stern. When he was asked if the similarity between the wartime group's activities and those of his own group was violence against Arabs, he replied, \"Hitting the enemy is not a bad thing.\u201d Federman is a radical settler activist associated with the outlawed Kach party, of which he was one time spokesman.Giuliano Della Pergola, Israele, un amore inquieto: discussioni sull'ebraismo contemporaneo, Rubbettino Editore, 2003, p. 84. A few hours after news that the Kach leaderMeir Kahane's assassination reached Israel, two elderly Palestinians, Mohammed Ali (73) and Mariam Suleiman Hassan (71), were gunned down in an incident ascribed to Kach militants. Federman was quoted as saying that the slayings had been committed as revenge by Kahane supporters, and that more violence was in the pipeline.Michael Kelly 'Trotsky kin is arrested in deaths on West Bank,' Baltimore Sun 10 November 1990 After his fellow Hebronite settler Baruch Goldstein machine-gunned 29 Palestinians at prayer in the Cave of the Patriarchs Massacre, Federman paid tribute hailing him as a holy hero,Massimo Nava, Vittime: Storie di guerra sul fronte della pace, Fazi Editore 2005, p. 273: 'definiva un heroe santo il dottor Goldstein.' stating 'The act itself was one of greatness. It was a great act of sanctifying the Name (God).'Scott Kraft, 'Extremists Pay Tribute to Killer of 48 at Funeral,' Los Angeles Times, 28 February 1994. He openly expressed his satisfaction at the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and was investigated for incitement against Binjamin Netanyahu after the latter signed accords with the Palestinians, whom he advocates expelling from both the West Bank and Gaza Strip. On 1 September 1998, Federman was charged on suspicion of having kicked a Hebronite, Mamoun Ja'abri, in the stomach and then spitting on him, and also of assault of a United States Embassy worker.Amy Klein, ' Federman charged with attempted assaults,' Jerusalem Post 2 September 1998. On 24 May 2002, his brother, Eli Federman, while on duty as a security guard outside the Studio49 Tel Aviv nightclub, shot and killed a suicide car bomber just seconds before he could drive his vehicle into the crowded club, preventing many deaths. Anchorman David Witztum, reporting the incident, contrasted Eli's behavior to that of his radical brother. Eli described his actions thus: > I fired one bullet at him. He fell out of the car and blew up. After the > blast, I shot him twice in the head, and then moved closer and emptied the > rest of the clip into his head.'Nitzan Ben-Shaul, Violent World: TV News > Images of Middle Eastern Terror and War, Rowman & Littlefield, 2007, p. 112. In May 2002, after 2 men from the Bat Ayin settlement were discovered outside a girls' school in a Palestinian neighbourhood on the Mount of Olives with a bomb timed to explode in the morning when students would be arriving, police investigators took 6 people into custody, including Federman, whom the Shin Bet regarded as \"the brain behind this organization\".John Kifner, 'Israel Arrests Settlers It Says Tried to Bomb Palestinians,' New York Times 19 May 2002 He was subsequently accused of having provided the explosives to be used to blow up the girls school, and put under house arrest for over half a year.'Settlers charged with bomb plot,' BBC 28 May 2002. All charges were later dropped, Federman was acquitted and he successfully sued the state for false arrest. He was in the news recently after his home and farm, which he had built without a building permit, near Kiryat Arba and Hebron was torn down in the middle of the night. In November 2005, the Israeli Ministry of Justice expressed its intention to review Federman's application to be licensed as an attorney, claiming that a person with a past as rich with disturbing the peace as his may not be eligible for a license. Federman, addressing the ministry's comment to the press, replied that it was in pattern with the courts' and prosecutor's offices past restrictive behavior towards him that they would now seek to bar him from acquiring the title he worked for as a law student. In 2008, Federman was indicted for assaulting a policeman, but was acquitted in 2010 after prosecutors failed to show up for the trial, due to a prosecutors' strike.Nir Hasson 'No Prosecutor?
