    "text": "The Shetucket River is a tributary of the Thames River, long,U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed April 1, 2011 in eastern Connecticut in the United States. It is formed at Willimantic by the junction of the Willimantic and Natchaug rivers. It flows southeast and south. Approximately northeast of Norwich it receives the Quinebaug River and broadens into a wide estuary which stretches southeast for approximately and joins the Thames estuary on the south side of Norwich. The river flows through a rural section of New England, despite the historical presence of industry in the surrounding region. Parts of the rivers have been designated by the federal government as the Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor. The National Park Service describes the river valley as the \"last green valley\" in the Boston- to-Washington megalopolis. In nighttime satellite photos, the valley appears distinctively dark amidst the lights of the surrounding urban and suburban regions. ==Crossings== {| class=wikitable ! Carries !
