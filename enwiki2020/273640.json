In Catalonia and today's Valencian Community the name of the coalition was Front d'Esquerres (in Catalan, meaning Front of the Left).Pag\u00e8s i Blanch, Pelai. War and Revolution in Catalonia, 1936-1939. Leiden, The Netherlands: Brill Books Vol. 58, Historical Materialism Book Series, 2013. The Popular Front included the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), Communist Party of Spain (PCE), the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM, independent communist) and the republicans: Republican Left (IR), (led by Aza\u00f1a) and Republican Union (UR), led by Diego Mart\u00ednez Barrio. This pact was supported by Galician (PG) and Catalan nationalists (ERC), socialist union Workers' General Union (UGT), and the anarchist trade union, the Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT). Many anarchists who would later fight alongside Popular Front forces during the Spanish Civil War did not support them in the election, urging abstention instead. The Joseph Stalin-controlled Comintern had decided in 1935 that, in response to the growth of Fascism, popular fronts allying Communist parties with other anti-Fascist parties including Socialist and even bourgeois parties were advisable. In Spain, it was a coalition between leftist republicans and workers' organizations to defend social reforms of the first government (1931\u20131933) of the Second Spanish Republic, and liberate the prisoners, political prisoners according with the front propaganda, held since the Asturian October Revolution (1934). The Popular Front defeated the National Front (a collection of right-wing parties) and won the 1936 election, forming the new Spanish Government. Manuel Aza\u00f1a was elected President of the Republic on May 1936, but the PSOE didn't join the government because of the opposition of Francisco Largo Caballero. In July 1936, conservative/monarchist generals instigated a coup d'\u00e9tat which started the Spanish Civil War (1936\u20131939). The Government dissolved the Spanish Republican Army in the loyal territory and brought weapons to armed groups organized by the unions (UGT and CNT) and workers' parties (PSOE, PCE, POUM) that had initial success in defeating the Francoist forces in Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao and Valencia. In October the same year, the Spanish Republican Army was reorganized. After a protracted war of attrition Franco would defeat the Republican forces and rule Spain as a dictatorship until he died in 1975. ==History== ===Foundation and the manifesto of the Popular Front=== The Popular Front was formed in 1936 by a coalition of left-wing republican parties. The Popular Front's founding manifesto condemned the actions of the conservative-led government, demanding the release of political prisoners detained after November 1933, the re-hiring of state employees who had been suspended, fired, or transferred \"without due process or for reasons of political persecution\", it proposed establishing a judiciary independent from government control, the investigation and prosecution of acts of unwarranted violence by police, and revision of the Law of Public Order to protect the rights of citizens against arbitrary power.Payne, Stanley. Spain's first democracy: the Second Republic, 1931-1936. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: University of Wisconsin Press, 1993. p. 266. The manifesto stressed political moderation against radicalism.Payne, Stanley. Spain's first democracy: the Second Republic, 1931-1936. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: University of Wisconsin Press, 1993. p. 267. The manifesto advocated a moderate left-leaning economic policy that rejected the idea of nationalization of land and instead supported the provision of state economic assistance to agriculture, a new progressive tenancy law, and promotion of collective forms of production. It supported protectionist measures to defend national industry, encouraged state research to assist national industry, promised protection of small businesses, major expansion of public works, and progressive tax reform. The manifesto declared the Popular Front's opposition to class-based society, stating \"The Republic conceived of by the Republican parties is not a Republic dominated by social or economic class interests, but a regime of democratic liberty...\" but it promised the restoration of certain economic policies of the 1931-33 Spanish government, including increased wages for farmworkers. Later, in 1938, a system of family allowances was introduced.Hicks, Alexander. Social Democracy and Welfare Capitalism: A Century of Income Security Policies. The manifesto promised the restoration of legislation guaranteeing regional autonomy that was revoked by the conservative-led government. ===Members=== Members to the coalition were: *Spanish Socialist Workers' Party \u2013 Socialist *Communist Party of Spain \u2013 Communist *Workers' Party of Marxist Unification \u2013 Independent Communist *Republican Left \u2013 Republican *Republican Union \u2013 Republican It was also supported by: *Republican Left of Catalonia \u2013 Catalan nationalist *Galicianist Party \u2013 Galician nationalist *Workers' General Union \u2013 Socialist trade union *CNT-FAI \u2013 Anarcho-syndicalist trade union ===1936 Election and immediate aftermath=== In the Spanish 1936 election, the Popular Front won the election with its leader Manuel Aza\u00f1a elected President of Spain.Payne, Stanley. Spain's first democracy: the Second Republic, 1931-1936. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: University of Wisconsin Press, 1993. p. 281. The Popular Front received 4,654,116 votes compared to the opponent combined right-wing vote of 4,503,524 votes.Romero Salvad\u00f3, Francisco J. Twentieth-century Spain: politics and society in Spain, 1898-1998. Hampshire, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: PALGRAVE, 1999. p. 90. It elected 278 deputies \u2013 99 of which belonged to the Socialists (PSOE), while the right-wing elected 124 deputies \u2013 88 of which belonged to the CEDA. Many of the elected members of the Popular Front were professional persons, several of whom were from wealthy backgrounds. People of various political backgrounds within the Popular Front were appointed to President Aza\u00f1a's cabinet, such as Am\u00f3s Salvador, architect and wealthy landowner, and Jos\u00e9 Alonso Mallol, a former Radical Socialist.Payne, Stanley. Spain's first democracy: the Second Republic, 1931-1936. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: University of Wisconsin Press, 1993. p. 282. Upon the election of the Popular Front, the Popular Front held a victory march in Madrid with over 250,000 supporters, with its Socialist and Communist party components marching in uniform in the thousands. The Popular Front immediately delivered its promise in its manifesto of rehiring workers fired for political reasons without due process and to reimburse them based on individual cases for wages lost to an extent of not less than thirty-nine days' wages nor more than six months.Payne, Stanley. Spain's first democracy: the Second Republic, 1931-1936. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: University of Wisconsin Press, 1993. p. 283. Aza\u00f1a responded to the recent surge of acts of violence, arson, and vandalism by radical leftists against right-wing parties and Catholic Church institutions by denouncing these actions. Uncontrolled political violence continued through to March with the greatest disturbance taking place in Granada where a violent act by right-wing political forces provoked a general strike and mass riot by left-wing political forces there.Payne, Stanley. Spain's first democracy: the Second Republic, 1931-1936. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: University of Wisconsin Press, 1993. p. 284. In particular, violence involving Communists and Socialists versus Falangists resulted in multiple murders.Payne, Stanley. Spain's first democracy: the Second Republic, 1931-1936. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: University of Wisconsin Press, 1993. p. 285. By July there had been 269 political killings.Romero Salvad\u00f3, Francisco J. Twentieth-century Spain: politics and society in Spain, 1898-1998. Hampshire, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: PALGRAVE, 1999. p. 91. Aza\u00f1a acceded to demands by left-wing movements for punishment of General Eduardo L\u00f3pez Ochoa, the army leader of the 1934 Asturian campaign against workers' movements there. The Spanish Republican government also made major changes to the Spanish Army, pro-Republican or neutral commanders were installed in multiple posts while commanders with questionable loyalties were moved to lesser or remote positions: for example, General Francisco Franco was removed as chief of staff of the army and moved to a position in the Canary Islands and General Emilio Mola was demoted from a major command in Spanish Morocco to a position as commander of a brigade in Pamplona.Payne, Stanley. Spain's first democracy: the Second Republic, 1931-1936. Madison, Wisconsin, USA: University of Wisconsin Press, 1993. p. 289. The government did not stay in power long, mainly because of the conflict of ideological views by many of the parties. The only factor working for the government was unity for the conquest of fascism. After the Republican defeat in the Spanish Civil War, the popular front was dissolved and Francisco Franco led as a dictatorship until 1975.Douglass, C. (1991). \"The fiesta cycle of Spain.\" in Anthropological Quarterly, 64(3), pp. 126-141. ==See also== * Spanish Civil War chronology 1936 * Popular Front (France) ==References== Category:1936 establishments in Spain Category:1939 disestablishments in Spain Category:Communist Party of Spain Category:Defunct political party alliances in Spain Category:Defunct socialist parties in Spain Category:Political parties disestablished in 1939 Category:Political parties established in 1936 Category:Political parties of the Spanish Civil War Category:Popular fronts Category:POUM Category:Republican Left of Catalonia Category:Republican parties in Spain Category:Second Spanish Republic Category:Spanish Socialist Workers' Party eo:Popola Fronto (gazeto) ",
