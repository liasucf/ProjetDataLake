She has been credited with reviving interest in the Metropolitan's Art Deco holdings by her authorship of an article in the museum's bulletin which drew attention to the collection. In 1979 Hunter-Stiebel was appointed associate curator of the Metropolitan museum's applied art department; she was the first permanent appointment in that department, and collected many objects of post-war design for the museum's holdings. In 1984 the property developer Donald Trump demolished the former Bonwit Teller department store on Fifth Avenue that was known for its exterior decoration. Hunter-Stiebel and the art gallery owner Robert Miller attempted to persuade Trump to donate the sculptural bronze reliefs from the building to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, but they were destroyed. Hunter-Stiebel caught a cab to the building site and attempted to pay the workmen for the sculptures, but was rebuffed. Hunter-Stiebel described the sculptures as \"irreplaceable architectural documents\", and described Trump as \"not an esthetic person\".GQ: The Secret to Donald Trump's Success | GQ, accessdate: January 13, 2017 Hunter-Stiebel left the Metropolitan Museum to join her husband and father-in-law at the art dealers Rosenberg & Stiebel, and later returned to curatorial work for the Portland Art Museum in the 2000s.Dealer Details: The National Art and Antique Dealers Association of America - Art and Antiques: Stiebel, Ltd. - Dealer Details, accessdate: January 13, 2017 Hunter-Stiebel left the Portland Museum in 2008; purportedly over a contractual dispute.OregonLive.com: Schnitzers donate $2 million; Hunter-Stiebel out | OregonLive.com, accessdate: January 13, 2017 Hunter- Stiebel curated several exhibitions at the Portland Museum including shows of 18th-century French painting, collections from the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, Paris, and Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum, and from the family holdings of the Grand Duchy of Hesse.The Royal Half: artnet Magazine - The Royal Half, accessdate: January 13, 2017 ==Bibliography== * The Fine Art of the Furniture Maker: Conversations with Wendell Castle, artist, and Penelope Hunter-Stiebel, curator, about selected works from the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester, 1981, with Wendell Castle) * American Glass Art; Evolution and Revolution (1982; with Paul Vickers Gardner, Paul E.
