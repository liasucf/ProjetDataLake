    "text": "Acetyl nitrate is the organic compound with the formula CH3C(O)ONO2. It is classified as the mixed anhydride of nitric and acetic acids. It is a colorless explosive liquid that fumes in moist air. ==Synthesis and reactions== It is prepared from acetic anhydride and dinitrogen pentoxide or with nitric acid: :(CH3CO)2O + HNO3 \u2192 CH3C(O)ONO2 \\+ CH3CO2H It hydrolyzes in air to acetic and nitric acid, the reverse of the above reaction. Alternatively, nitric acid adds to ketene. It is used for some nitrations and nitrolysis reactions.Louw, Robert \"Acetyl nitrate\" e-EROS Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis 2001, 1-2. It acetylates amines, akin to the behavior of acetyl chloride: :2 RNH2 \\+ CH3C(O)ONO2 \u2192 [RNH3]NO3 \\+ CH3C(O)NHR ==References== A. Pictet, E. Khotinsky: \u00dcber Acetylnitrat. in Chem.
