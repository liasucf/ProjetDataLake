The Technopark building complex was built between 1989 and 1993 as the first large single building on the industrial site of the former Escher Wyss & Cie company, and triggered the overall planning of the 17-hectare site. The project relies on the private design plan Techno Park (1991) and to the private design plan Escher Wyss area (1995/99).
