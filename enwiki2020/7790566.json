    "text": "Johnny Cristi\u00e1n Herrera Mu\u00f1oz (, born 9 May 1981) is a Chilean professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper and is the captain of Chilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n club Everton. He has played the most part of his career at Universidad de Chile, winning for the club eight league titles, a Copa Sudamericana, three cup titles and a supercup in 2015. He has represented Chilean football team at U20 level and Olympic level too, playing 21 official times for the adult team. Herrera has been part of Chile\u2019s both Copa Am\u00e9rica titles in 2015 and 2016. ==Club career== Herrera playing for the \"U\" in 2018. Born in Angol, Herrera joined Universidad de Chile youth squad and was promoted to the first/adult team in 1999. Three years later, he became the first-choice keeper after being back-up for Sergio Vargas, who left The Lions after 10 years playing there. In 2004, Herrera won his first professional title after defeating Cobreloa as visitors in the Torneo Apertura final, where he scored the winning goal during the shootout, giving the club their twelfth League title. In 2006, he moved to Brazilian giants Corinthians. Following an unsuccessful spell at Brazil \u2014 where only played nine official games \u2014 he returned to Chile and signed for Everton from Vina del Mar in 2007. There, he helped the team to win the 2008 Torneo Apertura. However, in June 2008, Herrera left Everton to sign for Audax Italiano. In 2011, Herrera returned to Universidad de Chile. That year he had a brilliant season, being a major figure in the club\u2019s first treble in its history after winning both league tournaments (Apertura and Clausura) and the Copa Sudamericana, under the guidance of coach Jorge Sampaoli. Noteworthy, Herrera was even chosen as the goalkeeper of the season by Conmebol. In 2012, he helped Universidad de Chile to win the Torneo Apertura, which meant the club\u2019s first ever league tri- championship, as well as the last reached during the Sampaoli era. On 20 May 2013, he featured in Universidad de Chile's 2\u20131 victory over Universidad Cat\u00f3lica in the 2012\u201313 Copa Chile Final, the club's fourth cup in the contest. On 18 March 2014, Herrera scored his first official goal in a 1\u20130 Copa Libertadores group stage win over Peru\u2019s Real Garcilaso, through a penalty kick. The same year he helped the club win the Torneo Apertura. His first League goal came on 22 November during a University Derby against Cat\u00f3lica in a 2\u20132 draw. On 2 December, Herrera won his twelfth professional title after defeating in the Copa Chile Final to rivals Colo-Colo in the shootout, where he saved a penalty and scored the winning goal. On 13 February 2016, he scored his third official goal in a 2\u20131 defeat to Palestino, after scoring on a successful penalty. ==International career== Herrera with the Chilean national team in 2017 Herrera has been representing the Chilean national team since he was a youth player, participating in its U-20 and U-23 levels, this last as one of the 23 players nominated to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. His first call-up to the adult team was in 2002 in a game against Mexico, but however his last was in 2005. Years later, during the best moment of his career between 2011 and 2012 playing for Universidad de Chile, Herrera curiously didn't receive nominations from Claudio Borghi, the incumbent coach. The press usually alluded to an internal dispute between them, but with Borghi's departure in December 2012, the situation changed in Herrera's favor. After almost 7 years absence, Herrera was reconsidered by Jorge Sampaoli, who finally took the helm. He received his first call up from Sampaoli for the friendly matches against Haiti and Senegal in January 2013, where he stated that Herrera would play against Haiti, rotating the goal- keeping duties with Christopher Toselli. Nevertheless, he played both games which were 2\u20131 and 3\u20130 wins respectively. On 5 March 2014, Herrera earned his eighth cap against Germany in Stuttgart after replacing first-choice Claudio Bravo due to injury. However, he gave a fine performance during the game played at Mercedes-Benz Arena which Chile lost 1\u20130 on a Mario G\u00f6tze goal. Having been part of the entire qualification campaign since Sampaoli\u2018s taking, Herrera was named in Chile's list of 23 for the FIFA World Cup in Brazil. On 5 June, he played in a 2\u20130 friendly win over Northern Ireland, prior to the World Cup. He was part of the 2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica champion team as back-up keeper to Claudio Bravo as well as in the 2016 Centenario edition. In 2017, he was nominated to the Confederations Cup and played two matches against Cameroon (a 2\u20130 victory) and Australia (a 1\u20131 draw). That cup, Chile was runner-up after being defeated 1\u20130 by Germany in the final. ==Honours== ===Club=== ;Universidad de Chile * Primera Divisi\u00f3n de Chile (8): 1999, 2000, 2004 Apertura, 2011 Apertura, 2011 Clausura, 2012 Apertura, 2014 Apertura, 2017 Clausura * Copa Sudamericana (1): 2011 * Copa Chile (3): 2000, 2012\u201313, 2015 * Supercopa de Chile (1): 2015 ;Everton * Primera Divisi\u00f3n de Chile (1): 2008 Apertura ===International=== ;Chile *Copa Am\u00e9rica (2): 2015, 2016 ===Individual=== * Campeonato Nacional (Chile) Goalkeeper of the Season: 2011 * CONMEBOL Goalkeeper of the Season: 2011 * Copa Sudamericana Team of the Season: 2011 * Campeonato Nacional (Chile) Team of the Season (3): 2010, 2011, 2012 ==See also== *List of goalscoring goalkeepers ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Chilean footballers Category:Universidad de Chile footballers Category:Sport Club Corinthians Paulista players Category:Audax Italiano footballers Category:Everton de Vi\u00f1a del Mar footballers Category:Chilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Chile under-20 international footballers Category:Chile international footballers Category:Chilean expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Brazil Category:People from Angol Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Association football goalkeepers who have scored Category:Chilean football goalkeeper stubs Category:Living people Category:1981 births Category:2014 FIFA World Cup players Category:2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica players Category:Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario players Category:2017 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:Copa Am\u00e9rica-winning players Category:Medalists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Chile Category:Footballers at the 2000 Summer Olympics ",
