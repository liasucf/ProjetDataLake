Her coaching career got off to a good start, with the Rhythm achieving a 9\u20132 record at the start of the season and McElhiney being reported to have the support of the male Rhythm players. Dontae' Jones, a former NBA player then with the Rhythm, was quoted as saying, \"It's going to go a long way toward how women succeed from here on .... If I can help her continue to raise that bar, then I\u2019m doing my job.\" Another Rhythm player, Adam Sonn, commented, \"She comes in, and it's just normal. It's just a coach coaching.\" The Rhythm's season was marred by an incident in which one of the team's co-owners, Sally Anthony, attempted to fire McElhiney in the middle of a game on January 29, 2005, on the grounds that McElhiney was playing Matt Freije after Anthony insisted that Freije be benched. McElhiney nevertheless finished coaching the game, which the Rhythm won. She was reinstated as coach by decision of the team's other two co-owners before the team's next game. The Rhythm finished with a 21\u201310 record, qualifying for the playoffs and the chance to host a first-round playoff game. However, the team's owners chose to withdraw the team from the postseason, stating, \"We've lost several players and felt we were not ready for the playoffs.\" McElhiney resigned as coach later the same week. ==Administrative career== In June 2005, McElhiney joined the athletic department staff at the University of Alabama as the director of women's basketball operations. Her former Vanderbilt University teammate Ashley Earley also joined as the graduate assistant coach. ==Personal life== McElhiney is married to Joel Ayers, formerly the head girls basketball coach at Gleason School and now the head girls coach at Dyersburg High School.
