Paterson-Brown became increasingly involved in family planning advocacy beginning in 1960 when she started to give talks at family planning clinics. Because family planning was a sensitive topic at the time, she gave talks \"in virtual darkness with one light illuminating the blackboard,\" which helped to provide attendees a degree of anonymity. She continued providing support and guidance related to family planning for years, and was publicly praised for her work assisting \"generations of expectant mothers.\" === Lord Lieutenant === In 1998, she was appointed to succeed the Duke of Buccleuch as the first female Lord Lieutenant in Scotland, serving as the Queen's representative for Roxburgh, Ettick and Lauderdale. Her appointment was reportedly made on the personal recommendation from the Duke.
