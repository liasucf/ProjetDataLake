    "text": "The United Swaziland Association (USA) was a political party that promoted interests of the Europeans in Swaziland. USA was founded in 1963. It was led by Willie Meyer. == History == The USA cooperated with the Swazi traditionalists but after the end of the alliance with the traditionalists, the USA began to support South African bantustan politics in Swaziland. The USA even suggest that South Africa or the United Kingdom buy out European holdings. The only challenger of the USA was the Swaziland Independence Front (SIF). The SIF was like the United Party, the United National South West Party and the Rhodesia Party more liberal and moderate than the USA. == References == Category:Afrikaner nationalism Category:Afrikaner organizations Category:Banned far-right parties Category:Conservative parties in Africa Category:Political parties in Eswatini Category:Political parties established in 1963 Category:Protestant political parties Category:1963 establishments in Swaziland ",
