    "text": "The 2001 NCAA Women's Water Polo Championship was the first annual tournament to determine the national championship of NCAA women's collegiate water polo. The single elimination tournament was played at the Avery Aquatic Center in Stanford, California during May 2001. UCLA defeated Stanford in the final, 5\u20134, to win their first NCAA championship. The Bruins (19\u20134) were coached by Adam Krikorian. Krikorian also won a championship as the coach of UCLA's men's water polo team during the same 2000\u201301 season. The leading scorer for the tournament was Kelly Heuchan, from UCLA, with 4 goals. First and second All Tournament Teams were also named, with seven players comprising the former (including the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, Coralie Simmons from UCLA) and six for the latter. ==Qualification== Since there has only ever been one single national championship for women's water polo, all NCAA women's water polo programs (whether from Division I, Division II, or Division III) were eligible. A total of 4 teams were invited to contest this championship. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Team ! Appearance !
