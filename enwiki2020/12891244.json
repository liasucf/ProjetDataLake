On June 11, 1819, he was baptized and became a member of the Freewill Baptist Church in Phelps. The following year he joined the Freewill Baptist Church in Junius. At age 15, he felt the call of God leading him to enter the ministry. He left home and began preaching in what was known as the Holland Purchase. Large congregations would gather to hear his preaching. However, during his first 3 months absence from home, his mother died and his father's house was burned. == See also == *Free Will Baptist Church *Arminianism == References == * ==External links== * - David Marks' Biography * - David Marks' Final Sermon, Thursday, November 13, 1845 * - David Marks' Autobiography Category:1805 births Category:1845 deaths Category:People from Shandaken, New York Category:Free Will Baptists Category:Baptists from New York (state) Category:Arminian writers Category:Arminian ministers ",
