    "text": "The Eddy Cort\u00e9s National Gymnasium (), better known as National Gymnasium (), is a sports arena located in La Sabana Metropolitan Park, San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica. Its capacity is over 4,000. == History == The gymnasium was opened on 19 February 1960. President Mario Echandi Jim\u00e9nez was present at the inauguration. The arena was originally used for bullfights, and it originally did not have a roof. After being used for decades, the building fell into disrepair, as teams complained about the leaking roof, small size of the gymnasium, and worn out electrical system. Soon after, the roof was changed in 2012 and the ventilation system, electrical wiring and electronic marker control console were fixed in 2015. Today, the structure is mostly used for basketball games, gymnastics competitions, graduation ceremonies, and other events. == Concerts == Despite being used mostly as a sporting venue, Gimnasio Nacional is occasionally used for concerts. Santana's concert here on 29 September 1973 holds the distinction of the first rock concert held in Costa Rica. {|class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !colspan=\"4\"|List of concerts held at Gimnasio Nacional |- ! style=\"width:150px;\"|Date ! style=\"width:200px;\"|Artists ! style=\"width:300px;\"|Tours ! style=\"width:325px;\"|Supporting Acts |- |29 September 1973 |Santana |Caravanserai Tour | |- |14 April 1994 |Depeche Mode |Exotic Tour/Summer Tour '94 |April's Motel Room |- |6 February 1996 |Soda Stereo | rowspan=\"3\" colspan=\"3\" |- |19 August 2011 |Yuri |- |19 September 2013 |Caf\u00e9 Tacuba |} == References == Category:Sports venues completed in 1960 Category:Indoor arenas in Costa Rica Category:Sport in San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica Category:Buildings and structures in San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica Category:Buildings and structures in San Jos\u00e9 Province Category:Basketball venues in Costa Rica ",
