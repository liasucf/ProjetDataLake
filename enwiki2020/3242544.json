He offered to donate the land on which the hospital would be built, and on January 14, 1880 the letters of incorporation were filed with the Court of Common Pleas of York County to build The York Hospital and Dispensary. The three-story building was constructed at the corner of West College Ave. and Church Alley. An annual report for the year 1896 shows that a total of 1,922 cases were treated (1,756 in the dispensary and 166 as inpatients). York Hospital and Dispensary later shortened its name to York Hospital and then York Health Network. In 1999, Gettysburg Hospital became the second hospital in York Health Network. In 2000, York Health Network joined WellSpan Health.
