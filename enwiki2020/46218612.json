    "text": "John Peter \"Jack\" Condon (9 May 1922 \u2013 9 October 2015) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Geelong in the Victorian Football League (VFL). ==VFL career== Condon was born in Hamilton, but recruited locally to Geelong, from the St Mary's club. Following a premiership with the seconds in 1948, he made his senior debut for Geelong in the 1949 VFL season as a mature recruit, two weeks shy of his 27th birthday. Condon, who worked off the field as a fireman, quickly became Geelong's regular ruckman. Described as a \"good battler\", he won the club's \"best first year player\" award for 1949. He played 14 of a possible 19 games that year, with a suspension for attempting to strike Footcray's Dick Wearmouth costing him four weeks. In 1950, Condon made 17 league appearances. He showed his capabilities as a forward when he kicked eight goals in Geelong's 33-point win over Footscray at Kardinia Park in round two. His final game for Geelong was the 1950 preliminary final loss to North Melbourne, when they gave up a 39-point quarter time lead. He kicked two goals in the 17-point loss. ==Coaching== He accepted an offer in the 1951 pre-season to be playing coach of Portland in the Western District Football League. They finished runners-up in Condon's first season as coach, then in 1952 he steered the club to their first premiership in the league, with a six-point grand final win over Hamilton, which were led by former Melbourne player Fred Fanning. Portland were losing preliminary finalists under Condon in 1953 and 1954. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1922 births Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Geelong Football Club players Category:Portland Football Club players Category:St Mary's Sporting Club Inc players Category:2015 deaths Category:People from Hamilton, Victoria ",
