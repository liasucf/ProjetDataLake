The organisation then merged with the Democratic Party and reorganised as the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP; then Democratic Party), therefore she automatically became a member of the newly formed DUP. Before the election, she briefly served as one of the party's Vice Presidents. In 2012 election, she ran 9th in the DUP list and was elected for the National Assembly. As a member of the Assembly, Nam was a member of several parliamentary committees, such as the Committee of Women and Family, the Health and Welfare Committee (including Subcommittee for Improvement of Childcare Services), and the Special Committee on Budget and Accounts. She was also a co-leader of the Gender Equality Policy Research Forum and the Civil Politics Forum within the National Assembly. Outside of parliament, she also held party positions within Democratic Party and its successors, the New Politics Alliance for Democracy (NPAD) and the Democratic Party of Korea. The positions include the President of Foreign Cooperation Committee, National Women Committee, and Special Committee on Childcare. She was also the deputy parliamentary leader of NPAD from May 2014 to 2015. Nam was also a member of the Special Committee for the Enhancement of Military Human Rights and Army Life in the National Assembly from October 2014 to July 2015.

During the presidential election in 2017, Nam was appointed as the women chief for the Democratic presidential candidate Moon Jae-in. After Moon was elected and inaugurated as the President, she was one of the possible figure to be the Minister of Women and Family, although Chung Hyun-back was actually selected for the position. Nam ran as a vice presidential candidate for the Democratic Party leadership election in 2018. She received 8.42% and came to 6th, just behind of Park Jung. As the party has 5 Vice Presidents, she couldn't actually be elected for the position. However, according to the party constitution, since no female was within the top 5, Nam was subsequently elected, instead of Park. == Personal life == Nam is married to Seo Joo-won, who is the President of Sudokwon Landfill Site Management Corporation. They have a daughter named Seo Ha-nui. Nam used an unofficial name, Nam Yoon In-soon (Korean: \ub0a8\uc724\uc778\uc21c), for her activist career. This was a part of double-barrelled name (similar to Spanish naming customs) campaign from the late 1990s, but she also used this name during the 2012 election. She reverted to her original name in 2015, because of systems issues and to relate more closely to people. == References == == External links == * Nam In-soon on Twitter * Nam In-soon on Facebook * Nam In-soon on Instagram * Nam In-soon on YouTube Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:South Korean women in politics Category:South Korean feminists Category:South Korean activists ",
