    "text": "The Bahamas Great Exuma Classic is a golf tournament on the Korn Ferry Tour, played at Sandals Emerald Bay Golf Course in the Bahamas. It is one of two Korn Ferry Tour events in the Bahamas, along with The Bahamas Great Abaco Classic. Both events were first played in January 2017 starting on a Sunday and finishing on a Wednesday, rather than the standard Thursday\u2013Sunday schedule. Due to high winds in the inaugural event, the cut line fell at 11-over-par 155, the highest in Web.com Tour history. The par-4 12th hole played to a stroke average of 5.008, making it the hardest in tour history relative to par. ==Winners== {|class=wikitable style=font-size:95% !Year!!Winner!!Country!!Score!!To par!!Margin of victory!!Runner(s)-up |- | 2020 || Tommy Gainey || || align=center|277 || align=center|\u221211 || 4 strokes || John Oda Dylan Wu |- | 2019 || Dou Zecheng || || align=center|270 || align=center|\u221218 || 2 strokes || Ben Kohles Steve LeBrun |- | 2018 || Im Sung-jae || || align=center|275 || align=center|\u221213 || 4 strokes || Carlos Ortiz |- | 2017 || Kyle Thompson || || align=center|286 || align=center|\u22122 || 2 strokes || Nicholas Thompson Andrew Yun |} Bolded golfers graduated to the PGA Tour via the Web.com Tour regular-season money list. ==References== ==External links== * *Coverage on the Web.com Tour's official site Category:Korn Ferry Tour events Category:Golf tournaments in the Bahamas Category:Recurring sporting events established in 2017 Category:2017 establishments in the Bahamas ",
