During his Diploma he also undertook a nine-month research stay at Stanford University with Paul A. Wender in 1995/1996.Paul A. Wender, Frank Glorius u. a.: Transition Metal-Catalyzed [5 + 2] Cycloadditions of Allenes and Vinylcyclopropanes: First Studies of Endo-Exo Selectivity, Chemoselectivity, Relative Stereochemistry, and Chirality Transfer. In: Journal of the American Chemical Society. 121, 1999, S. 5348\u20135349, . Glorius completed his Doctorate in 2000 investigating \"New chiral bis-oxazoline ligands for enantioselective catalysis\" at the University of Basel with Andreas Pfaltz. His PhD was divided between the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Kohlenforschung (1997\u20131999) and the University of Basel (1999\u20132000). Between 2000\u20132001 Glorius completed a Postdoc at Harvard University in Cambridge, with David A. Evans exploring the Total synthesis of Aflastatin A. Following this, he worked with his mentor Alois F\u00fcrstner as an independent researcher/research group leader/Assistant Professor at the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Kohlenforschung. In 2004, before formal completion of the habilitation, he was awarded a position as C3-Professor of Chemistry at the University of Marburg. Since August 2007, Glorius has been a Professor of Organic Chemistry at Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t in M\u00fcnster. Professor Glorius' research program is dedicated to the development of new catalytic methodologies in organic chemistry. His research group explores a wide range of topics including the development and application of N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) in catalysis,Matthew N. Hopkinson, Christian Richter, Michael Schedler, Frank Glorius: An overview of N-heterocyclic carbenes. In: Nature. 510, 2014, S. 485\u2013496, .

Former members of the group have gone on to have careers in both academia (e.g. Canada, China, France, Germany, India and Japan) and industry (BASF, Bayer, Evonik, Clariant, Axalta, Lanxess, Continental, Archimica, Mitsubishi, Novartis or Janssen Pharmaceutica (Johnson & Johnson) for instance). == Honors and awards == Research Awards: Glorius has received numerous grants, prizes and awards. In his early career, he was awarded the Liebig-scholarship of the Fonds der Chemischen Industrie (2001\u20132004), the ORCHEM-Award for Scientists (2004), and the BASF Catalysis Award (2005). Of particular note was the Alfried Krupp Prize in 2006, for \u20ac1 million, the ERC Independent Researcher Starting Grant, worth \u20ac1.5 million, in 2010, and the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, in 2013, from the German Research Foundation, valued at \u20ac2.5 million.Press Release Leibniz Award Additionally, he has received the OMCOS Award in 2011, and the Springer Heterocyclic Chemistry Award in 2012. In 2013, he was elected as an honorary member of the Israel Chemical Society, and was named as \"Highly Cited Researcher\" in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018.Homepage Clarivate (formerly Thomson Reuters) Glorius also received the Novartis Chemistry Lectureship Award for 2014/2015 and the inaugurational SYNLETT Best Paper Award 2015.Synlett Award announcement In 2017 he has received the Mukaiyama Award from The Society of Synthetic Organic Chemistry, Japan (SSOCJ). Most recently, he was selected for the Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award of the American Chemical Society (ACS),Arthur C. Cope Scholar Awards Homepage for the Merck, Sharp & Dohme Award of the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)Merck, Sharp & Dohme Award Homepage and for the French Gay-Lussac Humboldt Prize. Teaching Award: In addition, in 2014 Frank Glorius was awarded by the students of the Department of Chemistry&Pharmacy; of the WWU Muenster with the \"Goldener Brendel\" for excellence in teaching. For his achievements as PhD supervisor he has received the IPMI Faculty Advisor Award 2017.IPMI Homepage Glorius sits on the boards of numerous committees and societies, including the Kuratorium (Board of Trustees) of the Fonds der Chemischen Industrie, the selection committee of the Humboldt foundation for incoming postdocs, the German Catalysis Society (GeCatS) and the M\u00fcnster branch of the German Chemical Society (2011\u20132014). == References == Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:German chemists Category:University of M\u00fcnster faculty Category:University of Basel alumni Category:University of Hanover alumni ",
