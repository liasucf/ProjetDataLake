Within the area, three old-growth forests exist which are rather different from each other. In the Str\u00e5dalen area close to the border with Norway, the old-growth forest is dominated by large spruce trees, while in the area around Lake L\u00e5gsj\u00f6n the forest is dominated by Scots pine, often in the form of krummholz. In Rutsdalen area, old-growth forest dominated by spruce is separated from mixed coniferous old-growth forest which grow on thin moraine. Two traditional mountain farms exist in the area.

The area is used by the Sami population for reindeer grazing all year around. ==References== Category:Nature reserves in Sweden Category:Mountains of Sweden Category:Geography of J\u00e4mtland County Category:Tourist attractions in J\u00e4mtland County Category:Protected areas established in 1988 Category:1988 establishments in Sweden ",
