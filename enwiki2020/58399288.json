M. Thomas and The Air Mines of Mistila (1988) in collaboration with Philip Gross. Her work has been widely anthologized and translated into various languages, including Italian, Japanese and Finnish. == Biography == She was born in the Peak District, Derbyshire, in 1936, and attended the University of Bristol where she received her BA in French. She then moved to Australia for ten years, where she was a Tutor in French at the University of Queensland while studying for her M.A. and Ph.D., both on French Surrealism. In 1971 she returned to the UK, and settled in Helston, Cornwall, in 1974, where she undertook tutoring in Twentieth-Century Poetry for the Open University and for the University of Exeter Extra-Mural programme, while writing and publishing her major works of poetry. She was appointed as Cornwall's first Writer in the Community in 1986, and was regularly invited to give Poetry Workshops and courses at the Arvon Foundation. She received an honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of Exeter in recognition of her literary achievements in 1989, and many of her literary papers are held in the University of Exeter archive.Literary papers of Sylvia Kantaris, late 20th century.

However, most of her work was published in Britain, and some of her poetry has a specifically Cornish theme.E.g. poems such as \"Water-colours, Cornwall\" or \"The Light at St Ives\", from The Sea at the Door, pp. 1-2. Her second major book, The Tenth Muse (1983) explores the relationship of women to writing, and \"through its title, evokes a whole tradition of women's poetry\". Shortly after its publication, she was involved in a lively feminist debate in the Letters pages of The Times Literary Supplement concerning a fictional \"Hysterical Women's Movement\" that many contemporary reviewers of women's writing appeared to believe in.Times Literary Supplement, 19 August 1983, p. 882. Her next collection, The Sea at the Door (1985) is described by one reviewer as \"a haunted book \u2013 haunted by past and present selves, none of them quite real\", noting particularly the way in which she often engages intense erotic themes through the filter of imagination and dreams. Some of her work focuses on fraught relationships between men and women, together with an exploration of gender politics, notably News from the Front (1983), co-authored with the poet and novelist D. M. Thomas, in which each poet explores the conflictive relationship between a young Portuguese radical and a right-wing British businessman, with each sometimes adopting the feminine and sometimes the masculine persona. The Air Mines of Mistila (1988), written in collaboration with the poet Philip Gross, has a Latin American theme,Blurb on the back cover. with allusions to the novel Pedro P\u00e1ramo by Juan Rulfo in a number of the poems.
