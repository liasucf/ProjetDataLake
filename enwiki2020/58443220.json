The game featured NCAA players (predominantly from the Football Bowl Subdivision) and a few select invitees from Canadian university football, rostered into \"East\" and \"West\" teams.

In the week prior to the game, scouts from all 32 NFL teams attended team practices. Coaches and game officials were supplied by the NFL. The day before the game, the East\u2013West Shrine Game Pat Tillman Award was given to Cody Barton (LB, Utah); the award \"is presented to a player who best exemplifies character, intelligence, sportsmanship and service. The award is about a student-athlete's achievements and conduct, both on and off the field.\" ==Coaching staffs== In early January 2019, head coaches were announced; Sam Mills III, defensive line coach for the Carolina Panthers, and Adam Zimmer, linebackers coach for the Minnesota Vikings, for the East and West teams, respectively.
