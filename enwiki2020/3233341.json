    "text": "Crown prosecutors are the public prosecutors in the legal system of Australia. In Western Australia, they are referred to as State prosecutors. Crown prosecutors represent the Crown in right of the Commonwealth and in right of each state or Territory in criminal proceedings. Crown prosecutors are appointed not elected and are not public servants; they are private counsel briefed by the Director of Public Prosecutions for particular cases. Both the Commonwealth of Australia and the states and territories can make criminal laws under the Constitution of Australia, so Crown prosecutors deal with both state and federal offences. The typical Crown prosecutor, often a Queen's Counsel or Senior Counsel, will have extensive experience as defence counsel as well as prosecuting counsel. ==See also== * Crown attorneys in Canada * Crown Prosecution Service in England and Wales * Crownies, an ABC television series about crown prosecutors. * District attorneys in the United States * Procurator fiscal in Scotland ==References== Category:Legal professions Category:Prosecution services of Australia ",
