Paul Skalich (1534\u20131573), also known as Stanislav Pavao Skali\u0107 or Paulus Scalichius de Lika, was an encyclopedist, Renaissance humanist, and adventurer born in Zagreb (modern Croatia), and who lived part of his life in the Holy Roman Empire. (modern Germany) His surname is rendered in various other ways: e.g., in English, Skalich, Scalich, Scaliger; in Latin, Scalichius or Scaligius; and in Spanish, Scalitzius. ==Biography == Skali\u0107 studied theology and philosophy in Vienna and later moved around Europe, living in Bologna, Rome, Bohemia, Poland, France and Germany, among other places.Lovro \u017dupanovi\u0107. \"Skali\u0107, Pavao.\" New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians His book Encyclopaedia seu orbis disciplinarum tam sacrarum quam prophanarum epistemon (\"Encyclopaedia, or Knowledge of the World of Disciplines\"; Basel, 1559) is one of the first books entitled encyclopedia. Robert Collison later wrote that the work was poorly written, only being important today for its use of the word encyclopaedia, and that Joachim Sterck van Ringelbergh had used the word cyclopaedia to describe his work in 1541.Collison, Robert. Encyclopaedias. 2nd ed. (Hafner, 1966) p. 80 Skali\u0107 also wrote a treatise on music: Dialogus de Lyra (Cologne, 1570). He and preacher Johann Funck exercised great influence over Albert (1490-1568), first duke of Prussia, and became wealthy. Religious differences with the king of Poland led to the execution of Funck and the rise of Skali\u0107.Schaff-Herzog article == Nationality == References vary regarding Skali\u0107's nationality. M.
