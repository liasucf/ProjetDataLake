    "text": "John Morton (born 1925) is a trade unionist and former musician. Born in Wolverhampton, Morton learned to play the piano while he was a child. On leaving school, he started an apprenticeship as a printer, but his love of swing music led him to leave to play in a band.John Silverlight, \"Pianist who calls the tune for the musicians\", The Observer, 27 July 1980Musicians' Union, \"John Morton\" He joined the Musicians' Union, and gradually rose to prominence, winning election to its Executive Committee, and leading a boycott of Wolverhampton's Scala Ballroom over its policy of only admitting white people. Morton worked full-time for the union for a few years, but moved to become a lecturer in industrial relations at Solihull College. Despite this, he remained on the Executive Committee and, when General Secretary Hardie Ratcliffe announced his retiral, he asked Morton to run for the post. Morton won election as general secretary, focusing much of his time on opposing the closure of orchestras, and negotiating with broadcasters, particularly the new independent local radio stations. He also became President of the International Federation of Musicians (FIM). He was elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, serving from 1975 to 1985, and again from 1986 until his retirement. Politically, he was considered to have moved from the left-wing of the union to the centre or right during this period.\"Communists blamed for loss of Council seat\", The Guardian, 3 September 1975 Morton retired as general secretary in 1990, but remained president of the FIM until 2002, and president emeritus of the FIM thereafter. ==References== Category:1925 births Category:Living people Category:English musicians Category:General Secretaries of the Musicians' Union (UK) Category:Members of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress Category:People from Wolverhampton ",
