It was centered on Koromo Castle in what is now the city of Toyota, Aichi. ==History== A fortification was built near the present site of Koromo Castle during the Kamakura period, and the area was contested in the Sengoku period between the Imagawa clan and the Oda clan. After the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, the Miyake clan (formerly of Tahara) were allowed to return to Mikawa and were assigned a 10,000 koku domain on the banks of the Yasaku River. In 1600, Miyake Yasusada built a jin'ya fortified residence approximately a kilometer away from the site of the original fortification, and planted sakura trees all around it. The residence was nicknamed . The Miyake moved the seat of their domain to Kameyama Domain in Ise Province in 1619, but returned to Koromo from 1636\u20131674. After 1674, they were finally allowed to return to their ancestral Tahara Domain. Koromo then became tenry\u014d territory ruled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate through appointed daikan administrators to 1688. In 1688, a branch of the Honda clan was transferred to Koromo from Ishikawa Domain in Mutsu Province, remaining to 1749 when it was transferred to Sagara Domain. The Honda were replaced by a branch of the Nait\u014d clan from Annaka Domain in K\u014dzuke Province. The Nait\u014d ruled for the next 120 years until the Meiji restoration, and were allowed to construct the modest castle, Koromo Castle as their headquarters. Two of the Nait\u014d clan daimy\u014d, Masanari and Masahiro, were adopted into the family; they were the elder brothers of Ii Naosuke. From 1836\u20131838, the domain suffered from crop failures and famine, which led to a number of large-scale peasant's uprisings. In 1854, the town was largely destroyed by the 1854 Ansei earthquake, and entered into the Bakumatsu period impoverished and with a minor as daimy\u014d. The Ee ja nai ka movement found strong support in the domain. Although the domain dispatched some troops to guard the T\u014dkaid\u014d and Sunpu Castle during the Boshin War, these troops surrendered to the new Meiji government without resistance. The domain had a population of 19,253 people in 5078 households per an 1869 census. The domain maintained its primary residence (kamiyashiki) in Edo at Hanzonmon until the An'ei period (1772\u20131780), when it was relocated to Mita.Edo daimyo.net After the abolition of the han system in July 1871, the domain became \u201cKoromo Prefecture\u201d, which later became part of Nukata Prefecture, and finally Aichi Prefecture. As with most domains, Koromo Domain consisted of several discontinuous territories calculated to provide the assigned kokudaka, based on periodic cadastral surveys and projected agricultural yields.Mass, Jeffrey P. and William B. Hauser. (1987). The Bakufu in Japanese History, p. 150.Elison, George and Bardwell L. Smith (1987). Warlords, Artists, & Commoners: Japan in the Sixteenth Century, p. 18. At the end of the Edo period, Koromo Domain consisted of 25 villages in Kamo District and 6 villages neighboring Shitara District in Mikawa, and 12 villages in Kumehokujo District, Mimasaka Province, 8 villages in Sh\u016bchi District, and Haibara District, both in T\u014dt\u014dmi Province. ==List of daimy\u014d== {| class=wikitable ! #||Name || Tenure || Courtesy title || Court Rank || kokudaka |- |colspan=6| 25px Miyake clan (fudai) 1604-1619; |- ||1||||1604\u20131615|| -none-|| Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 10,000 koku |- ||2||||1615\u20131620|| Echigo-no-kami (\u8d8a\u5f8c\u5b88) || Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 10,000 koku |- |colspan=6|25px tenry\u014d, 1620-1636 |- |colspan=6| 25px Miyake clan (fudai) 1636-1664 |- ||3||||1636\u20131657|| Daizen-no-suke (\u5927\u81b3\u4eae) || Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 10,000 koku |- ||4||||1658\u20131664|| Noto-no-kami (\u80fd\u767b\u5b88) || Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 10,000 koku |- |colspan=6|25px tenry\u014d, 1664-1681 |- |colspan=6| 25px Honda clan (fudai) 1681-1749 |- ||1||||1681\u20131700|| Yamashiro- no-kami (\u5c71\u57ce\u5b88) || Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 20,000 koku |- ||2||||1700\u20131711|| Yamashiro-no-kami (\u5c71\u57ce\u5b88) || Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 20,000 koku |- ||3||||1711\u20131749|| Nagato-no-kami (\u9577\u9580\u5b88) || Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 20,000 koku |- |colspan=6| 25px Nait\u014d clan (fudai) 1749-1871 |- ||1||||1749\u20131766|| Tamba-no- kami (\u4e39\u6ce2\u5b88)|| Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 20,000 koku |- ||2||||1766\u20131794|| Yamashiro- no-kami (\u5c71\u57ce\u5b88) || Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 20,000 koku |- ||3||||1794\u20131813|| Yamashiro-no-kami (\u5c71\u57ce\u5b88) || Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 20,000 koku |- ||4||||1813\u20131830||Yamashiro-no-kami (\u5c71\u57ce\u5b88)|| Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 20,000 koku |- ||5||||1830\u20131851||Tamba-no-kami (\u4e39\u6ce2\u5b88)|| Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 20,000 koku |- ||6||||1851\u20131858|| Yamashiro-no-kami (\u5c71\u57ce\u5b88) || Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 20,000 koku |- ||7||||1858\u20131871||Tamba-no-kami (\u4e39\u6ce2\u5b88)|| Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 20,000 koku |- |} ==References== * ==External links== * Koromo Domain on \"Edo 300 HTML\" ==Notes== Category:Domains of Japan Category:1604 establishments in Japan Category:States and territories established in 1604 Category:1871 disestablishments in Japan Category:States and territories disestablished in 1871 Category:Mikawa Province Category:Domains of Aichi Prefecture ",
