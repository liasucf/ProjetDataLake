    "text": "The Mind Fixers was a seven-part series of newspaper stories which ran in the Baltimore Evening Sun in July 1984. It was written by Jon Franklin. It won the award for Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Journalism in 1987. The series explores the science of molecular psychiatry. Based upon interviews with more than fifty scientists, Franklin takes a generally optimistic point of view. He paraphrases his sources as saying that the new science is \"capable of curing the mental diseases that afflict perhaps 20 percent of the population and constitute a major drain on the gross national product,\" as well as eventually expanding the boundaries of \"the normal mind.\" ==External links== *\u201cThe Mind Fixers\u201d at the Internet Archive Category:Biological psychiatry Category:1984 documents ",
