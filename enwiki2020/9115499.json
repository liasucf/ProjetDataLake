It is a significant maize-growing area. Farmer's zeal to clear more land for maize cultivation has led to deforestation of vast tracts of hillsides, resulting in \"bald mountains\" (; ). A by-product of the land clearing is smoke from field burning, contributing to the northern region's significant air pollution. Charoen Pokphand (CP) Group, Thailand's largest agro-industrial and food conglomerate, and the leading purchaser of Pua District maize, in March 2016 announced an \"agricultural social enterprise\" to steer district villagers away from maize farming. CP Group has incurred criticism for the way it purchases maize harvests for animal feed from farmers in Nan and other provinces. Suphachai Chearavanont, vice-chairman of CP Group, said that corn planters will be encouraged to grow cash crops such as coffee, which requires less farmland and makes a higher profit than maize. Not only will this address the bald-mountain problem, he said, but it will also help reduce the spring haze in the north which is caused by slash-and-burn practices to prepare land for the next maize season. Mr Suphachai said crops like coffee take about three-and-a-half years to show a yield, but stated that CP Group would stand by farmers and provide assistance in the meantime. ==Gallery== File:2013 Wat Rong Ngae 01.jpg|Wat Rong Ngae File:2014 1121 Wat Ban Ton Laeng 01.JPG|Wat Ban Ton Laeng File:Wat Phra That Bueng Sakat 2014 a.jpg|Wat Phra That Bueng Sakat File:Nan z doi phuka 2006 1003.jpg|Road number 1256 on a ridge near Doi Phu Kha File:2013 Pua countryside.jpg|Countryside east of Pua File:Doi Phu Kha mountains.jpg|The mountains of Doi Phu Kha National Park ==References== ==External links== *amphoe.com (Thai) Pua ",
