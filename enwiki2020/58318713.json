    "text": "Frank Childress (born July 6, 1998), known professionally as Comethazine, is an American rapper and songwriter. He is best known for his single \"Walk\", which peaked at number 20 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. Comethazine has released 4 mixtapes since 2018, Bawskee, Bawskee 2, Bawskee 3.5, and most recently, \u201cPandemic\u201d all to mainly positive critical reception. In 2019, he was an XXL Freshman and performed his cypher alongside rappers Roddy Ricch and Tierra Whack. On March 27, 2020, Comethazine's debut studio album Pandemic was released. ==Career== Comethazine began posting his music on audio distribution platform SoundCloud and video distribution platform YouTube as a teenager, allowing him to quit his job as a mechanic to focus on music full-time. In early 2018, a feature on SoundCloud that allows their original sound file to be switched was abused for an unofficial upload of YBN Nahmir's song \"Bounce Out With That\", that was replaced with his song \"Bands\", causing it to acquire the chart data of \"Bounce Out With That\". It is unclear who perpetrated this, though the account associated with the switch has since been removed. This incident helped increase the popularity of \"Bands\". In 2019, he was selected to be a part of the 2019 XXL Freshmen Class. ==Musical style and influences== Comethazine's music has been compared as a mixture of Playboi Carti and Tay-K, and has been referred to as anti-melody, a derivative form of trap that uses the bass as a source of melody instead of traditional instrumentation. He has cited rappers such as Big Mike, Pimp C, Chingy, Jadakiss,Special Ed, Chief Keef, Playboi Carti, and Jim Jones as musical influences. ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | US |- ! scope=\"row\" |Pandemic | * Released: March 27, 2020 * Label: Alamo * Format: Digital download, streaming | 151 |} ===Mixtapes=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:19em;\" | Details ! colspan=\"4\" scope=\"col\" | Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | US ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | US R&B; /HH ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | US Rap ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" |CAN |- !scope=\"row\"|Bawskee | * Released: August 24, 2018 * Label: Alamo Records * Format: Digital download | 136 || \u2014 || \u2014 |\u2014 |- !scope=\"row\"|Bawskee 2 | * Released: January 11, 2019 * * Format: Digital download | 61 || 36 || \u2014 |66 |- !scope=\"row\"|Bawskee 3.5 | *Released: July 26, 2019 * * Format: Digital download | 53 || 26 || 23 |59 |- !scope=\"row\"|Bawskee 4 | * To be released: October 23, 2020 * * Format: Digital download | colspan=\"4\" |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! colspan=\"2\" | Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\"| Certifications ! rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| US Bub. ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| US R&B;/HH Bub. |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Piped Up\" | 2017 | \u2014 |\u2014 | | rowspan=\"4\"| Bawskee |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Bands\" | rowspan=\"5\"| 2018 | \u2014 |\u2014 | *RIAA: Gold |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Walk\" | 20 |5 | * RIAA: Platinum |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Oowee\" | \u2014 |\u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"DeMar DeRozan\" | \u2014 |\u2014 | | Bawskee 2 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Highriser\" | \u2014 |\u2014 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Nonsense\" | rowspan=\"5\" | 2019 | \u2014 |\u2014 | | Bawskee 2 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Just Saying\" | \u2014 |\u2014 | | rowspan=\"2\" | Bawskee 3.5 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Stand\" | \u2014 |\u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"50 Bars\" | \u2014 |\u2014 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"|\"Glide\" |\u2014 |\u2014 | | rowspan=\"2\" |Pandemic |- ! scope=\"row\"|\"No Front\" | rowspan=\"4\" |2020 |\u2014 |\u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\"|\"Air Max\" |\u2014 |\u2014 | | rowspan=\"3\" |Bawskee 4 |- ! scope=\"row\"|\"We Gone Win\" |\u2014 |\u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\"|\"Derek Jeter\" | -- | -- | |- |} ===Other charted songs=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font- size:90%;\"| NZ Hot |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Find Him!\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2019 | 33 | rowspan=\"2\"| Bawskee 3.5 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Solved the Problem\" | 34 |} ==References== Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American rappers Category:21st-century American male musicians Category:People from East St. Louis, Illinois Category:Rappers from Illinois Category:Rappers from St. Louis Category:Midwest hip hop musicians ",
