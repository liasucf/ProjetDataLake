During the Burundian Civil War, the CNDD\u2013FDD was the most significant rebel group active and became a major political party in Burundi. In March 2012, Pascal Nyabenda was elected as President of CNDD\u2013FDD. Then on 20 August 2016, General \u00c9variste Ndayishimiye was, in the extraordinary congress that took place in Gitega, elected as the Secretary General of the Party. During the civil war, CNDD was the political wing of the organization, while the FDD was the military wing. It was founded in 1994, a year after the assassination of the first democratically elected President Melchior Ndadaye. The political wing was dominated by Hutu intellectuals from the southern region of Bururi led by Leonard Nyangoma, while the fighting wing was composed of troops drawn from throughout the country, which led to a split in the group in 2001. The rebel group was often referred to simply as Forces for the Defense of Democracy (FDD). In 2001, the CNDD- FDD consisted of about 25,000 rebels led by Jean- Bosco Ndayikengurukiye. However a schism in October 2001 led to the overthrow of Ndayikengurukiye by Pierre Nkurunziza. The Nkurunziza-led faction, consisting of 20,000 to 22,000 troops signed a ceasefire with the government in December 2002 but continued fighting. The faction led by Ndayikengurukiye became the lesser of the two with about 5,000 fighters. It also signed a ceasefire with the government in October 2002 to which it has roughly held. At an official ceremony on January 2005, the group registered as a legal political party. In largely peaceful parliamentary elections on 4 July 2005, the CNDD won an estimated 60 to 80 percent of the vote, making it likely that a CNDD representative would be chosen the president in August. Pierre Nkurunziza indeed was elected President of Burundi unopposed on August 19. At the legislative elections, the party won 57.8% and 64 out of 118 seats. CNDD\u2013FDD's youth wing is led by Hon Sylvestre Ndayizeye. In June 2020, Nkurunziza died while still serving as President of Burundi and was succeeded by Ndayishimiye. Prior to Nkurunziza's death, Ndayishimiye had been elect President of Burundi in elections which were held in May 2020. == Electoral history == === Presidential elections === {| class=wikitable style=text- align:center !Election !Party candidate !Votes !% !Result |- ! colspan=\"5\" |President elected by National Assembly and Senate |- |2005 |Pierre Nkurunziza |151 |94.4% |Elected |- ! colspan=\"5\" |President elected by popular vote |- |2010 | rowspan=\"2\" |Pierre Nkurunziza |2,479,483 |91.62% |Elected |- |2015 |1,961,510 |69.41% |Elected |- |2020 |\u00c9variste Ndayishimiye |3,082,210 |71.45% |Elected |} === National Assembly elections === {| class=wikitable style=text- align:center !Election !Party leader !Votes !% !Seats !+/\u2013 !Position |- |2005 |Hussein Radjabu |1,417,800 |58.55% | | 64 | 1st |- |2010 |J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Ngendakumana |1,848,023 |81.19% | | 17 | 1st |- |2015 |rowspan=\"2\"|Pascal Nyabenda |1,721,629 |60.28% | | 5 | 1st |- |2020 |3,036,286 |70.98% | | | 1st |} === Senate elections === {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center !Election !Party leader !Seats !+/\u2013 !Position |- |2005 |Hussein Radjabu | | 32 | 1st |- |2010 |J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Ngendakumana | | | 1st |- |2015 |rowspan=\"2\"|Pascal Nyabenda | | 1 | 1st |- |2020 | | 1 | 1st |} ==Further reading== * == External links == * Ex-Hutu rebels win Burundi poll, BBC 5 July 2005 Category: History of Burundi Category: Political parties in Burundi Category: Rebel groups in Burundi Category: 1994 establishments in Burundi Category: Political parties established in 1994 Category: Burundian Civil War Category: Factions of the First Congo War Category: Factions of the Second Congo War ",
