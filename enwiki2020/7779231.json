    "text": "Pima Bajo (Mountain Pima, Lowland Pima, Nevome) is a Mexican indigenous language of the Piman branch of the Uto-Aztecan language family, spoken by around 1,000 speakers in northern Mexico. The language is called O'ob No'ok by its speakers. The closest related languages are the O'odham (Pima and Papago) and the O'othams. There are three major communities in the Oob No'ok region (Yepachic, Maycoba and Y\u00e9cora) but many of the people live in small outlying hamlets and on isolated family ranches rather than the larger towns. ==Morphology== Estrada-Fern\u00e1ndez studied the language, publishing an overview of their grammar, syntax and vocabulary. She identified consistent dialectical differences between communities in the region, especially between villages in Sonora and those in Chihuahua. Pima Bajo is an agglutinative language, where words use suffix complexes for a variety of purposes with several morphemes strung together.Estrada-Fern\u00e1ndez, Zarina. 1998.
