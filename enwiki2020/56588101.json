An elderly Sikh volunteer tells his volunteers (especially a curious girl) about Sajjan Singh Rangroot, a soldier who fought in World War I. In the early 20th century, Sajjan was a young Sikh man who disliked the British. Sajjan\u2019s father worked for the British. Sajjan\u2019s father wanted Sajjan to work for the British as well. As World War 1 was going on, Sajjan wanted to be a soldier for the British Indian army. He hoped that if the British won, India would gain independence. His father disliked the idea, but his mother was not against it. So Sajjan joins the army after an emotional farewell from his family. He becomes friends with many other soldiers like Dheera, Teja, Lacchman Das and Mela Singh. Teja was an arrogant person and Mela Singh was a person who lied a lot to get attention. Him lying leads to hilarious reactions. The Subedar (Leader) of the group was Zorawar Singh who has fought many wars before. After rigorous training, the group reach Britain to fight. The group were the Lahore Regiment. When the regiment reach Britain, many British soldiers make fun of the Sikhs. The soldiers train even more. At a tea shop Sajjan and one British soldier try to have a fight, but the owner of the shop who is called Becky stops them as she does not want the tables and chairs to break. Sajjan then leaves the soldier alone. Becky then starts to like Sajjan. Sajjan finds out but he is betrothed to someone called Jeeti. The Sikhs and British find out that the Germans have invaded many British trenches. So the British and Sikhs have to get to a trench before the Germans attack. This is as the trench will protect them. During that, the Germans attack. However, the Sikhs and British get the trench and later capture the main German trench line, forcing the Germans to retreat. But Dheera dies during that. Sajjan becomes really disturbed but Zorawar makes Sajjan better. The Germans find out that Sikhs are helping the British in war. So, the Germans send them a letter. The letter says that the Sikhs should join the Germans as they will get better equipment, food and more salary. Sajjan refuses as Sikhs should not be traitors. After a month of staying in the trenches, Mela Singh tells Sajjan that it is Baisakhi. But the Baisakhi is a sad one. So Sajjan tries to make everyone happy by singing a song. After, the Germans attack the trench and the Sikhs and the British escape. The Germans take over the trench. Teja dies during that. So Sajjan decides go in the battlefield alone and bomb the trench. Sajjan is successful and all Germans in the trench die. However, Sajjan dies as well. In India, the British and the people pay their respects to Sajjan.
