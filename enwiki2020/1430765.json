    "text": "The Chevrolet Inline-4 engine was one of Chevrolet's first automobile engines, designed by Arthur Mason and introduced in 1913. Chevrolet founder Billy Durant, who previously had owned Buick which had pioneered the overhead valve engine, used the same basic engine design for Chevrolet: exposed pushrods and rocker arms which actuated valves in the detachable crossflow cylinder head. This was referred to this as a \"valve-in-head\" design, and it drew considerable publicity in a time when most rivals were flatheads. It was produced through 1928 when it was replaced by the Chevrolet Straight-6 engine. Chevrolet later used many other straight-4 engines, including the straight-6-derived 153 and other more modern engines documented in the list of GM engines. ==171== The engine was the first and most common member of this family. It featured splash lubrication. For its last year (1928) it gained a revised carburetor, higher compression, aluminum pistons, and larger valves for a rating of at 2,200 rpm. Because of increased weight of the slightly longer 1928 Chevrolet National Series AB performance failed to improve from the 1927 Chevrolet Series AA Capitol.
