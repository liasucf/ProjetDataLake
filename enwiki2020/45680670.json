Cleaves sprained his ankle with 16:18 to play in the second half, and this was after Florida had trimmed Michigan State's double digit halftime lead to 50\u201344. Cleaves returned about four minutes later, and immediately helped lead the Spartans on a 16\u20136 run to put the game out of reach. The lone top-seed remaining would bring order to a tournament filled with upsets as they salted away the victory for the school's second National Championship (1979). Michigan State coach Tom Izzo earned his first title in his second straight final four appearance. Morris Peterson led the Spartans with 21 points. As of 2019, Michigan State's 2000 team is the last Big Ten Conference team to win a National Championship. ==References== NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game Category:NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Games Category:Florida Gators men's basketball Category:Michigan State Spartans men's basketball Category:Basketball in Indianapolis Category:College sports in Indiana Category:Sports competitions in Indianapolis NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Game Category:2000s in Indianapolis ",
