    "text": "Borsheim's Fine Jewelry ( ; frequently abbreviated without an apostrophe as Borsheims) is a jewelry store in Omaha, Nebraska. The store was founded in 1870, and has been a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway since 1989. Louis Borsheim started Borsheims in downtown Omaha in 1870. The business was sold to Louis Friedman and his son Ike in 1955. Both owners retained the Borsheims name. In 1986, Borsheims moved to the Regency Court Mall. In 1989, investor Warren Buffett purchased a majority of Borsheims stock, making it part of his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway. Borsheims is led by Karen Goracke, who became Borsheims president and CEO in 2013. The store maintains an inventory that includes more than 100,000 pieces of jewelry and watches. It has been the location of Berkshire shareholder-only events held in association with its annual general meeting. In September 2019, Borsheims promoted Adrienne Fay to newly created role as Vice President overseeing the customer purchase journey. ==References== ==External links== * Borsheims Category:Berkshire Hathaway Category:Companies based in Omaha, Nebraska ",
