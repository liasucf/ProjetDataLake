He graduated from the Antonio Arroio Decorative Arts School (Escola Secund\u00e1ria Art\u00edstica Ant\u00f3nio Arroio) where he studied under Lino Ant\u00f3nio, Paula Campos and Rodrigues Alves. Sobral worked in a range of media including painting, graphic design, illustration, scenography and poetry. His paintings were first shown publicly at the General Exhibitions of Fine Arts (SNBA, Lisbon) immediately after World War II (1939\u201345). He joined the Portuguese surrealist group formed by Ant\u00f4nio Maria Lisboa and Cesariny Vasconcelos. His first individual exhibition was in Castelo de Vide in 1952. Since then his work has been shown in many individual and group exhibitions. Until the late 1950s Sobral worked in creative advertising and a graphic illustration. He also wrote poetry and drama, and worked as a layout designer. He was critical of the regime of Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar, and was arrested several times for political reasons. He took up sculpture in the 1960s, and then ceramics. In 1970 he began to collaborate in making tapestry with the Manufactura de Tape\u00e7arias de Portalegre. He was a co-founder of the Minotauro publishing house with Urbano Tavares Rodrigues. This company published the Minotauro magazine. In 1975 he moved to Americana, S\u00e3o Paulo, where he created a sculpture for the city entrance at the invitation of former Mayor Ralph Biasi. Figueiredo Sobral died on 13 August 2010 in Lisbon at the age of 85. Sobral's monumental sculptures and mural paintings are installed in urban public spaces in Brazil and Portugal.
