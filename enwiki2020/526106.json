Consulted on 6 June 2010. in order to distinguish it from the European Patent Office, one of the two organs of the organisation) is a public international organisation created in 1977 by its contracting states to grant patents in Europe under the European Patent Convention (EPC) of 1973.Gower's Report on Intellectual Property , para 1.34 The European Patent Organisation has its seat at Munich, Germany, and has administrative and financial autonomy. The European Patent Organisation is not legally bound to the European Union (EU) and has several members which are not themselves EU states. The evolution of the Organisation is inherently linked to the European Patent Convention. See European Patent Convention for the history of the European Patent system as set up by the European Patent Convention and operated by the European Patent Office. == Organs == European Patent Office headquarters in Munich The European Patent Organisation has two organs: the European Patent Office, which acts as its executive body, and the Administrative Council, which acts as its supervisory body as well as, to a limited extent, its legislative body. The actual legislative power to revise the European Patent Convention lies with the Contracting States themselves when meeting at a Conference of the Contracting States. Besides, the Boards of Appeal, which do not form an independent organ of the Organisation but are integrated within the European Patent Office, are assigned the role of an independent judiciary. Opinion G 3/08 of 12 May 2010, Reasons 7.2.1. The European Patent Organisation is in that sense an international organisation \"modelled on a modern state order and based on the separation of powers principle\". === European Patent Office === The European Patent Office (EPO) examines and grants European patents under the European Patent Convention. Its headquarters are located at Munich, Germany, with a branch in Rijswijk (a suburb of The Hague, Netherlands), sub- offices in Berlin, Germany, and Vienna, Austria, and a \"liaison bureau\" in Brussels, Belgium. === Administrative Council === The Administrative Council is made up of members of the contracting states and is responsible for overseeing the work of the European Patent Office, ratifying the budget and approving the actions of the President of the Office. The Council also amends the Rules of the EPC and some particular provisions of the Articles of the European Patent Convention. As of 2019, the Chairman of the Administrative Council is Josef Kratochv\u00edl. == Legal status == The European Patent Organisation has legal personality, and is represented by the President of the European Patent Office. == Member states, extension states, and validation states == thumb|250px| There are, as of April 2019, 38 Contracting States to the EPC, also called member states of the European Patent Organisation:EPO member states, retrieved on 25 July 2020 Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United Kingdom (see European Patent Convention article for the dates of entry in force in each country). The most recent member state to join the EPC entered was Serbia which did so on 1 October 2010. Serbia accedes to the European Patent Convention , 30 July 2010. Consulted on 31 July 2010. In addition, there are \"extension states\" which are not Contracting States to the EPC but have instead signed extension agreements under which the protection conferred by European patent applications and patents is extended to the relevant country.EPO Journal 2004, 619 These are Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro.EPO web site, Extension of European patents to Montenegro (ME) , 12 January 2010. Consulted on 15 January 2010. Slovenia, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Croatia, Macedonia, Albania and Serbia were all extension states prior to joining the EPC. Furthermore, there are so-called \"validation states\" which are not Contracting States to the EPC but have instead signed validation agreements which act similarly to the extension agreements to extend the protection of European patent applications and European Patents. Morocco, Moldova, Tunisia, and Cambodia became validation states on 1 March 2015, 1 November 2015, 1 December 2017, and 1 March 2018, respectively. == See also == * Eurasian Patent Organization * European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), dealing with trademarks and industrial designs for the European Union * International Patent Institute (IIB), established in 1947 and integrated into the European Patent Organisation on its creation * Patent examiner * Trilateral Patent Offices == Notes == == References == ==External links== * Category:Patent offices Category:Organisations based in Munich ",
