    "text": "The William Gibbs House is a historic house in Waltham, Massachusetts. Built c. 1830\u201354, this -story wood-frame house is one Waltham's few temple-front Greek Revival houses. It has four two-story Corinthian columns supporting a fully pedimented gable with a deep, dentillated cornice. It was probably built in the 1840s by William Gibbs, a hat manufacturer, and was sold by him to another hat maker who lost it to foreclosure. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Waltham, Massachusetts ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Waltham, Massachusetts Category:Houses completed in 1845 Category:Houses in Waltham, Massachusetts ",
