    "text": "Francisco Bulnes (Mexico City, 4 October 1847 \u2013 Mexico City, 22 September 1924) was a scientist, journalist, and politician.Charles A. Hale, \"Francisco Bulnes\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 1, p. 485. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. ==Biography== He educated as an engineer, but is better known as an influential liberal intellectual during the regime of Mexican President Porfirio Diaz. He served D\u00edaz as the Secretary of Foreign Affairs. As a trained scientist, \"it is not surprising that Francisco Bulnes became one of the leading figures in Mexico's liberal- positivist school, collectively known as the Cient\u00edficos.Karen Racine, \"Francisco Bulnes\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico, vol. 1, p. 168. Chicago: Fitzroy and Dearborn 1997. Positivism was the prevailing intellectual movement of the period and took a scientific approach to economic development and to history. Bulnes was born in Mexico City in 1847 and attended the National Mining School. He then taught mathematics at the prestigious National Preparatory School, later also teaching other sciences as well as political economy. As a member of Mexico's Society of Geography and Statistics, Bulnes traveled to Japan with a delegation of Mexican scientists. He entered political life through his work on the Mexico City-Veracruz railway line when he met liberal Veracruz politician Sebastian Lerdo de Tejada. Bulnes became a long-serving Mexican senator, where he drafted the first Bank Law and the Mining Code of 1880.Racine, \"Francisco Bulnes\" p. 168. He was an admirer of the British political system and admired the progress of both the United Kingdom and the United States. He was a full supporter of liberal ideology which in Mexico sought to curtail the political and economic power of the Roman Catholic Church. Its religious doctrines stressed rewards in the afterlife and in liberals' view was an impediment to personal advancement and national economic development. He viewed Protestantism as \"more suited to modern cultures.\"Racine, \"Francisco Bulnes\" p. 168. In El porvenir de las nations Hispano-Americanas (The Future of the Hispanic-American Nations), published in 1899 in the wake of the Spanish\u2013American War, Bulnes attributed Mexico's backwardness to a combination of Iberian conservatism and Indian debility. He explained the natives' weakness, using the recently developed science of nutrition, by dividing mankind into three races: the people of corn, wheat, and rice. After some dubious calculations of the nutritional value of staple grains, he concluded that \u201cthe race of wheat is the only truly progressive one,\u201d and that \u201cmaize has been the eternal pacifier of America's indigenous races and the foundation of their refusal to become civilized.\u201d Bulnes attacked the reputation of the late president Benito Ju\u00e1rez, describing him \"as an insignificant provincial lawyer with no clear ideology until he met Ocampo in New Orleans.\"Brian Hamnett, Ju\u00e1rez. New York: Longmans 1994, 244-245. Bulnes's attack on Ju\u00e1rez was contested by among others Genero Garc\u00eda and Justo Sierra.Hamnett, Ju\u00e1rez, p. 245. In 1910 when the Mexican Revolution (1910\u20131920) erupted and the D\u00edaz regime collapsed, Bulnes left Mexico for exile in New Orleans and then Havana, returning to Mexico in 1921 following the end of the military phase of the Revolution. Bulnes published a defense of D\u00edaz in 1920 and a critique of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's role in the Revolution.Racine, \"Francisco Bulnes\", p. 169. As a staunch defender of the D\u00edaz regime and one who espoused politically charged opinions on a variety of topics, Bulnes's reputation in Mexico has suffered. Manuel Gamio, the archaeologist who excavated the pyramids of Teotihuac\u00e1n, denounced Bulnes as a racist, while Daniel Cosio Villegas, a leading historian, described him as \u201cone of the most evasive, designing, and deceitful writers that Mexico has ever produced.\u201d However, historian of Mexican liberalism, Charles A. Hale says \"His critical insights have attracted many modern scholars to his work.\"Hale, \"Francisco Bulnes\", p. 485. ==Works== * Sobre el hemisferio norte, once mil leguas.
