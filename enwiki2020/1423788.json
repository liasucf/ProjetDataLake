It was the second-largest council area in Northern Ireland with over 120,000 people and an area of of southwest Antrim and northwest Down. It stretched from Glenavy and Dundrod in the north to Dromara and Hillsborough in the south and from Drumbo in the east to Moira and Aghalee in the west. The council area consisted of five electoral areas: Downshire, Dunmurry Cross, Killultagh, Lisburn Town North and Lisburn Town South. It had 30 councillors, last elected in 2011.

William Beattie was elected as a \"Protestant Unionist\" in 1997, but is tallied as an Independent Unionist above. New legislation introduced for the 2001 elections required candidates to register party names for these to appear on the ballot paper, this also made it impossible for candidates to stand as Independent Unionist. The UDP missed the deadline for registration and their candidate, party leader Gary McMichael, was elected as an independent. The other candidate elected as an independent in 2001, described himself as a Unionist on the council website.Lisburn council election results 1993-2011, ARK, accessed 13 January 2013 Source: ARK accessed 13 January 2013 ==2011 Election results== 2011 saw the continued advancement of the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in within the council Area. In Downshire, the DUP picked up a seat from the UUP, and in Dunmurry Cross, Sinn F\u00e9in gained from the SDLP. However the SDLP loss was compensated by changing demographics in the Lisburn Town North DEA, where the SDLP took a seat for the first time. There were no changes in the Killutagh or Lisburn Town South DEAs. The election saw the DUP return all their candidates with the exception of Ben Mallon, a local student standing in Lisburn North. {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" |- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\" !colspan=2| Party || seats || change +/- |- ! style=\"background-color: \" |\u2022 |Democratic Unionist Party ||align=\"right\"| 14 ||align=\"right\"| +1 |- ! style=\"background-color: \" |\u2022 |Ulster Unionist Party ||align=\"right\"| 5 ||align=\"right\"| -2 |- ! style=\"background-color: \" |\u2022 |Sinn F\u00e9in ||align=\"right\"| 5 ||align=\"right\"| +1 |- ! style=\"background-color: \" |\u2022 |Social Democratic and Labour Party ||align=\"right\"| 3 ||align=\"right\"| = |- ! style=\"background-color: \" |\u2022 |Alliance Party of Northern Ireland ||align=\"right\"| 3 ||align=\"right\"| = |- ! style=\"background-color: \" |\u2022 |Independent ||align=\"right\"| 0 ||align=\"right\"| = |- |} ==Mayors of Lisburn== * 1964 \u2013 70: James Howard (1st Mayor of the Borough of Lisburn) * 1970 \u2013 73: Hugh Gray Bass * 1977 \u2013 78?: Elsie Kelsey, Ulster Unionist Party * 1978 \u2013 79: * 1979 \u2013 81: Alderman Dr Samuel Semple MBE, Ulster Unionist Party * 1981 \u2013 83: Billy Belshaw, Democratic Unionist Party * 1983 \u2013 85: Maureen McKinney, Ulster Unionist Party * 1985 \u2013 87: Walter Lilburn, Ulster Unionist Party * 1987 \u2013 88: * 1988 \u2013 89: Billy Bleakes, Ulster Unionist Party * 1990 \u2013 91: Willam McAllister, Ulster Unionist Party * 1991 \u2013 93: Ivan Davis, Ulster Unionist Party * 1993 \u2013 94: Seamus Close, Alliance Party of Northern Ireland * 1994 \u2013 96: Harry Lewis Ulster Unionist Party * 1996 \u2013 98?: George Morrison, Ulster Unionist Party * 1998 \u2013 00: Peter O'Hagan, Social Democratic and Labour Party * 2000 \u2013 02: Jim Dillon, Ulster Unionist Party * 2002 \u2013 03: Betty Campbell, Alliance Party of Northern Ireland * 2003 \u2013 04: Billy Bell, Ulster Unionist Party * 2004 \u2013 05: Cecil Calvert, Democratic Unionist Party * 2005 \u2013 06: Jonathan Craig, Democratic Unionist Party * 2006 \u2013 07: Trevor Lunn, Alliance Party of Northern Ireland * 2007 \u2013 08: James Tinsley, Democratic Unionist Party * 2008 \u2013 09: Ronnie Crawford, Ulster Unionist Party * 2009 \u2013 10: Allan Ewart, Democratic Unionist Party * 2010 \u2013 11: Paul Porter, Democratic Unionist Party * 2011 \u2013 12: Brian Heading, Social Democratic and Labour Party * 2012 \u2013 13: William Leathem, Democratic Unionist Party * 2013 \u2013 14: Margaret Tolerton, Democratic Unionist Party * 2014 \u2013 15: Andrew Ewing, Democratic Unionist Party * 2018 - 19: Uel Mackin, Democratic Unionist Party ==Review of Public Administration== Under the Review of Public Administration (RPA) the Council was due to merge with Castlereagh Borough Council in 2011 to form a single council for the enlarged area totalling 540 km\u00b2 and a population of 175,182.
