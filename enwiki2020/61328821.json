Bellwood studies the ecology, biogeography and evolution of marine fishes, and in 2016 was elected to the Australian Academy of Science. ==Early life== Bellwood was born in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, England.Christopher J. Fulton (2015) \"Prof. David Bellwood FAA\" Australian Society for Fish Biology K. Radway Allen Award, official website. Accessed July 21, 2019. He graduated from the University of Bath in 1980, with Honours, having studied the effects of cyanide as an anaesthetic for reef fishes. He worked on North Sea inshore fishing trawlers and trained in taxonomy at the Natural History Museum in London, under zoologist Geoffrey Boxshall. ==Career== Bellwood completed his PhD research at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia, where he studied parrotfishes from 1981-85. He subsequently undertook a one-year postdoctoral position at Silliman University in the Philippines. In 1988, Bellwood returned to James Cook University, first as a postdoctoral researcher with Howard Choat and then, in 1991, as a Lecturer. In 2004, he was promoted to a Personal Professorial Research Chair in Marine Biology, and then to Distinguished Professor in 2015, becoming an Australian Research Council Laureate Fellow in 2019. Bellwood's research interests are wide-ranging, and his work spans the \"systematics, evolution, biogeography, biology and ecology of reef fishes from both tropical and temperate seas.\" Bellwood currently teaches \u2018Reef fish evolution and ecology\u2019 and \u2018Marine biogeography\u2019 at James Cook University. Since 1992, Bellwood has led the Reef Fish Research Lab at James Cook University. ==Awards and honours== In 2015, the Australian Society for Fish Biology awarded Bellwood its highest honour, the K. Radway Allen Award.
