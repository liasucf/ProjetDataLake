King, Kris Kristofferson, Gladys Knight & the Pips, and Jose Feliciano. == References == ==External links== * Rollin' on the River on IMDB * TV Archive.Ca * Retro Video Category:1971 Canadian television series debuts Category:1973 Canadian television series endings Category:First-run syndicated television shows in Canada Category:Television series by Glen-Warren Productions ",
