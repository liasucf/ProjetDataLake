It is situated on the Wirral Peninsula, adjacent to the Woodchurch housing estate and to the south of the large village of Upton. The location has two landmarks: Arrowe Park Hospital and Arrowe Country Park, along with a number of residences. Historically within the county of Cheshire, the estate upon which Arrowe Park now lies was founded by John Shaw. His great nephew John Ralph Shaw built Arrowe Hall. Arrowe Park Hospital is a large acute accident and emergency facility that was opened in 1982. The country park was opened in 1926 with a golf club added in the 1930s. ==History== Arrowe Hall Arrowe was a small village in the central part of the Wirral. The first recorded owner of the land was an Anglo Saxon chief called \"Aescwulf\". In 1240 it was owned by Roger de Montalt, 1st Baron Montalt. There is reference to a watermill in Arrowe in 1347. From the mid 15th century until the 17th century Arrowe was owned by the Dutton family of Dutton, Cheshire who were declared Lords of Arrowe. During the 18th century many farms sprung up around Arrowe. Arrowe Township was a block of land, east to west, between Arrowe Park Road and Limbo Lane and north to south, from Arrowe Brook Lane and the Arrowe Brook Road area, to Thingwall Road East and Thingwall Road. The township was in the parish of Woodchurch and included the hamlet of Arrowe Park. The population was 96 in 1801, 105 in 1851 and 121 in 1901 but had been abolished by 1933. In 1807, Liverpool mayor, shipowner and slave trader John Shaw first bought Arrowe House Farm and subsequently more and more of the surrounding land. On his death in 1829 it came into the ownership of his nephew, John Ralph Nicholson Shaw, who built Arrowe Hall in 1835 and had the grounds landscaped to form a country estate, with parkland, a lake and workers' cottages. Arrowe Hall may have been designed by John Cunningham, who certainly made additions. The Hall was extended on several occasions in the later 19th century. The property was handed down to Captain Otho Shaw, a world traveller and collector, who housed numerous items there. In 1908, Arrowe Hall and Park were acquired by Lord Leverhulme, who sold the estate to Birkenhead Corporation in 1926. Ownership was transferred again on 1 April 1974 from Birkenhead Corporation to the nascent Metropolitan Borough of Wirral local authority. In 1929, the 3rd World Scout Jamboree was held at Arrowe Park, with over 50,000 scouts and 320,000 visitors. There is a monument in the park which commemorates this event. ==Landmarks== Arrowe Park Hospital Arrowe Country Park is a country park in the district that was opened in 1926.
