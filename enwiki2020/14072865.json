He and his family moved to Asturias, Spain in the late 1920s to escape the repressive leadership of Cuban leader Gerardo Machado. They returned to Cuba in December 1936 to escape the Spanish Civil War. In 1942, Fern\u00e1ndez left for Philadelphia to study electronic engineering. In 1945, he returned to Cuba, and devoted himself to painting. In 1947, Fern\u00e1ndez returned the United States, settling in New York City. He registered with the Art Students League, where he studied painting with George Grosz and Preston Dickinson. In 1948, Fern\u00e1ndez met painter Wifredo Lam, who introduced him to several European painters living in New York City at the time, including Marcel Duchamp and Esteban Franc\u00e9s. In 1949, Fern\u00e1ndez's daughter Yolanda was born in New York City. In 1952, Fern\u00e1ndez travelled to Medellin, Colombia, where he was influenced to begin studying photography. In 1954, Fern\u00e1ndez worked for Propaganda Epoca, a Colombian advertising agency, where he met Fernando Botero and Gabriel Garcia M\u00e1rquez. In 1955, Fern\u00e1ndez travelled the Amazonian area of El Atrato, studying archaeology and ethnology. After photographing Native Americans in Guajira for four months, he returned to New York City, where he sold many of the photographs he had taken in South America. In 1957, he took part as a photographer in the filming of Nazar\u00edn de Luis Bu\u00f1uel in Mexico. His photographs were published in Life, Esquire, Paris Match, Jours of France, Pagent, Cosmopolitan, Evergreen Review, Time Magazine, The New York Times, and the Herald Tribune.

He also worked as a photographer for the Revoluci\u00f3n newspaper and its weekly magazine, the Lunes of Revoluci\u00f3n, photographing writers, musicians, and artists, including Jose Lezama Lima and Ernest Hemingway. During this time period he traveled to Havana on a yearly basis to see his family. During one of these trips, he wrote a report on the artistic life of Cuba for Life Magazine. In 1960, he returned to New York City and temporarily gave up photography to devote himself to painting, teaching at the School Visual Arts. He lived in the \u201cVillage\u201d, regularly meeting with Jorge Luis Borges, Aldous Huxley, Joan Mir\u00f3, Antoni T\u00e0pies, and Antonio Will. In 1961, his work was exhibited at the D\u2019Arcy Gallery of New York. In 1969, he started to alternate his work in New York with stays in San Juan, Puerto Rico, in search of an environment more favorable to creation. During this period he wrote as an art critic for several publications, including the San Juan Star, Opus International, and Knowledge of Arts. From 1971 to 1973, his works were exhibited at the El Morro gallery in San Juan, the museum of the University of Puerto Rico, and at the Alliance Fran1caise and Botello gallery in San Juan. Between 1974 and 1976, he lived in the Spanish cities of Toledo and Madrid.
