    "text": "Al-Kabri () was a Palestinian Arab town in the Galilee located northeast of Acre. It was captured by the Haganah 21 May 1948, a week after the State of Israel was declared. In 1945, it had a population of 1,520Khalidi, 1992, p. 19 and a total area cultivated of 20,617Khalidi, 1992, p. 20: Citrus, bananas, cereals, fruit and olive trees dunams. It is near the site of Tel Kabri. ==History== ===Crusader era=== In the 13th century, al-Kabri was known as \"Le Quiebre\" and belonged to the fief of Casal Imbert (az-Zeeb). In 1253, King Henry granted the whole estate of Casal Imbert, including Le Quiebre, to John of Ibelin.Strehlke, 1869, pp. 84-85, No. 105; cited in R\u00f6hricht, 1893, RRH, p. 318, No. 1208; cited in Frankel, 1988, p. 264 Shortly after, in 1256, John of Ibelin leased az-Zeeb and all its dependent villages, including Le Quiebre, to the Teutonic Order for ten years.R\u00f6hricht, 1893, RRH, p. 328, No. 1250; cited in Frankel, 1988, p. 264 In 1261, az-Zeeb, together with Le Fierge and Le Quiebre, were sold to the Teutonic Order, in return for an annual sum for as long as Acre was in Crusader hands.Strehlke, 1869, pp. 106-7, No. 119; cited in R\u00f6hricht, 1893, RRH, pp. 341-2, No. 1307 In 1283, it was still a part of the Crusader states, as it was mentioned under the name \"al-Kabrah\", as part of their domain in the hudna (truce agreement) between the Crusaders based in Acre and the Mamluk sultan al-Mansur Qalawun.Barag, 1979, p. 203 ===Mamluk period=== According to al-Maqrizi, it was under Mamluk rule by 1291, as it was mentioned under the name of \"al-Kabira\" in that year when Sultan al-Ashraf Khalil allocated the town's income to a charitable organization in Cairo.al- Maqrizi, 1845, vol 2, p. 131 ===Ottoman era=== aqueduct between Acre and Kabri, built by Jezzar Pasha.Jacotin, 1826. See also Siege of Acre (1799) Al-Kabri was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and by the 1596 tax records it was part of nahiya (subdistrict) of Akka, part of Safad Sanjak with an all-Muslim population of ten households. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on various agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, cotton, beehives and/or goats and occasional revenues; a total of 1,691 ak\u00e7e. 7/12 of the revenue went to a Waqf.H\u00fctteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 193Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H\u00fctteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9. In Pierre Jacotin\u00b4s map from 1799 the village was called Kabli.Karmon, 1960, p. 160 The place was well known for its springs, including Ayn Mafshuh, Ayn Fawwar, Ayn al-'Asal, and Ayn Kabri. The number of springs made al-Kabri the main supplier of water in the District of Acre. Ancient aqueducts supplied water from the springs to Acre, and two additional canals were built by Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar in 1800, and Sulayman Pasha al-Adil in 1814.Khalidi, 1992, p. 20Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 156 In 1875, the French explorer Victor Gu\u00e9rin visited the village: > Many of the houses are built of good materials, which seem ancient. They are > constructed of stones finely cut, mixed with simple rubble, perfectly > jointed by means of little stones so placed as to fill up spaces and to make > the whole compact. The site of an ancient church, now completely destroyed, > is still, to a certain extent, to be traced. Many columns have been removed > from it, and numbers of cut stones of medium size. Above the village, the > ruins of houses prove that the place was once much more populous than > now.Gu\u00e9rin, 1880, pp. 32 -33, as translated by Conder and Kitchener, 1881, > SWP I, p. 169 > At twenty-five minutes walk from El Kabry is a spring called Neba Fawara. > Formerly received in a basin, of which the foundations only are now visible, > it runs away in a considerable stream, which waters several gardens. > Enormous fig-trees show the extraordinary fruitfulness of the soil. A little > farther I pass along arcades entirely covered with high bushes, which form > part of the aqueduct of El Kabry. The ground rises here, so that the canal > supported by these arcades is at the level of the ground, then it disappears > altogether, reappearing again, according to the level of the ground. El > Kabry is in a very advantageous position, thanks to its precious springs, > which must always have caused the foundation of a group, more or less > considerable, of houses. The name of Kabry shows that it was once called > Gobara, a name given by Josephus to a place in another part of Galilee. It > contains two abundant springs; one is received in a reservoir similar to > that of Et Tell, and from there, by an opening made expressly, the water > runs off in a cascade to turn mills and water gardens. The second spring > gushes from the bottom of a kind of vaulted cave, into which one descends by > steps, and it feeds the aqueduct, which, sometimes subterranean, sometimes > on the level of the ground, sometimes borne in arcades, supplies Akka with > water. Reconstructed by Jezzar Pasha at the end of the last century, this > aqueduct has succeeded one much older, of which traces yet remain. > Besides these two springs there is a third not far off, called Ain Jatun, > of equal importance, which fertilises the proverbially fruitful territory of > Kabry.Gu\u00e9rin, 1880, pp. 32 -33, as translated by Conder and Kitchener, 1881, > SWP I, p. 146 In 1881 the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described the village as a \"village built of stone, containing about 400 Moslems, situated on the edge of the plain, with gardens and olives, figs and mulberries, apples and pomegranates; there is a large spring and birket here, at which the aqueduct conveying water to 'Akka commences.\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 146. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, pp. 19-20 A population list from about 1887 showed el Kabry to have about 690 inhabitants, all Muslims.Schumacher, 1888, p. 190 ===British Mandate period=== In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, al-Kabri had a population of 553 inhabitants, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Acre, p. 36 increasing in the 1931 census to 728 Muslims in 173 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 101 During this period, al-Kabri's houses were built of stone, mud, and reinforced concrete. The village contained a mosque and a boys' elementary school. Agriculture was the base of the economy with villagers cultivating olives, citrus, and bananas and engaged in animal husbandry, including raising cattle. The population grew to 1,530 in the 1945 statistics, still all Muslim.Village Statistics The Palestine Government, April 1945 , p. 3 Together with the nearby Tarshiha, the villages had 47,428 dunums of land at this time.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 41 Of this, a total of 743 dunums of land in the two villages was used for citrus and bananas, 5,301 were plantation and irrigable land, 14,123 for cereals,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 81 while 252 dunams were built-up (urban) land.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 131 ====1947-8 civil war==== Al-Kabri was first badly shaken by the Palmach raid on the village on the night 31 January/1 February 1948, in which the house of the main al-Husayni-affiliated notable, Fares Efendi Sirhan, was partly demolished by a huge explosion. After this, Sirhan and his family fled to Lebanon.Morris, 2004, p. 253 On the 27 March 1948, the Yehiam convoy bringing supplies to besieged Kibbutz Yehiam was ambushed while passing by al-Kabri and 46 Haganah members were killed.Benvenisti, 2000, p. 138Khalidi, 1992, p. 20. Gives the date as 28 March and that The New York Times reported 49 Jews dead and six Arabs, and that the convoy consisted of five trucks and an armored car. In April 1948, the Haganah prepared an initial blueprint for an operation called \"Ehud\", which provided for attacks on al-Kabri, al Nahar, al-Bassa and al-Zib for \"the destruction of the gangs [and] the menfolk, [and] the destruction of property\". ===Israeli period=== The village was likely occupied on the night of 20\u201321 May during the second stage of Operation Ben-Ami, by which time most of the inhabitants had fled. During their dispersal in Galilee some of the villagers were killed when it was discovered that they came from al-Kabri, in retaliation for the convoy ambush.Khalidi, 1992, p. 20, quoting Nazzal, 1978, pp. 58-63 According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, the remaining structures in al-Kabri's lands in 1992 were \"crumbled walls and stone rubble, overgrown with thorns, weeds, and bushes.\" A Jewish community by the same name, Kabri, was built on land adjacent to the site of the Palestinian village, which is also for agriculture and pasture land. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * (p. 56) * (possibly Kabartha p. 154 ) * ( p. 634) * * * * * * * * * *Nazzal, Nafez (1974): The Zionist occupation of western Galilee, 1948, Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol. 3, No. 3, 58-76. * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== *Welcome to al-Kabri Palestine Remembered. *al- Kabri, Zochrot *Survey of Western Palestine, Map 3: IAA, Wikimedia commons *Al-Kabri at Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center *Al-Kabri photos, from Dr. Moslih Kanaaneh Category:District of Acre Category:Arab villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War Category:Teutonic Order ",
