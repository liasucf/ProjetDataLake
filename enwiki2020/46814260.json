The studio was founded in January 2011 by former Ubisoft employees Mathieu Girard and Romain de Waubert de Genlis, and was acquired by Sega in June 2016. Amplitude is now a part of Sega West, which also comprises Creative Assembly, Sports Interactive and Relic Entertainment. == History == Amplitude Studios focuses primarily on the development of titles for the personal computer (PC), and uses Steam's Early Access programme, as well as Games2Gether, a crowd- sourcing and voting platform developed by Amplitude Studios, for players to suggest and vote on design choices that should be taken into games from Amplitude Studios, to create a player-centered experience. In July 2016, Sega announced that they had acquired Amplitude Studios in order to expand their reach on the PC gaming market. Founders Girard and de Waubert de Genlis stated that they agreed on the deal as they saw the opportunity to work alongside other Sega-owned studios, such as Creative Assembly and Relic Entertainment. == Games developed == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
