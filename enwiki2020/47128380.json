    "text": "The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 (INARA) (, Pub.L 114\u201317) is a bill that was passed by the US Congress in May 2015, giving Congress the right to review any agreement reached in the P5+1 talks with Iran aiming to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. The bill passed in the Senate by a 98\u20131 vote (only Tom Cotton voted against), and then passed in the House by a vote of 400\u201325 on May 14. President Barack Obama threatened to veto the bill, but eventually a version arrived that had enough support to override any veto and Obama did not try vetoing it. Larry Klayman filed a lawsuit, alleging that the law was an unconstitutional abrogation of the Senate's Treaty Power. The lawsuit was dismissed for lack of standing. ==See also== * Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the final negotiated international agreement * Iran Nuclear Achievements Protection Act, passed by Iranian Parliament * Negotiation of a comprehensive nuclear agreement with Iran ==References== Category:Acts of the 114th United States Congress Category:Iran\u2013United States relations Category:2015 in international relations Category:United States foreign relations legislation ",
