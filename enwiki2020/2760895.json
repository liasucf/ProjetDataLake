    "text": "Alex Stephen Bruce (born 28 September 1984) is a professional footballer who plays as a defender or a defensive midfielder. The son of the former Manchester United defender Steve Bruce, he has played for Oldham Athletic, Sheffield Wednesday, Tranmere Rovers, Ipswich Town, Leicester City, Leeds United, Huddersfield Town, Hull City, Wigan Athletic, Bury and Kilmarnock. Born and raised in England, Bruce has played twice for the Northern Ireland national team, for which he declared himself available in 2011 and made his debut in 2013. He had previously made two appearances for the Republic of Ireland in 2007\u201308, but was allowed to switch under FIFA eligibility rules as these had been in friendly matches. ==Club career== ===Blackburn Rovers=== Bruce was born in Norwich, Norfolk, but moved to the Greater Manchester area at the age of three when his father, centre-back Steve Bruce, was transferred from Norwich City to Manchester United. He joined the Manchester United Academy, but was released at age 16 and moved to Blackburn Rovers as a trainee. He signed his first professional contract there in 2002, and was part of their under-19 team that won the FA Premier Academy League in 2002\u201303. He made his first-team debut on 26 December 2004 against Hartlepool United, while on three months' loan to League One club Oldham Athletic, and was part of the Oldham team that beat Manchester City in the FA Cup on 8 January 2005. ===Birmingham City=== He signed on a free transfer for Birmingham City, where his father was manager, on 27 January 2005. After finishing his loan spell at Oldham and returning to his parent club, he joined Sheffield Wednesday again on loan until the season's end, and contributed to their promotion via the play-offs. Bruce's performances against Tranmere Rovers impressed that club's manager, Brian Little, who signed him on loan for the first half of the 2005\u201306 season, but the loan was terminated early by mutual consent. Bruce made a few Premier League appearances for Birmingham following his return, including coming on as a substitute against Liverpool when Birmingham were getting heavily beaten. The team were relegated to the Championship, and it was felt that accusations of nepotism were hindering his progress, so it was decided that, in the best interests of club, manager and player, Bruce should pursue his career away from his father's management. ===Ipswich Town=== In the summer of 2006, he moved to Ipswich Town on a free transfer, signing a three- year contract. In early summer 2007 he was called up as an international player by the Republic of Ireland, and in November 2008, he was reportedly being watched by Italian club Fiorentina, having been recommended by Ireland manager Giovanni Trappatoni. Bruce scored his first goal for Ipswich, away to his former club Birmingham City, on 24 October 2008. He ended speculation he would leave the club by signing a new two-year contract in May 2009. Bruce captained the side at the start of the 2009\u201310 season, initially because Gareth McAuley was absent through injury and loss of form, but manager Roy Keane confirmed in late August that Bruce would keep the captaincy even if McAuley returned to the team. He fell out of favour with Keane, and lost his place in the starting 11. Bruce playing for Leicester City in 2010 On 1 February 2010, Bruce joined Leicester City on loan for the rest of the season; he jumped at the opportunity \"for a change and a new challenge.\" He made his debut as a substitute during injury time in a 2\u20131 win over Blackpool at Bloomfield Road on 7 February, playing for less than a minute. Half an hour into his full debut, he suffered a hernia that required surgery, and kept him out for several weeks. He recovered in time to play in the last three matches of the season, partnering Jack Hobbs in central defence as Leicester lost the Championship play-off semi-final to Cardiff City on penalties. ===Leeds United=== In July 2010, a transfer to Sheffield United was discussed but not completed; press speculation suggested the clubs had failed to agree on how the \u00a3200,000 fee should be paid. On 30 July, Bruce joined Championship club Leeds United for an undisclosed fee. He signed a two-year deal with an option for a further year. Bruce was an unused substitute in Leeds' first game of the season, and made his debut in the League Cup against Lincoln City on 10 August, coming into the starting 11 in place of captain Richard Naylor; Naylor took his place back for the next League match. Bruce made his second start in the next round of the League Cup, against his former club Leicester City. In his first League appearance, again replacing the rested Naylor, this time against Doncaster Rovers on 17 September, Bruce helped Leeds keep a clean sheet. He kept his place for the next game, against Sheffield United, and scored his first Leeds goal in the next, a 6\u20134 home defeat against Preston North End. After Naylor came back into the side, Bruce moved to right back against his former club Ipswich Town, and was sent off after receiving a second yellow card for a foul on Andros Townsend. After a spell on the bench, Bruce returned to Leeds' starting line-up against Cardiff City. After cementing his place in the side in partnership with Andy O'Brien, Bruce picked up an injury against Queens Park Rangers and had to be substituted early in the first half. In January 2011, Bruce was part of the Leeds team that came close to eliminating Premier League Arsenal from the FA Cup. Leeds took the lead through a Robert Snodgrass penalty, but Cesc F\u00e0bregas equalised in the 90th minute, also via a penalty. After Leeds conceded eight goals in the last three games in February, Leigh Bromby replaced Bruce in the defence, and Bruce made no further appearances that season. The return to fitness of Patrick Kisnorbo provided additional competition in defence. Bruce scored in a pre- season victory against Motherwell, and played in a reserve-team friendly against non-league club Farsley Celtic, but missed the first few months of the season through injury, including damage to an ankle. On 24 November, he joined League One club Huddersfield Town on loan until 2 January 2012. He made his debut in Town's 1\u20130 home defeat to AFC Bournemouth on 10 December, and played twice more before Leeds invoked a 24-hour recall clause after an injury to Tom Lees. He returned to Leeds' starting lineup for the first time in nearly a year for the 2\u20131 win against Burnley on 2 January, but that was his only appearance in January, and he was linked with a move to Los Angeles Galaxy. No move took place, and Bruce made seven more appearances before being released by manager Neil Warnock when his contract expired at the end of the season. ===Hull City=== Bruce signed a two-year deal with Championship club Hull City, where his father was manager, on 30 July 2012. He played 32 games and became an integral part of the team that earned promotion to the Premier League as Championship runners-up during the 2012\u201313 season. In his second season at the club, Bruce played 20 Premier League matches. On 17 May 2014 he started the 2014 FA Cup Final against Arsenal, but was on the losing side after Aaron Ramsey scored in extra time to give Arsenal a 3\u20132 victory. On 20 October 2015 he scored his first goal for Hull City with a 36th-minute header, after coming on for the injured Curtis Davies in the 18th minute of a 3\u20130 win against his former club, Ipswich Town. On 31 January 2017, he moved on loan to Wigan Athletic until the end of the season. ===Bury=== In August 2017, Bruce joined League One club Bury on non-contract terms. Just 15 minutes into his debut, on 13 August away to Wigan Athletic, he scored with a header to tie the scores at 1\u20131; he played 75 minutes, and his team lost 4\u20131. Bruce left Bury on 30 August 2017 by mutual consent. ===Wigan Athletic=== The following day, he rejoined Wigan Athletic until the end of the season. Bruce went on to make ten appearances for Wigan in all competitions, scoring his seventh career goal in a 3\u20131 victory against Rotherham United. Wigan entered into contract talks with him at the end of the 2017\u201318 season. ===Kilmarnock=== On 30 January 2019, Bruce signed for Kilmarnock until the end of the 2018\u201319 season after Wigan agreed to terminate his contract. On 17 July 2019, he signed a new one-year contract with the club. Bruce left Kilmarnock on 31 January 2020. ==International career== Qualifying through his paternal grandmother from Bangor, Northern Ireland, Bruce was eligible for international football for both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in addition to England, where he was born and brought up. He was called up by the Northern Ireland under-21s, but opted to play for the Republic instead, and made his debut for their under-21 team against Sweden in February 2006. He also represented Republic of Ireland B against Scotland B in November 2006. On 23 May 2007 he made his full international debut in a friendly match for the Republic of Ireland against Ecuador played at Giants Stadium, New Jersey. He captained the Republic of Ireland B team which played Nottingham Forest in a challenge match at Dalymount Park on 9 October 2008. In July 2011, Bruce switched his international allegiance to Northern Ireland. This was possible under FIFA eligibility rules because Bruce's appearances for the Republic had been in friendly matches. He was first called into the Northern Ireland squad in October 2012, for the World Cup qualifier against Portugal, but injury forced his withdrawal. He made his Northern Ireland debut against Malta in a friendly on 6 February 2013, becoming the only player to make senior appearances for both FA Ireland and Irish FA sides since a FIFA intervention to prevent switches between the two associations in 1950. ==Personal life== When Bruce joined Leeds United, he was reunited with his childhood friend, the Leeds goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel; their fathers, Steve Bruce and Peter Schmeichel, had played together in the same positions at Manchester United. In December 2010, Bruce was involved in a car crash during a snow storm, but managed to escape from the crash unharmed. Bruce married his partner Lucy in 2015. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== Bruce (left) and Nolberto Solano playing for Leicester City in 2010 {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Appearances
