    "text": "The Field Elm cultivar Ulmus minor 'Dicksonii', commonly known as Dickson's Golden Elm, is a yellow-leaved tree raised in Chester in 1900 by Dickson's Nursery, which distributed it from the autumn of 1907 as 'Golden Cornish Elm'. 'Cornish Elm' was the name often given in error to Guernsey or Wheatley Elm by the local authorities who planted the latter extensively, an error which may have influenced the choice of name by Dickson's nursery.Mitchell, A. (1996) The Trees of Britain (London) 'Dicksonii' is usually listed as a variety of Guernsey Elm rather than Cornish Elm, Bean giving 'Wheatleyi Aurea' as a synonym, and Hillier U. \u00d7 sarniensis 'Dicksonii'.Hilliers' Manual of Trees & Shrubs. Ed. 4, 399, (1977); David & Charles, Newton Abbot, UK Clibrans' nursery of Altrincham, however, described it (1922) as otherwise identical \"in habit and constitution\" to 'type' Cornish Elm (the nursery marketed Guernsey Elm as 'Wheatleyii'). The Sp\u00e4th nursery of Berlin distributed it from c.1913 as U. campestris cornubiensis Dicksonii.Sp\u00e4th, L., Catalogue 158 (1913-14; Berlin), p.137 The nursery Messieurs Otin p\u00e8re et fils of Saint-\u00c9tienne sold an Ulmus Wheatleyi aurea pyramidalis, with leaves marbled yellow, in 1882, earlier than Dickson's introduction. Not to be confused with more common cultivars named 'Golden Elm' \u2013 'Wredei', 'Lutescens' and 'Louis van Houtte'. ==Description== A slow growing tree, variously described as \"of free and upright growth\", \"resembling Cornish Elm in form\", and \"conical and of dense habit\". The leaves are \"a fine yellow colour, said to last till autumn\", though specimens in the north appear to colour less well (see gallery). A photograph of 'Dicksonii' was published in the Royal Horticultural Society's Gardeners' Encyclopedia of Plants and Flowers (1989).Bricknell, Christopher, ed., Royal Horticultural Society Gardeners' Encyclopedia of Plants and Flowers (London, 1989), p.76 File:Trunk of Ulmus minor 'Dicksonii' at Peasholm Park, Scarborough (1).jpg|Trunk of reverted 'Dicksonii', Peasholm Park, Scarborough File:Bark of Ulmus minor 'Dicksonii' at Peasholm Park, Scarborough.jpg|Bark of 'Dicksonii' File:Leaves of Ulmus minor 'Dicksonii' at Peasholm Park, Scarborough.jpg|Leaves of 'Dicksonii' reverted to green File:Ulmus minor 'Dicksonii'.

The horticulturalist Christopher Lloyd used 'Dickson's Golden Elm' in his herbaceous borders at Great Dixter Gardens, Northiam, East Sussex. Though he gave 'Dampieri Aurea' as a synonym, photographs suggest that the cultivar planted was 'Dicksonii'.Paul Gillett, The Long Border, Great Dixter, www.geograph.org.uk 82 were planted (as Ulmus stricta Wheatleyi aurea) on the boulevard to Long Eaton district boundary before 1939 to commemorate the coronation of King George VI. One example was planted at Pyrford Court, Woking, Surrey before 1985. 'Dicksonii' is now very rare in the UK.
