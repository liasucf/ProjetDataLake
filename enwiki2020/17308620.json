    "text": "Wayne S. Vucinich (June 23, 1913 \u2013 April 21, 2005) was an American historian. Following World War II, he was one of the founders of Russian, Slavic, East European and Byzantine studies at Stanford University, where he spent his entire academic career. ==Life== Vucinich was born in the United States to a family of Serb immigrants who had come from Bosnia in the early twentieth century. He was born in Butte, Montana in 1913, and lived there until he was orphaned at 5 years old and then sent back to Herzegovina. He was educated in Herzegovina and Los Angeles, California. He attended the University of California, Berkeley, earning a M.A. in East European history in 1936. He continued to pursue his doctoral studies between 1936 and 1941, also studying at Charles University in Prague. ===Career=== After graduating, Vucinich joined the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and worked as an analyst for the Balkans and the Soviet Union during the Second World War. In the course of his assignments, he visited London, Bari and Sofia. In 1946, after working in the State Department for a year, he accepted an offer to teach in Stanford's History Department, where he worked until his formal retirement in 1978. From 1972-85, he was director of the Center for Russian and Eastern European Studies. He also taught at Stanford's overseas campuses in Florence, Beutelsbach and Vienna. In 1977, he was appointed to Robert and Florence McDonnell Professor of Eastern European Studies at Stanford, a chair first established for Vucinich. He held it for many years after his formal retirement in 1978. Among his students were David Kennedy and Norman Naimark. In his teaching and research, Vucinich covered a broad area of history, encompassing general European history, modern history, history of the Austro- Hungarian Empire, Italy, the Balkans, Ottoman and Byzantine history, and nationalities of the Soviet Union. From 1981-82, he served as president of the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies. ==Legacy and honors== *In 1954, Vucinich won the George Louis Beer Prize of the American Historical Association for his Serbia Between East and West: The Events of 1903-08. *1982, the Vucinich Book Prize was established in his honor by the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies.
