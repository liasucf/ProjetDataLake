    "text": "Eucalyptus \u00d7 beyeri is a tree that is endemic to New South Wales. It was originally given the name Eucalyptus paniculata var. angustifolia by George Bentham who published the description in Flora Australiensis. Bentham noted that William Woolls had given it the common name narrow-leaved iron-bark. In 1917, Richard Thomas Baker raised the variety to species status with the name Eucalyptus beyeri. In 1990, Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill suggested that Bentham's type specimen was a hybrid between a previously undescribed species and E. crebra. They gave the previously undescribed species the name Eucalyptus beyeriana. This interpretation is accepted by the Australian Plant Census but not universally, and Eucalyptus beyeri is still listed in the Flora of Australia. ==References== \u00d7 beyeriana Category:Myrtales of Australia Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Trees of Australia Category:Plants described in 1867 Category:Taxa named by George Bentham Category:Plant nothospecies ",
