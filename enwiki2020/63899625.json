If it were to be properly described as a new species, the genus name would have to be changed since it is preoccupied by an extinct spider. It was initially thought to have been a spider until it was determined to have been a hoax. The factors that gave the hoax away is that there were too many segments at the base of the legs, the sternum was absent and the eyes were too large to be those of a spider, but they were large enough to have come from a crayfish. \"M\". chaoyangensis is probably the same as Cricoidoscelus, which is also found in the Yixian Formation, although there is the possibility that \"M\". chaoyangensis belonged to an entirely new genus. ==Discovery and naming== The fossil was initially discovered as a crayfish, probably by a farmer. The fossil was eventually vandalised and extra remains of the fossil were painted on to make the fossil seem like a spider, possibly to add value to the fossil so it could be sold on the black market. The fossil eventually made its way to the collection stored at the University of Kansas and it was described in 2019 by Cheng et al as a second species of the Jurassic spider Mongolarachne but it was subsequently shown to be a fossil crayfish when the specimen was analysed further. The paint was subsequently removed and the fossil placed into storage until further research can be done. == References == Category:Fossil taxa described in 2019 Category:Crayfish Category:Barremian first appearances ",
