On December 19, 2005, during his second deployment, he was severely injured in an IED attack in Yusafiah, Iraq. He lost his left arm above the elbow and his left leg above the knee; his right leg and jaw were badly injured, the latter having to be wired shut. He was unconscious for five days, and later was moved to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C. for further treatment and rehabilitation. === Fitness competitions === After leaving the Army, and going through an extended period of depression and addictions, first to pills, then to alcohol, with encouragement of his friend Eric Eisenberg who fits prosthetic devices at BioTech Limb & Brace, Galloway began focusing on fitness, reconnecting with his passion for sports that he had from his childhood and before his injury. Galloway eventually became a personal trainer. He participated in a variety of fitness competitions from regular 5K and 10K races to ones such as Tough Mudders, CrossFit competitions and Spartan events.

Galloway appeared on the November 2014 cover of Men's Health magazine, the first reader to be selected for the magazine's cover, and was named the publication\u2019s \"Ultimate Men's Health Guy\".

While Galloway experimented with a prosthetic arm for his Argentine tango, he and Burgess decided not to use it, ultimately not using it in any of his dances. The producers told him before the competition began that he would not be assigned the jive or quickstep, since the quick, repetitive motions required for those dances would be too painful. On May 19, 2015, Galloway and Burgess finished the competition in third place losing to Riker Lynch and Rumer Willis who took second and first place, respectively. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Week # ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Dance/Song ! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Judges' score ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Result |- style=\"background:#ccc;\" | style=\"width:10%;\"|Inaba | style=\"width:10%;\"|Goodman | style=\"width:10%;\"|Hough | style=\"width:10%;\"|Tonioli |- |1 |Cha-Cha-Cha/ \"I Lived\" |7 |6 |6 |7 |No Elimination |- |2 |Samba/ \"Homegrown Honey\" |7 |6 |7 |7 |Safe |- |3 |Argentine Tango/\"Rather Be\" |7 |7 |8 |8 |Safe |- |4 |Contemporary/\"American Soldier\" |8 |8 |8 |8 |Safe |- |5 |Foxtrot/\"A Whole New World\" |7 |7 |7 |7 |Safe |- |6 | Rumba/\"Waves\" Freestyle: Team YOLO/\"Wipe Out\" | 7 10 | 7 9 | 7 10 | 8 10 |Safe |- |7 | Jazz/Era:1970's \"Super Bad\" Cha-Cha-Cha/\"Dance with Me\" | 10 Awarded | 8 2 | 9 Extra | 9 Points |Safe |- |8 |Tango/\"Geronimo\" Salsa/\"Mr. Put It Down\" |8 8 |7 8 |8 8 |8 8 |Safe |- | style=\"text-align: center; background:#faf6f6;\"|9 Semi-Finals |Viennese Waltz/\"The Time of My Life\" Paso Doble/\"Unstoppable\" (E.S.
