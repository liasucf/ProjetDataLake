    "text": "The Museum Of Young Art (MOYA) founded 2005 in Vienna, Austria, was the first museum worldwide exclusively devoted to 21st-century young art. The MOYA was privately owned, founded & owned by the Swiss and German art historian and art manager Dr. Kolja Kramer. It presented artworks produced after the year 2000 only and it focussed especially on the early work of artists. Artists also did not necessarily have to be fully established. A risk with regard to long term art historical relevance was taken for the sake of art historical speculation. The MOYA also functioned as a springboard for many young artists. In 2015 the MOYA-Museum of Young Art in Vienna was closed. The transfer of the MOYA-Museum of Young Art outside Austria is planned at present. Further Information: www.moya-museum.org. thumbnail thumbnail thumbnail thumbnail thumbnail thumbnail thumbnail == Location == The first location of the MOYA was right at the famous Vienna Ring Road, next to Vienna's Burgtheater and the Rathaus, Vienna, in L\u00f6welstrasse 20, 1010 Vienna. In 2010 it moved to a larger city palace nearby, to Palais Sch\u00f6nborn-Batthy\u00e1ny at the Freyung, built by the important baroque architect Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, in the heart of Vienna, Renngasse 4, 1010 Vienna. == Represented countries== In the MOYA, mainly contemporary young European art was presented even though there was a concentration on regional art from Vienna and Austria and its neighbouring countries. The MOYA functioned as a gate the east with its many exhibitions and artists from Eastern Europe. The annual show `Young Art Global\u00b4 regularly put the regional context in a broader spatialtemporal perspective with international artists from all over the world. The MOYA was closely related to the diplomatic circle in Vienna and collaborated with cultural institutes and international art institutions in the countries. In 2014 the MOYA received the Flame of Peace, an award given by members of the Habsburg family for contributions to world peace. The following countries were represented in the MOYA by artists in cooperation with ministries, embassies and cultural institutes and institutions of the following countries: Andorra, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Brazil, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Guatemala, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Luxemburg, Malaysia, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Panama, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine. == Artists== Represented artists in the MOYA include: Andrejs Ame\u013ckovi\u010ds, Santiago Ayerbe, Mervat Alameer, Bernhard Ammerer, Renatta Avila, Aris Bagdas, Zs\u00f3fi Barab\u00e1s, Marius Bercea, Anca Benera, Adam Bota, Bernhard Buhmann, Gilbert Calleja, Nuno Andr\u00e9 Coelho, Orla Conolly, Suzana Dan, Naomi Devil, Juliana Do, Markus Dressler, Karin Frank, Maria Friberg, Agnes Gazdag, Helmuth Gr\u00e4ff, Die 4 Grazien, Urban Gr\u00fcnfelder, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Gy\u00f6rffy, Heiri H\u00e4fliger, Klaus Henckelmann, Anna Hilti, Michael Horsky, Liu Cheng Hua, Ina Hsu, Patr\u00edcia Jagicza, Wu Chan Jian, Grzegorz Klaman, Bas van Koolwijk, Kristian Kozul, Mela Kaltenegger, Ganna Kryvolap, Toni Mestrovic, Youn-Hee Moon, Robert Muntean, Jacek Niegoda, Michael Ornauer, Ceren Oykut, Andrea Papageorgiu, Eva Petric, J\u00f3zsef Pincz\u00e9s, Jos\u00e9 Pozo, Marcus Proschek, Chen Qi, Emmanuel Fretes Roy, Alexandru Radvan, Bianca Regl, Reyes, Dorota Sadovska, Laura Samaraweerow\u00e1, Josephine Scianna, Susanna Schwarz, Skero, Dominika Skutnik, Marek Sobcyk, N\u00f3r\u00e1 So\u00f3s, Stylianos Schicho, Andr\u00e1s Szab\u00f3, Peter Szarka, Michal Szlaga, G\u00e9za Sz\u00f6ll\u00f6si, Lefteris Tapas, Sorin Tara, Iv Toshain, Tomaz Tomazin, Iacopo Toppazzini, Mirela Traistaru, Christina Tsialis, Iuliana Vilsan, Agn\u00e9s Verebics, Kati Verebics, Mart Viljus, Klaus Wanker, Adalbert Wazek, Letitia Werth, Sula Zimmerberger, and many others. ==References== ==External links== * MOYA * Der Standard 1 * Der Standard 2 * Der Standard 3 * ArtSlant * Puls 4 * Wien International * Wiener Zeitung * Club Wien * Wien Kunst * About Vienna * EC Europa * Art Magazine * Art Navi * FM 4 * Falter * Carto * Basis Wien * Hey Event * Platzpirsch * European News Agency * Primio Celeste Category:Art museums and galleries in Vienna Category:Contemporary art galleries in Austria Category:Art museums established in 2005 Museum of Young Art ",
