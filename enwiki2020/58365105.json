Since the age of three, Kian and his mother traveled on and off with his father making music in remote indigenous Australian communities. Kian's parents separated in 2010, although both parents are singer songwriters and passionate about music. hearing him sing at a very early age, Kian's mother and father saw his potential and he received his first guitar at the age of seven. ==Music career== ===2017\u2013present: Early years and Bliss=== In May 2017 Kian wrote and sang the chorus of Baker Boy's debut single \"Cloud 9\". The single's popularity kickstarted Kian's success. In February 2018, Kian released \"Too Far Gone\" with 15-year-old Vince the Kid. In July, Kian released \"Waiting\" a song he wrote at the age of 14, with him explaining \"It's about that feeling of uncertainty when you don't know if they like you back \u2013 I know it's childish but I reckon everyone has found themselves in this insecure hole at some point in their lives no matter what age. Hidden within the lyrics are some things that relate to me personally along with metaphorical things to move the story along.\" In August, Kian was announced the winner of the 2018 Triple J Unearthed. Since winning Triple J Unearthed, \"Waiting\" was added to high rotation and was being played on the more prominent radio station, Nova. In November, Kian signed a new recording deal with EMI Music in Australia and Republic Records for the rest of the world. In February 2019, he released his third single \"Childism\" with Triple J getting an exclusive first listen.
