With the help of a local journalist, she helped convene the first ever organisational meeting of domestic workers in Cape Town in 1965. As General Secterary of SADSAWU, she has fought for a national minimum wage increase and compensation for on-the-job injuries for domestic workers. In 2011, Myrtle helped lead the international coalition of domestic workers that secured passage of the International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention on Decent Work for Domestic Workers (C. 189). The Convention (No. 189) on domestic workers has become the first international labor standard to ensure domestic workers the same basic rights as other workers. As part of SADSAWU, Myrtle played a central role in influencing the ILO Domestic Workers Convention C.189. The convention marked unprecedented involvement of informal women workers in the ILO standard-setting process. In 2013, Myrtle accepted the George Meany\u2013Lane Kirkland Human Rights Award, which recognizes international leaders and organizations who have overcome significant hurdles to fight for human rights. In 2015, Myrtle was awarded 2015 Fairness Award, which honors outstanding leaders who dedicates themselves to bring economic justice, fairness and equality to the poor and marginalized communities. == References == Category:South African labour law Category:South African activists Category:South African women activists Category:Living people Category:1947 births ",
