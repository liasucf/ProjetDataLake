    "text": "Inferential confusion is a \"form of processing information in which an individual accepts a remote possibility based only on subjective evidence\". It can also be defined as a meta-cognitive confusion, leading a person to confuse \"an imagined possibility with an actual probability\". It shares similarities with thought\u2013action fusion and is associated with OCD symptoms.N.A.R. Goods, C.S. Rees, S.J. Egan & R.T.

Several studies on inferential confusion and OCD have shown that inferential confusion is involved in OCD. == References == == Further reading == *Wong, S. F., & Grisham, J. R. (2018).
