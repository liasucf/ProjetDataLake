Not all authorities accept it as distinct, with the Flora Europaea treating it as a synonym of Rosa canina. It is a shrub that grows high. It has long, bent thorns. It bears dark or light pink flowers in June and July. The hips are oval and quite soft. ==References== *Flora Europaea: Rosa dumalis *Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening.
