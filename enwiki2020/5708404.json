The Baronetcy was created in the Baronetage of England on 16 May 1661 following the English Restoration, in recognition of the family's loyalty to the Crown for Hugh Smith of Ashton Court. *Sir Hugh Smith, 1st Baronet (died 28 July 1680) *Sir John Smith, 2nd Baronet (born c.1655; died 26 May 1726) *Sir John Smith, 3rd Baronet (died July 1741) Although the baronetcy was extinct on the death of the third Baronet it was recreated in 1763 for the husband of his daughter and heiress Florence \u2013 see below for further details.. ==Smith, later Bowyer-Smyth baronets, of Hill Hall (1661)== See Bowyer-Smyth baronets ==Smith of Isleworth, Middlesex (20 April 1694)== Arms of Smith of Isleworth Created in the Baronetage of England.

The first Baronet was succeeded by his son and subsequently by two nephews. Lack of male issue resulted in the extinction of the baronetcy in 1849. *Sir Jarrit Smith, 1st Baronet, MP for Bristol (born c.1692; died 24 January 1783) *Sir John Hugh Smith, 2nd Baronet (born c.1735; died 30 March 1802) *Sir Hugh Smyth, 3rd Baronet (born 3 July 1772; died 28 January 1824) *Sir John Smyth, 4th Baronet (born 9 February 1776; died 19 May 1849) The family estates at Ashton Court and in Bristol and Gloucestershire passed in 1849 to Florence Smith, sister of the third and fourth Baronets. She had married John Upton and on her death in 1852 the estates passed to her grandson John Henry Greville Upton for whom the baronetcy was recreated for the second time in 1859 under the title Smyth of Ashton Court \u2013 see Smyth baronets for further details. ==Smith (sometime Wyldebore-Smith), later Smith-Marriott baronets of Sydling St Nicholas, Dorset (1774)== *see Smith-Marriott baronets ==Smith, later Smith-Dodsworth baronets (1784)== *see Smith-Dodsworth baronets ==Smith, later Cusack-Smith baronets, of Tuam (1799)== *see Cusack-Smith baronets ==Smith, later Eardley baronets, of Hadley (1802)== The Smith, later Eardley Baronetcy, of Hadley in the County of Middlesex, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 22 December 1802. For more information on this creation, see Eardley baronets. ==Smith, later Spencer-Smith baronets, of Tring Park (1804)== *see Spencer-Smith baronets ==Smith of Eardiston, Worcs (23 September 1809)== Created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. The succession was for many years thought to have been as follows: *Sir William Smith, 1st Baronet of Eardiston (died 1821) *Sir Christopher Sidney Smith, 2nd Baronet (born 14 May 1798; died 7 August 1839) *Sir William Smith, 3rd Baronet (born 5 October 1823; died 4 January 1893) *Sir William Sydney Winwood Smith, 4th Baronet (born 1 April 1879; died 27 June 1953) *Sir Christopher Sydney Winwood Smith, 5th Baronet (born 20 September 1906; died 3 December 2000) The Baronetcy then became dormant, not having been proved by: *Robert Christopher Sydney Winwood Smith (born 1939) Since the publication of Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage 2011, however, it has been accepted that the 4th Baronet was the product of the bigamous second marriage of his father Christopher Sydney Winwood Smith (1846-1887; son of the 3rd Baronet as above, but predeceased him) in 1877 to Caroline Holland, and was not in line to inherit the title; Christopher Sydney Winwood Smith's first marriage, in 1870, was to Anne Mogan, and it was their son, William Sidney Winwood Smith (1872-1954), that was entitled to succeed as 4th Baronet. His son, Sidney Richard Smith (1907-1983) would have been the 5th Baronet, succeeded by his second cousin, Antony Winwood Smith (1920-1993) as 6th Baronet. This line was unaware of their succession to the baronetcy. Debrett's 2011 states the title to have been extinct in 1993 at the death in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe of Sir Antony Winwood Smith, 6th Baronet, this being confirmed by the Registrar of the Official Roll of the Baronetage in 2008.Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage, 148th edition, ed. Charles Kidd, Debrett's Peerage Ltd, 2011, p. 6 The succession of the baronetcy, per the above, would thus have been as follows: *Sir William Smith, 1st Baronet of Eardiston (died 1821) *Sir Christopher Sidney Smith, 2nd Baronet (born 14 May 1798; died 7 August 1839) *Sir William Smith, 3rd Baronet (born 5 October 1823; died 4 January 1893) *Sir William Sidney Winwood Smith, 4th Baronet (born 1872; died 1954) *Sir Sidney Richard Smith, 5th Baronet (born 20 September 1906; died 3 December 1983) *Sir Antony Winwood Smith, 6th Baronet (born 1920; died 1993) ==Smith of Pickering, Canada 30 August 1821)== Created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. *Sir David William Smith, 1st Baronet (born 4 September 1764; died 9 May 1837) (Extinct on his death) ==Smith, later Smith-Gordon (1838)== *see Smith-Gordon baronets ==Smith of Aliwal, Punjab (1846)== Created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. *Sir Harry George Wakelyn Smith, 1st Baronet, Governor of the Cape of Good Hope 1847\u20131852 (born 28 June 1787; died 12 October 1860) (Extinct on his death) ==Smith of Stratford Place, London (6 September 1897)== Created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. *Sir Thomas Smith, 1st Baronet (born 23 March 1833; died 1 October 1909) *Sir Thomas Rudolph Hampden Smith, 2nd Baronet (born 24 January 1869; died 25 June 1958) *Sir Thomas Turner Smith, 3rd Baronet (born 28 June 1903; died 11 May 1961) *Sir Thomas Gilbert Smith, 4th Baronet (born 2 July 1937; died 13 February 2003) *Sir Andrew Thomas Smith, 5th Baronet (born 17 October 1965) ==Smith, later Prince-Smith baronets, of Hillbrook (1911)== The Smith, later Prince-Smith Baronetcy, of Hillbrook in the County of York, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 11 February 1911.
