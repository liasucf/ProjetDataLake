On Metacritic, the first season holds a score of 58 out of 100, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". On Rotten Tomatoes, the show holds a 61% approval rating based on 31 critics with its critical consensus: \"The Family takes a confusing, convoluted course to solve its central mystery that few will want to follow, despite a game performance from Joan Allen.\" The performances of McCarthy, Pill, and Allen have been praised by critics. Stacey Ritzen of Uproxx wrote that \"the cast all bring their A game, particularly Allen as the ball-busting matriarch and McCarthy, who lends genuine creepiness and dread to the role.\" Dominic Patten of Deadline Hollywood praised Allen's and Pill's performances, and wrote that Pill \"delivers a rooted multi-level performance that is pretty big league unto itself\". Ellen Gray of Philadelphia Daily News praised McCarthy's performance, writing that \"while we're waiting to be further mystified, there's plenty to see, including McCarthy's scene-stealing performance as a character who might be as misunderstood as Boo Radley, or might truly be the bogeyman of our worst nightmares.\" Other critics slammed the writing and casting. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter called the show, \"Poorly written and completely ridiculous.\" Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly gave it a C-, summarizing it as a \"sour, formulaic expression of ABC's penchant for buzzy, 'sticky' potboilers.\" He wrote that the show delivered a \"shallow treatment of material that deserves more maturity, more empathy, more savvy about American culture. It shows capacity for interesting ideas but has only meager, clich\u00e9 imagination for them.\" ===Ratings=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;width:99%\" |- ! No. ! Title !
