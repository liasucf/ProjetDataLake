It is located on the central square, Trg Slobode (Liberty Square), in Zrenjanin, Serbia, next to the famous theatre building. ==History== Hotel \"R\u00f3zsa\" was built in 1886 by the projects of Ferenc Pelzl, in neorenaissance. It has two floors and a back yard to the Begej river. After 1918 hotel was renamed to \"Vojvodina\" and was the best hotel in Veliki Be\u010dkerek. Hotel stayed in this building until 1972, when a new building was built just beside the old building. ==Today== After 1972, the building was no more a hotel. Since then, the ground floor became a bank, while the upper floors became offices. The facade was restored the last time in 2004, when flood lights were installed, so today it is possible to see all its beauty. ==See also== * Tourism in Serbia * National Theatre \"To\u0161a Jovanovi\u0107\" * Theatre building, Zrenjanin * Finance palace == References == Category:Zrenjanin Category:Buildings and structures in Vojvodina Category:Hotels in Serbia Category:Hotel buildings completed in 1886 ",
