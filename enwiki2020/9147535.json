    "text": "Fran\u00e7ois Weyergans (; 2 August 1941 \u2013 27 May 2019)Fran\u00e7ois Weyergans est mort was a Belgian writer and director.http://www.evene.fr/celebre/biographie/francois-weyergans-6092.php His father, Franz Weyergans, was a Belgian and also a writer, while his mother was from Avignon in France. Fran\u00e7ois Weyergans was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise on 26 March 2009, taking the 32nd seat which became vacant with the death of Alain Robbe-Grillet in 2008. ==Biography== He started film studies at the IDHEC (Hautes \u00c9tudes Cin\u00e9matographiques), where he came to love the films of Robert Bresson and Jean-Luc Godard, among others. He soon began to write for Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma and directed his first film in 1961, on Maurice B\u00e9jart, which led to his expulsion from the school as students were banned from making professional films. ==Novels== After having been through some psychoanalysis, he published a satirical account of his treatment in a novel called Le Pitre (1971), which attracted some critical notice and won the Roger Nimier Prize. His second novel in 1981 was Macaire le Copte. This won the Prix Rossel in his native Belgium, as well as the Prix des Deux Magots in France. From then on, Weyergans devoted himself entirely to writing, spending whole nights working from 11 p.m. until noon. His subsequent works\u2014mostly of an ironic autobiographical nature\u2014also won literary prizes, including the \"Prix M\u00e9ridien des quatre jurys\" in 1983 for Le radeau de la M\u00e9duse and the Prix Renaudot in 1992 for La d\u00e9mence du boxeur. Most recently, his Trois jours chez ma m\u00e8re awarded him the Prix Goncourt in 2005. In this, he satirises his own famous difficulties in delivering a promised manuscript in time. In the process he creates a \"Russian doll\" type structure where he (Weyergans) writes as a writer, Weyergraf, who finds all sorts of distractions or reasons to avoid writing a book called Trois jours chez ma m\u00e8re. He does this largely by inventing an author called Graffenberg, who in turn invents another author, Weyerstein, who sketches out a possible structure\u2014but he keeps getting waylaid by humorous meditations on his own life, love (or just encounters), family, films and multiple enthusiasms and interests. ==Films== * 1962: B\u00e9jart * 1963: Hieronymus Bosch * 1965: Robert Bresson: Ni vu, ni connu (des portraits Cin\u00e9astes de notre temps), 65 minutes * 1967: Baudelaire is gestorven in de zomer * 1967: Aline * 1972: Un film sur quelqu'un * 1977: Maladie mortelle * 1977: Je t'aime, tu danses * 1978: Couleur Chair (Flesh Color) ==References== ==Further reading== * Gardies, Andr\u00e9 (1972) Alain Robbe-Grillet.
