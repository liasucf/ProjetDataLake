    "text": "Corey Stern is an American lawyer, known for representing children and their families in lead-poisoning and sex abuse lawsuits. ==Career== Working as a partner at Levy Konigsberg LLP, Stern filed cases against the City of Flint, State of Michigan, and several private entities in 2016 during the Flint Water Crisis. Starting with around a hundred cases, after being appointed Lead Counsel in the Genesee County Litigation by Circuit Court Chief Judge Richard Yuille, the number of cases filed quickly grew, with the total children he has represented expanding to in excess of 2500. The lawsuits also named three employees of the local water authority. Stern has represented over one hundred children, individually, against the New York City Housing Authority (\u201cNYCHA\u201d) in lead-poisoning cases; the poisonings occurred as a result of lead paint hazards in the buildings maintained by the authority. In 2017, Stern filed a Federal class action lawsuit against NYCHA and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, alleging violations of residents\u2019 constitutional rights. In 2019, Stern filed a class action suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York representing sexual assault victims of Dr. Reginald Archibald during his employment at The Rockefeller University. The lawsuit filed by Jeffrey Poppel, a former patient, alleges that during his four decades as a pediatric endocrinologist at Rockefeller, Dr. Reginald Archibald had more than 9,000 patients, many of whom were boys who were unable to grow normally. The New York Times spoke with 17 people, most of them men, who said they were abused by Dr. Archibald when they were young boys or adolescents. He has previously worked with lead-poisoning cases in the State of Georgia. In 2016, Stern secured a $2.5 million judgment from New York City, the property owner, after lead paint caused lead-poisoning in a child resident. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Lawyers from New York City Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
