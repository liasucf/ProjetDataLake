The first edition of BMA came out in February 1992, it was tabloid in size and the cover featured Tex Perkins, and included coverage of the Nirvana Nevermind tour. A small office (3m x 3m) was established upstairs at Gorman House where often both editors and contributors worked simultaneously. A full set of the magazine can be found at the Canberra Library and at the National Library of Australia. In 2013, BMA Magazine opened a curated exhibition, Canberra at Street Level, to mark its 21st anniversary. Notably, for the first time in the magazine's 26-year history, an issue was not published in March 2018. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1992 establishments in Australia Category:Music magazines published in Australia Category:Biweekly magazines published in Australia Category:Magazines established in 1992 Category:Mass media in Canberra Category:Free magazines ",
