    "text": "The 2020 D.C. United season is the club's 25th season of existence, and their 25th consecutive season playing in Major League Soccer, the top flight of American soccer. The regular season began on February 29, 2020 (making it the first time the season began in February), and was suspended on March 12, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The club's season is resumed on July 13, 2020 with the MLS is Back Tournament at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex near Orlando, Florida, where group stage fixtures counted towards the regular season standings. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, United's slate of external competitions were greatly altered. The club was slated to participate in the 2020 U.S. Open Cup beginning in April, however that tournament was cancelled due to the pandemic. Additionally, United was slated to play in the 2020 Leagues Cup, a secondary knock-out tournament for the top MLS clubs which did not qualify for the 2020 CONCACAF Champions League. As with the Open Cup, the Leagues Cup was cancelled due to the pandemic. The 2020 season has also brought changes to D.C. United's coaching staff. After a string of losses, which pushed United to last place in the Eastern Conference's standings, head coach Ben Olsen was replaced by assistant coach Chad Ashton on October 8, 2020. == Preseason exhibitions == == Competitive fixtures == === Major League Soccer === ==== Standings ==== ===== Eastern Conference ===== ===== Overall ===== ==== Results by round ==== ==== Results summary ==== === U.S. Open Cup === === Leagues Cup === === MLS is Back Tournament === ==== Group C ==== == Squad information == === First team roster === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; width:80%;\" |- ! style=\"background:#000000; color:white; text-align:center;\"| Squad No. ! style=\"background:#000000; color:white; text-align:center;\"| Name ! style=\"background:#000000; color:white; text-align:center;\"| Nationality ! style=\"background:#000000; color:white; text-align:center;\"| Position(s) ! style=\"background:#000000; color:white; text-align:center;\"| Date of birth (Age) ! style=\"background:#000000; color:white; text-align:center;\"| Apps ! style=\"background:#000000; color:white; text-align:center;\"| Goals ! style=\"background:#000000; color:white; text-align:center;\"| Assists ! style=\"background:#000000; color:white; text-align:center;\"| Signed from |- ! colspan=\"9\" style=\"background:#EB0027; color:white; text-align:center\" | Goalkeepers |- | 1 | Chris Seitz | | GK | |1 |0 |0 |align=\"left\"| Houston Dynamo |- | 24 | Bill Hamid | | GK | | 238 | 0 | 0 |align=\"left\"| Midtjylland |- | 36 |Earl Edwards Jr. | | GK | | 0 | 0 | 0 |align=\"left\"| Orlando City |- ! colspan=\"9\" style=\"background:#EB0027; color:white; text-align:center\" | Defenders |- | 3 |Chris Odoi-Atsem | | RB | |13 |0 |0 |align=\"left\"| Maryland Terrapins |- | 13 | Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Brillant | | CB | | 66 | 3 | 4 |align=\"left\"| New York City FC |- | 15 |Steve Birnbaum | | CB | |163 |8 |3 |align=\"left\"| California Golden Bears |- | 23 |Donovan Pines | | CB | |10 |0 |0 |align=\"left\"| Maryland Terrapins |- | 28 |Joseph Mora | | LB | |50 |0 |3 |align=\"left\"| Saprissa |- |44 |Axel Sj\u00f6berg | | CB | |0 |0 |0 |align=\"left\"| Columbus Crew |- | 91 |Oniel Fisher | | RB | |26 |1 |1 |align=\"left\"| Seattle Sounders FC |- ! colspan=\"9\" style=\"background:#EB0027; color:white; text- align:center\" | Midfielders |- | 4 |Russell Canouse | | DM | |56 |1 |2 |align=\"left\"| TSG 1899 Hoffenheim |- | 5 |J\u00fanior Moreno | | DM | |49 |0 |5 |align=\"left\"| Zulia |- | 7 |Paul Arriola | | RM | |68 |14 |12 |align=\"left\"| Tijuana |- | 8 |Ulises Segura | | CM | |56 |5 |3 |align=\"left\"| Saprissa |- | 10 |Edison Flores | | AM | | 0 | 0 | 0 | align=\"left\" | Monarcas Morelia |- | 11 |Yamil Asad | |LM | | 30 | 9 | 8 |align=\"left\"| V\u00e9lez Sarsfield |- | 18 |Felipe | | CM | |9 |0 |1 |align=\"left\"| Vancouver Whitecaps FC |- | 25 |Mohammed Abu | | DM | |0 |0 |0 | align=\"left\" | V\u00e5lerenga (loan) |- | 27 |Moses Nyeman | | CM | |0 |0 |0 | align=\"left\" | D.C.
