    "text": "Le Blanc-Mesnil () is a commune in the northeastern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located from the center of Paris, between Charles de Gaulle Airport and le Bourget Airport. ==Name== The name Le Blanc-Mesnil was recorded for the first time in the 11th century as Mansionile Blaun. This name is a compound of Medieval Latin Mansionile, meaning \"little houses\", from Latin mansio (accusative mansionem), and of Germanic (Old Frankish) blanch, blaun, meaning \"glossy, shining, white\", which gave French blanc (\"white\") and English blank. The name is interpreted by some as a reference to the houses of Le Blanc- Mesnil which were whitened due to the flour dust coming from the windmills located there in ancient times. One researcher, however, thinks that blanc had also the meaning of \"free\" in Old French, and so the name would mean \"free mesnil, free village\", perhaps because the villagers had been freed from serfdom. None of these interpretations is certain. ==Geography== ===Nearest municipalities=== *Bondy *Aulnay-sous-Bois *Drancy *Le Bourget *Dugny *Bonneuil-en-France in Val d'Oise and Gonesse. ==History== ===French Revolution=== On 2 December 1792, a third of the territory of Aulnay was detached and became the commune of Le Blanc-Mesnil. ===Heraldry=== ==Economy== * Parc d'activit\u00e9 du Coudray * Zone industrielle de la Molette in Blanc- Mesnil, Bourget and Drancy.
