    "text": "Stress-induced leakage current (SILC) is an increase in the gate leakage current of a MOSFET, used in semiconductor physics. It occurs due to defects created in the gate oxide during electrical stressing. SILC is perhaps the largest factor inhibiting device miniaturization. Increased leakage is a common failure mode of electronic devices. ==Oxide defects== The most well- studied defects assisting in the leakage current are those produced by charge trapping in the oxide. This model provides a point of attack and has stimulated researchers to develop methods to decrease the rate of charge trapping by mechanisms such as nitrous oxide (N2O) nitridation of the oxide.
