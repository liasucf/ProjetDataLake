    "text": "Brett Favre holds the record for most consecutive starts by a quarterback. In the history of the National Football League, there have been twelve starts streaks of at least 100 consecutive games by eleven different quarterbacks, with four of those with a regular season streak of at least 200 games. Brett Favre has held the record since November 7, 1999 when he made his 117th consecutive start against the Chicago Bears. His consecutive starts streak is also the longest all-time for a non-special teams player. On December 5, 2010, playing for the Minnesota Vikings against the Buffalo Bills, Favre was knocked out of the game on the first drive with a sprained SC joint injury to his right shoulder, caused by a hit from linebacker Arthur Moats. After a snowstorm delayed the following Sunday's game against the New York Giants to Monday, December 13, Favre was ruled inactive, ending his streak at a record 297 games (321 including playoffs).\"Brett Favre unable to start vs. Giants\" ESPN.com Below is a list of the top 25 quarterbacks to achieve the longest consecutive regular season starts at their position. == All-time consecutive starts streaks == Top 25 ranked by consecutive regular season starts, updated through season, week 6 Bold denotes an active streak. {|class=\"wikitable\" !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"scope=\"col\" width=\"20\"|Rank !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"scope=\"col\" width=\"200\"|Quarterback !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"scope=\"col\" width=\"150\"|Streak start !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"scope=\"col\" width=\"150\"|Streak end !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"scope=\"col\" width=\"150\"|Teams !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"scope=\"col\" width=\"70\"|Regular season !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"scope=\"col\" width=\"40\"|Playoffs !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"scope=\"col\" width=\"70\"|Total !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"scope=\"col\" width=\"80\"|References |-align=\"center\" |rowspan=\"1\"|1 |Brett Favre||9/27/1992||12/5/2010||GB/NYJ/MIN||297||24||321 | |-bgcolor=\"lightgray\" style=\"font-weight:bold\" align=\"center\" |rowspan=\"1\"|2 |Philip Rivers |9/11/2006 ||Active||SD/LAC/IND||230||11||241 | |-align=\"center\" |rowspan=\"1\"|3 |Eli Manning |11/21/2004||11/23/2017||NYG||210||12||222 | |-align=\"center\" |rowspan=\"1\"|4 |Peyton Manning||9/6/1998||1/2/2011||IND||208||19||227 | |-align=\"center\" |rowspan=\"1\"|5 |Matt Ryan||12/20/2009||10/20/2019||ATL||154||9||163 | |-align=\"center\" |rowspan=\"1\"|6 |Matthew Stafford||9/11/2011||11/3/2019||DET||136||3||139 | |-bgcolor=\"lightgray\" style=\"font-weight:bold\" align=\"center\" |rowspan=\"1\"|7 |Russell Wilson||9/9/2012||Active||SEA||133||15||148 | |-align=\"center\" |rowspan=\"1\"|8 |Joe Flacco||9/7/2008||11/22/2015||BAL||122||15||137 | |-align=\"center\" |rowspan=\"1\"|9 |Ron Jaworski||9/18/1977||11/25/1984||PHI||116||7||123 | |-align=\"center\" |10 |rowspan=2|Tom Brady||9/14/2009||1/3/2016||NE||112||14||126 || |-align=\"center\" |11 ||9/30/2001||9/7/2008||NE||111||17||128 | |-align=\"center\" |rowspan=\"1\"|12 |Joe Ferguson||9/18/1977||9/23/1984||BUF||107||3||110 | |-align=\"center\" |rowspan=\"1\"|13 |Dan Marino||10/25/1987||10/10/1993||MIA||95||4||99 | |-align=\"center\" |rowspan=\"1\"|14 |Roman Gabriel||11/28/1965||9/17/1972||LAR||89||2||91 | |-align=\"center\" |rowspan=\"1\"|15 |Johnny Unitas||9/27/1959||11/7/1965||BAL||88||3||91 | |-align=\"center\" |rowspan=\"1\"|16 |Jim Everett||9/4/1988||10/23/1993||LAR||87||4||91 | |-align=\"center\" |rowspan=\"1\"|17 |Richard Todd||9/9/1979||12/2/1984||NYJ/NO||86||4||90 | |-align=\"center\" |rowspan=\"2\"|18T |Aaron Brooks||11/26/2000||12/12/2005||NO||82||2||84 | |-align=\"center\" |Drew Brees||1/16/2010||9/20/2015||NO||82||8||90 | |-align=\"center\" |20 |Trent Green||9/9/2001||9/10/2006||KC||81||1||82 | |-align=\"center\" |rowspan=\"2\"|21T |Drew Brees||1/8/2005||12/27/2009||SD/NO||79||3||82 | |-align=\"center\" |Kirk Cousins |9/13/2015||12/23/2019||WAS/MIN||79||1||80 | |-align=\"center\" |rowspan=\"2\"|23T |Andy Dalton||9/11/2011||12/13/2015||CIN||77||4||81 | |-align=\"center\" |Ryan Tannehill||9/09/2012||12/11/2016||MIA||77||0||77 | |-align=\"center\" |rowspan=\"1\"|25 |Steve Grogan||11/23/1975||11/16/1980||NE||76||2||78 | |} == See also == *Iron man *List of most consecutive starts and games played by National Football League players *List of National Football League records (individual)#Starts/games played *Lists of NFL starting quarterbacks *List of most consecutive games with touchdown passes in the National Football League *List of most wins by a National Football League starting quarterback == References == Category:National Football League records and achievements ",
