We've seen all of that. I don't > want people looking at me for my body, looking at me going, 'Look at that, I > want to fuck that.' I'm not up there for that.... It's not right. If we want > an egalitarian world you gotta be androgynous.... I'm not talking about the > new wave androgyny, I'm talking girls are tough, and guys...can be feminine. > There's a balance.\" ===Other personnel=== Mia Ferraro, Dez Cadena, Steve Drojensky, and Travis Johnson were also in the band for a period of time.Interview with Travis Johnson , thedickies.com/ ===Break up and later projects=== Bulimia Banquet released two albums, a single, and tracks for compilation albums.
