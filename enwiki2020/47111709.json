    "text": "Tangled Up is the second studio album by American country music singer Thomas Rhett. It was released on September 25, 2015, via Valory Music Group. The album's lead single \"Crash and Burn\", was released to radio on April 27, 2015. The album's second single, \"Die a Happy Man\" was released to country radio on September 28, 2015, but was available for download as a pre-order for the album on September 18, 2015. ==Reception== ===Critical=== Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic thought that the Thomas Rhett's second album feels like an album \"where the singer/songwriter comes into his own\" and rated the album 4 stars out of 5. He thought that Rhett \"displays an omnivorous cultural appetite\" in the album where Rhett might be \"dropping passing allusions to Guns N' Roses and Third Eye Blind\" to using disco beat. He judged Rhett to be \"a true pop artist, harnessing the trends of his time and turning them into music that's hard to resist.\" Billboard also picked up on the disco influence, noting that songs in the album, such as \"Tangled\", \"sound as Saturday Night Fever\u2019d as anything recorded by a male country star in decades\", but wondered whether \"country radio will fully embrace their Nashville disco or ignore it.\" ===Commercial=== Tangled Up debuted on the Billboard 200 at No. 6 and Top Country Albums at No. 3, with 76,000 units sold, 63,000 of which are pure album sales. It reached No. 2 on the Top Country Albums chart in its fourth week. The album was certified Platinum by the RIAA on September 20, 2016. The album has sold over 598,900 copies in the US as of September 2017. ===In popular culture=== Alvin and the Chipmunks covered the album's third track, \"South Side\", for their 2015 film and soundtrack Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Danielle Bradbery \u2013 vocals on \"Playing with Fire\" *Byron \"Mr. Talkbox\" Chambers \u2013 synthesizer, talk box *Chris DeStefano \u2013 banjo, bass guitar, drums, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, steel guitar, keyboards, piano, programming, background vocals *Sean Douglas \u2013 background vocals *Paul Franklin \u2013 steel guitar *Jesse Frasure \u2013 programming *Teddy Geiger \u2013 bass guitar *Dann Huff \u2013 electric guitar, soloist *Charlie Judge \u2013 keyboards *Tori Kelly \u2013 vocals on \"Die a Happy Man\" (The Remix) *Chris Kimmerer \u2013 drums *LunchMoney Lewis \u2013 vocals on \"I Feel Good\" *Joe London \u2013 bass guitar, electric guitar, keyboards, programming *Rob McNelley \u2013 electric guitar *Charlie Puth \u2013 keyboards and background vocals on \"I Feel Good\" *Danny Rader \u2013 acoustic guitar *Thomas Rhett \u2013 lead vocals *Jimmie Lee Sloas \u2013 bass guitar *Jordin Sparks \u2013 vocals on \"Playing with Fire\" *Matt Stanfield \u2013 keyboards *Chris Stapleton \u2013 electric guitar, background vocals *Russell Terrell \u2013 background vocals *Derek Wells \u2013 electric guitar == Charts == === Album === ==== Weekly charts ==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015\u201317) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 77 |- |- |- |- |- |} ====Year-end charts==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard 200 | 21 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top Country Albums (Billboard) | 7 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard 200 | 59 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top Country Albums (Billboard) | 9 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard 200 | 159 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top Country Albums (Billboard) | 19 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top Country Albums (Billboard) | 24 |} ====Decade-end charts==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2010\u20132019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard 200 | 169 |} === Singles === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Single ! colspan=\"5\"| Peak chart positions |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US Hot Country ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US Country Airplay ! style=\"width:45px;\"| US ! style=\"width:45px;\"| CAN Country ! style=\"width:45px;\"| CAN |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 2015 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Crash and Burn\" | 2 | 1 | 36 | 1 | 47 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Die a Happy Man\" | 1 | 1 | 21 | 1 | 35 |- | rowspan=\"3\"| 2016 ! scope=\"row\"| \"T-Shirt\" | 3 | 1 | 41 | 1 | 53 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Vacation\" | 19 | 30 | 101 | 39 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Star of the Show | 4 | 1 | 45 | 1 | 77 |- | colspan=\"9\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart |} ==Certifications== == References == Category:2015 albums Category:Thomas Rhett albums Category:Big Machine Records albums Category:Albums produced by Dann Huff Category:Albums produced by Jesse Frasure Category:Albums produced by Lindsay Rimes ",
