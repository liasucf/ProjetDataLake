    "text": "ABC is the second studio album by the Jackson 5 and was issued on May 8, 1970, by Motown Records. It featured the No. 1 singles, \"ABC\" and \"The Love You Save\". Also present on the LP are several notable album tracks including a cover of Funkadelic's \"I'll Bet You\", \"I Found That Girl\" (the only lead song from brother Jermaine), and \"The Young Folks\" originally recorded by the Diana Ross-led version of the Supremes. The album peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Pop Albums Chart and at No. 1 on the Billboard Black Albums chart. It was named No. 98 on the VH1 All-Time Albums Top 100. It remains one of the Jackson 5's most popular efforts selling over 5.7 million copies worldwide. This number, however, may represent strongly overstated sales figures explained by Motown striving for higher publicity and marketing effects.Chery, Carl: XXL: Michael Jackson Special Collectors Edition, page 99. American Press. ==Re- release== In 2001, Motown Records remastered all J5 albums in a \"Two Classic Albums/One CD\" series (much like they did in the late 1980s). This album was paired up with Diana Ross Presents the Jackson 5. The bonus track was an outtake, \"Oh, I've Been Blessed\", a song also released on the rare 1979 outtakes album Boogie. An alternate version of the title track appears on the CD Jackson 5 \u2013 I Want You Back!
