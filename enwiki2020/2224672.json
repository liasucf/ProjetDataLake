He became professor at the \u00c9cole de Guerre Navale. In 1919, he was tasked with reorganising the historical services of the French Navy, and in 1928, he was promoted to contre-amiral. On 2 July 1936, he was made a grand officer of the Legion of Honour. The same year, he founded the Institut des hautes \u00e9tudes de la d\u00e9fense nationale, which he headed until 1939. He rose to vice-amiral in 1937>and finished his career heading the naval forces of the Northern fleet. ==Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes de la D\u00e9fense Nationale== One of his main achievements was the creation of the Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes de la D\u00e9fense Nationale (IHEDN, Institute of Higher Studies of National Defence), which aimed to reduce the intellectual gap between civilian and military officials. ==Theories== Between 1929 and 1939, Castex wrote Th\u00e9ories strat\u00e9giques, which analysed the link between land and naval warfare and argued for a national \"gravity centre\", which, in the case of France, would be situated outside Europe. He argued that the \"gravity centre\" should have been displaced to Northern Africa before 1939, with installation of main armament factories and government centres. In 1939, Castex suggested granting independence to French Indochina, which he deemed indefensible against the Japanese Empire, and to Syria and Lebanon, which were then under French mandate, to make allies out of them. In 1955, Castex published an article in the Revue de la d\u00e9fense nationale (\"Review of National Defence\"), La Russie, rempart de l'Occident (\"Russia, Wall of the West\"). There, he seemed to predict the rise of China and its upcoming rivalry with the West, including Russia. ==Works== * Le Grand \u00c9tat-major naval, question militaire d'actualit\u00e9 (1909) * Les Id\u00e9es militaires de la marine du XVIIIe.
