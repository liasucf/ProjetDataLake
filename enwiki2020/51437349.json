All of the band members have been influenced by pop punk and punk artists while vocalist Tobi Duncan's interests in hardcore punk and metal music and Bostock's ska influence have also shaped the group's sound. The band have also cited influences from bands such as Have Heart, Trophy Eyes, Turnstile, La Dispute, Can't Swim, Movements, Title Fight, the Misfits, the Sex Pistols, Rise Against, Thrice, Blink-182 and Sum 41. Duncan has cited the poets W. B. Yeats and Emily Bront\u00eb as a major influence on his lyric writing. Alternative Press described them as bringing a \"queer edge to melodic hardcore\", through their use of interchanging gender pronouns, reflecting Duncan's bisexuality. ==Band members== *Tobi Duncan \u2013 lead vocals (2014\u2013present) *Dann Bostock \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals (2014\u2013present) *Ryan Hyslop \u2013 lead guitar (2014\u2013present) *James Grayson \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals (2014\u2013present) *Oakley Moffatt \u2013 drums (2014\u2013present) ==Discography== ;Studio albums {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\"| Title ! scope=\"col\"| Album details |- |- ! scope=\"row\"|Nothing I Write You Can Change What You've Been Through | * Released: * Label: Hopeless * Format: CD, DL, LP |- ! scope=\"row\"|Crown Shyness | * Released: * Label: Hopeless * Format: CD, DL, LP |} ;Extended plays {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\"| Title ! scope=\"col\"| Album details |- ! scope=\"row\"| Look Alive | * Released: 23 June 2014 * Label: Self-released * Format: DL |- ! scope=\"row\"| Brainwork | * Released: 18 May 2015 * Label: Hopeless * Format: DL |} ;Singles {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !scope=col | Title !scope=col | Year !scope=col | Album |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Boneless\" | 2014 | Look Alive |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Perspective\" | 2015 | Brainwork |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Shade\" |rowspan=\"3\"| 2018 |rowspan=\"3\"| Crown Shyness |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Inside Out\" |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Old Soul\" |} ;Music videos {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !scope=col | Title !scope=col | Year !scope=col | Director |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Boneless\" |rowspan=\"3\"| 2015 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Perspective\" | Richard Dimery |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Eleven\" | Ian Coulson |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Strangers (feat.
