    "text": "The Dhangar or Gavli is a herding caste of people found in the Indian states of Maharashtra, Goa and Uttar Pradesh. They are scattered over all the 35 districts of Maharashtra. The Dhangars consist of 22 endogamous groups. The Dange Dhangars found in the coastal strip are pastoral people and practise shifting cultivation, the Hatkar and a few others are Shepherds, the Sangars are weavers of woollen blankets, the Khatik Dhangars sell meat, but do not rear sheep, and the Khutekars rear sheep and weave. In the past, some Dhangars were Inamdars and some were tenure-holders, holding lands either by a share or by paying a lump sum for a certain period. Depiction of a Dhangar tribal in the past. Gavli are a sub-caste of Dhangar. They are found in forested hill tracts of India's Western Ghats. Dhangars in Goa are referred to as Gouly or Gavli. Yadavas of Devagiri or Seuna Yadavas are called \"Gavli Kings\". Like Hoysala Yadavas, Seunas Yadavas were also originally pastoralists or cattle- herders. The Yadavas often proudly claimed their pastoral ancestry. According to M. S. A. Rao, present-day Yadav comprise of different allied castes of several denominations such as Ahirs in Punjab, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Gujarat, Thetwars and Raots in Madhya Pradesh, Gawlis or Gopals in Maharashtra, Idaiyan in Tamil Nadu, Golla in Andhra Pradesh and Mysore, Gopas in Bengal. Among other denominations are Gwal, Dhanpal, Dhangar, Nanda and Dhinderd. However, Gawli caste of Maharashtra is distinct from Dhangar. Gawlis tend cows and other milch cattle. According to Shyam Singh Shashi, Marathas of Indore (Holkar) call themselves Dhangar Ahir and Ahirs of Maharashtra prefer to be known as Ahir Dhangars - Ahir is one of the gotra of Dhangars. In North India the Ahirs, who call themselves Yadav, were at one time a wing of Dhangar society - which includes Gadaria in North India and Kuruba both in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. He further states that 80 percent of gotras of Dhangars are similar to kshatriyas though 15 percent resembles those of Brahmins, Vaishyas and backward classes. ==Etymology== The word \"Dhangar\" may be associated with a term for \"cattle wealth\" or be derived from the hills in which they lived (Sanskrit \"dhang\"). Ul Hassan noted that some people of his time believed the term to come from the Sanskrit \"dhenugar\" (\"cattle herder\") but dismissed that etymology as being \"fictitious\". ==History== The archaeological evidence and ethnographic data suggest that the contemporary Dhangar castes are the result of more than one migration from North-West India, between 4000 and 10000 BC. The density and distribution patterns of the different groups of Dhangars seem to have been guided by the suitability of the region for the sustenance of the animals that they traditionally maintained and the products of those animals on which the specific groups subsisted. Ethno-historic investigations among the Dhangars suggest that, out of 22 endogamous groups, the Kannade, Unnikankan and Kurmar who speak Kannada were originally from Karnataka and might have migrated to the present habitats in Maharashtra at different points of time. Whereas Hatkar, Zende, Thellari and Dange trace their origin to a single caste in the remote past, Shegars claim that they have nothing to do with the Dhangars and are descendents from Rajputs of Rajasthan. Ahirs who speak \"Ahrani\" a mixed dialect of Gujarati and Marathi and are closely related to the Ladshe and Dange who have supposedly come from Gujarat. On the other hand, Gadhari-Nikhar and Gadhari-Dhangar, having migrated from North India, speak Hindi. Telangi speaks Telugu and probably migrated from Andhra Pradesh, the remaining groups speak Marathi. The Khatiks are said to have derived from Khutekars. Reginald Edward Enthoven classifies Dhangars into 23 sub-castes. Out of which Asal Dhangars or Maratha Dhangars who form an important element in the Dhangar population are the representatives of the original Dhangars who settled in the Marathi speaking districts. Another large sub-caste Hatkar is of considerable importance in Berar. They claim to be Bargi Dhangar or \"shepherds with the spears\". They also claim to be Marathas and were perhaps Bargirs or mounted troopers during the time of the Maratha Empire. Enthoven further states that Dhangars were noted for their martial qualities. Shivaji's most trusted Mawalas or Maratha footmen were West-Pune Dhangars, and many of the bravest Maratha leaders, among whom the Holkars are the most distinguished. In 1798, Colonel Tone, who commanded a regiment of the Peshwa's army, wrote of the Marathas: \"The three great tribes which compose the Maratha caste are the Kunbi or farmer, The Dhangar or shepherd, and the Gwala or cowherd; to this original cause may perhaps be ascribed that great simplicity of manner which distinguishes the Maratha people\". ==Varna status== Dhangars regard themselves as belonging to the Kshatriya varna and to support this they give the example of the role played by the Holkar dynasty in Maratha history. This is also reflected in their social relations and day-to-day behavior with Schedule Castes. Thus, as far as the various sub-castes of the Dhangars in Maharashtra are concerned, they themselves claim to belong to a Hindu Caste cluster just below the hierarchical status of the Maratha Kunbi - peasants or farmers. Dhangars employ Brahmins for religious and ceremonial purposes, and these Brahmins are received on terms of equality by other Brahmins. When Brahmins are not easily available, the elders of the caste perform the ceremonies. The marriage ceremonies of Dhangars do not differ much from those of Kunbis. According to Gail Omvedt and Bharat Patankar, The group considering themselves \"highest\" in the Other Backward Class category are mainly the peasant castes (Jats and Kurmis in north India, Kunbis in Maharashtra, Vellalar in south India, etc), close to these are the herding (Yadav, Dhangars, Kuruba) and gardening (Mali, Sainis) communities. Ranging below these are the various artisan and service groups \u2013 goldsmiths, blacksmiths, potters, barbers, washermen etc. Ambedkar had described caste as a \"graded hierarchy\" with an ascending ladder of status and a descending degree of contempt. Phule had talked of how the \"ignorant Kunbi looked down on the ignorant Mahar, the ignorant Mahar scorned the ignorant Mang\" \u2013 these were expressions of this hierarchy of caste, in which every group tried to claim a higher status than another. ==Current situation== Traditionally being shepherds, cowherds, buffalo keepers, blanket and wool weavers, butchers and farmers, the Dhangars were late to take up modern-day education. In Maharashtra, the Dhangars are classified as a Nomadic Tribe but in 2014 were seeking to be reclassified as a Scheduled Tribe in India's system of reservation. The Dhangar community's population in Maharashtra is around one crore (ten million), which is 9% of the total 11.25 crore (112.5 million) population of the state. Devendra Fadnavis, former Chief Minister of Maharashtra, had said that \"The situation of the Dhangars in some areas of the state was worse than that of Scheduled Tribes, and the government was committed to providing them reservation under the ST category\". In Goa, they are classified as Other Backward Classes category in India's system of reservation. ==Dhangad vs Dhangar issue in Uttar Pradesh== According to the 2011 Census of India, Dhangad or Oraon or Dhanka people are listed as Scheduled Tribes in the states of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa. However, In Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal Dhangad or Dom is listed as Scheduled Caste whereas Oraon as Scheduled Tribe. In Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand Dhangar is classified as Scheduled Caste. On 17th January 2019, the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Research and Training Institute (SCSTRTI) wrote a letter to the Principal Secretary to the Government of Uttar Pradesh stating that the Hindi version of the word Dhangar is Dhangad as per the Gazette notification issued in 1950 by the President/Indian Government. They recommended that the Gaderia community's Dhangar should not be included in the Scheduled Caste category. Dhangar is a sub-caste of the Gadaria caste in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, the Kuruba caste in Karnataka and the Bharwad caste in Gujarat. Gadaria or Gaderia, Kuruba and Bharwad are classified as Other Backward Class in those respective states, including Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, in India's system of reservation. ==Culture== Khandoba (literally \"father swordsman\"), the guardian deity of the Deccan is the favorite god of the caste and is worshipped every Sunday and on Saturday (the light sixth of Margashirsha) day, with offerings of sweetmeats. Vithoba of Pandharpur is worshipped daily in every household. ==Subdivisions== Initially there were twelve tribes of Dhangar, and they had a division of labour amongst brothers of one family. This later formed three sub-divisions and one half-division. These three being Hatkar (shepherds), Ahir (cowherds) and Khutekar (wool and blanket weavers)/Sangar. The half-division is called Khatik. All sub-castes fall in either of these divisions. All sub-divisions emerge from one stock, and all sub-divisions claim to be a single group of Dhangars. The number three and a half is not a random selection but has a religious and cosmological significance.G.D. Sontheimer, The Dhangars: a community in a developing agricultural environment; G.D. Sontheimer and L.S. Leshnik, eds., Pastoralists and Nomads in South Asia, Wiesbaden, 1975, p. 140. All Dhangars of Western Maharashtra and Konkan/Desh regions (formerly Marhatta country), like Holkars who were Dhangar, can be termed \"Marathas\", but not all Marathas are Dhangars. ==References== ==Further reading== * Baviskar, B.S., \"Co-operatives and caste in Maharashtra: A case study\".
