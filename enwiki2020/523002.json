The acquisition was completed in December 1995 and gave U.S. Bancorp of Oregon its first entry into the state of Utah. As part of the acquisition deal, West One's chairman and chief executive Daniel R. Nelson would become the chief operating officer and president of U.S. Bancorp and he would later be Cameron's successor as chairman and CEO upon Cameron's planned retirement in three years. Since both U.S. Bancorp and West One had overlapping territories in Oregon and Washington, the U.S. Justice Department would only allow the acquisition to proceed if U.S. Bancorp would sell off 27 branch offices in Washington and Oregon. As a result of the regulatory ruling, U.S. Bancorp sold 25 branch offices in Oregon, four in central Washington and one in Idaho to First Hawaiian Bank for $38 million in cash.

At the time of the announcement, U.S. Bancorp of Oregon had banking offices in Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho and Utah while First Bank System had banking offices in Minnesota, Colorado, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin, Kansas, and Wyoming. Under the terms of the acquisition, First Bank System would be renamed U.S. Bancorp with the headquarters for the newly combined company being at First Bank's existing headquarters in Minneapolis. John F. Grundhofer, chairman and chief executive of First Bank, was appointed president and chief executive of the new company while Gerry B. Cameron, chairman, and chief executive of U.S. Bancorp of Oregon, was appointed chairman of the new company, which he held until his retirement in 1998. The acquisition was completed in August 1997. Approximately 4000 jobs were eliminated, mostly in Portland. ====Brief history of First Bank prior to acquisition==== First Bank System can trace its roots back to the formation of First National Bank of Minneapolis in 1864. In 1929, the First National Bank of Minneapolis joined together with the First National Bank of St. Paul to form a joint holding company for both banks that was called the First Bank Stock Corporation while keeping both subsidiary banks legally separate. The new holding company quickly grew by acquiring other banks in the four-state region before the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 prohibited such actions. First Bank Stock Corporation was renamed First Bank Stock Corporation Inc. in 1968. ====U.S. Bancorp after takeover by First Bank System==== In September 1997, the new U.S. Bancorp, formerly First Bank System, announced the pending acquisition of the St. Cloud, Minnesota-based Zappco, Inc. with its three banks and six banking locations for an undisclosed amount. At the time of the announcement, U.S. Bancorp had more than 1,000 banking offices in the states of Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, California, Idaho, Nebraska, North Dakota, Nevada, South Dakota, Montana, Iowa, Illinois, Utah, Wisconsin, Kansas, and Wyoming. The acquisition was completed in December 1997. In March 1998, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the Vancouver, Washington-based Northwest Bancshares with its 10-branch offices Northwest National Bank subsidiary for an undisclosed amount. In October 1998, the U.S. Justice Department agreed to allow the acquisition to proceed on the condition that one of the Northwest National Bank branch offices was to be sold. The acquisition was completed in December 1998 after U.S. Bancorp sold the request banking office to Centennial Bank of Eugene. At the end of 1998, Gerry Cameron retired as chairman and handed the position over to John Grundhofer who added the title of chairman to his other positions of president and chief executive officer. In February 1999, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the San Diego-based Bank of Commerce with its 10 branch offices for $314 million in stock. The acquisition was finalized in July 1999. In May 1999, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the Newport Beach, California-based Western Bancorp with its Santa Monica Bank and Southern California Bank subsidiaries and a total of 31 branch offices for $904 million in stock. Alternate Link via ProQuest. At the time of the announcement, U.S. Bancorp had 98 branch offices within California. The acquisition was finalized in November 1999 for $1.04 billion in stock. In July 1999, Philip G. Heasley was appointed president and chief operating officer of U.S. Bancorp. John Grundhofer had handed over the position of president to Heasley while still retaining the titles of chairman and chief executive officer. Heasley had assisted Grundhofer in turning the company around from near insolvency when the company was originally known as First Bank until it became a successful financial institution that became large enough to be absorb other banks, including U.S. Bancorp of Oregon in 1997. Heasley resigned the following year to join Bank One as the head of their First USA credit card unit around the same time Firstar was about to takeover U.S. Bancorp. In September 1999, U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of the San Diego-based Peninsula Bank with its 11 branch offices for $104 million in stock. In early January 2000, a group of Peninsula Bank stockholders tried to stop the merger because the initial merger agreement was made prior to the huge 27% single-day drop in the value of U.S. Bancorp stock which effectively lowered the purchase price. The acquisition was later completed in January 2000 at a 10% reduction of the original price negotiated. In June 2000, U.S. Bancorp announced the acquisition of the San Diego-based Scripps Financial Corporation with its nine-branch office Scripps Bank subsidiary for $155 million in stock. The acquisition was completed in October 2000. ===Firstar era=== In October 2000, Firstar Corporation of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, announced the pending acquisition of U.S. Bancorp of Minneapolis, Minnesota, for $21 billion in stock. Firstar completed its buyout of U.S. Bancorp on February 27, 2001, and changed its name to U.S. Bancorp. Under the merger agreement, Jerry Grundhofer, president and chief executive officer of Firstar, would continue in those positions in the combined company while his older brother, John Grundhofer, chairman, president and chief executive officer of U.S. Bancorp, would serve as chairman of the board in the combined company until his planned retirement on December 31, 2002. Though some administrative functions would remain in Milwaukee and Cincinnati, it was decided that the new combined company would be based in Minneapolis and that the new company would use the U.S. Bancorp name. To allow the merger to proceed, the U.S. Department of Justice required Firstar to sell 11 branch offices in the Minneapolis-area and 2 in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Bremer Bank of Saint Paul, Minnesota, purchased the 11 Minneapolis-area Firstar offices while Liberty Bank of West Des Moines, Iowa, purchased the 2 Council Bluffs offices. ====Brief history of Firstar prior to acquisition==== Although the origin of the Milwaukee-based Firstar Corporation can be traced back to the founding of the Farmer's and Millers Bank in Milwaukee in 1853 and the later formation of the First Wisconsin National Bank in 1919, the actual company that took over U.S. Bancorp in 2001 is the actually the same company and leadership that was responsible for the takeover of Firstar 27 months earlier in 1998, namely Star Banc Corporation. That bank, in turn, traced its roots to the founding of First National Bank of Cincinnati in 1863. Jerry Grundhofer and his team from Star Banc were instrumental in both acquisitions. Present-day U.S. Bancorp retains Star Banc's pre-1998 stock price history, and as mentioned above operates under the charter originally granted to First National Bank of Cincinnati. Additionally, all SEC filings before 1998 are under Star Banc, and all filings from 1998 to 2000 are under Firstar. ====U.S. Bancorp after takeover by Firstar==== In April 2001, the new U.S. Bancorp announced the pending acquisition of all 20 branch offices in California of the Encino-based Pacific Century Bank from its Honolulu-based parent Pacific Century Financial Corporation.

In May 2004, U.S. Bancorp announced that it was acquiring the $34 billion corporate trust bond administration business from National City Corporation. In October 2004, Richard K. Davis was appointed chief operating officer and president of U.S. Bancorp. Jerry Grundhofer had handed over the position of president to Davis while still retaining the titles of chairman and chief executive officer. Davis had been a protege of Grundhofer since their days together at Star Banc Corporation and had assisted in the takeover of Firstar by Star Banc in 1998 and the later acquisition of U.S. Bancorp by Firstar in 2001.

Since the company did not have a previous presence in Texas nor want one in the near future, the company subsequently sold the three banks in Texas in 2010 to Houston-based Prosperity Bancshares for an undisclosed amount. Each of the banks had one office each. In October 2009, BB&T; Corporation (now Truist Financial) announced the pending sale of its Nevada banking operations to U.S. Bancorp for an undisclosed amount. BB&T; had just acquired the 21 offices in Nevada through a transaction facilitated by the FDIC for disposal of the assets and deposits of the failed Alabama-based Colonial BancGroup but BB&T; had no desire to expand west of Texas while it wanted to keep the other Colonial former locations in the Southeastern United States.

Davis officially retired from the company in April 2018 and handed over the chairmanship position to Cecere. In February 2018, the bank was charged by the Department of Justice with failing to implement measures preventing illegal activities, including one case of abetting them. To defer prosecution, U.S. Bancorp agreed to pay $613 million in fines and agreed to implement measures to show the authorities that it had improved the monitoring of its customer transactions. $505 million was distributed in September 2018 to customers of an illegal payday loan business whose suspicious activities US Bancorp had failed to report.

After an unsuccessful attempt to release the funds, James met Eugenio at the gas station during her break and offered him $20 from her own pocket as a Christmas Eve act of kindness. She was fired from her job, despite U.S. Bankcorp's policy that \"Our employees are empowered to do the right thing.\" After Nicolas Kristof published a critique of the firing in The New York Times the bank agreed to rehire the employees. ==Notable corporate buildings== *U.S. Bank Center in Phoenix, Arizona *U.S. Bank Tower in Sacramento, California *One California in San Francisco, California, sports the U.S. Bank logo and houses bank offices *U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles, California, the third tallest building west of the Mississippi River *U.S. Bank Tower in Denver, Colorado *U.S. Bank Plaza in Boise, Idaho *U.S. Bank Building in Chicago, Illinois *U.S. Bank Building in Davenport, Iowa *U.S. Bank Building in Duluth, Minnesota *U.S. Bancorp Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota *U.S. Bank Plaza in Minneapolis, Minnesota *U.S. Bank Center in St. Paul, Minnesota *One U.S. Bank Plaza in St. Louis, Missouri *U.S. Bank Building in Billings, Montana *U.S. Bank Tower in Lincoln, Nebraska *U.S. Bank Center in Las Vegas, Nevada *U.S. Bank Tower in Cincinnati, Ohio *U.S. Bank Centre in Cleveland, Ohio *U.S. Bancorp Tower in Portland, Oregon *U.S. Bank Building in Sioux Falls, South Dakota *U.S. Bank Centre in Seattle, Washington * U.S. Bank Building in Spokane, Washington *U.S. Bank Building in La Crosse, Wisconsin *U.S. Bank Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin *U.S. Bank Plaza in Madison, Wisconsin ==Naming rights and Sponsorships== U.S. Bank owns corporate naming rights to the following: *U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota U.S. Bank is a sponsor of: * Denver Broncos \u2013 Official Bank of the Denver Broncos. * Minnesota Vikings \u2013 Official Bank of the Minnesota Vikings. * San Francisco 49ers \u2013 Official Bank of the San Francisco 49ers. * Utah Jazz \u2013 Official Bank of the Utah Jazz. * NHL \u2013 Official Partner of the NHL. ==See also== * John F.
