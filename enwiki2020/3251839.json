It has a population of 3,200 residents (as of March 2014), and is the first Gozitan village that greets the visitor on leaving M\u0121arr Harbour towards the Gozitan heartland. Its name originated from the water spring, around which in 1700, Grandmaster Perellos built an arcade containing public wash basins and fresh water spouts. Attractions include Lourdes Chapel with its sharp steeple and underlying niche of Our Lady of Lourdes, Fort Chambray and the towering of Ghajnsielem Parish Church. ==Village Motto and Coat of Arms== The Latin motto of Ghajnsielem is Ob fontem prosperitas, that is Flourishing because of a spring \u2013 Nistaghna b\u2019nixxiegha ilma.
