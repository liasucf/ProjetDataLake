He was mainly active at the municipal foundry of the Hanseatic city of L\u00fcbeck and in his later life in Copenhagen. Most famous is his Pulsglocke for St. Mary's Church, L\u00fcbeck cast in 1669. It was destroyed during the British air raid on L\u00fcbeck in 1942 and since then has served as a war memorial. His baroque cannons are on exhibit in major army and history museums in Europe, (for example, the Zeughaus in Berlin (Deutsches Historisches Museum), the T\u00f8jhus Museum in Copenhagen, the Legermuseum in Delft, the Artillery Museum in Saint Petersburg and the Museum of Military History, Vienna).
