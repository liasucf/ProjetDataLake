    "text": "\"Getting Closer\" is a rock song from the British\u2013American rock band Wings, Paul McCartney's post-Beatles band. The song was released on the album Back to the Egg. ==Background== Despite being released in 1979, Paul McCartney wrote \"Getting Closer\" in 1974, recording a piano demo for the song later that year. Upon being resurrected by the band for Back to the Egg, the song, originally at a slower tempo, was transformed into a \"driving rocker.\" Like most of the songs off of Back to the Egg, \"Getting Closer\" bears an influence from punk and new wave music.McCartney: Songwriter p. 122 Author and Mojo contributor Tom Doyle describes Wings' version as \"power-popping\" and reminiscent of the English band Squeeze.Doyle, p. 174 Juber said of the guitars used in the song: \"I think I played my Martin D28 on the rhythm track and some Les Paul Custom (the one in the video) for the electric.\" ==Personnel== *Paul McCartney \u2013 vocals, bass, electric guitar, Mellotron *Linda McCartney \u2013 keyboards, backing vocals *Denny Laine \u2013 electric guitar, backing vocals *Laurence Juber \u2013 electric guitar *Steve Holley \u2013 drums ==Release== \"Getting Closer,\" backed with \"Spin It On,\" was released in the US in June 1979 as the first single from Back to the Egg. The single reached #20 on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as #20 on Cashbox and #22 on Record World. Despite not being released as the first single in the UK (\"Old Siam, Sir\" was used instead), the song did see a UK single release in August 1979. Marketed as a Double A-side with \"Baby's Request,\" the single was a relative flop, only peaking at #60. For the release of Back to the Egg, a special was made featuring music videos for multiple songs, including \"Getting Closer.\" \"Old Siam, Sir\", \"Spin It On\" and \"Arrow Through Me\" were among the tracks for which videos were made. Billboard Magazine described \"Getting Closer\" as \"an uplifting raker in which McCartney's soaring vocals play off strong guitar, keyboards and drum lines.\" ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1979) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) | style=\"text-align:center;\" |57 |- |Canada (RPM) | style=\"text-align:center;\" |18 |- |Irish Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\" |24 |- |Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) | style=\"text- align:center;\" |29 |- |UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|60 |- |US Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|20 |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Chart (1979) !Rank |- |Canada (RPM) |align=\"center\"|127 |- |US (Joel Whitburn's Pop Annual) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|136 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:Paul McCartney songs Category:1979 singles Category:Wings (band) songs Category:Songs written by Paul McCartney Category:Columbia Records singles Category:Parlophone singles Category:Song recordings produced by Paul McCartney Category:Song recordings produced by Chris Thomas (record producer) Category:Music published by MPL Music Publishing ",
