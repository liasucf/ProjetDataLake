    "text": "Uthman bin Madh'oon () (may also be spelled as Uthman bin Maz'oon) was one of the companions of Muhammad. ==Biography== He was married to Khawlah bint Hakim, both being two of the earliest converts to Islam. According to Ibn Ishaq, he led a group of Muslims to Abyssinia in the first migration which some of the early Muslims undertook to escape persecution in Mecca. He was also a cousin of Umayyah ibn Khalaf. There is a narration that, out of religious devotion, Uthman bin Madh'oon decided to dedicate himself from prayer and take a vow of chastity from his wife. His wife spoke to the Prophet Muhammad about this, and the Prophet gently reminded Uthman that he himself, as the Prophet, also had a family life, and that Uthman had a responsibility to his family and should not adopt monasticism as a form of religious practice. He died in the 3rd year after the hijrah and was either the first companion or the first Muhajir (immigrant to Medina) to be buried in the cemetery of Baqi' (Jannat al-Baqi) in Medina. ==See also== *Islam ==References== Category:Companions of the Prophet Category:624 deaths Category:Quraysh ",
