    "text": "The 2005 election for Mayor of Los Angeles took place on March 8, 2005, with a run-off election on May 17, 2005. In a rematch of the 2001 election, Councilman Antonio Villaraigosa defeated the sitting mayor, James Hahn, becoming the city's first Hispanic mayor since the 19th century. == Background == Philanthropist Eli Broad endorsed Hahn. State Senator Gil Cedillo, Councilman Eric Garcetti, and Councilman Cindy Miscikowski, who all endorsed Villaraigosa in 2001, switched sides and endorsed Hahn. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger promised Hahn that he would not participate in the election. As such, Schwarzenegger did not endorse any candidates, however he has expressed broad support for Hertzberg's plan to break up the Los Angeles Unified School District. And his Education Secretary, and former mayor of Los Angeles, Richard Riordan campaigned heavily for Hertzberg.Gold, Matea; McGreevy, Patrick (February 26, 2005). \"Hertzberg Gets a Lift From Gov\". Los Angeles Times. Retrieved May 22, 2010. ==Results== Although Villaraigosa garnered the plurality of votes in the general election, his lack of an outright majority forced a special election between him and the incumbent Hahn. With less than 34% of registered voters participating, Villaraigosa won the runoff. With his election, Villaraigosa became the first Latino mayor of Los Angeles since 1872. ===Primary election=== ===General election=== ==References and footnotes== ==External links== * Office of the City Clerk, City of Los Angeles Mayoral election, 2005 Category:2005 California elections 2005 Los Angeles ",
