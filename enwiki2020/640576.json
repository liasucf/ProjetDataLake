    "text": "The area covered by the Essex Senior League is coloured in teal. The Essex Senior Football League is an English men's football league. It contains clubs from the Essex FA, Hertfordshire FA, London FA, Middlesex FA and the Amateur Football Alliance. It is a feeder league to Division One North of the Isthmian League and has a single division which sits at Step 5 (or Level 9) of the National League System. ==Founder members== The Essex Senior League was formed in 1971 with nine founder members. The finishing positions for the 1971\u201372 season were as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- |1 |Witham Town |- |2 |Billericay Town |- |3 |Pegasus Athletic |- |4 |Tiptree United |- |5 |Saffron Walden Town |- |6 |Basildon United |- |7 |Heybridge Swifts |- |8 |Southend United 'A' |- |9 |Stansted |} ==Promotion and relegation== The Essex Senior League state that a club must finish in the top 3 to be considered for promotion to the Isthmian League Division One North. However the process is governed by the FA Leagues Committee who regulate relegations and promotions throughout the National League System. As of the 2014\u201315 season FA rules for Step 5 divisions such as the Essex Senior League stipulate that the champions should be offered the first chance of promotion. If the champions do not wish to be promoted or are not able to meet the entry requirements for promotion then the 2nd or 3rd placed team may be considered for promotion. Under normal circumstances, only one club can be promoted from a Step 5 league (i.e. the Essex Senior League) to a Step 4 league (i.e. the Isthmian League Division One). In exchange for the promoted club, the Essex Senior League would typically receive a relegated club from a Step 4 league. Relegated clubs of Step 4 leagues are allocated an appropriate league based on their geographical locations. Thus the Essex Senior League is most likely to receive one of the relegated clubs from the Isthmian League Division One North. There was no relegation from the Essex Senior League into a lower league since there was no Step 6 equivalent to the ESL until the 2017\u201318 season. Leagues including the Essex Olympian League (Step 7) sometimes acted as a feeder league to the Essex Senior League but promotion and relegation between the two leagues was not automatic. A Step 6 division for Essex and East Anglia was announced in October 2017 to solve the relegation problem. Starting in 2018\u201319, the Eastern Counties League controls this new division. ==Champions, runners up and third place finishers== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" !Season!!Winner!!Runners-up!!Third place |- |1971\u201372||Witham Town||Billericay Town||Pegasus Athletic |- |1972\u201373||Billericay Town||Basildon United||Stansted |- |1973\u201374||Saffron Walden Town||Billericay Town||Coggeshall Town |- |1974\u201375||Billericay Town||Basildon United||Coggeshall Town |- |1975\u201376||Billericay Town||Tiptree United||Basildon United |- |1976\u201377||Basildon United||Brentwood||Billericay Town |- |1977\u201378||Basildon United||Tiptree United||Ford United |- |1978\u201379||Basildon United||Canvey Island||Eton Manor |- |1979\u201380||Basildon United||Wivenhoe Town||Canvey Island |- |1980\u201381||Bowers United||Heybridge Swifts||Wivenhoe Town |- |1981\u201382||Heybridge Swifts||Wivenhoe Town||Brentwood |- |1982\u201383||Heybridge Swifts||Stansted||Halstead Town |- |1983\u201384||Heybridge Swifts||Bowers United||Witham Town |- |1984\u201385||Maldon Town||Witham Town||Stansted |- |1985\u201386||Witham Town||Wivenhoe Town||Ford United |- |1986\u201387||Canvey Island||Witham Town||Purfleet |- |1987\u201388||Purfleet||Brentwood||Halstead Town |- |1988\u201389||Brightlingsea United||East Thurrock United||Ford United |- |1989\u201390||Brightlingsea United||Woodford Town||East Thurrock United |- |1990\u201391||Southend Manor||Brentwood||Burnham Ramblers |- |1991\u201392||Ford United||Brentwood||East Thurrock United |- |1992\u201393||Canvey Island||Sawbridgeworth Town||Bowers United |- |1993\u201394||Basildon United||Ford United||Canvey Island |- |1994\u201395||Great Wakering Rovers||Sawbridgeworth Town||Romford |- |1995\u201396||Romford||Great Wakering Rovers||Concord Rangers |- |1996\u201397||Ford United||Great Wakering Rovers||Concord Rangers |- |1997\u201398||Concord Rangers||Basildon United||Bowers United |- |1998\u201399||Bowers United||Great Wakering Rovers||Saffron Walden Town |- |1999\u20132000||Saffron Walden Town||Southend Manor||Burnham Ramblers |- |2000\u201301||Brentwood||Saffron Walden Town||Barkingside |- |2001\u201302||Leyton||Enfield Town||Burnham Ramblers |- |2002\u201303||Enfield Town||Concord Rangers||Ilford |- |2003\u201304||Concord Rangers||Ilford||Sawbridgeworth Town |- |2004\u201305||Enfield Town||Burnham Ramblers||Waltham Abbey |- |2005\u201306||A.F.C.
