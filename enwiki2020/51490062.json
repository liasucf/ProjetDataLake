As a child, he relocated to Fort Lauderdale, Florida after his father found a better job there. In his youth, Isaac was a worship leader in church. ==Career== Isaac began his career in earnest after moving to Daytona Beach, Florida. He was invited by a friend to do some sessions with Flo Rida and would continue to work with him thereafter. That work eventually led Isaac to his first placement, \"Good Feeling.\" That song, which peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100, would later be released on Flo Rida's 2012 album, Wild Ones. Isaac co-wrote 4 songs on that album, including \"Good Feeling\" and \"Whistle\" the latter of which went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The following year, he co-wrote \"Timber\" by Pitbull featuring Kesha. That song would also top the Hot 100 chart and go multi-platinum in several countries. In 2015, he co-wrote Charlie Puth's \"One Call Away\" for which he would go on to win a BMI Pop Award (his fifth in as many years). In 2016 and 2017, he worked on a variety of movie soundtrack songs, including Lecrae's \"River of Jordan\" from The Shack, Nick Jonas and Nicki Minaj's \"Bom Bidi Bom\" from Fifty Shades Darker, and Lil Uzi Vert, Quavo, and Travis Scott's \"Go Off\" from The Fate of the Furious. In 2017, he worked on Damian Marley's \"Medication,\" the lead single off of his album, Stony Hill. The album would go on to win the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album in 2018. == Discography == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ Selected songs with production and songwriting credits ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" | Song name ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" style=\"width:2.5em;\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" | Primary artist(s) ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" | Album ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" | Role ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"1\" | Notes |- !scope=\"row\"|\"Whistle\" |rowspan=\"9\"|2012 |rowspan=\"3\"|Flo Rida |rowspan=\"5\"|Wild Ones |rowspan=\"4\"|Co-writer, Vocals |US No. 1 |- !scope=\"row\"|\"Good Feeling\" |US No. 3 |- !scope=\"row\"|\"Let It Roll\" |UK No. 17 |- !scope=\"row\"|\"Sweet Spot\" |Flo Rida (feat.
