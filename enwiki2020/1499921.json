The school is at the intersection of West First Street and North Beaudry Avenue. On March 25, 2008, the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education voted to name the school as Edward R. Roybal Learning Center for former Congressman Edward R. Roybal, who represented this area in Congress and whose daughter, Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, is representing the area. The attached park, named Vista Hermosa Park, opened on July 19, 2008. The first new public park in the downtown Los Angeles area since 1895, it was funded and developed in part by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy and is operated by the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority. The park contains a soccer field that is shared by the school and the surrounding community.New park a sight for sore eyesConservancy Opens New Park Near Downtown Los Angeles The school is part of LAUSD, and opened after years of controversy on Tuesday, September 2, 2008.Central LA HS #11, 55.98107 School Name: Edward R.

The northern part of the site had been within the Los Angeles City Oil Field, an industrial area which contained over 1,000 active oil wells around 1900, and a concern of soil contamination\u2014specifically, methane and hydrogen sulfide\u2014was confirmed during development in 1999. This resulted in a temporary halt to construction. In December 2000 Superintendent Roy RomerLA Times (2006) Generally Speaking, It's Right to Honor Romer saved the project and began reviewing private bids to address the additional issues at the site. In 2002, the \"Alliance for a Better Community\" was selected to finish the project.Alliance for a Better Community - History Further complicating the development, in September 2002 an earthquake fault was detected on the northeast portion of the plot.
