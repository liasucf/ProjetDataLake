    "text": "John Tucker Must Die is the official soundtrack album of the 2006 film John Tucker Must Die. It was released in July 2006 by Wind-up Records. ==Production== From 6 April 2006 to 24 April 2006, unsigned artists were allowed to submit their music for an online contest on MySpace called The John Tucker Must Die Undiscovered Band Contest. The winning band's song was eligible for inclusion in the movie and on the soundtrack. From these initial submissions, 20 semi-finalists were chosen by members of the MySpace staff. On 1 May 2006, those 20 bands relied on the support of their own fan bases, or MySpace 'friends,' to determine the top 10 finalists who were selected on 19 May 2006. The grand prize winner was chosen on 26 May 2006 by a panel of celebrity judges and music executives. Texas pop/punk band Rockett Queen's song \"Next Big Thing\" was chosen as the grand prize winner. The John Tucker Must Die Undiscovered Band Contest was hosted by Stefy Rae of the band Stefy. Stefy's Wind-up Records debut was released on 29 August 2006. Two songs from the female-fronted band Stefy were featured in the film as well as songs from The All-American Rejects, Nada Surf, Ben Lee, OK Go, People in Planes, and Motion City Soundtrack, among others. ==Track listing== #The All-American Rejects \u2013 \"Dirty Little Secret\" #Cartel \u2013 \"Honestly\" #Stefy \u2013 \"Chelsea\" #Rock Kills Kid \u2013 \"Hope Song\" #People in Planes \u2013 \"Instantly Gratified\" #Motion City Soundtrack \u2013 \"Better Open the Door\" #Quietdrive \u2013 \"Time After Time\" #Stefy \u2013 \"Fool for Love\" #OK Go \u2013 \"This Will Be Our Year\" #Nada Surf \u2013 \"I Like What You Say\" #Ben Lee \u2013 \"Float On\" #Josh Kelley \u2013 \"Sunset Lover\" #Caesars \u2013 \"We Got to Leave\" #Rockett Queen \u2013 \"The Next Big Thing\" #Hudson \u2013 \"Not Giving Up\" #Taxi Doll \u2013 \"Waiting\" ==References== Category:Comedy film soundtracks Category:2006 soundtrack albums Category:Wind-up Records soundtracks Category:Rock soundtracks ",
