He is best known for \"Pistol Packin' Mama,\" a 1944 hit that was one of the most popular recordings of the World War II years and later became a hit again with a cover by Bing Crosby and The Andrews Sisters. ==Biography== Born in Jacksonville, Texas, Dexter owned a bar in the 1930s and helped popularize the style of country music known as honky tonk.Russell, p. 235. He made his recording debut on November 28, 1936, for ARC Records.Russell, Pinson, p. 314. and he was probably the first artist to use the term \"honky tonk\" in a country song when he recorded \"Honky Tonk Blues\" at his first session.La Chapelle, p. 150. His tremendous hit \"Pistol Packin' Mama\" became the 1943 marching chorus of the New York Yankees. The 1943 movie of the same name, made by the Republic Pictures, gave Dexter close to $250,000 in royalties. Another hit from the 1940s was \"Guitar Polka\", which entered Billboard's list as the \"Most Played Juke Box Folk Record\" for 16 weeks running in 1946.Russell, p. 236. Still other hits include \"So Long Pal\", \"Triflin' Gal\", \"I'm Losing My Mind Over You\" and \"Too Late to Worry.\" Dexter was the first country singer to perform on Broadway, and in 1971, was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame. He died January 28, 1984, in Lewisville, Texas. On August 21, 2010, Dexter was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall Of Fame, located in Carthage, TX. Other inductees that night along with Dexter were George Jones and Ray Winkler. Following Al Dexter's death in 1984, his family discovered 50 master tapes containing studio recordings. In 2010, Al Dexter's son Carl Wayne Poindexter officially released the 3-disc CD box set entitled \"Al Dexter's Found Masters Volume 1\u20133\" on his independent record label, Al Dexter Estate Productions. This professionally produced collection contained digitally re- mastered studio recordings which were made by Dexter with various band lineups and configurations. ==Discography== ===Albums=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
