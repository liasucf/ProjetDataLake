    "text": "Eochaid Faebar Glas, son of Conm\u00e1el, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland. His epithet means \"blue- green sharp edge\".Dictionary of the Irish Language, Compact Edition, Royal Irish Academy, 1990, p. 290-291, 363 According to the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn, Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn and the Annals of the Four Masters, he came to power after killing the joint High King, Cermna Finn, in battle at D\u00fan Cermna (Downmacpatrick in Kinsale, County Cork), and Cermna's brother and colleague Sobairce was killed by Eochaid Menn of the Fomorians (another version of the Lebor Gab\u00e1la says he came to power at the end of a seven-year interregnum following the death of Tigernmas). He killed Smirgoll, grandson of Tigernmas, in the battle of Druimm Liath\u00e1in. He ruled for twenty years, until he was killed by Smirgoll's son Fiacha Labrainne in the battle of Carman. The Lebor Gab\u00e1la synchronises his reign with that of Piritiades in Assyria. Keating's chronology dates his reign to 1115\u20131095 BC, that of the Annals of the Four Masters to 1493\u20131473 BC.R. A.
