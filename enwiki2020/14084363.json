    "text": "Un Peu de l'\u00c2me des Bandits () is the second album by Belgian avant-rock band Aksak Maboul. It was recorded at Sunrise Studio in Kirchberg, Switzerland in February and August 1979, and released on LP in January 1980 on founding member Marc Hollander's Belgian independent record label, Crammed Discs. At the time the band had changed the spelling of their name to \"Aqsak Maboul\", and this is reflected on the album's record sleeve. When the album was re- issued on CD in 1995 (also on Crammed Discs) the spelling of their name reverted to \"Aksak Maboul\". In addition to the Aksak Maboul line-up at the time, the album also featured ex-Henry Cow musicians Fred Frith and Chris Cutler whose contribution and names helped bring the album to the attention of a wider audience. Aksak Maboul's co-founder, Vincent Kenis did not play on this album, although he did arrange two of the tracks. ==Background== The formation of Rock in Opposition (RIO) in 1978 brought together a number of like-minded European bands.See Rock in Opposition. Aksak Maboul was amongst the second wave of bands to join RIO and benefited from the collaborations it spawned. This album features three musicians from two other RIO bands, Michel Berckmans from Univers Zero, who had joined Aksak Maboul when they began performing live in 1978, and Fred Frith and Chris Cutler from Henry Cow, who were invited by Marc Hollander to participate in the recording. ==Content== Un Peu de l'Ame des Bandits is more intense and experimental than Aksak Maboul's first album, Onze Danses Pour Combattre la Migraine (1977). It comprises complex written sections as well as improvised ambient pieces. It uses sampling before samplers were invented and is a mixture of tangos, Turkish tunes, \"chamber rock\", noisy punk rock and pseudo-Var\u00e8se music. Like the first album, it is largely instrumental with a little singing and other vocals. Side A of the LP record contains five dance pieces. \"Modern Lesson\" begins as a \"twisted blues number\" with gibberish vocals over guitar, cello and saxophone, then switches to horn and string chamber music. It includes sounds from a pinball machine flipper as well as samples from every other track on the album. \"Tango\" was composed with \"hat, scissors and glue\" Un Peu de l'\u00c2me des Bandits liner notes. and features several popular tangos cut up and reassembled at random; the resulting \"opus\" was learnt and performed live in one take. \"I Viaggi Formano la Giovent\u00fa\" is an arrangement of a Turkish folk song featuring dumbeg and cello playing traditional scales. \"Inoculating Rabies\" is \"angry bassoon punk\" that is a composed bassoon and bass clarinet piece over a background of noisy rock guitar music. Side B is the 23-minute \"Cinema\" suite which includes four solos: six-string bass-guitar, acoustic cello, electric cello, and synthesizer. It contains \"dissonant woodwind passages, atonal psychedelic rock-outs, and snatches of Middle Eastern music\". The last section, \"Age Route Brra! (Radio Sofia)\", is an improvised imitation of a Bulgarian radio talk show. \"Cinema\" was well received in progressive rock circles, as was the album as a whole. ==Reception== AllMusic called it \"a pinnacle of the RIO movement\", while Gnosis said, \"Overall a very good album and one that is considered de rigueur for RIO fans.\" In their review of the album's 2018 reissue, Pitchfork criticized the album's \"[dis]regard for flow\" whilst saying that it does not come at \"the expense of exhilarating technicality\". The Quietus called it \"still great ... riotous and breathtaking\" in their review of the same. ==Track listing== On the original LP release, the track titles on the record sleeve and the vinyl label differ.
