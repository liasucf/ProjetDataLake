This name, which is in use at least in the nineteenth century, is indicated in particular on a map of the surveyor Henry O'Sullivan, drawn as a result of explorations carried out between 1897 and 1899. From the end of the seventeenth century, this Stream was used as one of the ordinary routes of travel between lakes Saint- Jean and Mistassini. Botanist Andr\u00e9 Michaux borrowed it in 1792. This watercourse is designated \"Shetshishkuesheu\" by the Innu commconverty, meaning \"river where there is shade\".\"Names and Places of Quebec\" work, work of the Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec, published in 1994 and 1996 under the form of a printed illustrated dictionary, and under that of a CD-ROM made by the company Micro-Intel, in 1997, from this dictionary.
