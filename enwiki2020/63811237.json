    "text": "Alison Roman (born September 1, 1985) is an American cook. She is the author of the cookbooks Dining In, published by Clarkson Potter in Fall 2017, and Nothing Fancy, published in October 2019 and a New York Times Bestseller. She was a senior food editor at Bon App\u00e9tit until leaving for Buzzfeed Food. She is a bi-weekly columnist for The New York Times Cooking section. Originally from Los Angeles, she currently lives in Brooklyn. She has posted recipes that went viral on Instagram, commonly called #TheStew and #TheCookies. Her recipes and online presence gained traction when home cooking increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. She previously worked as a pastry chef at Sona in Los Angeles, at Quince in San Francisco, and for Christina Tosi at Milk Bar in New York City. In May 2020, Roman was criticized on social media for an interview in which she made flippant remarks about the product lines of Chrissy Teigen and Marie Kondo, both of Asian descent. Critics highlighted the racial undertones in Roman's remarks. Roman later apologized, admitting that her white privilege had played a role in blinding her from the insensitivity of the remarks, as well as influencing her initial reaction when criticized on social media. Roman's New York Times column was subsequently suspended. ==Bibliography== * Dining In (2017) * Nothing Fancy (2019) ==References== ==External links== * * * * Alison Roman's columns in the New York Times * Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:American cookbook writers Category:Writers from Los Angeles Category:Bon App\u00e9tit Category:Women cookbook writers Category:The New York Times columnists Category:American women columnists Category:21st-century American women writers Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:American women non-fiction writers ",
