    "text": "Carl Wayne Cotman is an American neurologist and neuroscientist. He is a professor of neurology at the University of California, Irvine School of Medicine, where he is also the founding director of the Institute for Brain Aging and Dementia and the Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders (UCI MIND). He is known for researching the neurochemistry of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. His research has shown, for example, that physical exercise increases production of brain-derived neurotropic factor, which protects neurons from aging-related damage and promotes the growth of new ones. ==References== ==External links== *Faculty page * Category:Living people Category:American neurologists Category:American neuroscientists Category:University of California, Irvine faculty Category:Alzheimer's disease researchers Category:Neurochemists Category:Indiana University alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
