    "text": "Stronger Everyday is the fourth studio album by Jon B. It was released October 5, 2004 on Sanctuary Records. After recording three albums for Epic Records, Jon felt he was being underpromoted. He was signed to Sanctuary by Destiny's Child manager Mathew Knowles who was just hired as the president of urban music at the primarily rock oriented label. Stronger Everyday was originally recorded under DreamWorks Records under the working title Everyday Struggles, but the label folded in early 2004 before Jon got to release any material. The album spawned the singles \"Everytime\" and \"Lately\". ==Track listing== From Discogs.Stronger Everyday. Discogs.
