    "text": "All I Want for Christmas is a 1991 American romantic comedy film directed by Robert Lieberman, and starring Harley Jane Kozak, Lauren Bacall, Thora Birch, Ethan Randall, and Leslie Nielsen. The score was composed by Bruce Broughton, including a theme-setting song by Stephen Bishop. ==Plot== In New York City, siblings Ethan (Ethan Randall) and Hallie O'Fallon (Thora Birch) launch a hilarious scheme to get what they most want for Christmas involving their parents, Catherine (Harley Jane Kozak) and Michael (Jamey Sheridan), and grandmother, Lillian (Lauren Bacall). When Hallie meets Santa Claus (Leslie Nielsen), she asks for an unusual gift: her parents back together again. As the children embark on their adventure, and while planning ahead, Tony Boer (Kevin Nealon) takes an interest in Catherine. Ethan gets pre-occupied with not only his parents' romantic dilemma, but also his own, one brought about by his new friendship with Stephanie (Amy Oberer). An elaborate scheme evolves with mice, telephone calls, and an ice cream truck, as Ethan and Hallie try to achieve their goal for helping Stephanie, and see Tony as the primary obstacle. They succeed with a little Christmas magic from Santa Claus. Catherine decides to reject Tony and remarry Michael, completing Hallie's wish. Stephanie and Ethan talk one more time as she gives him a kiss; they begin a relationship, and everyone lives happily ever after. ==Cast== *Harley Jane Kozak as Catherine O'Fallon *Jamey Sheridan as Michael O'Fallon *Ethan Randall as Ethan O'Fallon *Kevin Nealon as Tony Boer *Thora Birch as Hallie O'Fallon *Andrea Martin as Olivia *Lauren Bacall as Lillian Brooks *Amy Oberer as Stephanie *Ren\u00e9e Taylor as Sylvia *Leslie Nielsen as Santa Claus *Felicity LaFortune as Susan *Camille Saviola as Sonya *Michael Alaimo as Frankie *Josh Keaton as Brad *Elizabeth Cherney as Paige ==Reception== The film was universally panned by critics.
