    "text": "Flex-Able is an album by Steve Vai. This was his first as a solo artist, and was created in Stucco Blue, a shed converted into a studio in Vai's old back garden. It is very different from many of his other albums, and is largely influenced by Frank Zappa. Flex-Able does not rely as much on massive guitar arrangements and shred moments as the rest of his output from the 1990s onwards, with the exception of Leftovers which is a compilation of bonus tracks and remasters from his sessions at 'Stucco Blue'. The cover of the May 2009 issue of Guitar World features a photograph of Vai in a pose similar to the album's cover, including the bending guitar neck. ==Track listing (Original LP release)== The album was originally released on vinyl in 1984. All songs written by Steve Vai. === Side one === #\"Little Green Men\" \u2013 5:39 #\"Viv Woman\" \u2013 3:09 #\"Lovers Are Crazy\" \u2013 5:39 #\"Salamanders in the Sun\" \u2013 2:26 #\"The Boy/Girl Song\" \u2013 4:02 === Side two === #\"The Attitude Song\" \u2013 3:23 #\"Call It Sleep\" \u2013 5:09 #\"Junkie\" \u2013 7:23 #\"Bill's Private Parts\" \u2013 0:16 #\"Next Stop Earth\" \u2013 0:34 #\"There's Something Dead in Here\" \u2013 3:46 ==Track listing (Extend Re-Release)== The album was re-released on CD in 1988 by Akashic Records, with four bonus tracks from the Flex-Able Leftovers EP; and again remastered and reissued by Epic Records in 1997, with the same track listing as the Akashic reissue.
