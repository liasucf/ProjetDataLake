At nineteen, he entered the first class of cinema of La Cambre at Institut Sup\u00e9rieur des Arts D\u00e9coratifs (ISAD) an art school created by Henry Van de Velde. From that class, he holds an unforgettable memory (no budget, no equipment). Buchet entered the section of experimental cinema that La Cambre created in 1957. While there, he mainly studied sound editing and made 3 short films: \"Discours\" (Speech), \"Comment se pendre\" (How to hang himself), \"that it will wire for sound\" in 1974, and \"Masques\" in 1959, which he made in collaboration with Marc Lobet on a music of Fernand Schirren. ==Career== After having worked at Meuter-Titra laboratories, he worked with the cameraman Willy Kurant. In 1963, he made the short film, \"La journ\u00e9e de Monsieur Chose\" The day of Mr Chose [Thing] and the following year, \"Que peut- on bien faire chez soi le dimanche apr\u00e8s-midi quand on n'a pas la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision?\" What can we do on a Sunday afternoon, when we don't have a TV?. Five years later, he made \"Hommage \u00e0 Don\" Helder Camara. In 1974, he directed Suzanne's Fugue, his first full-length film, which had a limited budget of 200.000 FB or US $5,000. Five years later, with Mireille and the others, he worked on a full-length film turned during six weeks, in studio, produced by Godfroid Courtmans. This was a film of humor, on the razor's edge, neighbors absurdity, in the vein of Czech films of the 1960s. Selected in San Remo and Moscow, the film attains limited public success. After the film \"Poveri ma belli\" from Dino Risi, Buchet launched Pauvres mais Beaux, a production house, and returnedm to the short film and documentary, Les meilleurs in 1982 and Dupont Durand in 1989. During his later years, he wrote and directed some shorts. He now works on \"Passions froides\" a full-length film which he does not despair to carry out, in spite of resistance from his producer. During his career, he directed various short fictions, experimental films and documentaries. He is also the author of two full-length films, \"La fugue de Suzanne\" (Suzanne's Fugue, 1974) and Mireille dans la vie des autres (Mireille and the Others, 1979). Mireille and the Others was entered into the 11th Moscow International Film Festival. In 1968, he collaborated with Robbe De Hert in the realization of committed films and took part in the creation of \"Cin\u00e9libre\". In addition to work as screenwriter, script-doctor, manager and director of production, Jean-Marie Buchet also directed, until 2002, a workshop of writing of scenario at the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles (ULB-ELICIT). He has been writing movie criticism in the \"Grand Angle\" review since 1996 and works in the service of film restoration at the royal Film Archive of Belgium since 1999. == Films == * 1957: Two things (Deux Choses): Conference (Conference) and How to be hang himself (Comment se pendre) (animation) 4'30\" * 1959: Masks (Masques, Co- director: Marc Lobet; Music Fernand Schirren) 9' * 1961: I love you (Je t'aime) 10' * 1963: The day of Mr Thing (La journ\u00e9e de Monsieur Chose) 12' * 1964: What can we make at home on a Sunday afternoon when we do not have a television?
