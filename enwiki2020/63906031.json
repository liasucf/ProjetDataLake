    "text": "Craig Irvin is an American operatic baritone. Irvin did his undergraduate study at the Simpson College, in Indianola Iowa, before completing his graduate work at The University of Tennessee. During his graduate studies, he performed with the Knoxville Opera as Basilio in Il Barbiere di Siviglia and as a soloist in Verdi\u2019s Requiem with the Elmhurst Symphony Orchestra. He has performed in many leading opera houses both nationally and internationally, including premiering the role of Lieutenant Horstmayer in Kevin Puts and Minnesota Opera\u2019s acclaimed and Pulitzer Prize winning Silent Night \u201cI\u2019ve had the new-opera experience that no one gets\u201d Irvin is quoted to say by Opera News, in singing the same role multiple times. ==Career== Irvin began his career at Orlando Opera in the 2006 season, and continued the following season as a main stage artist. While in Orlando, Irvin also performed the role of Gaston in Beauty and the Beast at Walt Disney World, completing over 700 performances. \u201cI got to be onstage, in front of thousands of people, five days a week, for almost two years,\u201d Irvin says. \u201cAnd that is not an experience you get - in America - as an opera singer!\u201d Irvin spent 2008 in residence with Lyric Opera of Chicago\u2019s Ryan Opera Center. He returned for a second season in 2009-2010. While there he portrayed a number of roles including Zuniga in Carmen, Theseus in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, the Imperial Commissioner in Madama Butterfly, the title role in The Mikado, and Bartolo in Le Nozze Di Figaro, among others. In 2011, Irvin performed as Lieutenant Horstmayer in the premier of Kevin Puts\u2019 Silent Night at Minnesota Opera. Having said of Silent Night, \u201cIt\u2019s the most amazing opera I have ever had a chance to work on.\u201d Irvin describes why he feels that way, citing, \u201cThere\u2019s a major battle scene about five minutes into the show that is extremely visceral, both for the action and the music,\u201d He continues, \u201cTen minutes later, there\u2019s some of the most beautiful music and orchestration I\u2019ve ever heard. You can visualize, just through the music, the sun breaking the crest of the horizon, and the frost on the grass start to melt away, and birds taking off. But it ends darkly, because as the sun comes out, you see all the dead bodies.\u201d In the 2012-2013 season, Irvin sang in Carmina Burana with the Phoenix Symphony, and debuted at Opera Saratoga as Dick Deadeye in HMS Pinafore, and as Raimondo in Lucia di Lammermoor. In 2013, Irvin played Mandryka in Strauss\u2019s Arabella at the Minnesota Opera. In early 2015 Irvin sang the Pirate King in the Pensacola Opera production of Gilbert & Sullivan's The Pirates of Penzance Also in 2015, Irvin was seen in Sarasota Opera\u2019s production of La Boheme as Marcello. In their review of his role in Utah Opera\u2019s 2016 production of Figaro, The Salt Lake Tribune said of Irvin, \u201cBaritone Craig Irvin was a strong foil, playing Count Almaviva as a suave bully who was redeemed by a lightning bolt of compassion at the end of the opera.\u201d And in his role that year at LoftOpera as Macbeth, The Observer commented \u201cAs Macbeth, Craig Irvin flaunted a big, steely baritone as striking as his craggy profile.\u201d Irvin has reprised his premier role of Lieutenant Horstmayer a number of times since his original performance in 2011 at Minnesota Opera, including in 2012 at Opera Philadelphia. Further performances were at Fort Worth Opera and Cincinnati Opera in 2014, Atlanta Opera in 2016, 2019 at Austin Opera, and Utah Opera in 2020. 2017 found Irvin playing Excamillo in Carmen, a role of which the Texas Classical Review stated, \u201cThough each generation finds new secrets in Carmen, Escamillo never changes: he needs a decent dynamic range, a sturdy swagger, and a beautiful, smooth vocal quality, all of which Irvin brought to the table.\u201d Irvin was then described in his role as Dan Packard as \u201captly heartless and blustering\u201d in Dinner at Eight, \u201csinging with a big, commanding baritone\u201d. In 2018 Irvin appeared twice at the Wexford Festival Opera, once as Sherrif Jack Rance in La Fanciulla Del West, of which Opera Wire said \u201cIrvin, was very impressive. Stylishly dressed in black, his presence dominated the stage. He acted the role with such conviction that it would be impossible to doubt the malevolence of his intentions.\u201d Continuing, they added \u201cIrvin has a strong baritone with an interestingly colored timbre, which he successfully used to characterize Rance\u2019s sinister nature. He sang with confidence, coated with a vocal swagger that gave him the necessary authority to convince in the role.\u201d Also at the Wexford Festival, Irvin performed Dan Packard in Dinner at Eight. Irvin was honored with the Heinz Rehfuss Singing Actor Award by the Orlando Opera. Irvin was also recognized with an Honorable Mention in the Fourth Annual Excellence in Opera awards by Operavore. He was featured by Barihunks for his Zurga in the 2015 production at Utah Opera of Bizet's The Pearl Fishers, and in 2017 for his role at Minnesota Opera in Dinner at Eight. == Discography == * An American Baritone Vincero Enterprises (2011) * Then Sings my Soul (2019) == References == == External links == * Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American operatic baritones Category:Simpson College alumni Category:University of Tennessee alumni ",
