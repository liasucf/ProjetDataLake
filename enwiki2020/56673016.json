GQ reviewed Anne-Marie's live performance of the song at a Rough Trade store in Brooklyn, saying \"she begins shouting her insecurities to the audience: about wanting longer legs, never fitting in, and eating copious amounts of dessert. Then she does the unthinkable. She grabs and pinches her own body fat onstage\", going on to say she knows how to \"put on a show\". ==Promotion== Anne-Marie announced the release of the track on 31 October, and performed the new version for the first time live in the studio on BBC Radio 2 on 31 October 2018. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018\u201319) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ireland (IRMA) | 34 |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ) | 10 |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 893 |} ==Certifications== ==References== Category:2018 songs Category:2018 singles Category:Anne-Marie (singer) songs Category:Songs written by Jennifer Decilveo Category:Songs written by Anne-Marie (singer) ",
