Sterling has been recognized for its sustainability initiatives by Sierra Magazine and earned a STARS Gold Rating from the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education. The Real Food Challenge ranked Sterling the number one college in the U.S. for two consecutive years, 2015 and 2016, for its commitment to serving locally sourced sustainably produced food. Prior to Sterling, Derr served as an alumni leader and ultimately Interim President of his alma mater, Antioch College, where he is credited with successfully leading the effort to revive the institution. For more than a decade Derr was affiliated with the Walnut Hill School for the Arts where he served in a number of roles, including Acting and Associate Headmaster. He has also served in senior admission roles at Earlham College and Connecticut College. ==Personal life== Derr was born in Flint, Michigan. His grandparents and parents were autoworkers.
