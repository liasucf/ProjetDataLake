    "text": "WSTY-LP, UHF analog channel 23, is a low-powered Family Channel-affiliated television station licensed to Hammond, Louisiana, United States. It serves portions of the Baton Rouge and New Orleans television markets. The station is owned by Pontchartrain Investors, LLC. On cable, the station is seen on Spectrum channel 22. Its transmitter is located off US Highway 51 just south of Natalbany, Louisiana and north of Hammond. ==History== The channel began as a translator for independent station WBTR (then known as WKG-TV) in 1988. As original station owner Woody Jenkins and Great Oaks Broadcasting had problems garnering cable coverage in the Greater Baton Rouge area, he set up translator stations, including W39AW, to broaden the station's cable coverage. W39AW also brought UPN programming to the region when the network began operations. In 1996, the station change its channel to 23. By the mid 1990s, Jenkins succeeded in gaining enough cable coverage for WBTR that he began to sell off his former translators or adapt them to bring localized programming to the communities served. In late 1998, Jenkins began different test formats for a TV station to cover the Florida Parishes (Tangipahoa, St. Helena, Livingston, and St. Tammany Parishes) with the station signing on by the end of December.http://www.hammondstar.com/wsty-tv-will-hit-air-waves-next- week/article_63b6afcf-ac87-5939-85b7-ce5d96da8702.html On December 16, 1998, the station signed on with localized programming to the Hammond-Ponchatoula region as well as with a primary affiliation with America One and a secondary affiliation with America's Voice. Like with WBTR, Woody Jenkins struggled to get WSTY on the local cable provider, Charter Communications, given the limited number of channels available at the time. Exercising the right of must-carry, he filed a complaint with the FCC against Charter asking for cable coverage and reparations.http://www.hammondstar.com/wsty-tv-files-complaint- against-charter-with-fcc/article_c9a7d186-cf72-5c30-9f51-d90a952633b5.html By August 1, 1999, Charter began carrying WSTY on its lineup.http://www.hammondstar.com/charter-to-begin-carrying-wsty- saturday/article_229b49d6-7ce8-5cb5-be6e-cbbc2f178dcb.html In 2005, Jenkins and Great Oaks Broadcasting sold the station to Veritas Broadcasting Company, and the station soon fell into the hands of Pontchartrain Investors, LLC. Today, WSTY is affiliated with The Family Channel (previously My Family TV). It is unknown as to when the station dropped its America One affiliation. Current local programming for WSTY includes: The Great Outdoorsmen, Louisiana's Bayou Country Outdoors, and Spiritual Outdoor Adventures. Station owners Pontchartrain Investors also have a construction permit to convert WSTY's signal from analog to digital on channel 38. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Television stations in Louisiana Category:Television channels and stations established in 1988 Category:1988 establishments in Louisiana ",
