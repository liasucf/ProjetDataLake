    "text": "The Iverni (\"Iwernoi\" above) are one of the population groups mentioned in Ptolemy's Geography. The Iverni (, ') were a people of early Ireland first mentioned in Ptolemy's 2nd century Geography as living in the extreme south- west of the island.Ptolemy. Geography. 2.2.6 (ed. K. M\u00fcller [Paris 1883\u20131901]) He also locates a \"city\" called Ivernis (, ') in their territory, and observes that this settlement has the same name as the island as a whole, Ivernia (, ').Ptol. Geog. 2.2.9; 8.3.4 The name Iverni has been derived from Proto-Indo- European *, \"the fertile land\". It was probably once the name given to all the peoples of Ireland, but by Ptolemy's time had a more restricted usage applicable to the inhabitants of the south-west.John T. Koch, Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, ABC-CLIO, 2005, p.709 These Iverni can be identified linguistically with the \u00c9rainn (\u00c9raind, \u00c9rnai, \u00c9rna), a people attested in Munster and elsewhere in the early Middle Ages. The prehistoric \u00c9rainn royal dynasties are sometimes referred to as the D\u00e1irine.DIL Letter: D1 (D-Deg\u00f3ir), Columns 35 and 36O'Rahilly, pp. 7, 189 ==Historical septs== In early Irish genealogical tracts the \u00c9rainn are regarded as an ethnic group, distinct from the Laigin and Cruthin. Population groups in Munster classed as \u00c9rainn include the Corcu Lo\u00edgde in southwest County Cork, the M\u00fascraige in Counties Cork and Tipperary, the Corcu Duibne in County Kerry, and the Corcu Baiscinn in west County Clare. The D\u00e1l Riata and D\u00e1l Fiatach (or Ulaid) in Ulster are also considered \u00c9rainn. The \u00c9rainn appear to have been a powerful group in the proto-historic period, but in early historical times were largely reduced to politically marginal status, with the notable exception of the enigmatic Osraige. The most important of the Munster \u00c9rainn, the Corcu Lo\u00edgde, retained some measure of prestige even after they had become marginalised by the E\u00f3ganachta in the 7th or 8th century.Charles Doherty, \"\u00c9rainn\", in Se\u00e1n Duffy (ed.), Medieval Ireland: an encyclopedia, 2005, CRC Press, pp. 156\u2013157 It is likely that the sometimes powerful U\u00ed Liath\u00e1in and their close kin the U\u00ed Fidgenti originally belonged to the \u00c9rainn/D\u00e1irine as well, but were later counted among the E\u00f3ganachta for political reasons.John V. Kelleher, \"The Rise of the D\u00e1l Cais\", in \u00c9tienne Rynne (ed.), North Munster Studies: Essays in Commemoration of Monsignor Michael Moloney. Limerick: Thomond Archaeological Society. 1967. pp. 230\u201341.Gear\u00f3id Mac Niocaill, Ireland before the Vikings. Dublin: Gill and Macmillan. 1972. Another prominent \u00c9rainn people of early Munster are believed to have been the Mairtine, who by the early historical period have completely vanished from the Irish landscape, although they may be in part ancestral to the later D\u00e9isi Tuisceart and D\u00e1l gCais.D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn, \"Ireland, 400\u2013800\", in D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn (ed.), A New History of Ireland (Volume 1): Prehistoric and Early Ireland. Oxford University Press. 2005. p. 222 The D\u00e9isi Muman may also have had \u00c9rainn origins, but this has long been disputed. ==D\u00e1ire: Darini, D\u00e1irine== It seems likely the Iverni were related to the Darini of eastern Ulster.for extensive discussion, see Julius Pokorny. \"Beitr\u00e4ge zur \u00e4ltesten Geschichte Irlands (3. \u00c9rainn, D\u00e1ri(n)ne und die Iverni und Darini des Ptolom\u00e4us)\", in Zeitschrift f\u00fcr celtische Philologie 12 (1918): 323\u201357. The name \"Darini\" implies descent from an ancestor called D\u00e1ire, (*D\u0101rios) as claimed by several historical peoples identified as \u00c9rainn, including the D\u00e1l Riata and D\u00e1l Fiatach in eastern UlsterDonnchadh \u00d3 Corr\u00e1in, \"Prehistoric and Early Christian Ireland\", in R. F. Foster (ed.), The Oxford Illustrated History of Ireland, Oxford University Press, 2001 as well as the \u00c9rainn of Munster. An early name for Dundrum, County Down, is recorded as D\u00fan Droma D\u00e1irine, and the name D\u00e1irine was applied to the Corcu Lo\u00edgde, further suggesting a relationship between the Darini and the Iverni. ==\u00c9rainn: Clanna Dedad== The genealogies trace the descent of the \u00c9rainn from two separate eponymous ancestors, Ailill \u00c9rann and \u00cdar mac Dedad. Legendary relatives of the latter include the Cland Dedad (offspring of Deda mac Sin), a Munster people who appear in the Ulster Cycle, led by C\u00fa Ro\u00ed, son of D\u00e1ire mac Dedad, and the legendary High King Conaire M\u00f3r, grandson of Iar and ancestor of the S\u00edl Conairi. The historical sept of the U\u00ed Maicc Iair (\"grandsons of the son of Iar\") and the MAQI IARI of ogham inscriptions also appear to be related.Eoin MacNeill, \"Early Irish Population Groups: their nomenclature, classification and chronology\", Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy (C) 29, 1911, pp. 59\u2013114 The personal name Iar is simply another variant of the root present in Iverni and \u00c9rainn.MacNeill 1911 Finally, the name \u00cdth, given in the genealogies as the ultimate ancestor of the Corcu Lo\u00edgde (D\u00e1irine) and offering some confusion about their parentage and relation to the Iverni, in fact preserves the same Indo-European root *peiH- (\"to be fat, swell\"),John T. Koch. \"\u00c9riu\", in John T. Koch (ed.). Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO. 2006. pp. 709\u201318 thus in effect completing a basic picture of the Iverni/\u00c9rainn and their kindred in later historical Ireland. ==O'Rahilly's theory== Ivernic is a hypothetical language proposed by T. F. O'Rahilly. He suggested that it was an unattested P-Celtic (probably Brittonic) language spoken in Ireland before Irish. He suggested this language was spoken by the Iverni (hence its modern name), and that they invaded Ireland from Britain, bringing with them the language. O'Rahilly identifies two words recorded in the Sanas Cormaic as coming from Ivernic: ond = \"stone\" and fern = \"anything good\". His theory has been refuted and is not widely accepted by experts.Koch, John T. Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO, 2006. p.750Martin Ball and James Fife. The Celtic Languages. Psychology Press, 1993. p.75MacEoin, Gear\u00f3id. \"What language was spoken in Ireland before Irish?\", in The Celtic Languages in Contact. Potsdam University Press, 2007. p.116 Furthermore, by the proto-historic period, the Iverni were evidently Goidelic-speaking, as ogham inscriptions in Primitive Irish are most abundant in Counties Cork and Kerry.John T.
