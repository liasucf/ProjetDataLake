    "text": "Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy are Hanna-Barbera cartoon characters who debuted on The Quick Draw McGraw Show and appeared in their own segment. The segments centered around the misadventures of a dachshund father-and-son team. Doggie Daddy (voiced by Doug Young with a Brooklyn accent, based on a Jimmy Durante impersonation) tried to do the best he could at raising his rambunctious son Augie (voiced by Daws Butler). The characters have made appearances outside of their series, including in their own video game and in Yogi's Ark Lark and its spin-off series. ==Summary== The segments centered around the misadventures of a dachshund father-and-son team. Doggie Daddy (voiced by Doug Young with a Brooklyn accent, based on a Jimmy Durante impersonation) tried to do the best he could at raising his rambunctious son Augie (voiced by Daws Butler). Augie, who loved his father, would often refer to him as \"dear old Dad.\" Their mutual admiration included Daddy gently chiding, \"Augie, my son, my son\", when he would disappoint his father; and when his son would say or do something that inspired pride, Daddy would turn to the audience and say with a grin, \"Dat's my boy who said dat!\" The segments and characters were similar to the Spike and Tyke cartoons William Hanna and Joseph Barbera produced during their theatrical animation careers at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the 1940s and 1950s. ==Theme song== A 45 rpm record released at the height of the show's popularity featured the show's theme song. The lyrics included this chorus: An instrumental version of the song was used as the introductory theme to each cartoon. ==Character information== ===Augie Doggie=== Augie is a highly spirited pup who is motivated by ambition and the desire to make his father proud. He is typically seen wearing only a green shirt. Possessing some knowledge in science and the ability to converse with animals, Augie would often capitalize upon his father's foibles. And he's voiced by Tom Kenny since 2020. ===Doggie Daddy=== The smooth-talking Doggie Daddy attempts to provide strict parental guidance to Augie, often to Augie's displeasure. Doggie Daddy is usually depicted wearing only a collar. Despite his strictness, Doggie Daddy has a warm personality and typically acquiesces to his son's wishes. Doug Young voiced Doggie Daddy as a Jimmy Durante impersonation. After his death in 2018, he's voiced by Dee Bradley Baker since 2019. ==Episodes== ===Series overview=== ===Season 1 (1959\u20131960)=== ===Season 2 (1960\u20131961)=== ===Season 3 (1962)=== ==In other languages== * * * * * * * * * * ==Later appearances== * Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy appeared in Yogi's Ark Lark, its spin-off series Yogi's Gang, Laff-A-Lympics, and Yogi's Treasure Hunt.
