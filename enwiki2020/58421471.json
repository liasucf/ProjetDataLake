She attended the Australian Institute of Sport on a scholarship and had a top 40 ranking in a promising junior career. A right- handed player, Lukaszewicz received a wildcard into the singles main draw of the 2004 Australian Open, at the age of 15. She was ranked barely in the world's top 1000 at the time and was drawn up against the top seed Justine Henin-Hardenne in the first-round. The match, played on Rod Laver Arena, was over in 45 minutes, with the world number one winning 6\u20130, 6\u20130. She also exited in the opening round of the junior competition by the same scoreline, beaten by Shahar Pe'er. Henin-Hardenne's coach Carlos Rodr\u00edguez later criticised Australian Open officials for mismatch, questioning whether a wildcard should have been granted. In addition to her Australian Open appearance in 2004, she was also a member of Australia's Fed Cup squad that year for a tie against Russia in Moscow. Having already been in Moscow as a hitting partner, she joined Alicia Molik, Samantha Stosur and Rennae Stubbs as the fourth team member after Nicole Pratt withdrew. Following her career in tennis she studied nutrition and now works in Adelaide as a dietitian. ==ITF Circuit finals== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%; width:15%;\" |- style=\"background:lightblue;\" |$25,000 tournaments |- style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" |$10,000 tournaments |} ===Doubles (0\u20132)=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%;\" |- |Outcome |No |Date |Tournament |Surface |Partner |Opponents in the final |Score |-style=\"background:#f0f8ff;\" | style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Runner-up | 1. | 31 July 2005 | Pontevedra, Spain | Hard | Galina Semenova | Anna Font Laura Vallverdu-Zaira | 3\u20136, 7\u20136, 4\u20136 |- style=\"background:lightblue;\" | style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Runner-up | 2. | 25 September 2005 | Mackay, Australia | Hard | Monique Adamczak | Casey Dellacqua Daniella Jeflea | 6\u20137(6), 6\u20137(2) |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Australian female tennis players Category:Australian Institute of Sport tennis players Category:Sportspeople from Adelaide Category:Tennis people from South Australia Category:Australian people of Polish descent ",
