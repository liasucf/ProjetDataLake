    "text": "Hilda Peak is a mountain summit located at the northern extreme of Banff National Park, in the Canadian Rockies of Alberta, Canada. The nearest higher peak is Mount Athabasca, to the southwest. Hilda Peak is situated south of Sunwapta Pass and can be prominently seen from the Icefields Parkway. The Hilda Glacier lies to the south side of the peak, and the Boundary Glacier lies to the west. __NOTOC__ ==History== The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1938 by E. Brooks, H. Brooks, R. Cross, and W. Marples. The mountain was named Hilda Peak in 1938. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1985 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. ==Geology== Like other mountains in Banff Park, Hilda Peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Hilda Peak is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 \u00b0C with wind chill factors below -30 \u00b0C. Precipitation runoff from Hilda Peak drains east into Hilda Creek, thence Nigel Creek, tributaries of the North Saskatchewan River. ==Gallery== File:Icefields Parkway view of Mount Athabasca and Hilda Peak.jpg|Hilda (right) seen from the Icefields Parkway ==References== ==See also== *List of mountains of Canada *Geography of Alberta ==External links== * Hilda Peak weather forecast * Parks Canada web site: Banff National Park Category:Mountains of Alberta Category:Mountains of Banff National Park Category:Alberta's Rockies Category:Canadian Rockies ",
