    "text": "Vain Glory Opera is the third (or second \"official\") studio album by the German power metal band Edguy, released in 1998. It was mixed by Stratovarius' Timo Tolkki, who also played additional lead guitar on \"Out Of Control\", and featured additional lead and backing vocals by Hansi K\u00fcrsch of Blind Guardian on \"Out of Control\" and the title track \"Vain Glory Opera.\" Further choir vocals were supplied by Ralf Zdiarstek and Norman Meiritz. At the time of recording the album, Edguy had not yet chosen a permanent drummer to succeed Dominik Storch. So session musician Frank Lindenthal, a good friend of the band, was asked to play drums on the album. \"Hymn\" is a cover version of the song from the album Quartet (1982) by the British new wave band Ultravox. ==Track listing== Music and lyrics by Tobias Sammet, except where indicated # \"Overture\" \u2013 1:31 # \"Until We Rise Again\" \u2013 4:28 # \"How Many Miles\" (Edguy, Sammet) \u2013 5:39 # \"Scarlet Rose\" \u2013 5:10 # \"Out of Control\" (Edguy, Sammet) \u2013 5:04 # \"Vain Glory Opera\" \u2013 6:08 # \"Fairytale\" (Edguy, Sammet) \u2013 5:11 # \"Walk on Fighting\" (Edguy, Sammet) \u2013 4:46 # \"Tomorrow\" \u2013 3:53 # \"No More Foolin'\" (Edguy, Sammet) \u2013 4:55 # \"Hymn\" (Midge Ure, Billy Currie, Chris Cross, Warren Cann) \u2013 4:53 (Ultravox cover) # \"But Here I Am\" - 4:33 (Japanese edition bonus track) ==Personnel== ;Band members *Tobias Sammet \u2013 vocals, bass, keyboards *Jens Ludwig \u2013 guitars *Dirk Sauer \u2013 guitars ;Additional musicians *Frank Lindenthal \u2013 drums *Ralf Zdiarstek, Norman Meiritz, Andy Allend\u00f6rfer \u2013 backing vocals *Hansi K\u00fcrsch \u2013 additional vocals on tracks 5 and 6 *Timo Tolkki \u2013 guitar solo on track 5 ;Production *Andy Allend\u00f6rfer, Nils Wasko - executive producers *Norman Meiritz - engineer *Timo Tolkki - mixing *Mika Jussila - mastering at Finnvox Studios, Helsinki ==References== Category:Edguy albums Category:1998 albums Category:AFM Records albums ",
