    "text": "The lined flat-tail gecko (Uroplatus lineatus) is a gecko which is found in eastern Madagascar and on the island Nosy Bohara. These geckos live on trees in tropical rain forests and on bamboo plants. They reach a total length of 270 mm. Threats to this species are posed by deforestation and illegal pet trade. ==Taxonomy and etymology== The generic name, Uroplatus, is a Latinization of two Greek words: \"our\u00e1\" (\u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03ac) meaning \"tail\" and \"platys\" (\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03cd\u03c2) meaning \"flat\". Its specific name, lineatus, is the Latin word for \"lined\" in reference to the longitudinal stripes on the lizard's body. ==References== lineatus Category:Reptiles of Africa Category:Endemic fauna of Madagascar Category:Reptiles described in 1836 ",
