    "text": "Jason Kuznicki is the editor of Cato Books and of Cato Unbound, the Cato Institute\u2019s online journal of debate. He earned his doctorate at Johns Hopkins University, where Kuznicki received a Fulbright Fellowship and a Chateaubriand Prize. Kuznicki previously worked as an assistant editor of the Encyclopedia of Libertarianism. Kuznicki is the author of Technology and the End of Authority: What Is Government For? (Palgrave, 2017). In it he suggests government and states are just one tool among many that human societies have deployed to solve various sorts of problems. Rather than focus too much on the state, Kuznicki argues we should instead focus on the real center of society, institutions such as markets, churches, sports teams, scientific schools, and families, which the state is designed to support. As a thought leader within the modern libertarian movement, Kuznicki opposes libertarian perspectives that support some of the Confederacy's philosophical underpinnings, focusing instead on the basic human freedoms of African Americans. Contributing to the anthology Our American Story (2019), Kuznicki addressed the possibility of a shared American narrative and suggested that we should not idolize the past, arguing \"the most important American narrative today is one that historians call a declension narrative, and second, it's false.\" Kuznicki's writing and speeches have been featured on C-SPAN, the Federalist, and Law and Liberty, as well as in Liberal Currents where he continues to publish essays. ==References== Category:Living people Category:American political commentators Category:American male writers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
