In 1978, after being capsized by killer whales, he survived more than ten weeks in a life raft in the South Atlantic along with a friend, journalist Mauro Mancini, who died of pneumonia two days after the two were rescued. Another venture was Fogar's solo sled expedition to the North Pole. He competed several times in the Dakar Rally and in the Rallye des Pharaons. Fogar's grave at the Monumental Cemetery of Milan in 2015 In 1992, Fogar was paralysed from the neck down following a jeep accident while rallying in Turkmenistan. This did not end his adventurous spirit, and in 1997, in a wheelchair, he competed in a round-Italy yacht race. He died in 2005 of a heart attack and is buried at the Monumental Cemetery of Milan, Italy. ==Personal life== Father of Rachele Fogar (her mother is Katalin Szijarto) and Francesca Fogar (her mother is Maria Teresa Panizzoli).
