    "text": "Domin\u00f3 is a Chilean chain of fuente de soda restaurants, a type of establishment specializing in Chilean-style fast food. While the completo is what they are best known for, Domin\u00f3 also serves Chilean-style sandwiches, empanadas and salads. Beginning with one location in central Santiago, Domin\u00f3 has since expanded to have locations across the country. ==History== The first Domin\u00f3 opened in 1952 on Agustinas street. This location is still in operation to this day. Founded by Pedro Pubill, he sought to bring an American style soda fountain restaurant (which were very popular at the time) to Chile. As Domin\u00f3 established itself, it became known for its creativity in their menu. Many consider Domin\u00f3 to be the first to set the trend of having numerous different unique completo combinations. Domin\u00f3 would operate solely out of their original location until 1995 when they opened their second location also in central Santiago. This expansion would be followed by the addition of one more location in 1999 followed by a large expansion in 2000s which would bring their total locations to over 30. ==Products== Example of a completo variation with numerous toppings. Domin\u00f3 specializes in food typically found at fuente de sodas. Fuente de sodas are a traditional style of fast-food restaurant found in Chile that serve foods such as churrascos, lomitos and completos. While Domin\u00f3 serves all of these aforementioned items, they are most known for their completo. Currently they serve sixteen variations of completos, ranging from the classic completo italiano (tomato, avocado, mayo) to the more unique turco (egg and cheese). ===Completos=== Domin\u00f3 has more variations of the completo than a typical fuente de soda. Each of their variations is referred to with a specific name, which is not uncommon in Chile. In addition to the traditional variations, Domin\u00f3 has completos such as the alemana (tomato, sauerkraut, mayo), the rodeo (cheese, barbecue sauce and bacon) and the irlandesa (lettuce, tomato and mayo). ===Sandwiches=== Domin\u00f3 offers the typical styles of sandwiches found at fuente de sodas, namely churrascos (thin slices of beef), lomitos (braised pork) and mechadas (Chilean-style roast beef). Similarly to the completos, these sandwiches can be topped with many different variations of toppings. ==See also== * Completos * Chilean cuisine ==References== Category:Chilean cuisine Category:Restaurant chains ",
