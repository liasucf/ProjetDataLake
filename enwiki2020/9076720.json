Naris Kridakorn, editor of World Boxing Magazine. M.R. Naris had recommended him to the \"Sorjaturong Boxing Gym\" (\u0e04\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22\u0e21\u0e27\u0e22 \u0e2a.\u0e08\u0e32\u0e15\u0e38\u0e23\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c) by Suchart Theerawuttichuwong as owner and trainer. Saman won the WBC, IBF and lineal junior flyweight titles during his career. He is the third Thai world boxing champion not to be previously involved in Muaythai (the first being Pone Kingpetch, and the second being Chartchai Chionoi). Saman was also the first Thai and Asian boxer who won world championships of two institutions at the same time. Before that, he was criticized for not being capable enough to be a world champion. In 1993 he challenged the WBC strawweight world champion with Ricardo L\u00f3pez, but was defeated in the second round. He defeated reigning champion Humberto Gonz\u00e1lez in a thrilling fight that was named Ring Magazine's Fight of the Year in 1995 to win the IBF and WBC titles. Both fighters were knocked down twice during the fight. He defended the WBC portion of the title ten times before losing it to Yo Sam Choi in 1999 via a unanimous decision. Their rematch was postponed seven times, finally taking place in 2001, when Saman lost by a knockout in the seventh round. He retired in 2005 after being knocked out in the first round by K\u014dki Kameda. After retirement, he opened a Khao man kai (Thai version of Hainanese chicken rice) and Khao mu daeng (rice with red pork) restaurant in his home town of Ban Fah Lagoon Village, Rangsit, Pathumthani province. == See also == *List of light flyweight boxing champions *List of WBC world champions *List of IBF world champions == References == == External links == * *Saman Sorjaturong - CBZ Profile |- |- |- Category:1969 births Category:International Boxing Federation champions Category:Living people Category:World Boxing Council champions Category:World light-flyweight boxing champions Category:World boxing champions Category:People from Kamphaeng Phet Province Category:Thai male boxers ",
