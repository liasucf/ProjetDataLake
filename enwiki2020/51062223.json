    "text": "William Andrew Licon (born August 25, 1994) is an American competitive swimmer who specializes in breaststroke and medley events. He is the current American Record-holder in the 200-yard breaststroke with a time of 1:47.91. Licon is only the fourth swimmer in collegiate history to win four individual NCAA titles in four different events during their career. He was voted the Big 12 Male Athlete of the Year in 2017. He competed for the University of Texas at Austin from 2013 to 2017 under head coach Eddie Reese where he was an 11-time NCAA Champion, a 15-time All-American, a 3-time NCAA team champion (2015, 2016, and 2017), and a 12-time Big 12 Conference champion. Licon has been a member of the United States national team since 2015. He currently competes for the club team Longhorn Aquatics and represents the professional team LA Current in the International Swimming League. ==Early Life and Education== Will Licon was born in El Paso, Texas on August 25, 1994. There, he lived with his parents Robert and Nancy, as well as his younger siblings Michael and Elizabeth; all three of them grew up together as competitive swimmers. In the summer of 2001, Licon began his competitive swimming career by joining the El Paso Tennis Club \"Fighting Frogs\" summer league swim team at the age of six. After one season of summer league swimming and winning multiple City Championship events, Will's father, Robert, advanced his now seven-year-old son to year-round club swimming. In the Fall of 2001, Robert created the USA Swimming club team West Texas Typhoons (WETT), where Licon swam for the next seven years of his career, breaking 50 individual Border Local Swim Committee (LSC) records during his tenure. In 2009, Licon left El Paso and moved with his family to Plano, Texas. There, he joined the club team City of Plano Swimmers (COPS), where he swam for 2 years (2009-2011). While living in Plano, Licon attended Jasper High School (2009-2011) and swam for Plano Senior High School during his freshman year (2009-2010), becoming a school record-holder in the 200-yard medley relay for his sole year of high school swimming. In 2011, Licon moved to Austin, Texas at the age of 16 to swim for Nitro swim club, leaving his family as they moved back to El Paso. For his final two years of high school, Licon boarded with multiple host families in the surrounding Austin area to maintain an elite level of training that would best set him up for future athletic and academic success. \"It was very hard the first couple of months. I was scared. I was on my own,\" Licon said. \"It forced me to grow up on a whole new level.\" Only months after moving cities, Licon won the 200-meter breaststroke at the 2011 Jr. National Championships, posting a 2:16.09. With this time, he finished ahead of his rival and future Olympic gold medalist Gunnar Bentz. In Austin, Licon attended Westlake High School for one semester before briefly moving back to El Paso. For two months in El Paso, he attended El Paso High School before moving back to Austin for the final time in 2012. Back in Austin, he enrolled into, then eventually graduated from Vista Ridge High School. That summer, Licon competed in the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, finishing 19th in the 200-meter breaststroke which qualified him for the 2012 Jr. Pan Pacific Swimming Championships in Honolulu, Hawaii. In Hawaii, Licon posted a 2:14.53 in the 200-meter breaststroke to take fourth place. Individually, Licon also placed sixth in the 100-meter breaststroke (1:03.85) and competed in the preliminary swims of the 100-meter butterfly and the 200-meter individual medley. He concluded the meet with a silver medal performance in the 4\u00d7100-meter medley relay alongside future Longhorn teammates Jack Conger and Matt Ellis with a 1:02.86 breaststroke split. This silver medal became Licon's first international medal of his swimming career. Later in October 2012, Licon gave his verbal commitment to swim at the University of Texas at Austin and signed his letter of intent on November 14, 2012. ==Collegiate Career== ===2014 NCAA Championships=== In his debut season as a freshman at the 2014 NCAA Division I Men's Swimming and Diving Championships, Licon placed fifth in the 400-yard individual medley, setting a school record for the Longhorns with a time of 3:40.84. He also finished 12th in the 200-yard breaststroke and 14th in the 200-yard individual medley. The Longhorns finished second to the California Golden Bears for the men's NCAA team title, scoring 417.5 points to Cal's 468.5. ===2015 NCAA Championships=== At the 2015 NCAA Championships during his breakout sophomore year, Licon won two individual titles, one relay title, and earned a second place finish. In his first event, Licon was runner-up to Stanford\u2019s David Nolan in the 200-yard I.M. while producing a lifetime-best by over a second and a half, going 1:40.09. This made Licon the third-fastest performer of all time in the event. Nolan\u2019s time of 1:39.38 was a new American Record. Licon then joined Kip Darmody, Joseph Schooling, and Jack Conger to win the 4\u00d7100-yard medley relay in a new NCAA and U.S. Open record time of 3:01.23, just out-touching the California Golden Bears (3:01.60) for gold. The Longhorns were ineligible for the American record because Schooling represented Singapore internationally. Licon also won the 400-yard individual medley with a time of 3:36.37, crushing the American Record-Holder Chase Kalisz by 3.14 seconds in the process. Licon became the fourth fastest performer of all time in this event, and it was the first time in the history of Texas Longhorns swimming and diving that one of their athletes had won the 400 I.M. at the NCAA Championships. With his last race of the meet, Licon went head-to-head against American Record-Holder and reigning NCAA champion Kevin Cordes in the 200-yard breaststroke. Licon out- touched Cordes for the win with a 1:49.48, just edging out Cordes\u2019 1:49.53, and became just the second swimmer ever to break 1:50 in the event. Licon\u2019s breakout performance at the 2015 NCAA Division I Men's Swimming and Diving Championships helped the Longhorns win their first team title since 2010. It was the Longhorns' 11th NCAA men's team title overall. ===2016 NCAA Championships=== Competing at the 2016 NCAA Championships in his junior season, Licon won the 200-yard individual medley with a 1:40.04, ahead of future Olympic silver medalist Josh Prenot (1:40.14) and future 3-time Olympic gold medalist and world record-holder Ryan Murphy (1:40.27).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKUhrOE4SUk Licon\u2019s time broke the pool record previously held by 12-time Olympic medalist Ryan Lochte (1:40.08), which was the former American Record just over a year prior. Licon won the 200-yard breaststroke with a 1:48.12, beating second place Prenot by 1.26 seconds. His time broke the NCAA, American, and U.S. Open record previously owned by Kevin Cordes (1:48.66) by over half a second. Licon's first 100-yard split of 51.81 surprisingly broke Brendan Hansen's school and conference record in the 100-yard breaststroke of 51.96 in the process. Licon also earned second place in the 400 individual medley behind Josh Prenot, with a 3:37.40 effort,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-FUecZSs_U and a third place finish in the 4\u00d750-yard medley relay.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1nlElh-k38 Licon joined John Shebat, Joseph Schooling, and Jack Conger to help Texas win the 400-yard medley relay for the second straight year with a new NCAA and U.S. Open Record of 3:00.68,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9UJ8ZUKYEs&t;=1s splitting a 50.69 on the breaststroke leg. Licon's efforts helped Texas win the 2016 NCAA Division I Men's Swimming and Diving Championships, winning back-to-back team titles. ===2017 NCAA Championships=== As he wrapped up his senior year, Licon went out with a bang at the 2017 NCAA Championships by going undefeated in all of his races. In his first event, Licon won the 200-yard individual medley, tying University of Florida\u2019s Mark Szaranek for top of the podium at 1:40.67. Later that same night, Licon joined Shebat, Schooling, and Conger in the 4\u00d7100-yard medley relay one last time to crush their previous NCAA and U.S. Open Record with a sensational time of 2:59.22,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF6jwr0RWYc accompanied by a blazing 49.75 breaststroke split from Licon. That swim marked the first time in history that any team had cracked the 3-minute barrier in the 4 \u00d7 100-yard medley relay. Licon followed up his wins in the 200-yard individual medley and the 4\u00d7100-yard medley relay with another victory in the 100-yard breaststroke (50.68). That time made Licon the second-fastest performer in history. Later that session, Licon joined teammates Shebat, Schooling and Brett Ringgold in the 200-yard medley relay,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMpDCshSvt0 taking first place in a new NCAA and U.S. Open Record of 1:21.54. On his final night of collegiate swimming, Licon took down his own American, NCAA, and U.S. Open Records in the 200-yard breaststroke with a 1:47.91,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmB3UMR84k8 beating second place Anton McKee by 3.31 seconds. Licon\u2019s opening 100 split of his 200 breaststroke (51.42) was so quick that it would\u2019ve been only two-hundredths slower than the third place finisher in the individual 100 breaststroke race (51.40). Licon became the first swimmer in history to break the barrier of 1:48.00 in the 200-yard breaststroke. Licon's undefeated performance was a significant factor in helping the Texas Longhorns swimming and diving team dominate the 2017 NCAA Division I Men's Swimming and Diving Championships, secure the Longhorns' third consecutive team title, and win the Longhorn men's 13th national championship in total. ===Accolades=== Licon finished his career at the University of Texas with 11 NCAA titles (7 individual, 4 relay), 18 All- America honors, 16 Big 12 titles, 6 school and Big 12 records, and was named the Big 12 Men\u2019s Swimmer of the Year twice (2015, 2017). \u201cHe became the fourth swimmer in collegiate history \u2014 and first in 17 years \u2014 to win 4 NCAA individual titles during his career.\u201d ====Big 12 Male Athlete of the Year==== Concluding his NCAA career in 2017, Licon \u201cjoined a rare group that includes Ricky Williams, Derrick Johnson and Vince Young\u201d by becoming the first swimmer ever and the fifth Longhorn to win the Big 12 Male Athlete of the Year award. Licon shared the award with Kansas Jayhawks point guard and 2017 AP Player of the Year, Frank Mason III. ====Big 12 Men\u2019s Swimmer of the Year (2015)==== Licon was voted the Big 12 Conference Men's Swimmer of the Year by league coaches after his breakout sophomore season where he defeated a pair of American record-holders back-to-back en route to his first individual NCAA titles in the 400 I.M. and 200 breaststroke. He was also a member of the NCAA and U.S. Open record-setting 4 \u00d7 100 medley relay that placed first. He placed second in the 200 I.M. behind another American record-holder, which brought his NCAA Championship medal haul to three golds and one silver. Licon was also a factor in the Longhorns' sweep of the 2015 Big 12 Championship, claiming event titles in the 200 I.M., 400 I.M. and 200 breast. ====Big 12 Men's Swimmer of the Year (2017)==== After his senior campaign, Licon was voted the Big 12 Conference Men's Swimmer of the Year for a second time. He became the first Big 12 swimmer in history to win 3 individual events at a single NCAA Championships, doing so in the 200 I.M., 100 breast, and 200 breast. Licon broke his previous NCAA, American, and U.S. Open records in the 200 breast, as well as the NCAA and U.S. Open records in the 4 \u00d7 50 and 4 \u00d7 100 medley relays. The senior completed his college career with Big 12 and program records in the 100 and 200 breast, the 200 and 400 I.M., and the 200 and 400 medley relays. In his NCAA career, Licon became the fourth swimmer in the history of college swimming and the first Big 12 swimmer to win four separate individual events at the NCAA Championships. ====El Paso Athletic Hall of Fame==== On May 2, 2018, only a year after his collegiate career had ended, Licon was inducted into the El Paso Athletic Hall of Fame, joining basketball icons Don Haskins, Nolan Richardson, Nate Archibald, Bobby Joe Hill, golf legend Lee Trevino, and former American record-holding swimmer Lara Jackson. ==Long Course== ===2014 U.S. Summer Nationals=== After his first year of collegiate swimming, Licon placed seventh in the 200-meter breaststroke at the 2014 Phillips 66 Summer National Championships with a time of 2:11.68. He also placed 13th in the 200-meter individual medley (2:01.44) and 13th in the 400-meter individual medley (4:20.79). ===2015 U.S. Summer Nationals=== Michael Phelps and Licon (right) pose on the podium after the 200 breast finals at the 2015 U.S. Summer Nationals.Following a breakout NCAA season, but recovering from mononucleosis that took five weeks out of his training,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqaAbXFtjvE Licon entered Summer Nationals in San Antonio, Texas as a threat to win multiple events. After swimming the fastest overall time in the preliminaries of the 200-meter individual medley, Licon was seeded a spot ahead of Michael Phelps headed into the finals, but ultimately got silver behind Phelps with a personal best time of 1:58.43. In the 200-meter breaststroke, Licon placed second, behind Great Britain's Craig Benson with a personal best time of 2:10.02.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0ycdUkpUrY&t;=164s Despite the loss, Licon finished ahead of Michael Phelps who swam in the same race. ===2016 U.S. Olympic Trials=== Following a stellar NCAA season just a few months prior, Licon entered the 2016 U.S. Olympic Trials in Omaha with heavy momentum to make the Olympic team. His best bet on claiming a roster spot was in the 200 breaststroke, due to the 200 I.M. spots being dueled between Olympic icons Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte. Despite just breaking the American Record in the short course 200-yard breaststroke, Licon wasn't the favorite to win the event going into Trials. Kevin Cordes was coming off a silver medal- performance in the 200-meter breaststroke from the 2015 World Championships in Kazan, and he had been producing the fastest times among U.S. swimmers in both breaststroke events since 2013. In the eyes of the media, everyone was jockeying for second place behind Cordes. At the start of the race, Cordes took it out like a rocket, splitting first at the 100-meter mark with a 1:00.77, 3-quarters of a second ahead of Licon's 1:01.45 split, and almost a second under the world record pace. At the 150-meter mark, Licon turned in third place behind Cordes and just behind Josh Prenot, with all 3 swimmers still under the world record pace. As they were heading down home stretch, Prenot began to surge ahead of Licon and Cordes, with Licon gaining ground on Cordes. As he approached the last five meters, Licon's only hope at an Olympic berth laid with out-touching Cordes for silver. They both lunged for the wall, but Cordes managed to touch second, just 14-hundredths ahead of Licon. Licon settled for third place (2:08.14) behind Cordes (2:08.00), being shut out of the Olympic team in heart-breaking fashion. Licon also finished eighth in the 100-meter breaststroke final,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgWQa2eS1f0 recording a 1:00.61. ===2017=== ====2017 U.S. Summer Nationals==== After a heartbreaking third place finish in the 200-meter breaststroke at the Olympic Trials the previous year, Licon entered Summer Nationals with high expectations as a newly-minted professional athlete. In the 200-meter breaststroke, Licon ultimately swam a 2:09.68https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=va0oa6vm4oM for fifth place, well off his personal best time that he set the year prior. He also placed sixth in the 100-meter breaststrokehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzYOVoXLWEo with a 1:00.67 and sixth as well in the 200-meter individual medleyhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShpZzB7mKXc with a 1:58.90. His swims in the 200-meter breaststroke and the 200-meter individual medley qualified him for the 2017 World University Games in Taipei, Taiwan. ====2017 World University Games==== At the 2017 World University Games, Licon was named co- captain of Team USA, alongside teammates Ryan Held, Ella Eastin, and Ali Deloof. He finished seventh in the 200-meter breaststroke with a time of 2:10.75 and ninth in the 200-meter individual medley with a 2:01.44, just missing the A final in the latter. ===2018 U.S. Summer Nationals=== Licon came in third place in the 200-meter breaststroke, posting a time of 2:08.72. Andrew Wilson placed second with a time of 2:08.71, finishing 1-hundredth of a second ahead of Licon, which ultimately kept Licon from competing in the 2018 Pan Pacific Swimming Championships by the slimmest of margins. Licon also placed eighth in the 100-meter breaststroke (1:00.53) and ninth in the 200-meter individual medley, winning the B Final in 1:59.39. His times in the 200 breaststroke and the 200 individual medley qualified himself for the 2019 Pan American Games in Lima, Peru. ===2019 Pan American Games=== With his first international breakout swim meet of his career, Will Licon produced a lifetime-best in the 200-meter breaststroke, winning his first major international medal in 2:07.62 over countryman Nic Fink (2:08.16) to annihilate the previous Pan American Games record of 2:09.82. That time vaulted Licon to seventh in the world in 2019 for that event, as well as making him the fastest American in 2019. In his second event, he matched his previous gold medal with another gold in the 200-meter individual medley by taking down Brazilians Caio Pumputis and Leonardo Coelho Santos with a time of 1:59.13. Licon's gold in the 200-meter individual medley was the first time that a United States male swimmer won this event at the Pan American Games since Ron Karnaugh's victory in 1991. ==International Swimming League== On June 18, 2019, Licon announced his commitment to swim professionally for the LA Current in the newly-formed International Swimming League, which would be swum exclusively in short course meters. ===2019 Season=== In the inaugural ISL season and his ISL debut in Lewisville, Texas, as well as his debut in short course meters swimming, Licon competed in four events. On day 1, he finished sixth in the 50 m breaststroke and second in the 200 m breaststroke with a 2:04.33, just behind London Roar's Matthew Wilson (2:03.93) in the latter. In the 4 \u00d7 100-meter medley relay, Licon, alongside Olympians Ryan Murphy and Tom Shields, finished second to the London Roar while splitting a 57.32 on the breaststroke leg. On the second day, Licon finished fourth in the 100-meter breaststroke. Licon elected to opt out of the ISL match in Budapest to continue training stateside. At the ISL American Derby in College Park, Maryland, Licon finished third in the 100 and 200-meter breaststrokes, going 57.33 and 2:04.09 respectively, which improved upon both of his times from the previous month. His 4 \u00d7 100 m medley relay was disqualified due to an exchange error between Licon and backstroker Shane Ryan. At the ISL finale, hosted at the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, the Current entered as a dark horse to win the team title. Licon competed in the 50 breast next to long course world record- holder, Adam Peaty. Not known for his sprinting abilities, Licon got sixth place, but still managed to beat out iconic sprint sensation Caeleb Dressel. In his next individual race, the 200 breaststroke, Licon was slated to swim his best event amongst a historically stacked field that included short course world record-holder Kirill Prigoda, long course world record-holder Anton Chupkov, long course American record-holder Josh Prenot, Matthew Wilson (the second-fastest 200-meter breaststroke performer of all time in long course), Ilya Shymanovich (the second-fastest long course 100-meter breaststroker of all time behind Adam Peaty), Andrew Wilson (World Championship Finalist), and Nic Fink (8-time NCAA All-American and World Championship finalist). Licon took out the race hard, hitting the 100-meter mark almost 8-tenths of a second ahead of the next swimmer. On the last lap, Licon began to fatigue and Fink stormed down the last length to just out-touch Licon for first. Licon's time of 2:02.42 was a new personal best and just 9-hundredths off the American record. Licon and his 4 \u00d7 100 medley relay got sixth place with Licon splitting a 56.64. The LA Current wound up settling for a distant fourth place team finish. ==College Education and Personal Life== Licon attended the University of Texas at Austin from 2013-2018 and graduated with a degree in sport management. During his career at UT, Licon was a member of Big 12 Commissioner's Honor Roll (Fall 2013), 2-time Athletic Director's Honor Roll (2015, 2017), 2013-14 Academic All-Big 12 Rookie Team, 2015 Academic All-Big 12 (First Team), 2016 Academic All-Big 12 (First Team), and 2017 Academic All- Big 12 (Second Team). From 2016-2018, Licon was a member of the Texas Cowboys student organization at the University of Texas. In 2017, Licon was inducted into the Friar Society, which is the \"oldest and most prestigious\" honor society at the University of Texas. ==Personal bests== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#eee;\" ! colspan=\"5\" | Short Course Yards |- style=\"background:#eee;\" !
