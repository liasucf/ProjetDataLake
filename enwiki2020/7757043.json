    "text": "Alford and Alder (Engineers) Ltd. (established 1925 in Hemel Hempstead - closed 1969) was a British automotive engineering company that specialized in suspension, brake and steering gear components. It achieved early fame for supplying Malcolm Campbell's speed-record making Bluebird (1927\u20131935). The company changed its name to Alforder Newton Ltd (1959) as it was acquired by Standard Motor Company, a purchase that financially troubled the buyer greatly. A rack and pinion steering setup was used in the Triumph TR4 and Triumph Spitfire which, together with the Herald steering column, became one of the most widely used assemblies in the British specialist car industry during the 1950s and 1960s, including Turner and TVR. Even the Lotus lineup - Elan, Plus2, Europa - used the Alford & Alder steering rack, column and uprights. They also made suspension components for the Maserati 3500. Alford & Alder was part of Leyland Cars through its SU Butec division in the 1970s and expanded to make front axle assemblies for trucks at its Eastman Way site. The company operated at the two Hemel Hempstead sites until at least 1980. ==References== ==External links== *Archives at University of Warwick Category:Automotive companies of England Category:1925 establishments in England Category:Companies based in Hemel Hempstead Category:British companies established in 1925 Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1925 ",
