    "text": "Mario Arroyo is a Gibraltarian poet and former school teacher. He is the author of Profiles (1994), a series of bilingual meditations on love, loneliness and death. In 2009 he was described by the Spanish newspaper El Pais as 'un perfecto bilingue'. A study commissioned by the prestigious Spanish cultural body el Instituto Cervantes in 2005 remarked that Arroyo's poetry possessed \"indudable inspiraci\u00f3n en la experiencia vivida y en la realidad local, aunque a diferencia de otros escritores gibraltare\u00f1os no cae en reductores localismos, sino que es capaz de dar una significaci\u00f3n trascendente a sus reflexiones personales.\" Arroyo is also a noted dancer. In September 2015 Arroyo was awarded the Gibraltar Medallion of Honour for his contribution to the arts. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Gibraltarian writers Category:European poets Category:Male poets Category:Male dancers ",
