    "text": "The 2019 South American Cricket Championship was a cricket tournament took place in Lima, Peru from 3 to 6 October 2019. This was the sixteenth edition of the men's South American Cricket Championship, and the first in which matches were eligible for T20I status, since the ICC granted Twenty20 International (T20I) status to matches between all of its Members. Mexico were the defending champions having won the event in 2018. The seven participating teams were the national sides of hosts Peru, along with Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay. Colombia and Uruguay were not Associate Members of the ICC and so matches involving either of these teams did not have T20I status. Argentina defeated Mexico by four wickets in the final. ==Squads== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; margin:auto\" |- ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |- style=\"vertical-align:top\" | * Hern\u00e1n Fennell (c) * Bruno Angeltti * Pedro Arrighi * Pedro Baron * Ramiro Escobar (wk) * Alejandro Ferguson * Jonathan Hurley * Agustin Husain * Inaki Jimenez * Lautaro Musiani * Santiago Rossi * Mart\u00edn Siri * Ruann Van Der Merwe | * Greigor Caisley (c) * Fahad Ali * Jaimin Allen * Richard Avery * Kamal Bishnoi * Luiz Goncalves (wk) * Yasar Haroon * Victor Poubel * Luis Rodrigues * Muhammad Saleem * Kevin Silva * John Singleton * Ismat Ullah | * Kamlesh Gupta (c)(wk) * Alex Carthew * Chris Emmott * Shoaib Gazi Hossain * Ignacio Lisboa * Major Mandy * Michael Meade * Irfan Mir * Hirenkumar Patel * Mayanak Patel * Rolando Rivas * Hardev Singh * Aresh Srivastav * Amit Uniyal | * Nick Barsby * Mark Edelston * Oliver Farr * Andy Farrington * Daniel Hall * Viresh Kavikar * Chris Laas * Guy Leslie * Aniket Medellin * Sanjay Pandya * Chris Payne * Patrick Raikes * Satnam Sandhu * Paddy Smallwood (wk) * Olly West | * Tarun Sharma (c) * Kaushal Kumar (wk) * Revanakumar Ankad * Aman Arora * Buddhadeb Banerjee (wk) * Gaurav Dutta * Luis Hermida * Shashikant Laxman * Shantanu Kaveri * Mahesh Nandela * Anurag Tripathi * Jagdeesh Umanath * Andrew Westphal | * Matthew Spry (c) * Shaikh Ashraf * Joel Corpus * Diego de la Puente * Henry Dixon * Hafez Farooq * Steven Hallett (wk) * Mohsin Hub * Alexander James * Waqar Khan * Suresh Kumar * Christopher Mahoney * Oliver Marshall * Joaquin Salazar * Pravin Shamdasani * Jagjit Singh | * Boopathy Ravi (c) * Althaf Ahmed * Beerbal Abdulkhader * Vatsal Desai * Gokul G. * Soham Gupta * Syed Hidhayathullah * Gopi Krishnan * Nishant M.V. * Avijit Mukherjee * Savin Prakash * Rajendra Rathod * Jashwant Reddy (wk) * Allister Sharp * Rob Sharp * Ramsoorya Singaram * Deeshan Vasagiri |} ==Round-robin== ===Points table=== ===Matches=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ==Final== ==See also== * 2019 South American Cricket Championship \u2013 Women's tournament ==References== ==External links== * Series home at ESPN Cricinfo Category:Associate international cricket competitions in 2019\u201320 Category:International cricket competitions in Peru ",
