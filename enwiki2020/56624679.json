Muheim went onto enjoy an impressive debut season, netting eleven times in nineteen games during the under-18 campaign and made his under-21 debut a year later. However, during the 2016\u201317 campaign, Muheim became a bit-player and therefore, returned to his boyhood club, Z\u00fcrich on loan for the remainder of the campaign. Muheim failed to make a single appearance during his time back at Z\u00fcrich and instead returned to Chelsea in June 2017. On 31 January 2018, Muheim returned to Switzerland to join Swiss Super League club St. Gallen on a permanent basis. Four days later, he made his professional debut during St. Gallen's 2\u20130 away defeat against Young Boys, replacing Silvan G\u00f6nitzer in the 80th minute. ==International career== Muheim has represented Switzerland consecutively from under-15 to under-19 level. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Swiss Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |Chelsea |2016\u201317 |Premier League |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0 |- |Z\u00fcrich (loan) |2016\u201317 |Swiss Challenge League |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|St. Gallen |2017\u201318 |Swiss Super League |1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0 |- |2018\u201319 |Swiss Super League |1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0 |- |2019\u201320 |Swiss Super League |21||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||22||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !23!!0!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!24!!0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !23!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!24!!0 |} ==References== Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:People from the canton of Uri Category:Swiss footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Swiss Super League players Category:Swiss Challenge League players Category:FC Z\u00fcrich players Category:Chelsea F.C. players Category:FC St. Gallen players Category:Switzerland youth international footballers ",
