    "text": "The Kernm\u00fcnsterland is a major landscape unit in western Germany. It covers an area of about 2700 km\u00b2 and lies at the heart of the Westphalian Basin and the historic region of M\u00fcnsterland in the north of Westphalia. It is bounded to the west, north and east by the sandy countryside of the Westm\u00fcnsterland and Ostm\u00fcnsterland, whilst in the south it is bordered by the loess landscapes of the Hellweg B\u00f6rde and Emscherland. Geologically it rises clearly over the surrounding area on a bed of thinly covered Upper Cretaceous strata.E. Meynen and J. Schmith\u00fcsen: Handbuch der naturr\u00e4umlichen Gliederung Deutschlands - Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Landeskunde, 6th edition Remagen 1959 (total of 9 editions in 8 books 1953-1962, updated 1960 1:1,000,000 map with major units) The Kernm\u00fcnsterland is roughly bounded by the valley of the River Lippe to the south and that of the Ems to the northeast, the Lippe valley being considered part of Kernm\u00fcnsterland, whilst the Ems valley is counted as part of Ostm\u00fcnsterland. To the west it is bordered by the hills of the Baumberge (up to 188 m) and the Sch\u00f6ppingen Ridge (up to 158 m) to the northwest and the Haltern Hills (up to 154 m - Hohe Mark, Borkenberge and Haard) to the southwest, the Baumberge and Sch\u00f6ppingen Ridge being included in Kernm\u00fcnsterland, whilst the Haltern Hills are part of Westm\u00fcnsterland. Another ridge, the Beckum Hills (up to 174 m) to the southeast is its own major landscape unit. == Location == Kernm\u00fcnsterland includes the city of M\u00fcnster (less the northeast part) to the north, the district of Coesfeld (less the extreme west with Coesfeld and Billerbeck) to the west, the district of Warendorf (less the north with Sassenberg, Warendorf-Nord, Telgte and Ostbevern) to the east the centre of the historic M\u00fcnsterland. == References == == External links == * Natural region maps from the individual 1:200,000 sheets by the Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Landeskunde - relevant here are all units beginning with \"541\" on: **Sheet 83/84 - Osnabr\u00fcck/Bentheim (west and centre) **Sheet 95/96 - Kleve/Wesel (east) **Sheet 97 - M\u00fcnster **Blatt 98 - Detmold (small areas in the west) Category:M\u00fcnster (region) Category:Regions of North Rhine-Westphalia !
