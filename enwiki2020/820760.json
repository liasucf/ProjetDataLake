    "text": "Acarape is a municipality in the north region of the state of Cear\u00e1, Brazil. ==History== One can attribute the existence of Acarape as simply an urban extension of the city of Reden\u00e7\u00e3o given that only 3 km separate the two cities. Initially the location of today's Acarape was called Calaboca which was part of the city of Reden\u00e7\u00e3o. When the slaves were freed in Brazil, the people of the very modest location of Calaboca decided to play homage to their origins, thus changing the name to Acarape which means \"from the Acar\u00e1s\". Before the change above, Calaboca benefited from rail track linking Fortaleza to Baturit\u00e9 and the establishment of a rail station in Calaboca on October 26, 1879. Being part of a major rail route served as an incentive for small merchants to open stores in Calaboca. The population grew and on April 16, 1987, the location became a municipality with the name of Acarape. == Agriculture == * Sugarcane * Bean == Industries == * Cacha\u00e7a: Ypi\u00f3ca group == Curiosities == Acarape is also used by the population as a reference to city water. If one person says to be drinking water from Acarape, this person is saying that the water is tap water. This is the case, because one of the largest dams in the state of Cear\u00e1 is the Acarape do Meio Dam at Reden\u00e7\u00e3o. == External links == * Satellite view of Acarap\u00e9 * Location of city within the state * Cacha\u00e7a Ypi\u00f3ca produced in Acarap\u00e9 Category:Municipalities in Cear\u00e1 ",
