The song was released on 14 June 2016 as the album's lead single. It was featured as a track in the soundtrack for FIFA 17 by EA Sports. == Lyrics and composition == \"Are We Ready? (Wreck)\" is an indie pop song inspired by Prince and David Bowie whose lyrics critique the materialistic tendencies of today's society. The band's lead singer, Alex Trimble, said of writing the song: > While I was writing this single I discovered this term weltschmertz, the > German word for being at odds with the world around you. The fact that it > was a fully coined term and related to so many people that have existed and > do exist made me feel it was okay to not exist on the same level as everyone > else, it was okay to be comfortable doing your own thing. \u2018Are We Ready? > (Wreck)\u2019 was me\u2026 not attacking the world around me but outlining why I don\u2019t > really get it and why I don\u2019t fit in with it. == Music video == A music video for the single was released on the band's official YouTube account on July 6, 2016. The video, directed by New Zealand duo Thunderlips, depicts the members of the band in prosthetics in several retro advertisements for products which feature the lyrics of the song. == Critical reception == The song was well received by critics. Rhian Daly of NME called the song \"polished minimalism\" while mentioning its commentary on consumer culture, saying \"It oozes dissatisfaction, a desolate critique of a world where we're becoming zombies to materialism and technology by someone who's yet to succumb to it like those around him.\" In another review, Paste Magazine's Molly Morgan states that the song \"encompasses all that we love already about TDCC: it\u2019s dance-y, light and fun\" while the darker lyrics \"hold greater meaning to the band\". == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (2016) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |align=\"center\"|166 |- !scope=\"row\"|Mexico Singles (Mexico Ingles Airplay) |align=\"center\"|50 |- |} ==References== Category:2016 singles Category:2016 songs Category:Two Door Cinema Club songs Category:Song recordings produced by Jacknife Lee Category:Songs written by Jacknife Lee Category:Parlophone singles ",
