    "text": "A Silver Ameraucana cock with a pea comb, typical to the breed A pea comb is one type of chicken combs. It manifests as three connected rows of caruncles in the form of conjoined pea-like protrusions. Pea combs begin at the base of the beak and extend towards the top of a chicken's head. Pea combs are smaller than other combs length-wise and do not extend upwards. More prominent types of combs are more likely to suffer from frostbite, leading to theories that pea combs may be beneficial for breeds common in colder climes. This type of comb is present in Araucana, Ameraucana, Buckeye, Brahma, Cornish, and Cubalaya breeds. ==References== Category:Chickens Category:Bird anatomy ",
