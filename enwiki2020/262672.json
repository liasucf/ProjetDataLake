    "text": "Morbier is a semi-soft cows' milk cheese of France named after the small village of Morbier in Franche-Comt\u00e9. It is ivory colored, soft and slightly elastic, and is immediately recognizable by the distinctive thin black layer separating it horizontally in the middle. It has a rind that is yellowish, moist, and leathery. Traditionally, the cheese consists of a layer of morning milk and a layer of evening milk. When making Comt\u00e9, cheesemakers would end the day with leftover curd that was not enough for an entire cheese. Thus, they would press the remaining evening curd into a mold, and spread ash over it to protect it overnight. The following morning, the cheese would be topped up with morning milk. Nowadays, the cheese is usually made from a single milking with the traditional ash line replaced by vegetable dye. The Jura and Doubs versions both benefit from an appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC), though other non-AOC Morbier exist on the market. The aroma of Morbier cheese is mild, having a semblance to Raclette cheese in consistency and aroma, with a rich and creamy flavour. ==See also== *List of French cheeses *List of cheeses ==References== * Category:French cheeses Category:French products with protected designation of origin Category:Cow's-milk cheeses ",
