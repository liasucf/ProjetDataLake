    "text": "Radix natalensis is a species of freshwater snail, an aquatic gastropod mollusc in the family Lymnaeidae. This species occurs widely in Africa. It is a major intermediate host for Fasciola gigantica in Africa. Placement of this species in the genus Radix was confirmed by Correa et al. (2010). == Distribution == Radix natalensis is a widespread species in Africa, occurring from northern Africa to southern Africa: * Northern Africa: Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Sudan. There are also findings of distribution of Radix natalensis in Algeria 8-10,000 years ago. * Western Africa: Benin, Burkina Faso, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal, Sarr A., Kinzelbach R. & Diouf M. (2011, in press). \"Diversit\u00e9 sp\u00e9cifique et \u00e9cologie des mollusques continenatux de la basse vall\u00e9e du Ferlo (S\u00e9n\u00e9gal). [Specific diversity and ecology of continental molluscs from the Lower Ferlo Valley (Senegal)]\". MalaCo 7: 8 pp. PDF . * Eastern Africa: Burundi, Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Somalia, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. * Central Africa: Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. * Southern Africa: Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Rhodesia. * Madagascar The type locality is in \"pools in Port Natal\", which today is Durban, South Africa. == Description == Radix natalensis was described by the German scientist and traveller Christian Ferdinand Friedrich Krauss in 1848. The shape of the shell is elongate ovoid.Wright C. A. (1963). \"The freshwater gastropod mollusca of Angola\". Bulletin of the British Museum (Natural History) 10(8): 447-528. 16 plates. page 493. The shell is colorless or light brown in color. The height of the aperture covers about 3/4 of the shell height. The lip of the aperture is thin and sharp. The umbilicus is closed. The width of the shell is about 5.75\u20137 mm. The height of the shell is 4.6-19.2 mm. {| ||Drawing of apertural and abapertural view of the shell of Radix natalensis from its original description by Christian Ferdinand Friedrich Krauss in 1848. ||Drawing of lateral view of the shell. |} The reproductive system and radula was described by Wright (1963) in detail. == Ecology == Radix natalensis lives in permanent water bodies. An estimated density of Radix natalensis in a natural habitat in Tanzania was 34 snails per m\u00b2. The snails lived mainly in the shallow water in depths of 0\u20134 cm, mainly between 20\u201330 cm from the shoreline. They prefer plant detritus or bedrock as a substrate. Laboratory experiments have shown that some larger snails of Radix natalensis can survive on a wooden surface without water for up to 21 days. Some smaller snails of Radix natalensis have survived desiccation on a soil surface up to 60 days on \"black\" soil. Some smaller snails of Radix natalensis were able to survive for up to 90 days on soil among sedges (Cyperus) or in the \"black\" soil exposed to sun or in the soil with stones. Parasites of Radix natalensis include: * Fasciola hepatica * Fasciola giganticaSoliman M. F. M. (2008). \"Epidemiological review of human and animal fascioliasis in Egypt\". The Journal of Infection in Developing Countries 2(3): 182-189. abstract. PDF * Trichobilharzia sp. * some cercaria from Echinostomatidae * some xiphidiocercaria from Plagiorchiidae * four trematode larvae in Zambia Predators of Radix natalensis include leeches Helobdella nilae and Alboglossiphonia conjugata. Snails of the non-indigenous species Marisa cornuarietis eliminated Radix natalensis and other two native snail species from a small pond in Tanzania in an experiment in 1982.
