According to a report by Clean Edge: The Clean Tech Marketing Authority, the recovery act included more than $70 billion in tax credits and direct spending for programs involving clean energy and transportation.Clean Edge: The Clean Tech Marketing Authority Clean Energy Trends 2009 March 2009 The White House website states that the recovery act provided more than $80 billion in clean energy investments:http://www.whitehouse.gov Energy & Environment > \u2022 $111 billion for a smart grid to connect rural energy-producing sites with > cities, and smarter use of energy within homes, > \u2022 $55 billion to weatherize low-income homes, > \u2022 $41.5 billion to reduce the federal government's own energy bill by > making federal buildings more energy efficient, > \u2022 $62.3 billion to support state and local energy efforts, > \u2022 $6000 million (six billion to keep continuity with other numbers)train > people for green jobs, and > \u2022 $29 billion to promote investments in battery storage technologies. > Clean Edge lists other recent policies of the Obama Administration to support the clean energy sector in the U.S.:Clean Edge: The Clean Tech Marketing Authority Clean Energy Trends 2009 March 2009 > \u2022 Extending the investment tax credit for solar energy, > \u2022 Extending the production tax credit for wind energy, > \u2022 Allowing utilities to participate in income tax credits, and > \u2022 Allowing renewable energy developers to receive government grants instead > of tax credits. In his 2011 State of the Union Address, President Obama called for a goal, \"By 2035, 80 percent of America's electricity will come from clean energy sources.\" NPR Obama's State of the Union Address January 2011 In January 2017, President Obama published an article arguing that private-sector incentives will help drive decoupling of emissions and economic growth. He calls this the irreversible momentum of clean energy, which he says may occur independently of the near-term policy choices of the Trump presidency. https://energytransition.org/2017/01/the-irreversible-momentum-of-clean- energy/ ===Aftermath of Japanese Earthquake and Tsunami=== One of President Obama's suggestions for cleaner energy options was the use of nuclear power plants. But after the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan and its power plants, the $54 billion in loan guarantees the president has asked Congress to approve seem doubtful.BusinessWeek Nuclear-Power Plan Set Back March 14, 2011 Concerns have grown over the nuclear plants in California because, similar to Japan, they are also located on fault lines. But Per Peterson, former Chair of the nuclear-engineering department at the University of California, Berkeley has reassured people that the fault lines lack the same danger and potential of disaster as Japan.Wall Street Journal Obama's Energy Policy Faces Pressure March 16, 2011 ==Energy Security== In a speech on March 31, 2010 at Andrews Air Force Base, President Obama outlined a new energy security plan. The president's plan includes initiatives such as raising fuel efficiency standards. He also announced a decision to double the number of hybrid vehicles in the federal government's fleet, and made a decision to expand domestic offshore oil and gas exploration in Alaska and off the southwest coast (this is either the \"southwestern United States\" or \"South and Eastern Coasts of the United States\" The southwestern coast of the USA is from San Diego to about Santa Barbara CA and no new drilling was approve there). the United States.CNN Obama energy plan would open Atlantic and Gulf drilling April 1, 2010 (Link Inactive) Following up on Obama's speech, the White House blog released a statement on how the administration plans to boost domestic energy production, diversify America's energy portfolio, and promote clean energy innovation with three tactics: *Landmark car and truck fuel standards *Leading by example - Greening the federal fleet *Department of Defense energy security strategic emphasishttp://www.whitehouse.gov A Comprehensive Plan for Energy Security March 31, 2010 Since 2008 American oil production has increased by 70%, mostly due to drilling on private or State lands (not Federal).\"Bad News For U.S. Drillers As Saudis Signal No Cuts To Oil Output.\" ==Reactions and analysis of energy and climate security== The Center for a New American Security (CNAS) wrote recommendations on how to improve upon the energy security plan. In 2009, CNAS and its author, Christine Parthemore \"convened a group of scientists, investors, business executives, academics, nonprofit representatives, defense professionals, and federal, state, and local officials to discuss how to implement President Obama\u2019s energy and climate security goals.\"Center for a New American Security CNAS Final Recommendations June 2009 CNAS recommended three strategies for the administration to help move forward with the energy security plan: * Draft a comprehensive national strategy, * Link that strategy to a major, systems- level demonstration project for a future, low-carbon energy economy, and * Create a scorecard to track progress and capture lessons learned from the historical level of federal investment in energy and climate security. ==See also== *Climate change policy of the Obama administration ==References== Category:Public policy of the Obama administration Obama ",
