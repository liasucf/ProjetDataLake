    "text": "Maria Jarema (24 November 1908 \u2013 1 November 1958) was a Polish painter, sculptor, scenographer and actress. ==Life and career== She was born on 24 November 1908 in Staryi Sambir (Polish: Stary Sambor) in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. In the years 1929\u20131935, she studied sculpture at the Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts in Krak\u00f3w, under supervision of Xawery Dunikowski. In 1930, she co-founded the avant-garde, radical left Krak\u00f3w Group. Before the outbreak of World War II, she mostly dealt with sculpture but after the war she focused on painting. Her works were mainly abstract paintings. Since 1951, she created monotypes. Using this printmaking technique and sometimes combining it with oil paints and distemper, she created her most famous cycles of paintings \u2013 Penetracje (Penetrations) and Rytmy (Rhythms). Her works show a great fascination with the human shape and its place in space as well as the depiction of movement in painting. Balancing between figurative displays and abstract signs is also a distinctive feature of her paintings. She was one of the founders of the avant-garde theatre Cricot (1933\u20131938) alongside J\u00f3zef Jarema, Henryk Gotlib and Zbigniew Pronaszko. She is also known for her artistic collaboration with Tadeusz Kantor and his experimental theatre Cricot 2 as well as Adam Polewka's puppet theatre. Her paintings have been exhibited in a number of museums in Poland including the Zach\u0119ta National Gallery of Art. In 2018, her painting Formy (Forms) was sold at an auction for over 1 million zloty (ca. $270,000), which made it the most expensive painting by a female artist sold in Poland at the time. In 2019, Agnieszka Dauksza published a Nike Award-nominated book Jaremianka. Biografia focusing on the life of Jarema and her artisitc legacy. ==Personal life== She was a sister of painter J\u00f3zef Jarema and actor W\u0142adys\u0142aw Jarema \u2013 the founder of the Groteska Theatre in Krak\u00f3w. She married novelist and short story writer Kornel Filipowicz. ==See also== *List of Polish painters *List of Polish sculptors ==References== Category:1908 births Category:1958 deaths Category:20th-century Polish painters Category:Polish women painters Category:Polish sculptors Category:Artists from Krak\u00f3w Category:Sibling artists Category:Polish women sculptors Category:20th-century painters Category:20th-century Polish women artists ",
