    "text": "Kards is a free-to-play World War II-themed online digital collectible card game developed and published by 1939 Games. It was released in early access on Steam on April 12, 2019 and was fully released on April 15, 2020. Mobile ports are expected to be released in 2021 with crossplay capabilities between platforms. == Gameplay == Kards is a turned-based collectible card game. It is played between two players, each with a deck of 40 cards themed around strategies of powers during World War II: Nazi Germany, Great Britain, Soviet Union, the United States, Imperial Japan, France, and Fascist Italy. For example, a German deck relies on Blitzkrieg to overwhelm the opponent with tanks. The objective is to destroy the enemy's headquarters represented by a card on the board. The playing field, called \"battlefield\" in-game, is divided into three fronts, the player's support line, front line, and the enemy's support line. The support and front line can hold up to four and five cards respectively, but units must be deployed in the player's support line when played. In order to play cards, players expend a resource called Kredit that refreshes every turn, after which the maximum Kredit increases by one, up to 12. Kredits can also be used to move military units to the front line or to attack enemy units. Once a unit has been moved to the front line, they cannot retreat back unless forced to by certain cards. The front line can only be controlled by one player at a time, as such, whoever controls it has a strategic advantage on the battlefield. === Game modes === Players can compete against a computer AI or against human opponents online based on a tiered- ranking system. Players' rank will reset after each one-month long season. Alternatively, players can play in a draft against other human players where they have to build a deck from scratch by picking one card out of three randomly chosen ones at a time, after which they will use it until they win or lose a certain number of matches, earning rewards based on their performance. There is also five single-player campaigns that players can progress through, each themed around major military campaigns from the war. == Development and release == 1939 Games was founded in 2015 by former CEO \u00cdvar Kristj\u00e1nsson and Project Lead Gudmundur Kristj\u00e1nsson of CCP Games, best known for developing Eve Online, with Kards being their first project. At first, Kards started out as a cardboard prototype and went into full production after receiving a $70,000 grant, making its first public appearance in March 2019. Over the course of its development, Kards received over $5 million in endowments from venture funds, including the Chinese investing company Tencent, to support future updates and a mobile version of the game. Card artwork was sourced and licensed from World War II enlistment posters, propaganda art, and toy box art from the 1970s and 1980s, including box art of Airfix scale model kits famously painted by Roy Cross. The game released on April 15, 2020 on PC with continued post-launch support in the form of expansions, timed-limited events, and hotfixes. Prior to its official release, the game received over 250,000 downloads on Steam with a record peak of over 2,700 concurrent players. == Reception == Kards received \"generally favorable reviews\" for PC according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The game was praised for its polished presentation and fair monetization model, being comparable to other games of the same genre such as Hearthstone and Magic: The Gathering Arena while differentiating with its style of gameplay. == References == == External Links == * Category:2020 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Digital collectible card games Category:Free-to-play video games Category:IOS games Category:MacOS games Category:Windows games Category:Video games containing loot boxes Category:Video games developed in Iceland Category:Indie video games Category:World War II video games ",
