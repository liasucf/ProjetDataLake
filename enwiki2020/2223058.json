    "text": "A Deeper Kind of Slumber is the 1997 Century Media Records release by Swedish band Tiamat. Featuring female background vocals by Birgit Zacher (Moonspell, Angel Dust) and experimentation with a variety of influences, the album marked the group's first complete withdrawal from both death metal and conventional heavy metal, following their 1994 release, Wildhoney. It was also the first production after their relocation to Germany, and was written almost entirely by founder/lead songwriter Johan Edlund. Much of the music had reflected on Edlund's personal relationship with drugs, creative differences within the band as well as an interpersonal relationship. ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1997) !Peak position |- | Swedish Albums Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|39 |} ==Credits== ===Tiamat=== *Johan Edlund \u2013 vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards, theremin, co-production *Thomas Petersson \u2013 electric and acoustic guitars *Anders Iwers \u2013 bass guitar *Lars Sk\u00f6ld \u2013 drums ===Additional personnel=== *Inchtabokatables \u2013 violin, cello *Sami Yli-Sirni\u00f6 \u2013 sitar *Ertugrul Coruk \u2013 flute *Anke Eilhardt \u2013 Oboe *Birgit Zacher \u2013 additional vocals *Dirk Draeger \u2013 keyboards, engineering, production *Siggi Bemm \u2013 engineering, mixing, mastering ==References== Category:1997 albums Category:Tiamat (band) albums Category:Symphonic rock albums ",
