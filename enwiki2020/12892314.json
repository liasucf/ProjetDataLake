    "text": "The supposed nest of the Fatu-liva, showing the \"eggs\": Chappell (1921). The Fatu-liva is a fictional species of bird invented by George S. Chappell in his travel parody The Cruise of the Kawa: Wanderings in the South Seas, by Walter E. Traprock (1921). Fatu-liva were said to be found only in the fictional \"Filbert Islands\" in the South Pacific Ocean where they laid cube-like, black- spotted eggs that were very similar in appearance to dice. The bird's nest was described in the book as: > \"...a semi-spheric bowl of closely woven grass in which lay four snow-white, > polka-dotted cubes, the marvelous square eggs of the fatu-liva.\"Chappell > (1921) Additionally, a black-and-white photograph of what was supposedly the bird's dice-like eggs was provided. Its caption read: > \"This is without question the most extraordinary picture which has ever been > taken of any natural history subject. It corroborates in most convincing > manner the author's claim to the discovery of the wonderful fatu-liva bird > with its unique gift of laying square eggs. Here we see the eggs themselves > in all the beauty of their cubical form and quaint marking; here we see the > nest itself, made of delicately woven haro and brought carefully from the > tree's summit by its discoverer, Babai-Alova-Babai. An extremely interesting > feature of the picture is the presence in the nest of lapa or signal- > feather. By close observation, Mr. Whinney, the scientist of the expedition, > discovered that whenever the mother-bird left the nest in search of food she > always decorated her home with one of her wing feathers which served as a > signal to her mate that she would return shortly, which she invariably did. > Skeptics have said that it would be impossible to lay a square egg. To which > the author is justly entitled to say: 'The camera never lies.'\" The name \"Fatu-liva\" probably derives from the real island of Fatu Hiva, sometimes spelled Fatu Iva. The name Fatu Hiva means \"strange rock\" in the Marquesan language. \"Fatu-liva\" is a theoretically possible transcription of terms like fatu riva (\"encircled rock\") in some Polynesian languages.Tregear (1891) ==See also== *Gillygaloo *The Ascent of Rum Doodle ==Footnotes== ==References== * (1921): The Cruise of the Kawa: Wanderings in the South Seas, by Walter E.
