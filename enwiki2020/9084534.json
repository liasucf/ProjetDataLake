The plot involves an insurance investigator (Trevor) who infiltrates a gang who had stolen jewels from the eponymous building on Maiden Lane in the Fulton Street District of Manhattan. The neighborhood had been the center of New York City's Diamond District since the 19th century before its gradual relocation uptown to 47th Street after World War II. The Museum of Modern Art in New York City screened a restored print of the film in June 2013 as part of an Allan Dwan retrospective. ==Cast== * Claire Trevor as Jane Martin * Cesar Romero as Frank Peyton * Lloyd Nolan as Detective Walsh * Douglas Fowley as Nick Shelby * Lester Matthews as Gilbert Lockhart * Robert McWade as John Graves * Holmes Herbert as Harold Anderson * Paul Fix as Agitator ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1936 films Category:American films Category:English- language films Category:1936 crime films Category:American detective films Category:American black-and-white films Category:New York City in fiction Category:Films directed by Allan Dwan Category:20th Century Fox films ",
