Silicateins, the major biosilica forming enzymes present in demosponges: protein analysis and phylogenetic relationship. Gene, 395(1-2), pp.62-71. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2007.02.014. Environmental silicates are absorbed by specific biota, including diatoms, radiolaria, silicoflagellates, and siliceous sponges; silicateins have so far only been found in sponges. Silicateins are homologous to the cysteine protease cathepsin.Otzen D. (2012). The role of proteins in biosilicification. Scientifica, 2012, 867562. https://doi.org/10.6064/2012/867562Shimizu, K., Cha, J., Stucky, G.D. and Morse, D.E., 1998. Silicatein \u03b1: cathepsin L-like protein in sponge biosilica. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 95(11), pp.6234-6238. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.95.11.6234 In sponges, the silicatein enzymes reside in the axial filaments of the axial canals of the siliceous spicules. In contrast, diatoms do not use silicateins but rather small specialised peptides called silaffins which attach long chain polyamines (LCPAs) to lysine groups. Free LCPAs can also cooperate with silaffins. Both silicateins and silaffins form higher-order structures which act both as structural templates (for exoskeletons) and mechanistic catalysts for the polycondensation reactions of silicon-compounds. The Venus' flower basket siliceous sponge is a well-known example of an organism that utilises silicatein. It is known for its remarkable ability to extract silicic acid from surrounding seawater, which is then converted into complex 3D silica structures at ambient temperatures underwater, something human engineering capabilities are unable to replicate without the use of high-temperature. Another example of silicatein-utilising organisms are the suberites, a genus of sea sponge in the family Suberitidae. Suberites consist mostly of cells, in contrast with other Porifera (such as the class Hexactinellida, to which the Venus' flower basket belongs) which are syncytial.W.

Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A 129, 433 (2001). https://doi.org/10.1016/s1095-6433(00)00360-3 The extracellular matrix of siliceous spicules give suberites their structural foundation; these consist of bio-silica, a silicon dioxide polymer.W.
