    "text": "The Al Noor Mosque (, ') is a Sunni mosque in the Christchurch suburb of Riccarton in New Zealand. It was the primary target of the Christchurch mosque shootings of 15 March 2019. == History == The Al Noor Mosque was built in 1984\u20131985 by the Muslim Association of Canterbury, an organization founded in 1977 that also manages the mosque building. The Saudi Arabian government donated NZ$460,000 towards its construction. In 2003, the Christchurch Muslim community organised a \"National M\u0101ori Muslim Day\" at the mosque. By 2015, the mosque had 550 members. == Terror attacks == left On 15 March 2019, the site was a target in the Christchurch mosque shootings. Of the 51 people fatally shot overall in the attack, 44 victims died in Al Noor. The mosque reopened on 23 March. == Controversies == In 2003, controversy arose within the local Muslim community over the mosque's management. The arrival of new members of Arab and Somali origin sparked tension with the earlier members of South Asian origin, who have a different culture and have a different interpretation of Islam. In 2014, an Australian convert was alleged by his mother and stepfather that he was introduced to radical Islam at Al Noor before going to Yemen to join al-Qaeda, an allegation denied by Hisham el-Zeiny, the mosque's imam. The president of the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand, Anwar Ghani, said that mosque officials had told a Salafi follower not to promote his views there. El-Zeiny said that many Muslims were angry about US drone strikes in Yemen and that the mosque's leadership was \"spending most of [its] time trying to lessen the effect.\" == See also == *Islam in New Zealand ==References== ==External links== * Muslim Association of Canterbury Category:1980s architecture in New Zealand Category:1985 establishments in New Zealand Category:Christchurch mosque shootings Category:Mosques completed in 1985 Category:Mosques in New Zealand Category:Religious buildings and structures in Christchurch Category:Mosque buildings with domes Category:Sunni mosques ",
