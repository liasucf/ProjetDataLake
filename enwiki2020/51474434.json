    "text": "\"Angel\" is a song by American R&B; singer-songwriter Amanda Perez. It was featured on her 2003 album of the same name, and performed well in the US, where it reached the top five on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 and the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was also a top-five hit in Australia and New Zealand, reaching number one in the latter country for two weeks. ==Release== The song was released in the US as a CD single on May 20, 2003. The D-Lo Urban Remix was released to US radio as a Single Mix for Promo. It was also released digitally. ==Reception== ===Critical=== The review by AllMusic praised her vocal performance and named it the best song on its parent album. ===Commercial=== The song was a commercial success internationally. In the United States, it reached number 20 on the Billboard Hot 100, spending 19 weeks on the chart. The song also reached number 20 on the Radio Songs chart, on which it spent 20 weeks. On the Rhythmic chart, the song reached number 13. The song was most successful in the US on the Mainstream Top 40/Pop Songs chart, where it reached number 3 and spent 25 total weeks. The track also hit number 7 on MTV's Total Request Live. The song was also extremely successful in New Zealand. On the New Zealand singles chart, the single reached number one, spending for two weeks atop the chart in June 2003. The following month, \"Angel\" reached number 2 on the Australian singles chart. \"Angel\" appeared on the year-end charts for the US, Australia, and New Zealand. Billboard ranked the song as the 69th most-successful of 2003 in the US. The song was also ranked at number 13 on ARIA's list of top 100 songs of 2003 and number 15 on the New Zealand year-end chart for 2003. Perez's subsequent singles failed to break the Top 40 in any country, essentially making Perez a one-hit wonder (though she also scored a minor hit with \"Never,\" which peaked at number 79 on the Billboard Hot 100). Additionally, it was also the last song to be played as a long-distance dedication on American Top 40 in January 2004, as Ryan Seacrest replaced Casey Kasem a week later, though long-distance dedications continued on American Top 20 and American Top 10 until both shows ended in 2009. ==Music video== A music video was released, featuring Perez having flashbacks of her boyfriend (implied to be dead), and footage of her lighting candles. The music video was dedicated to two of her family members who had passed, Michael and Benitez Perez. The music video received substantial play on MTV's \"Total Request Live.\" ==Track listing== Notes *The enhanced CD single also includes the music video for \"Angel\" *The European release of the CD omitted the music video and the \"Dance Remix\" of \"Angel.\" ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (2003) !Peak position |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada (Nielsen SoundScan) |12 |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (2003) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA) |13 |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia Urban (ARIA) |8 |- !scope=\"row\"|New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) |15 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Hot 100 |69 |} ==Certifications== ==References== ==External links== *View the music video on YouTube *Read the full lyrics on MetroLyrics Category:2003 singles Category:2003 songs Category:Amanda Perez songs Category:Number-one singles in New Zealand Category:Virgin Records singles Category:Songs about heartache Category:2000s ballads Category:Contemporary R&B; ballads ",
