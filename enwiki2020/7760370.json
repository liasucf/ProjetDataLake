Garc\u00eda-Austt graduated with honors as \"Doctor en Medicina y Cirug\u00eda\" (M.D.) at the Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica of Uruguay in 1948 and obtained the Gold Medal, with a doctoral thesis on \"Repercussion of some metabolic alterations on the bioelectric potentials\".Before his graduation, in 1942, he had started his career as a neuroscientist, developing clinical electroencephalography at the Instituto de Endocrinolog\u00eda using the first recording equipment that existed in Uruguay. After his graduation, he continued his job as clinical neurophysiologist and at that time published his first papers on epilepsy. His clinical career continued with the foundation and direction of five clinical electroencephalography laboratories at Montevideo public hospitals. In this time arose his interest on basic scientific research on neurophysiology, at the Department of Physiology of the Medical School of Montevideo, under the direction of the Nobel Prize Dr. Corneille Heymans, during his extended stay in Montevideo at postwar time. Garc\u00eda-Austt claimed that his relationship with Prof. Heymans was fundamental for the start of his career as neurobiologist. In 1951, he worked in the Neurophysiology Laboratory of the Universidad Cat\u00f3lica at Santiago de Chile, directed by Prof. Joaquin Luco, one of the most important neurobiology scientists. Back in Montevideo, he started the \"Laboratorio de Neurofisiolog\u00eda\" in collaboration with Drs. E. Migliaro and J.P. Segundo. This laboratory was under the joint jurisdiction of the Biophysics and Physiology Departments. In this Neurophophysiology Laboratory, a set of neurobiological researchers was trained. Those researchers continued his works in different laboratories in Uruguay and foreign countries. At this School, Garc\u00eda-Austt set up an Integral Course of the Nervous System which included faculty from the physiology, biophysics, histology, anatomy and pharmacology departments. In 1959, Garc\u00eda-Austt created the Neurophysiology Laboratory at the \"Instituto de Neurolog\u00eda y Neurocirug\u00eda\" of the School of Medicine. He worked until 1973, when he moved to Spain. The laboratory's research included: #Evoked potentials in humans and their relationship with attention and perception; # Regulating mechanisms of sensory, auditive, visual and somesthetic inputs; # Recording and electrical stimulation during brain surgery in humans; # Oxygen pressure variation during sleep; # Physiology and physiopathology of the intracranial pressure. This research created a procedure for the diagnosis of normotensive hydrocephalia.. During this period, the research works was financed largely by foreign grants. ==Madrid== In 1973 he was invited by Jose M. Rodriguez Delgado to work in Madrid, collaborating in the development of Neurobiology at the Hospital \"Ramon y Cajal\" of the Social Security. He accepted it, both because of the better facilities and because of the unbearable socio-political climate in Uruguay. At that hospital he founded the Experimental Neurology Service of the Research Department. During 15 years, he worked on the generating mechanisms of brain rhythms. He was connected with the Hospital clinical area, via the collaboration with the Neurochirurgical Unit led by Dr. Obrador-Alcalde. As professor in the Department of Physiology of the School of Medicine of the Universidad Autonoma in Madrid, he taught Neuroscience, in close collaboration with Profs. Rodriguez Delgado and Reinoso Suarez. ==Garcia-Austt and the Spanish Neurosciences Society== Preliminary scientific meetings named I, II and III Spanish Neurobiologists Meetings in 1980, 1981 and 1983, organized by Garcia-Austt in collaboration with Reinoso Suarez, Salvador Lluch and Isabel de Andres, lead to the creation, in 1985, of the Spanish Neurosciences Society, in which Garcia-Austt was the first President. ==Return to Montevideo== In 1988 he returned to Montevideo to direct the \"Proyecto de Neurociencia\", financed by the European Union, their first scientific grant given to Latin America. The grant provided the basis for the development of five projects in several Uruguay laboratories. This marked a revival of the neuroscience in Uruguay, thanks to the integrating and formative work of Garcia-Austt, creating a favourable scientific environment for the return of several researchers which worked in foreign countries. During this period he returned frequently to Madrid, in which he maintained his office at the Ramon y Cajal Hospital.In Uruguay, he continued in the organization of several national and international courses which formed the present structure of the \"Escuela de Neurociencia\" in Hispanic America. In 1991 was designed Professor of Neuroscience of the School of Sciences of the University of Uruguay , a position which he held until his retirement in 1999. He married two times and had five sons. He died in Montevideo in 2005. ==Positions== *Associated Professor of Physiology, Facultad de Medicina de Montevideo, 1959-1974. *Chief of \"Servicio de Neurolog\u00eda Experimental\", Departamento de Investigaci\u00f3n, Centro Especial \u201cRam\u00f3n y Cajal\u201d, Madrid, 1977-1989. *Professor ad honorem, School of Medicine, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid, 1974. *\"Professor Especial\", School of Medicine, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid, 1975-1988. *\"Professor Em\u00e9rito\", School of Medicine, Uruguay, 1986. *\"Professor Honor\u00edfico\", Hospital Ram\u00f3n y Cajal, Madrid, 1990. *Professor of Neurosciences, Facultad de Ciencias, Uruguay, 1991\u20131999 *Director of the Instituto de Biolog\u00eda, Facultad de Ciencias, Uruguay, 1991-1994. *\"Professor Em\u00e9rito\", Facultad de Ciencias, Uruguay, 1998. *\"Doctor Honoris Causa\", Universidad, Uruguay, 2000. == References == Category:1919 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Uruguayan neuroscientists Category:People from Montevideo Category:Uruguayan expatriates in Chile Category:Uruguayan expatriates in Spain Category:University of the Republic (Uruguay) alumni Category:University of the Republic (Uruguay) faculty Category:Uruguayan people of Spanish descent Category:Uruguayan people of German descent ",
