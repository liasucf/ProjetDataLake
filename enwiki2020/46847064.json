The family returned to Chi\u0219in\u0103u around 1990, when Shor was either two or three years old, and his father went into business in Moldova. His father died in 2005. Ilan Shor has been married to the Russian singer Jasmin (who is 10 years older than him) since 2011. In addition to Jasmin's son from a previous marriage, they have a daughter, Margarita, who was born in 2012, and a son, Miron, who was born in 2016. == The $1 billion bank fraud scandal == The Kroll report claims that although the final beneficiaries are unknown, some companies that Ilan Shor has links to benefited, either directly or indirectly, from loans issued from the three banks involved in the Moldovan bank fraud scandal. On November 26, 2014 the banks went bankrupt and were later placed under special administration of the National Bank of Moldova. On 27 November, the Moldovan Government, headed by Prime Minister Iurie Leanc\u0103, secretly decided to bail out the three banks with $870 million in emergency loans, covered from state reserves. This created a deficit in Moldovan public finances equivalent to an eighth of the country's GDP. In the week preceding the 2014 Moldovan parliamentary elections, more than $750 million were extracted from the three banks between 24 and 26 November. A van belonging to Klassica Force, while transporting 12 sacks of bank files, was stolen and burned on November 27. Records of many transactions were deleted from the banks' computers. In March 2015 Ilan Shor was suspected by the National Anti-Corruption Center (NAC) for his work in Saving Bank. On 17 March 2015 he was questioned for 8 hours and Anti Corruption officers seized his personal property. On May 6, 2015 Shor was placed under house arrest. As of 2015, Shor is allowed to move freely, after a period of house arrest. This is because he fully cooperated with the investigation. Despite this, he was allowed to register for electoral race for the mayor of city of Orhei, a contest in which he won 62% of the vote on June 14 local government election. == Mayor of Orhei == He was elected mayor of the Moldovian town of Orhei on the 14th June with 62% of the vote, a post he held until April 2019. According to the polls made in 2019 related to the most popular politicians in the Republic of Moldova, Ilan Shor is ranked at the third position among the top politicians in which Moldovans have the highest trust, and by some polls he is ranked at the sixth and at the seventh position accordingly. == References == Category:Living people Category:1987 births Category:Moldovan businesspeople Category:Moldovan Jews Category:People from Tel Aviv ",
