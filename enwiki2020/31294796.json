They decided that the best way to deal with the rejection was to get drunk, really drunk. During the 24 hours of their crazy drunkenness, these two stranger became fast friends and married each other. When they finally sobered up, they embarked on a mission to undo every crazy thing they did while they were drunk and prayed that their girl/boyfriend wouldn't find out. However, it turns out that Jie Xiu's girlfriend, Ai Wei, doesn't want a scandal affecting her movie so she asks him to stay married to Xiao Ru for three months. Jie Xiu and Xiao Ru eventually develop feelings for each other, and Ai Wei tries to prevent their relationship from progressing. Ai Wei becomes jealous and realises how much she loves Jie Xiu, revealing the fake marriage contract to the media hoping that will make them get back together. Soon she realises that she is too late and she cannot stop their love for each other. Jie Xiu's mother Samantha catches trouble at a club, but they sort it out and Jie Xiu's relationship with his mother strengthens. During a celebration at the Farglory Hotel, though, Samantha ends up in the hospital after falling down the stairs. Xiao Ru's childhood friend and the franchise owner (Shuo Huai) comes back in hopes of marrying her, and in an emotional crossroads, he almost takes her back to America with him. Xiao Ru finally sorts herself out, after a long time of thinking she was \"taking something that belonged to someone else\". She decided that she wasn't stealing Jie Xiu from Ai Wei, and ultimately the two decide to divorce - for their fake marriage - and then marry again for real. ==Cast== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=170|Actor !! width=150|Character !!
