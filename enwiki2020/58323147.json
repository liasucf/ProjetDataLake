    "text": "Chase Bliss Audio is a Minnesota-based company that makes high-end electronic audio processors, known as effects pedals, used for the electric guitar, synthesizer, or for manipulating audio in a recording studio. The brand has built a reputation among audio purists for their forward thinking effects and their high functionality. For this reason, musicians and producers have frequently applied Chase Bliss Audio effects not only to guitars but other electric instruments as well as audio from microphones. ==History== Chase Bliss Audio was founded in 2013 by Joel Korte Anoka, Minnesota. The company is named after the founder's brother, Chase Korte, who died in 2007 after his car was struck by a drunk driver; and a favourite quote of Chase's, \"Follow Your Bliss\" by Joseph Campbell. ==Pedals== Chase Bliss released the Warped Vinyl, its first pedal at the end of 2013. The company's pedals contain multiple circuit boards and are manufactured in Minnesota and California. Premiere Guitar wrote of the pedals that they, \u201care notable for their kitchen-sink approach\u2014analog guts, digital brains, multiple knobs and toggles, and a bevy of DIP switches\u2014with no parameter left untweakable.\u201d Each has an analog signal path, controlled by digital microprocessors. Bands that have used his pedals include Nine Inch Nails, A-ha, Soul Asylum, and Radiohead. In addition to the Warped Vinyl pedal and its predecessors, several other pedals have been produced by the company. In 2014 they released the Wombtone phaser pedal, in 2015 they released the Gravitas and the Spectre flanger pedal. In 2016 the company then released the Tonal Recall delay pedal. In 2017 the company released the Brothers pedal. Additionally, in 2018 they released the Thermae delay and harmonization pedal, and the Condor analog EQ pedal. === Stompboxes === Chase Bliss Audio Tonal Recall Most Chase Bliss Audio units are in the familiar stompbox format, playing off of the tradition of effect pedals being in a rectangular chassis designed to be toggled by the musician's feet. Similar to guitar pedal giant BOSS, Chase Bliss Audio tends to fit their different units into the same chassis, providing a format that is unique to their brand. This format consists of 6 knobs, 4 toggle switches, two foot- switchable buttons, an input, an output, CV/ expression pedal input, and MIDI input. Another feature unique to Chase Bliss are the DIP switches at the top of the stompbox. These are used to change, automate, or reverse the values of knobs. === Automatone Series === In January 2019, at the 2019 NAMM Show, Chase Bliss Audio revealed their plans on releasing the first of a new line of pedal format that they called the automatone. ==Notable Users== *Tycho: Dark World, Thermae, Condor, Warped Vinyl, Tonal Recall, Brothers, Gravitas, Wombtone *Ed O'Brien (Radiohead): Tonal Recall RKM *The Tallest Man on Earth: Tonal Recall *Jason Isbell: Condor, Gravitas, Tonal Recall, Dark World *John Mayer: Tonal Recall, Warped Vinyl *Pete Jonas: Condor, Tonal Recall, Preamp MKII, Dark World, Blooper *Kid Koala: Condor *Celisse Henderson: Preamp MKII *Ricky Reed: Brothers, Tonal Recall, Warped Vinyl *Tony Berg: Brothers, Tonal Recall, Warped Vinyl, Dark World, Thermae, Mood, Condor, Gravitas ==References== Category:2013 establishments in Minnesota Category:Guitar effects manufacturing companies Category:Anoka County, Minnesota ",
