    "text": "The Hanson Brothers were a Canadian punk rock band formed in 1984 in Victoria and later based in Vancouver. The group included John and Rob Wright and Tom Holliston, all members of the punk rock band Nomeansno. The Hanson Brothers' band name references characters in the cult ice hockey film Slap Shot. ==History== From 1984 to 1989, the Wright brothers and original NoMeansNo guitarist Andy Kerr performed Ramones cover sets sporadically under the name The Hanson Brothers. The Hanson Brothers later began to write \"their own Ramones songs\". At this time John Wright played drums and the three members shared lead vocal duties. Examples of songs from this era are \"Ya Little Creep\" and \"Bad,\" two Kerr-era NoMeansNo songs with songwriting credited to the Hanson Brothers; the former appears on the 1991 compilation Clam Chowder and Ice Vs. Big Macs and Bombers, and the latter on The Sky Is Falling and I Want My Mommy, a collaborative LP with Jello Biafra. The Wrights began working with Holliston as the Hanson Brothers in 1989. The earliest sessions from this time still featured John Wright on drums; however, Ken Jensen of D.O.A. soon joined and, after releasing a debut 7\", the band recorded their first album, Gross Misconduct, in 1992. The album featured art spoofing the cover of the Ramones' Road to Ruin. Jensen died in a house fire in 1995. Ken Kempster (member of, among many other groups, the Showbusiness Giants) became the group's next drummer, referred to as \"Kenny Jr\" Hanson. This lineup released the group's second record, Sudden Death, through a subsidiary of Virgin Records. The cover spoofed D.O.A.'s \"The Prisoner\" single cover. In 2000, the songs \"Rink Rat\", \"Third Man In\", \"Stick Boy\", and \"Danielle\", were featured in the NHL Rock The Rink game for the Sony PlayStation. Also in 2000, John Wright, in his Johnny Hanson character, recorded an instructional video regarding homebrewing beer. Wright also compiled and released two compilations of hockey-themed songs called Puck Rock Volumes I and II. Kempster left the group in 2001, and Ernie Hawkins joined for touring behind the group's third record, My Game. The cover parodied Black Flag's My War. Hawkins appears on the group's 2008 live album It's a Living, whose cover parodies the Ramones' It's Alive. Mike Branum, from The Freak Accident, debuted as the group's drummer for their 2008 tour. Byron Slack replaced Branum in 2014. ==Members== * Johnny Hanson (John Wright) \u2013 lead vocals (1984\u20132016), drums (1984\u20131991) * Robbie Hanson (Rob Wright) \u2013 bass guitar (1984\u20132016) * Andy Kerr \u2013 guitar, vocals (1984\u20131989) * Tommy Hanson (Tom Holliston) \u2013 guitar, vocals (1989\u20132016) * Kenny Hanson (Ken Jensen) \u2013 drums (1991\u20131995) * Kenny Jr Hanson (Ken Kempster) \u2013 drums (1995\u20132001) * Ernie Hanson (Ernie Hawkins) \u2013 drums (2001\u20132006) * Mikey Hanson (Mike Branum) \u2013 drums (2008\u20132013) * Ronnie Hanson (Byron Slack) \u2013 drums (2014\u20132016) ;Timeline ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:30 PlotArea = left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:50 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1984 till:09/25/2016 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Colors = id:Vox value:red legend:Vocals id:Bass value:purple legend:Bass id:Guitar value:blue legend:Guitar id:Drums value:orange legend:Drums id:Lines value:black legend:Studio albums Legend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom ScaleMajor = increment:3 start:1984 ScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:1984 LineData = at:03/29/1992 color:black layer:back at:09/29/1996 color:black layer:back at:08/07/2002 color:black layer:back at:10/01/2006 color:black layer:back BarData = bar:John text:\"Johnny Hanson\" bar:Rob text:\"Robby Hanson\" bar:Andy text:\"Andy Kerr\" bar:Tom text:\"Tommy Hanson\" bar:Ken text:\"Kenny Hanson\" bar:KenJr text:\"Kenny Jr. Hanson\" bar:Ernie text:\"Ernie Hanson\" bar:Mikey text:\"Mikey Hanson\" bar:Ronnie text:\"Ronnie Hanson\" PlotData= width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4) bar:John from:01/01/1984 till:end color:Vox bar:John from:01/01/1984 till:06/01/1991 color:Drums width:3 bar:John from:10/01/2006 till:10/01/2008 color:Drums width:3 bar:Rob from:01/01/1984 till:end color:Bass bar:Andy from:01/01/1984 till:01/01/1989 color:Guitar bar:Andy from:01/01/1984 till:01/01/1989 color:Vox width:3 bar:Tom from:01/01/1989 till:end color:Guitar bar:Ken from:06/01/1991 till:01/29/1995 color:Drums bar:KenJr from:01/29/1995 till:01/29/2001 color:Drums bar:Ernie from:01/29/2001 till:10/01/2006 color:Drums bar:Mikey from:10/01/2008 till:03/01/2014 color:Drums bar:Ronnie from:03/01/2014 till:end color:Drums ==Discography== ===Full-length albums=== * Gross Misconduct \u2013 1992 * Sudden Death \u2013 1996 * My Game \u2013 2002 * It's a Living (live) \u2013 2008 ===EPs and singles=== * Brad (7\" single) \u2013 1992 * The Hockey Song (split 7\" single with D.O.A.) \u2013 1996 * Brad (EP re-release of Brad single with bonus tracks) \u2013 2003 Additionally, there are numerous compilation albums featuring Hanson Brothers tracks. ==References== * The Ruckus - Audio Interview with Tom Holliston from March 2009, featuring NMN and Hanson Brothers tracks Citations ==External links== * Hanson Brothers / Nomeansno Official message board & Tour Info * Hanson Brothers / No Means No fan site * Hanson Brothers at Southern Records Category:Musical groups established in 1984 Category:Musical groups from Victoria, British Columbia Category:Musical groups from Vancouver Category:Canadian pop punk groups Category:Mint Records artists Category:Alternative Tentacles artists Category:Virgin Records artists Category:1984 establishments in British Columbia Category:Sibling musical groups ",
