    "text": "Alan Murray (born 5 December 1949) is an English former football player, coach and manager. == Biography == Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, Murray spent the first years of his playing career at Middlesbrough, gradually honing his coaching skills as he struggled to break into the first team. He later moved on to York City, Brentford and Doncaster Rovers before finishing his playing career at Frickley Athletic. His coaching skills were put to the test at Hartlepool United in 1991 when, with boss Cyril Knowles battling against a brain tumour that was to eventually prove fatal, Murray was shuffled from his chief executive role to the position of manager. A 17-month stint at Darlington followed where he gradually pulled the team away from the foot of the Football League before he teamed up with former teammate Graeme Souness at Southampton. In September 2004 he once again joined Souness this time at Newcastle United as assistant manager. == Managerial stats == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Team !rowspan=\"2\"|Nat !rowspan=\"2\"|From !rowspan=\"2\"|To !colspan=\"5\"|Record |- !G!!W!!L!!D!!Win % |- |align=left|Hartlepool United | |align=left|June 1991 |align=left|February 1993 ||90||36||31||23||40.0 |- |align=left|Darlington | |align=left|October 1993 |align=left|March 1995 ||64||21||29||14||32.8 |} ==References== ==External links== * *Alan Murray at Post War English & Scottish Football League A - Z Player's Transfer Database Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Newcastle upon Tyne Category:Association football midfielders Category:Middlesbrough F.C. players Category:York City F.C. players Category:Brentford F.C. players Category:Doncaster Rovers F.C. players Category:Frickley Athletic F.C. players Category:Hartlepool United F.C. managers Category:S.L.
