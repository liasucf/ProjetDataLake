    "text": "\"A Drug Against War\" is a song by industrial rock band KMFDM, taken from their 1993 album Angst. It was released as a single prior to the album. A music video, featuring animated depictions of the band's previous album covers and singles, was made for the single, and was subsequently shown on the MTV cartoon Beavis and Butt-head on July 11, 1994. It was re-released as a 7\" in 2009. The song was featured in the video game Br\u00fctal Legend and, on December 16, 2010, it was made available as a downloadable song for the game Rock Band. In late 2011, the band released a new version of the song called \"A Drug Against Wall Street\", with lyrics in support of the Occupy Wall Street movement, and made it available for free download from their site. ==Critical reception== Andy Hinds, in the 2002 book All Music Guide to Rock, called the song KMFDM's most over the top moment to date. Ten years after its release, Brad Filicky of CMJ New Music Report said \"A Drug Against War\" was one of the most potent speed metal songs ever. Joshua Landau of Allmusic said that while the song was \"one of the best introductions to KMFDM's antagonistic guitars and viewpoints\", the four track single was \"only of interest to serious fans\". \"A Drug Against War\" was ranked No. 47 on COMA Music Magazine's 101 Greatest Industrial Songs of All Time. ==Track listing== ===1993 release=== ===2009 7\" reissue=== ==Personnel== *Sascha Konietzko \u2013 vocals (1-4), programming (1-4), drum sequences and arrangement (3, 4), production *En Esch \u2013 drum sequences and arrangement (1, 2) *Mark Durante \u2013 guitars (1-3) *Svet Am \u2013 guitars (1-4) *Christine Siewert \u2013 backing vocals (4) ==References== Category:1993 singles Category:KMFDM songs Category:TVT Records singles Category:1993 songs Category:Speed metal songs Category:Wax Trax!
