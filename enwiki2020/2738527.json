Aquarelle by Emil Ranzenhofer The Leopoldst\u00e4dter Tempel was the largest synagogue of Vienna, in the district (Bezirk) of Leopoldstadt. It was also known as the Israelitische Bethaus in der Wiener Vorstadt Leopoldstadt. It was built in 1858 in a Moorish Revival style by the architect Ludwig F\u00f6rster. The tripartite facade of the Leopoldst\u00e4dter, with its tall central section flanked by lower wings on each side, became the model for numerous Moorish Revival synagogues, including the Choral Temple in Bucharest, which has an almost identical main facade, the Zagreb Synagogue, the Spanish Synagogue in Prague, the Tempel Synagogue in Krak\u00f3w and the Grand Synagogue of Edirne. This temple was destroyed during the Kristallnacht on November 10, 1938. A memorial plaque on the site reads in German (and Hebrew): translated as: ==Synagogues influenced by the Leopoldst\u00e4dter Tempel== The Leopoldst\u00e4dter Tempel, painted by Rudolf von Alt The Tempel, which housed a prestigious congregation in the capital of the Empire, inspired the construction of several other synagogues in the Moorish Revival style. Some are designed similarly to Forster's building, with a flat facade and roof, tripartite massing with a large central block, symmetrical decorative minarets, and internal basilica plan with balconies. *Grand Synagogue of Edirne, Turkey *Zagreb Synagogue, Croatia *Vercelli Synagogue *Plum Street Temple, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA *Spanish Synagogue, Prague, Czech Republic *Tempel Synagogue, Krak\u00f3w, Poland *Sofia Synagogue, Sofia, Bulgaria *Choral Temple, Bucharest, Romania *Great Choral Synagogue, Kiev, Ukraine *Brodsky Choral Synagogue, Kiev, Ukraine *Doh\u00e1ny Street Synagogue, Budapest, Hungary ==Famous members== *Josef Goldstein, cantor at the synagogue *Adolf Jellinek, rabbi at the synagogue *Moritz G\u00fcdemann, rabbi at the synagogue ==Memorials== File:Leopoldst\u00e4dter Tempel Gedenktafel, Vienna.jpg|Memorial plaque at the site of synagogue File:Leopoldst\u00e4dter Tempel Mosaik, Vienna.jpg|Memorial mosaic at Tempelgasse File:Wien - Tempelgasse, Memorial (1).JPG|Monument showing the size of the synagogue ==See also== *History of the Jews in Austria *Stadttempel ==References== * * *Martens, Bob; Herbert Peter (2011). \"The Destroyed Synagogues of Vienna - Virtual city walks\".
