For the first time, the final will be played as a single match at a venue pre-selected by CAF. It was originally scheduled to be played on 29 May 2020 at the Japoma Stadium in Douala, Cameroon. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the match was postponed and Cameroon decided to withdraw from hosting. Instead, the final will be played on 6 November 2020 at either Cairo International Stadium in Cairo, Egypt (if one or both finalists are from Egypt), or Mohammed V Stadium in Casablanca, Morocco (if both finalists are from Egypt). ==Venue== ===Original host selection=== The CAF Executive Committee decided in June 2019 that the final would be played as a single match.

In July, the Cameroonian Football Federation announced that they had withdrawn from hosting the final. On 3 August 2020, the CAF announced that the final would be played on 16 or 17 October 2020. It would be played in Egypt if both semi-finalists from Egypt, Al-Ahly and Zamalek, reached the final, or in Morocco if both semi-finalists from Morocco, Raja Casablanca and Wydad Casablanca, reached the final. If one team from Egypt and one team from Morocco reached the final, it was initially decided that the final would be played in a neutral country. On 10 September 2020, the CAF announced that at the request of the Royal Moroccan Football Federation, the final was rescheduled to 6 November 2020. It was later decided that if the final were between a team from Egypt and a team from Morocco, the final would be played in either Egypt or Morocco, to be decided by a draw, which was held on 16 October 2020 in Casablanca, Morocco prior to the semi-final first legs, and the country drawn was Egypt. ==Teams== In the following table, finals until 1996 were in the African Cup of Champions Club era, since 1997 were in the CAF Champions League era. ==Players== In Caf Champios League Achraf Bencharki for play to Zamalek is the best player in seasion 2019-2020. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Team !Zone !Previous finals appearances (bold indicates winners) |- |/ Al-Ahly or Wydad Casablanca |UNAF (North Africa) | |- |/ Zamalek or Raja Casablanca |UNAF (North Africa) | |} ==Format== The final is played as a single match at a pre-selected venue, with the winner of semi- final 1 according to the knockout stage draw designated as the \"home\" team for administrative purposes.
