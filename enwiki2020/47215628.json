    "text": "Yo soy Franky is a Colombian telenovela produced TeleVideo for Nickelodeon Latin America. Written by Argentine author Marcela Citterrio, the show follows the story of a teen-robot named Franky (Mar\u00eda Gabriela de Far\u00eda), who has been designed as if it was a real girl. In 2017, Nickelodeon adapted the series for its global audience and uses the translated title and slight name change to its titular character, \"I Am Frankie\". The first episode aired September 11, 2017. The adapted series stars Alex Hook as Frankie. == Series overview == == Synopsis == === Season 1 (2015) === Sofia Andrade (Paula Barreto) is a great scientist who works in robotics, is married, and has a daughter named Clara Andrade (Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Pescador). Her husband, Wilson Andrade (Jorge L\u00f3pez), is a writer of self-help books. For years, Sofia Andrade has been working on a new robot, a model called FR4NK13, later known as Franky Andrade (Mar\u00eda Gabriela de Far\u00eda). Franky is the biggest project of EGG Enterprises. When the project finally ended, Franky was ready, so Sofia Andrade sent her to school to live side by side with humans. Now, Franky will face all problems and most importantly, protect her secret from all. However, the most intelligent girl, Tamara Franco (Danielle Arciniegas), will not rest until she discovers Franky's great secret. With her friends, Franky will face all her problems and adapt to a world between humans. Clara Andrade is a very naughty and tender girl; Sof\u00eda Andrade is caring and a great scientist; Wilson Andrade is a great crazy lover of books; and Franky is a robot with a human body, very intelligent, harmless and ready to help others. Miss Tamara Franco was always in love with Christian Montero L\u00e9on (Mart\u00edn Barba), but Christian is in love with Franky, although he does not know her real secret. Paul Mej\u00eda (George Slebi) is a dull but goodhearted scientist who soon ends up proving that he can be good, likes copying the ideas of Sofia and believes that bad luck haunts him everywhere. Yo Soy Franky is a story of comedy with a touch of romance and suspense with many lessons, to show viewers that they should not criticize people and will always find someone \"weird\" who will make them laugh. === Season 2 (2016) === Franky is now half-human, half-robot, thanks to her new heart. She faces new emotions, new enemies, new adventures... and realizes that coexistence between androids and humans is more complicated than everyone thought. Meanwhile, Sofia poses as Sabrina, the new nanny, thanks to the experiment C4MB10 (Change), which is a robotic case. There is also the Anti-Robot League, led by Segundo Mej\u00eda, Paul's twin brother. Tamara finds out Franky is a robot and threatens to tell Segundo about it to destroy her. Franky will be in trouble, because Segundo is the new principal of Franky's school. Roby Mej\u00eda will also become a superhero, with the help of his parents. But he must be careful, as the girls are trying to find out who hides behind the mask of Andromax. === Season 2 Part 2 (2016) === After Kassandra leaves the town with Franky's memories, there's a mysterious girl who has a lot of secrets. She has a mission in the year 2016 but in reality, she belongs in the future, in 2035. She attempts to make Cristian and Franky break up forever so humans and robots will never have peace with each other. However, then she starts discovering things about her true creator and her origin. The premiere of the second part of this season premiered in September 2016.
