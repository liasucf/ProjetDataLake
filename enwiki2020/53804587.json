    "text": "Dancing Brasil is a Brazilian reality television series based on the ABC celebrity dance competition Dancing with the Stars, produced by Endemol Shine in partnership with BBC Worldwide. The show is hosted by Xuxa Meneghel, alongside Junno Andrade, who became co-host in season four. S\u00e9rgio Marone co- hosted the first two seasons, while Leandro Lima was co-host in the third season. The series premiered on Monday, April 3, 2017 at 10:30 p.m. (BRT / AMT) on RecordTV. == Format == The format of the show consists of a celebrity paired with a professional dancer. Each couple performs predetermined dances and competes against the others for judges' points. The three couples receiving the lowest total of judges' points are up to the public vote, where the couple who received the fewest votes will be eliminated each week until only the champion dance pair remains. == Controversy == In order to produce Dancing Brasil, RecordTV bought the rights to adapt Dancing with the Stars, the American version of the British series Strictly Come Dancing, from BBC Worldwide, to be co-produced by Endemol Shine. However, Strictly has been served as the base for Dan\u00e7a dos Famosos (The Famous' Dance), another Brazilian series which has been airing since 2005 on Rede Globo as a 1-hour segment on Doming\u00e3o do Faust\u00e3o, hosted by Fausto Silva. Globo bought the rights to adapt Strictly from Endemol Shine, known at time as Endemol Globo, a joint venture between Globo and Endemol. The joint venture was dismantled in 2017, when Endemol Shine Group began controlled directly all the company's operations in Brazil, which allowed both the British and American adaptations to be sold separately. ==Series overview== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"white- space:nowrap; text-align:center; font-size:85%; width:100%;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:05%;\" | Season ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10%;\" | Number of ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10%;\" | Duration dates ! colspan=\"3\" style=\"width:45%;\" | Placements |- ! style=\"width:05%;\" | Couples ! style=\"width:05%;\" | Weeks | style=\"width:15%;\" bgcolor=\"FFD700\"| Winner | style=\"width:15%;\" bgcolor=\"C0C0C0\"| Runner-up | style=\"width:15%;\" bgcolor=\"D2B48C\"| Third place |- ! 1 | 14 | 13 | April 3 \u2013 June 26, 2017 | Mayt\u00ea Piragibe Paulo Victor Souza | Jade Barbosa Lucas Teodoro | Leo Miggiorin Dani de Lova |- ! 2 | 12 | 10 | July 24 \u2013 September 25, 2017 | Yudi Tamashiro B\u00e1rbara Guerra | Suzana Alves Tutu Morasi | Lexa Lucas Teodoro |- ! 3 | 15 | 13 | January 17 \u2013 April 11, 2018 | Geovanna Tominaga Lucas Teodoro | Raissa Santana Paulo Victor Souza | B\u00e1rbara Borges Marquinhos Costa |- ! 4 | 14 | 11 | September 26 \u2013 December 5, 2018 | P\u00e9rola Faria Fernando Perrotti | Lu Andrade Marquinhos Costa | Allan Souza Lima Carol Dias |- ! 5 | 13 | 11 | July 3 \u2013 September 11, 2019 | D'Black Carol Dias | Dany Hyp\u00f3lito Marquinhos Costa | Bia Feres Paulo Victor Souza |- |} ==Ratings and reception== ===Brazilian ratings=== All numbers are in points and provided by Kantar Ibope Media. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" |- ! rowspan=2 | Season ! rowspan=2 | Timeslot (BRT) ! colspan=2 width=\"25%\"| Premiered ! colspan=2 width=\"25%\"| Ended ! rowspan=2 width=\"10%\"| TV season ! rowspan=2 width=\"10%\"| SP viewers (in points) ! rowspan=2 width=\"10%\"| Source |- ! | Date ! span style=\"width:10%; font-size:smaller; font-weight:bold; line-height:100%;\"| Viewers (in points) ! | Date ! span style=\"width:10%; font-size:smaller; font- weight:bold; line-height:100%;\"| Viewers (in points) |- | 1 | rowspan=2 | Monday 10:30 pm | | 5.0 | | 7.2 | rowspan=3 | 2017\u201318 | 5.9 | |- | 2 | | 6.3 | | 7.8 | 5.8 | |- | 3 | Wednesday 10:30 pm | | 8.1 | | 6.7 | 6.2 | |- | 4 | Wednesday 11:00 pm | | 5.9 | | 7.0 | 2018\u201319 | 6.0 | |- | 5 | Wednesday 10:45 pm | | 6.7 | | 6.4 | 2019\u201320 | 5.3 | |- |} * Each point represents a specific number of households in 15 market cities in Brazil. 2017: 245.700 households (70.500 in S\u00e3o Paulo) 2018: 248.647 households (71.855 in S\u00e3o Paulo) 2019: 254.892 households (73.015 in S\u00e3o Paulo) ==References== == External links == * Dancing Brasil on R7.com Category:2010s Brazilian television series Category:2017 Brazilian television series debuts Category:Brazilian reality television series Category:Portuguese-language television shows Category:RecordTV original programming Category:Ballroom dance Category:Xuxa Category:British television series based on American television series ",
