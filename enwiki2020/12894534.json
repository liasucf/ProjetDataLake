    "text": "The Roman Catholic Diocese of Moulins (Latin: Dioecesis Molinensis; French: Dioc\u00e8se de Moulins) is a diocese of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church in France. The episcopal see is located in the city of Moulins. The diocese comprises all of the department of Allier in the region of Auvergne. ==History== The diocese was created in 1788, but the new bishop, \u00c9tienne-Jean- Baptiste-Louis des Gallois de la Tour, although appointed by King Louis XVI on 29 May 1789, had not been approved (preconized) by Pope Pius VI before the outbreak of the French Revolution in July 1789.Fisquet, p. 165. Under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (12 July 1790) there was erected a diocese of Allier, with a Constitutional Bishop resident at Moulins. The French government, however, did not have the canonical power to erect dioceses, and therefore this new diocese was in schism with Rome. The first Constitutional Bishop, Msgr. Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Laurent, had been a cur\u00e9 in the diocese of Autun before becoming a member of the Estates General; after his election by the voters of Allier, he was consecrated in Paris on 6 March 1791 by Constitutional Bishop Gobel. In 1793 he abdicated and married. Laurent died in 1796, Fisquet, p. 166. or 10 May 1821.Pisani, p. 97. The appointment and consecration of Laurent, as well as the erection of the Diocese of Allier, were annulled by Pope Pius VI. Laurent's consecration was labelled blasphemous and schismatic. Under the Concordat of 11 June 1817 the diocese of Moulins was re-established, from parts of the dioceses of Autun, Bourges, and Clermont- Ferrand, to cover the department of Allier. The implementation of the Concordat was delayed, however, by various circumstances brought about by the Hundred Days and the occupation of France by the Allies, as well as by the lack of funds both on the part of the French monarchy and the Papacy, to say nothing about the machinations of ministers and diplomats. On 6 October 1822, Pope Pius VII issued a bull which created fourteen dioceses in France, including Moulins. The first bishop was appointed in 1822, and in the same year the medieval collegiate church at Moulins was established as the Cathedral of Notre-Dame, the seat of the diocese. The diocese of Moulins was made a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Sens. This situation continued until 8 December 2002, when a major reorganization of the French diocesan structure made Moulins a suffragan of the Archbishop of Clermont.David M. Cheney, Catholic-Hierarchy.org, Diocese of Moulins, retrieved: 2017-01-29. The current bishop is Laurent Jean Lucien Marie Percerou, appointed in 2013. ==List of bishops== * \u00c9tienne-Jean-Baptiste-Louis des Gallois de la TourGallois had been vicar-general to the Bishop of Autun, Yves-Alexandre de Marboeuf (1767\u20131788). He was appointed Bishop of Moulins in 1788, as his patron was being promoted to the See of Lyon, but was not formally confirmed before the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789.

He was consecrated on 28 October 1798 in Paris by Constitutional Bishop Henri Gr\u00e9goire. He died on 19 August 1803. Fisquet, pp. 166\u2013167. (Constitutional Bishop (1798\u20131801) * Antoine de La Grange de PonsPons was born at Riom, a suburb of Clermont, of the local aristocracy, in 1759. He held a canonry in the Cathedral of Clermont, and held the post of Vicar General of the diocese. When the Civil Constitution of the Clergy was promulgated, he refused to take the required oath, and emigrated along with his bishop, to Piedmont. During his exile, he became Almoner to the Duchess of Angoul\u00eame. He returned in 1801. When the Concordat of 1817 was finally put into effect by papal action in 1822, Pons was appointed Bishop of Moulins by King Louis XVIII on 6 January 1822. His appointment was confirmed (preconized) by Pope Pius VII on 16 May 1823, and a royal ordinance of 2 July 1823 permitted Pons to receive the bulls for his consecration and installation. He was consecrated in Paris on 13 July by the Archbishop of Paris, Hyacinthe-Louis de Quelen, and took possession of his diocese by proxy on 29 July 1823.
