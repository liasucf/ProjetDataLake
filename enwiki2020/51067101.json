This band sold about 6 million copies in Brazil in the 1980s. Its original lineup had Afonso Nigro, Nill, Marcos Quintela and Marcelo Rodrigues. The biggest hits were \"Ela N\u00e3o Gosta de Mim,\" \"Companheiro\", \"'P. da Vida\", \"Manequim\" and \"Com Todos Menos Comigo.\" Between 1992 and 1995, the actor and television presenter Rodrigo Faro was part of the group. With the formation of Rodrigo Phavanello, Rodriguinho, Cristiano Garcia and Eber Alb\u00eancio, the band achieved national fame in 1997 with the song \"Baila, Baila Comigo\", which became a great commercial success and sold over three million copies in this period in Brazil.Ratinho (tv presenter) ==History== ===Beginnings (1984)=== Designed along the lines of Puerto Rican boy band Menudo (band), Domin\u00f3 appeared in 1984 with the hit \"Companheiro\". While the Menudo was broken out in Brazil, Augusto Liberato, through his Promoart agency, decided to form a nationalized version of the group. For the formation of the group, several boys aged between 14 and 15 years conducted tests in which they had to learn to sing and dance. The selectionated were Affonso Celso Lucatelli Nigro (Afonso Nigro), Lenilson dos Santos (Nill), Marcos Roberto Quintela (Marcos) and Marcelo Henrique Rodrigues (Marcelo). Yet in 1984, the group released a CBS Discs Compact with two versions of successes of the Mexican group Timbiriche, \"Ela N\u00e3o Gosta de Mim\" and \"Companheiro\", which was the first song to burst on the radio, completed with video clip released on Globo's program Fant\u00e1stico.[Gugu Liberato (7 de outubro de 2009). \u00abGrupo Domin\u00f3 foi lan\u00e7ado no Fant\u00e1stico\u00bb. Blog do Gugu (R7). Consultado em 20 de fevereiro de 2014.] ===International success and \"domin\u00f3mania\" (1985-1988)=== In 1985, when Domin\u00f3 was already a fever, the group released their first LP on CBS and was with, besides the famous \"Companheiro\" and \"Ela N\u00e3o Gosta de Mim\", the song \"Ainda Sou Voc\u00ea\" song from that album. Moreover, it had the special participation of the Turma do Bal\u00e3o M\u00e1gico group on tracks \"Chega Mais Um Pouco\" and \"Fim de Semana\". In 1986, in addition to being a constant presence on TV shows, especially the TVS, the group gains a special station at a resort. In the same year the Domin\u00f3 releases a record in Spanish and bursts in the Latin market. This LP had a music remake \"Lindo Bal\u00e3o Azul\" by Guilherme Arantes. Here, the second album was followed by hits \"Guerreiros\", \"Mari\u00e1\", \"Amor e M\u00fasica\" and \"Jura de Amor\". In 1987, the Domin\u00f3 had already three years on the road and a huge success bandages, public and critics. The third LP is the culmination of \"domin\u00f3mania\" plaguing the country. This album featured hits like \" 'P. da Vida,\" which sold much at its launch, followed by \"Manequim\" and \"Medusa\". That same year, they participated in the film Os Fantasmas Trapalh\u00f5es along with his godfather and entrepreneur Gugu Liberato. In 1988, the \"Black Album\", as is known, shows a group of maturing and brings more reflective character songs. This LP brought the hits \"Com Todos Menos Comigo,\" \"Bruta Ansiedade\" and \"As Palavras\" with the special participation of Ang\u00e9lica, at the time presenter of Clube da Crian\u00e7a and Milk Shake programs in Rede Manchete. That same year the quartet also participated in two films: Os Her\u00f3is Trapalh\u00f5es - Uma Aventura na Selva and Os Trapalh\u00f5es na Terra dos Monstros, where they sing the \"Paradise\" song. They have sold about 6 million copies throughout Brazil. ===Nill output, the appearance of the thumb and new formations (1989-1995)=== All went well until Nill leave the group and start a solo career. The farewell was in Viva a Noite program on 19 October 1989. The Promoart preferred to follow the group's career with only three members and released in 1990, the fifth LP that was accompanied by bands \"Maria\", \"Felicidade J\u00e1\" and \"Leil\u00e3o\". However, since the departure of Nill, the group had lost much of its popularity and its media space. This is also due to the formation of Polegar (youth band also released by Promoart Shows) group. Unlike Domino, the Polegar was not used choreographies but musical instruments standing out for being the first youth band launched at national level, formed by Alan Frank, Alex Gill, Rafael Ilha and Ricardo Costa. The Domin\u00f3 group also released another album self-titled in 1992, but no longer had its main member and vocalist Afonso Nigro, who left the group few months before the LP to be recorded. The Promoart and Sony Music, which had bought CBS Records, chose to reactivate the quartet, choosing two new members: a boy named Italo Coutinho[Ex-integrante do grupo Domin\u00f3, o alagoano \u00cdtalo Coutinho tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 destaque no Macei\u00f3 Fest 2003\u00bb.

The single \"Sem Compromisso\" was the only success of the album, which was sung by Marcelo Rodrigues and had the special participation of his girlfriend at the time, the host of the SBT, Mara Maravilha. Then he came with \"\u00d3 Que Eu Te Ponho,\" a music that was well publicized on TV and had his early success. In 1993, Marcos Quintela left the group and was replaced by Fabio.[Um v\u00eddeo promocional divulgando o single \"Vem Provar\", mostra F\u00e1bio como novo integrante ao lado de Marcelo Rodrigues, Rodrigo Faro e \u00cdtalo Coutinho.] In this same year, it was the turn of Marcelo Rodrigues bid farewell in Sabad\u00e3o program, in which he recalled the old hit \"Manequim\". In its place was place Valmir. The training became: Rodrigo Faro, Italo Coutinho, Fabio and Valmir. In 1995, there was more training, this time with members Rodrigo Phavanello, Eber Alb\u00eancio, Valmir and Ricardo. It launched the provocative album that came with the single \"Oh Carol,\" a version of Neil Sedaka song. ===Without Promoart, forgetfulness and return (1997-2006)=== Soon after the year 1992, the group was forgotten, but in 1997, the group reappeared and returned to make success, thanks to the song \"Baila, Baila Comigo\". This training consisted of Rodrigo Phavanello, Eber Alb\u00eancio, Rodriguinho and Cristiano Garcia. The album Comvido! sold 290,000 copies in France and the group performed in countries such as Turkey, Tunisia and Lebanon.[ S\u00e9rgio Martins (4 de agosto de 1999). \u00abSucesso es f\u00e1cil\u00bb. Veja. Consultado em 22 de mar\u00e7o de 2012.] This same formation also recorded an album called \"Give me love\" in 1999 and that same year he recorded a clip of the music Diz Que Sim in Jordan of the same album. In 2001, with the departure of Rodrigo Phavanello, who joined the group was Klaus Hee and then the group recorded the album \"La bomba\" and as the name says the single \"La Bomba\" was the flagship and recorded in Spanish but in Brazil was also recorded by the Band Braga Boys, but in Portuguese. After a few years, the group returned in 2003 with new members and new proposal, but not belonging more to Promoart. The businessman paid just the right when using Domin\u00f3 marks to Gugu Liberato. The training consisted of Maike Eversong, Ricky Fell, Diego Pompeu and Leandro Lemos. Then came out Maike Eversong (in 2002) and entered two members: Julio Street (official cover of Backstreet Boys), was known in the years 1999 to 2002, playing shows throughout Brazil and opening Backstreet Boys, doing some shows on TV and photographer nowadays and former model and actor Arthur Cezar, who currently is in production of his first solo CD career with music copyright, in addition to directing the company Boulevard Productions, producer of Musical shows and blockbusters of Musical de S\u00e3o Paulo. The group appeared a few times on television programs, such as the Domingo Legal, SBT, in July 2003, Superpop and Bom Dia Mulher programs of the RedeTV!. The songs were composed by the members and the singles were Cora\u00e7\u00e3o Parou\" and \"Baby\", but the success did not last long. But this training was considered by the producer as the last official formation of the Domin\u00f3 Group and the following, only as a test phase. ===BMD and more lineup changes (2008-2009)=== In 2008 the former members Arthur Cezar, Leandro Lemos, Alexandre Albertoni and the new member Isaac decided to form a new group called DMO.musicaterra.com.br The group did not last and ended soon after. Earlier in 2007, Alexandre Albertoni (which is a cousin of model and presenter Gianne Albertoni) posed for the G Magazine. In February 2008 there was a new selection to choose the new members in Rio de Janeiro and Rafael Pires, Vinicius, Thalis and Jojo were chosen to integrate the new formation. They were sharing an apartment in Barra da Tijuca and rehearsing, and recorded the first album that would have four new songs and eight remakes of the first formation. But this formation was considered as a testing phase by the productors and didn't last. In March, the singer Rafael Pires suffers a lightning-kidnapping and then is released; at the time the news reverberated on TV stations. According to the newspaper O Globo, the group would until, by April 2008, perform on the Domingo Legal (SBT) program with Afonso Nigro and Rodriguinho, but then there were no more group news.[Cantor do Domin\u00f3 \u00e9 v\u00edtima de seq\u00fcestro-rel\u00e2mpago na Barra\u00bb.
