    "text": "The Grand Caf\u00e9 Le Grand Caf\u00e9 is a famous caf\u00e9 and brasserie in Moulins in the French department of Allier, located at 49, place d'Allier, in the town centre. It was created in 1898 and its inner architecture is representative of the Art Nouveau style and features large wall mirrors, stucco, wrought iron, murals and ceiling paintings, as well as a large glass roof. Le Grand Caf\u00e9 was listed as an official historical monument in February 1978. Grand Caf\u00e9 The Grand Caf\u00e9 was frequented by Coco Chanel (who may have sang there, since at this time Le Grand Caf\u00e9 was also a caf\u00e9-chantant) and Georges Simenon during their youths. In his novel Maigret Goes Home, a chapter is set in Le Grand Caf\u00e9 but the 1959 movie Maigret et l'Affaire Saint-Fiacre based on the book and directed by Jean Delannoy with Jean Gabin playing Maigret was not shot in the actual caf\u00e9 but in interiors constructed in a Paris film studio. The 2008 television movie Coco Chanel had scenes shot in the Grand Caf\u00e9. ==Photos gallery== Grand caf\u00e9 de Moulins fa\u00e7ade avril 2017.jpg|Fa\u00e7ade of the Grand Caf\u00e9 from the place de l'Allier (Allier Square) Grand caf\u00e9 de Moulins salle du rez-de-chauss\u00e9e vue depuis la mezzanine .jpg|The ground floor room seen from the mezzanine Grand caf\u00e9 de Moulins salle du rez-de-chauss\u00e9e miroirs, avril 2017.jpg|Play of mirrors File:Grand caf\u00e9 de Moulins salle du rez-de-chauss\u00e9e peinture du plafond .jpg|Ceiling painting from Auguste Sauroy showing the Gambrinus legend ==References== Partially translated from the French Wikipedia article.
