The Shonkin Sag is a prehistoric fluvioglacial landform located along the northern edge of the Highwood Mountains in the state of Montana in the United States. The Sag is a river channel formed by the Missouri River and glacial meltwater pouring from Glacial Lake Great Falls. It is one of the most famous prehistoric meltwater channels in the world.Axline, Jon and Bradshaw, Glenda Clay. Montana's Historical Highway Markers. Rev. ed. Helena, Mont.: Montana Historical Society, 2008, p. 91. ==Location and size== Map of a portion of the Shonkin Sag (outlined in red) near Highwood, Montana. Shonkin Sag is located in central Montana. It begins south of Highwood, Montana, (about east of the city of Great Falls) and runs in an easterly direction for about until it reaches the Judith River.\"Societies and Academies: Geological Society of Washington.\" Science. May 7, 1895, p. 559-560. It varies from to in width and is about deep.Calhoun, Fred H.H. The Montana Lobe of the Keewatin Ice Sheet. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1906, p. 40. Its midpoint is located at approximately . Shallow glacial lakes may still be found along the now-dry channel.McRae, W.C. and Jewell, Judy. Montana. Berkeley, Calif.: Avalon Travel, 2009, p. 398; Spomer, Ron. Big Game Hunter's Guide to Montana. Belgrade, Mont.: Wilderness Adventures Press, 2005, p. 297. The sag is named for the town of Shonkin, Montana, settled in the 1870s. The name \"Shonkin\" is allegedly the Blackfeet word for the Highwood Mountains, or an adulteration of one of the town's early settlers, John Shonk.Aarstad, Rich; Arguimbau, Ellen; Baumler, Ellen; Prosild, Charlene L.; and Shovers, Brian. Montana Place Names from Alzada to Zortman. Helena, Mont.: Globe Pequot, 2009, p. 242. ==Formation== Prior to the Quaternary glaciation, the Missouri River drained to the northeast into a terminal lake or Hudson Bay.Howard, A.D. \"Drainage Evolution in Northeastern Montana and Northwestern North Dakota.\" Bulletin of the Geological Society of America. 69 (1958): 575-588. During the last glacial period about 17,000 to 13,000 years ago, the Laurentide Ice Sheet blocked the Missouri River and created Glacial Lake Great Falls.Alden, W.C.

Washington, D.C.: U.S. Geologic Survey, 2005. According to geologist Fred H.H. Calhoun and others, the ice sheet forced the waters of Glacial Lake Great Falls to reach at least above sea level.Calhoun, F.H.H. The Montana Lobe of the Keewatin Ice Sheet. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1906], p. 42.Bowman, Isaiah. \"Forest Physiography: Physiography of the United States and Principles of Soils in Relation to Forestry.\" American Environmental Studies. Reprint ed. Charles Gregg, ed. New York: Arno Press, 1970, p. 413. About 15,000 years ago, a glacial lake outburst flood occurred.Feathers, James K. and Hill, Christopher L. \"Luminescence Dating of Glacial Lake Great Falls, Montana, U.S.A.\" XVI International Quaternary Association Congress.

International Quaternary Association, Reno, 2003; Clausen, Eric. \"Meltwater Flood Origin for Great Plains Drainage Network.\" Proceedings of the North Dakota Academy of Science. 43 (1989): p. 40. These waters and their attendant debris then carved the Shonkin Sag at right angles across the existing drainage valleys, with the ice sheet forming the northern edge of the channel.Calhoun, F.H.H. The Montana Lobe of the Keewatin Ice Sheet. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1906], p. 42-43. Once the ice sheet retreated, the Shonkin Sag continued to provide a channel for water draining from Glacial Lake Great Falls and the Missouri River, albeit at a much slower rate and at a lower level. ==Laccolith== The Shonkin Sag lends its name to the Shonkin Sag laccolith, a famous laccolith thick and wide near the western mouth of the Shonkin Sag.James, Furman Kemp. A Handbook of Rocks - For Use Without the Petrographic Microscope. 6th ed. Los Angeles: James Press, 2007, p. 26; Beall, Joseph J. \"Pseudo-Rhythmic Layering in the Square Butte Alkali-Gabbro Laccolith.\" American Mineralogist. 57 (1972): 1294-1302. A laccolith is an igneous intrusion injected between two layers of sedimentary rock. Significant amounts of syenite and shonkinite can be found in the laccolith.Iddings, Joseph Paxon. Igneous Rocks: Composition, Texture and Classification, Description and Occurrence. New York: J. Wiley & Sons, 1909, p. 402.Shonkinite is a coarse-grained rock composed of augite and biotite with a small amount of orthoclase. See: Weed, Walter H. and Pirsson, Louis V. Geology of the Little Belt mountains, Montana, With Note on the Mineral Deposits of the Neihart, Barker, Yogo, and Other Districts. Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1900, p. 319. The Shonkin Sag laccolith is cited by geologists as a classic example of igneous differentiation in a single igneous intrusion.Barksdale, J.D. \"The Shonkin Sag Laccolith.\" American Journal of Science. 23 (1937): 321\u2013359. ==Railroad Grade== Part of the North Montana line of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad was constructed within Shonkin Sag (see photo above).USGS contour maps o47110d7 et al; \"Guide to the Milwaukee Road in Montana\", McCarter, Montana Historical Society Press, 1992, p. 80 ==Notes== ==External links== *\"The Shonkin Sag: An In-Depth Excursion Along the East Side of the Highwood Mountains.\" Gerald T.
