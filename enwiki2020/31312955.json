N\u00e1ndor Bal\u00e1zs received a master's degree at the University of Budapest (1948). Bal\u00e1zs left the communist Hungary in 1949. He received a PhD at the University of Amsterdam (1951). ==Scientific career == After receiving his PhD, Bal\u00e1zs spent two years (1951 and 1952) as assistant to Schroedinger at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, one year (autumn 1952 through summer 1953) as assistant to Albert Einstein at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and was Associate Professor of Physics at the University of Alabama during the years 1953-56\\. In 1961 he went to the Stony Brook University. During his life, Bal\u00e1zs had close friendships and working collaborations with Schroedinger, Paul Dirac (Dirac's wife, Margit Wigner, was Hungarian), Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Eugene Wigner, and other major figures in 20th-century physics. Bal\u00e1zs maintained contacts in his native Hungary and occasionally brought Hungarian physicists to the US. In his collaborations with people in Budapest (notably B\u00e9la Luk\u00e1cs and J\u00f3zsef Zim\u00e1nyi), he dealt with relativistic heavy-ion collisions and thus provided a connection between Stony Brook (a home of RHIC theory) and Hungary.
