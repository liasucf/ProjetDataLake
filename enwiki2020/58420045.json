Ontario's parent company, Cook United, discontinued the use of the Ontario brand when it bought the Rink's Bargain Barn chain in 1981. The remaining Ontario stores were rebranded as Rink's or Cooks stores. Cook United closed its remaining stores in 1987. ==History== Ontario Super Mart was a Lorain, Ohio-based retail chain that began in the 1950s selling clothing, groceries, hardware, electronics and household goods. By the early 1960s, Ontario operated stores in Cincinnati, Columbus and Cleveland. In 1964, the nine-store chain was acquired by Cook Coffee Co. of Maple Heights, Ohio, which would become Cook United Inc.\u201cCook Acquires Ontario.\u201d Cincinnati Enquirer, 24 September 1964, p. 52. Cook United would operate the chain under the name of Ontario Discount Department Stores along with Pic-n-Pay Supermarkets, Uncle Bill's Discount Department Stores, Whitehall's Discount City, and Consolidated Sales Company or CSC Stores. The Ontario chain expanded with stores in Missouri and growth into additional Ohio markets including Toledo. In 1968, Cook United acquired Clark's Department Stores in the United States from the Gamble's chain. Some of the Clark locations were converted to Cooks Discount Department Store. Because of the acquisitions, Cook United had discount stores in Texas, New Mexico, Florida, North Carolina, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma and Kentucky at the start of the 1970s. The company's goal was to reach $1 billion in sales and forecasted that it would operate more than 100 stores under its various brand names by 1975.\u201cOntario Will Open New Store Thursday.\u201d St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 8 March 1970, p. 55.)
