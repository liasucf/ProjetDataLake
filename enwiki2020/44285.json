    "text": "The August 1926 Weird Tales featured Hamilton's first published story \"The Star-Stealers\" was first published in the February 1929 issue of Weird Tales. The first \"Star Kings\" story was cover-featured on the September 1947 issue of Amazing Stories Hamilton's novella \"The Daughter of Thor\" was the cover story for the August 1942 issue of Fantastic Adventures. Hamilton's short novel \"Starman Come Home\", the cover story in the September 1954 issue of Universe Science Fiction, was published in book form as The Sun Smasher five years later house name \"S. M. Tenneshaw\", has never been included in an authorized Hamilton collection Hamilton's short novel \"Fugitive from the Stars\", cover- featured on the December 1958 issue of Imagination, was revised and published in an Ace Double in 1965 Edmond Moore Hamilton (October 21, 1904 \u2013 February 1, 1977) was an American writer of science fiction during the mid-twentieth century. == Early life == Born in Youngstown, Ohio, he was raised there and in nearby New Castle, Pennsylvania. Something of a child prodigy, he graduated from high school and entered Westminster College in New Wilmington, Pennsylvania at the age of 14, but washed out at 17. == Writing career == Edmond Hamilton's career as a science fiction writer began with the publication of \"The Monster God of Mamurth\", a short story, in the August 1926 issue of Weird Tales, now a classic magazine of alternative fiction. Hamilton quickly became a central member of the remarkable group of Weird Tales writers assembled by editor Farnsworth Wright, that included H. P. Lovecraft and Robert E. Howard. Weird Tales would publish 79 works of fiction by Hamilton from 1926 to 1948, making him one of the magazine's most prolific contributors. Hamilton became a friend and associate of several Weird Tales veterans, including E. Hoffmann Price and Otis Adelbert Kline; most notably, he struck up a 20-year friendship with close contemporary Jack Williamson, as Williamson records in his 1984 autobiography Wonder's Child. In the late 1930s Weird Tales printed several striking fantasy tales by Hamilton, most notably \"He That Hath Wings\" (July 1938), one of his most popular and frequently- reprinted pieces. Hamilton wrote one of the first hardcover compilations of what would eventually come to be known as the science fiction genre, The Horror on The Asteroid and Other Tales of Planetary Horror (1936). The book comprises the following stories: \"The Horror on the Asteroid\", \"The Accursed Galaxy\", \"The Man Who Saw Everything\" (\"The Man With the X-Ray Eyes\"), \"The Earth-Brain\", \"The Monster-God of Mamurth\", and \"The Man Who Evolved\". Through the late 1920s and early 1930s Hamilton wrote for all of the science fiction pulp magazines then publishing, and contributed horror and thriller stories to various other magazines as well. He was very popular as an author of space opera, a subgenre he created along with E.E. \"Doc\" Smith. His story \"The Island of Unreason\" (Wonder Stories, May 1933) won the first Jules Verne Prize as the best science fiction story of the year (this was the first science fiction prize awarded by the votes of fans, a precursor of the later Hugo Awards). In the later 1930s, in response to the economic strictures of the Great Depression, he also wrote detective and crime stories. Always prolific in stereotypical pulp magazine fashion, Hamilton sometimes saw four or five of his stories appear in a single month in these years; the February 1937 issue of the pulp Popular Detective featured three Hamilton stories, one under his own name and two under pseudonyms. In the 1940s, Hamilton was the primary force behind the Captain Future franchise, a science fiction pulp designed for juvenile readers that won him many fans, but diminished his reputation in later years when science fiction moved away from space opera. Hamilton was always associated with an extravagant, romantic, high-adventure style of science fiction, perhaps best represented by his 1947 novel The Star Kings. As the science fiction field grew more sophisticated, his brand of extreme adventure seemed ever more quaint, corny, and dated. In 1942 Hamilton began writing for DC Comics, specializing in stories for their characters Superman and Batman. His first comics story was \"Bandits in Toyland\" in Batman #11 (June\u2013July 1942). He wrote the short-lived science fiction series Chris KL-99 in Strange Adventures, which was loosely based on Captain Future. He and artist Sheldon Moldoff created Batwoman in Detective Comics #233 (July 1956).Irvine \"1950s\" in Dolan, p. 80: \"In the story 'The Batwoman' by writer Edmond Hamilton and penciler Sheldon Moldoff (as Bob Kane), Bruce Wayne took notice of a young admirer who...was fighting crime while wearing a bat-costume very similar to the one the Dark Knight wore.\" Hamilton co-created Space Ranger in Showcase #15 (July\u2013Aug. 1958) with Gardner Fox and Bob Brown.Irvine \"1950s\" in Dolan, p. 91: \"Space Ranger...debuted in Showcase #15 in stories by writer Edmond Hamilton and artist Bob Brown.\" He also wrote the well-regarded three-part story \"The Last Days of Superman\" in Superman #156 (Oct 1962). Hamilton was instrumental in the early growth of the Legion of Super-Heroes feature, as one of its first regular writers. He introduced many of the early Legion concepts including the Time Trapper in Adventure Comics #317 (Feb. 1964)McAvennie, Michael \"1960s\" in Dolan, p. 110: \"Writer Edmond Hamilton and artist John Forte made the first-ever reference to the nefarious Time Trapper.\" and Timber Wolf in Adventure Comics #327 (Dec. 1964).McAvennie \"1960s\" in Dolan, p. 113: \"Writer Edmond Hamilton and artist John Forte introduced them to Karth Arn, a super-strong acrobat calling himself 'Lone Wolf'...The hero soon adopted the moniker of Timber Wolf.\" His story \"The Clash of Cape and Cowl\" in World's Finest Comics #153 (Nov. 1965) is the source of an Internet meme in which Batman slaps Robin. Hamilton retired from comics with the publication of \"The Cape and Cowl Crooks\" in World's Finest Comics #159 (August 1966). In 1969, the Macfadden/Bartell Corporation published a collection of short science fiction stories \"Alien Earth and Other Stories\" (520-00219-075), where Hamilton's 1949 \"Alien Earth\" was featured along with novelettes by Isaac Asimov, Robert Bloch, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke and others. ==Marriage and collaboration== On December 31, 1946, Hamilton married fellow science fiction author and screenwriter Leigh Brackett in San Gabriel, California, and moved with her to Kinsman, Ohio. Afterward he would produce some of his best work including his novels The Star of Life (1947), The Valley of Creation (1948), City at World's End (1951) and The Haunted Stars (1960). In this more mature phase of his career, Hamilton moved away from the romantic and fantastic elements of his earlier fiction to create some unsentimental and realistic stories, such as \"What's It Like Out There?\" (Thrilling Wonder Stories, December 1952), his single most frequently- reprinted and anthologized work. Though Hamilton and Leigh Brackett worked side by side for a quarter-century, they rarely shared the task of authorship; their single formal collaboration, Stark and the Star Kings, originally intended for Harlan Ellison's The Last Dangerous Visions, would not appear in print until 2005. It has been speculated that when Brackett temporarily abandoned science fiction for screenwriting in the early 1960s, Hamilton did an uncredited revision and expansion of two early Brackett stories, \"Black Amazon of Mars\" and \"Queen of the Martian Catacombs\" \u2014 revised texts were published as the novellas People of the Talisman and The Secret of Sinharat (1964). Edmond Hamilton died in February 1977 in Lancaster, California, of complications following kidney surgery. In the year before his death, Toei Animation had launched production of an anime adaptation of his Captain Future novels and Tsuburaya Productions adapted Star Wolf into a tokusatsu series; both series were aired on Japanese television in 1978. The Captain Future adaptation was later exported to Europe, winning Hamilton a new and different fan base than the one that had acclaimed him half a century before, notably in France, Italy and Germany. Joint interviews of Brackett and Hamilton by Dave Truesdale were published in Tangent (Summer 1976), and by Darrell Schweitzer in Amazing Stories (January 1978), \u2014 the latter published several months after Hamilton's death, but conducted \"much earlier\", Truesdale attributes to Schweitzer. == Edmond Hamilton / Leigh Brackett Day == On July 18, 2009, Kinsman, Ohio, \"celebrat[ed] Edmond Hamilton Day, honoring 'The Dean of Science Fiction' and Kinsman resident\". == Selected works == === Captain Future === # Captain Future and the Space Emperor (1940) # Calling Captain Future (1940) # Captain Future's Challenge (1940) # The Triumph of Captain Future (1940), reprinted as Galaxy Mission # Captain Future and the Seven Space Stones (1941) # Star Trail to Glory (1941) # The Magician of Mars (1941) # The Lost World of Time (1941) # Quest Beyond the Stars (1942) # Outlaws of the Moon (1942) # The Comet Kings (1942) # Planets in Peril (1942) # The Face of the Deep (1943) # Star of Dread (1943) # Magic Moon (1944) # Red Sun of Danger (1945), reprinted as Danger Planet # Outlaw World (1946) Volumes #14 (Worlds to Come, 1943) and #17 (Days of Creation, 1944) were written by Joseph Samachson while #20, The Solar Invasion (1946) was by Manly Wade Wellman. The main series was followed by a set of seven novelettes from 1950-1951: \"The Return of Captain Future\", \"Children of the Sun\", \"The Harpers of Titan\", \"Pardon my Iron Nerves\", \"Moon of the Unforgotten\", \"Earthmen No More\" and \"Birthplace of Creation\". === Interstellar Patrol === A space opera sequence based on the seminal \"Crashing Suns\".

A crossover between this universe and Brackett's, \"Stark and the Star Kings\", was released in 2005, having originally been submitted to The Last Dangerous Visions. Two further stories in the same universe, \"The Star Hunter\" (1958) and \"The Tattooed Man\" (1957), were reissued in 2014 as The Last of the Star Kings. # The Star Kings (1949) # Return to the Stars (1968) # \"Stark and the Star Kings\" (2005) # The Last of the Star Kings (2014) === Starwolf === Interstellar adventure with mercenary Morgan Chane. # The Weapon from Beyond (1967) # The Closed Worlds (1968) # World of the Starwolves (1968) === Other novels === * The Fire Princess (1938) * A Yank at Valhalla (1950), also published as The Monsters of Juntonheim * Tharkol, Lord of the Unknown (1950), also published as The Prisoner of Mars * City at World's End (1951) * The Sun Smasher (1959), also published as Starman Come Home * The Star of Life (1959), also published as The Man Who Missed the Moonhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6559852-the-star-of-life * The Haunted Stars (1960) * Battle for the Stars (1961) * The Valley of Creation (1948) * Fugitive of the Stars (1965) * Doomstar (1966) * The Lake of Life (1978) === Collections === * The Horror on the Asteroid and Other Tales of Planetary Horror (1936) * Murder in the Clinic (1946) * What's It Like Out There? and Other Stories (1974) * The Best of Edmond Hamilton (Doubleday Science Fiction Book Club, April 1977), edited and introduced by Leigh Brackett * Kaldar: World of Antares (1998) * The Vampire Master and Other Tales of Terror (2000) * Stark and the Star Kings (2005), Leigh Brackett and Hamilton * Two Worlds of Edmond Hamilton (2008) * The Sargasso of Space and Two Others (2009) Frank R.
