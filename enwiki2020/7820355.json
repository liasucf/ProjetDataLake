He was also a former chairman of the Western Operational Research Discussion Society and was a keynote speaker at the Second IMA International Conference on Mathematics in Sport in 2009.IMA Mathematics in Sport conference web site. Lewis also undertook various consultancy roles in England and Australia. ===Duckworth-Lewis Method=== In the 1980s, Frank Duckworth had proposed a method of resetting targets in interrupted limited-overs cricket matches. After the 1992 Cricket World Cup, commentator Christopher Martin-Jenkins asked for a better calculation system. Lewis read Duckworth's 1992 paper Fair Play in Foul Weather and together they devised the Duckworth-Lewis Method. In 2014, Steven Stern became custodian of the method, and it was renamed the Duckworth\u2013Lewis\u2013Stern method. ==References== ==External links== *Profile at Oxford Brookes University *Catalogue of Tony Lewis' papers concerning the D/L method, held at the Modern Records Centre, University of Warwick Category:1942 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Limited overs cricket Category:Academics of the University of the West of England, Bristol Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:English statisticians Category:Alumni of the University of Sheffield Category:People from Bolton Category:Academics of Oxford Brookes University ",
