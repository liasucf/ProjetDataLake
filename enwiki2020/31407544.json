    "text": "Fonseca Atl\u00e9tico Clube, is a sports club from the city of Niter\u00f3i in the state of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. The club was founded on 12 October 1917 by local merchants. The club always has been at home in the street Alameda S\u00e3o Boaventura in the quarter Fonseca and moved to its current location there in 1926. The club is best known for its association football team, which between 1937 and 1962 won a record eleven times the championship of Niter\u00f3i and in the years 1959, 1960 and 1962 three times the Campeonato Fluminense, ie., the championship of the state of Rio the Janeiro, which then did not include the city of the same name, which as the then national capital formed as Distrito Federal a separate entity. The three state titles qualified Fonseca to participate in the Ta\u00e7a Brasil, a competition which served as national championship. On each of those occasions the club exited the competition after the first round. The most famous player in the history of the club is Orlando Pe\u00e7anha who started his career with the youth teams of Fonseca and progressed to win the World Cups of 1958 and 1962 with Brasil. The club also had some local success in table tennis and cycling in the 1950s and indoor football in the 1990s. These days the club is still active in ballroom dancing, swimming, hydro-gymnastics, jiu jitsu and capoira, a martial arts form that originated in the north-east of Brazil. == Honours == * Campeonato Fluminense: 1959, 1960, 1962. * Championship of Niter\u00f3i: 1937, 1939, 1950, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1957, 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962 . == External links == * Fonseca Atl\u00e9tico Clube - official website via Wayback machine. * Antonio Mario Ielo: Fonseca Atl\u00e9tico Clube \u2013 Niter\u00f3i / RJ, Hist\u00f3ria do Futebol-Final: A Enciclop\u00e9dia do Futebol na Internet!!!!, 27 February 2012. * Roberto Castanheira: Fonseca Atl\u00e9tico Clube - Fotos, Grupo Prazer de Jogar Niter\u00f3i, 22 April 2011.
