    "text": "Some bull-type terrier breeds (American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier and Bull Terrier) Bull-type terriers are a dog sub-type of terriers. It is also a section of the terrier group at the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI). All bull-type terriers share the same ancestry in the crossbreeding between bulldog breeds and terriers. == History== In 1835 in England the blood sports, once extremely popular, became illegal, but the practice of some of these blood sports continued to be secretly practiced. Sports such as rat-baiting and dog fighting had grown in popularity because it was easier to hide such events. For dog fighting, a particular type of dog gained notoriety. Uniting the traits of the best dogs in these sports (Old English Bulldogs and terriers) was born the bull and terrier, a very varied type of dog that became the common ancestor of the modern breeds that are part of the bull-type terrier group. == Breeds == ===Extant=== * American Pit Bull Terrier (not recognized by the FCI and the AKC) * American Staffordshire Terrier * Boston Terrier (debatable) * Bull Terrier * Miniature Bull Terrier * Staffordshire Bull Terrier ===Extinct=== * Blue Paul Terrier * Bull and terrier (the common ancestor of all bull-type terriers) == See also == * Bulldog type == References == Category:Terriers Category:Dog types ",
