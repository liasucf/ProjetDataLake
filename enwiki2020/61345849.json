Upon its release, We Boom enjoyed commercial success in both South Korea and the United States. The extended play was the unit's third chart-topper on the Gaon Album Chart, their first release to receive a Platinum certificate by KMCA, and subsequently the best-selling release by an NCT unit in 2019. It also attained success in the States, earning the unit their best sales week to date while becoming the group their second and third top-ten entry on the Billboard World Albums and Billboard Heatseekers Albums, respectively. In conjunction to the EP's promotion, \"Boom\" was released as the lead single on the same digital release date to moderate success on the Gaon Digital Chart, peaking at number ninety, while barely missing out the top ten on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart.
