Slam'n Sammy Miller Wedge, in \"Beauty Beyond the Twilight Zone\", p.38. Miller was responsible for the \"Miller Wedge\" digger in 1974 and the rocket-powered Vanishing Point Vega FC in the 1980s.Taylor, p.38. The Wedge was allegedly a product of Miller's dislike of repeated funny car fires. It featured bicycle front wheels, a low-mounted, front-sloping rear wing, and a mid-mounted engine (placed further ahead of the rear axle than most similar dragsters).Taylor, p.38 photo. ==Notes== ==Sources== *Taylor, Thom. \"Beauty Beyond the Twilight Zone\" in Hot Rod, April 2017, pp. 30\u201343.
