After the takeover, it was confirmed that Newland would remain as editor under the new owners, despite some reports that he would be replaced by Dominic Lawson, editor of the Sunday Telegraph, and others such as Andrew Neil, publisher of The Scotsman and The Business. Newland was opposed to introducing a compact (tabloid) version of The Daily Telegraph but was known to want to introduce some changes to the broadsheet. Newland resigned as Daily Telegraph editor on 18 November 2005. His temporary replacement was confirmed as John Bryant, the Telegraph Group's newly appointed Editor-in- Chief. Bryant was never officially editor of the Daily Telegraph, a much- coveted office previously held by the likes of Lord Deedes and Max Hastings.
