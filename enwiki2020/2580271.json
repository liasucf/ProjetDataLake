    "text": "Men's World is a British soft-core pornographic magazine founded in 1988. It is released every four weeks and its content mostly consists of nude pictorials of well-known erotic and pornographic actresses. American models feature frequently, and well-known names like Aria Giovanni, Erica Campbell, Devon, and have been cover girls in the past. British models who have been featured regularly in the magazine include Joanne Guest and Abigail Toyne. When first published, Men's World was unusually large-format (an open spread page being closer to A2 than A3 as with most magazines), and the centrefold was in effect a high-gloss poster. After a while, the magazine reverted to the smaller, more usual format. Men's World is published by Paul Raymond, who also publishes Club International, Escort, Mayfair, Men Only, and Razzle. Their magazines are generally available in most newsagents, although some larger retailers require a modesty bag in order to protect minors from seeing gratuitous flesh on display on the cover. From 2013 the magazine was available for some time in digital format on the Paul Raymond digital newsstand. Men's World also has a digital identity on the official Paul Raymond site, where the hardcore imagery not found in the print version is also shown. ==See also== * Pornography in the United Kingdom * Outline of British pornography ==References== ==External links== *paulraymond.xxx Official website of Men's World publishers Paul Raymond Publications *Official digital newsstand of Paul Raymond Publications Category:Pornographic magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Men's magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Magazines established in 1988 Category:Monthly magazines published in the United Kingdom ",
