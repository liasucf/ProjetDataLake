    "text": "N-Methylphenethylamine (NMPEA) is a naturally occurring trace amine neuromodulator in humans that is derived from the trace amine, phenethylamine (PEA). It has been detected in human urine (<1 \u03bcg over 24 hours)G. P. Reynolds and D. O. Gray (1978) J. Chrom. B: Biomedical Applications 145 137\u2013140. and is produced by phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase with phenethylamine as a substrate. PEA and NMPEA are both alkaloids that are found in a number of different plant species as well.T. A. Smith (1977). \"Phenethylamine and related compounds in plants.\" Phytochemistry 16 9\u201318. Some Acacia species, such as A. rigidula, contain remarkably high levels of NMPEA (~2300\u20135300 ppm).B. A. Clement, C. M. Goff and T. D. A. Forbes (1998) Phytochemistry 49 1377\u20131380. NMPEA is also present at low concentrations (< 10 ppm) in a wide range of foodstuffs.G. B. Neurath et al. (1977) Fd. Cosmet. Toxicol. 15 275\u2013282. NMPEA is a positional isomer of amphetamine. ==Biosynthesis== ==Chemistry== In appearance, NMPEA is a colorless liquid. NMPEA is a weak base, with pKa = 10.14; pKb = 3.86 (calculated from data given as KbW.H. Carothers, C. F. Bickford and G. J. Hurwitz (1927) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 49 2908\u20132914.). It forms a hydrochloride salt, m.p. 162\u2013164\u00b0C.C. Z. Ding et al. (1993) J. Med. Chem. 36 1711\u20131715. Although NMPEA is available commercially, it may be synthesized by various methods. An early synthesis reported by Carothers and co-workers involved conversion of phenethylamine to its p-toluenesulfonamide, followed by N-methylation using methyl iodide, then hydrolysis of the sulfonamide. A more recent method, similar in principle, and used for making NMPEA radio-labeled with 14C in the N-methyl group, started with the conversion of phenethylamine to its trifluoroacetamide. This was N-methylated (in this particular case using 14C \u2013 labeled methyl iodide), and then the amide hydrolyzed.I. Osamu (1983) Eur. J. Nucl. Med. 8 385\u2013388. NMPEA is a substrate for both MAO-A (KM = 58.8 \u03bcM) and MAO-B (KM = 4.13 \u03bcM) from rat brain mitochondria.O. Suzuki, M. Oya and Y. Katsumata (1980) Biochem. Pharmacol. 29 2663\u20132667. ==Pharmacology== NMPEA is a pressor, with 1/350 x the potency of epinephrine.W. H. Hartung (1945) Ind. Eng. Chem. 37 126\u2013137. Like its parent compound, PEA, and isomer, amphetamine, NMPEA is a potent agonist of human trace amine-associated receptor 1 (hTAAR1). It has comparable pharmacodynamic and toxicodynamic properties to that of phenethylamine, amphetamine, and other methylphenethylamines in rats. As with PEA, NMPEA is metabolized relatively rapidly by monoamine oxidases during first pass metabolism; both compounds are preferentially metabolized by MAO-B. ===Toxicology=== The \"minimum lethal dose\" (mouse, i.p.) of the HCl salt of NMPEA is 203 mg/kg;A. M. Hjort (1934) J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 52 101\u2013112. the LD50 for oral administration to mice of the same salt is 685 mg/kg.C. M. Suter and A. W. Weston (1941) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 63 602\u2013605. Acute toxicity studies on NMPEA show an LD50 = 90 mg/kg, after intravenous administration to mice.A. M. Lands and J. I. Grant (1952). \"The vasopressor action and toxicity of cyclohexylethylamine derivatives.\" J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 106 341\u2013345. == References == Category:Phenethylamine alkaloids Category:TAAR1 agonists Category:Amphetamine Category:Trace amines Category:Phenethylamines Category:Norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agents Category:Amino acid derivatives ",
