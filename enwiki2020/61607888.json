    "text": "The 1921 season of Auckland Rugby League was its 13th. Seventy two teams played across its six main grades. The first grade competition featured seven teams, City Rovers, Marist Old Boys, Maritime, Devonport, Fire Brigade (formerly Grafton Athletic), Newton Rangers, and Ponsonby United. City Rovers comfortably won the senior championship for the 4th time with a 8 win, 1 draw, 0 loss record ahead of Maritime who were unable to repeat their title win from the previous season. City had previously won the title in 1910, 1911, and 1916. This was to be the first of 3 consecutive titles for them. They also won the Roope Rooster knockout competition for the 3rd time after previous wins in 1916 and 1918. == Club name changes and mergers == On 13 April the Management Committee of the Auckland Rugby League met. At the meeting Grafton was granted permission to change its name to \"Fire Brigade Club\". Devonport United notified the league that the Devonport Borough Council had allocated the Devonport Domain for its use. During the season the club was named 'North Shore' and 'Devonport' interchangeably by both The New Zealand Herald and the Auckland Star. In 1920 the club had seen a merger between North Shore Albions and the Sunnyside club and agreed on the name Devonport United but it appears that the stronger club's name was still more favoured by those reporting on the games, and it was eventually the name adopted by the club. While the Kingsland Rovers club wrote asking for advice on what it should do regarding a ground for the club to play at. == Carlaw Park open for business == History was made on 25 June when the first ever match was played on Carlaw Park between City Rovers and Maritime. The match was won by City Rovers 10 points to 8. Prior to the match an official opening ceremony was held. \"The park was declared open by Hon. Arthur Myers, MP. Mr and Mrs. Carlaw were each presented with a gold badge and certificate of life membership on the ground, and at the conclusion of the ceremony Mrs Carlaw kicked off for the first game on the new park\". City Rovers capped a remarkable season by winning the Thacker Shield from Ponsonby United on the final day of the season after having already won the Monteith Shield by winning the First Grade Championship, and the Roope Rooster Knock-out trophy. == Female football club denied by the league == On 12 July a meeting was held in Parnell to form a \"girls\" rugby league competition and over 40 enrolling. They were to play a game on Carlaw Park on the following Saturday afternoon. They were all aged between 16 and 20 years of age. The chairman of the Parnell club, Mr. A. R. Turner explained \"that it wished to develop the girls as well as the men, and to this end the club was being formed at the suggestion of the girls\". A trophy \"similar to the Monteith Shield\" had been donated, and \"members of the Auckland League Management Committee had donated a football, and were providing assistance in supplying jerseys. At the meeting when the time for enrollment came it was described that \"they rose in a body and fairly rushed the table, which was in danger of being overturned in the excitement of the moment\" Ivan Culpan, secretary of the league told the girls that the league would train them every evening in the lead up to the match. Over the next week the number of girls enrolled increased to 65. It later transpired that the members of the Auckland Rugby League who had attended had done so by invitation and were not necessarily acting on behalf of the league with the comments they had made. At the Auckland Rugby league Management meeting the following night the decision on whether to support the girls playing and affiliate the club with the league was deferred. Both G. Hunt and E Phelan spoke against allowing the girls to play. And at a meeting on 20 July the Auckland Rugby League decided to oppose the girls playing football. Mr. J. Carlaw said that medical opinion was in opposition to females playing the sport. Mr Stallworthy and Mr. E Feilding suggested a trial game with modified rules take place with doctors watching but the request was declined. == Arthur Singe switches to rugby league == At the beginning of the season Marist Old Boys enticed Arthur Singe to join the club. He was an outstanding rugby player playing in the wing-forward position (flanker in today's terms). He played for the New Zealand Army rugby team which toured Great Britain and then South Africa at the end of the war. When he returned to New Zealand he played for the Marist rugby club and played for Auckland 8 teams. He narrowly missed the New Zealand rugby team to tour Australia after playing just 10 minutes in the North Island v South Island match which acted as a trial of sorts. He switched codes and joined Marist, playing for them in 1921\u201322 and 1925\u201326 before going on tour with the New Zealand team on their ill-fated tour of England. Seven players went on strike due to issues with management on the tour and were ultimately banned for life. Singe was the only Auckland player among the strikers. The ban was lifted in 1962, 26 years after his death in 1936. Singe was to play 48 games for Marist scoring 148 points, 15 games for Auckland scoring 25 points, and 8 matches for New Zealand. == Monteith Shield (first grade championship) == === Final standings === {| |- | {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !width=175 |Team !width=20 abbr=\"Played\" |Pld !width=20 abbr=\"Won\" |W !width=20 abbr=\"Drawn\" |D !width=20 abbr=\"Lost\" |L !width=20 abbr=\"For\" |F !width=20 abbr=\"Against\" |A !width=20 abbr=\"Points\" |Pts |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|City Rovers |9||8||1||0||250||50||17 |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Maritime |9||6||0||3||135||112||12 |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Marist Old Boys |9||5||0||4||167||122||10 |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Ponsonby United |9||5||0||4||138||99||10 |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Newton Rangers |9||3||1||5||83||129||7 |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Devonport United |7||1||0||6||61||132||2 |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|Fire Brigade |8||1||0||7||49||179||2 |- |} === Monteith Shield fixtures === ====Round 1==== ====Round 2==== ====Round 3==== ====Round 4==== ====Round 5==== ====Round 6==== Round 6 was somewhat farcical. Devonport fielded several juniors and when the score got to 14\u20130 in favour of Maritime very quickly four Maritime players changed teams to make it a more even contest. The remainder of the game more resembled a practice match. While Newton defaulted their match with Fire Brigade as only 6 players turned out. The New Zealand Herald match report stated that \"counter-attractions proving too strong for the Newton players\". ====Round 7==== ====Round 8==== ====Round 9==== Round 9 saw the opening of Carlaw Park and the first ever match played on its soil. City defeated Maritime by 10 points to 8 in front of 7000 spectators. The other two matches for this round were postponed. The captains of both Newton and Devonport decided to postpone the match, though the majority of the Devonport players were unaware of this arrangement and arrived at the ground ready to play. While on the same day the Fire Brigade players were called to a warehouse fire in the city at mid-day and were tired and late arriving to the ground so the match was abandoned. ====Round 10==== ====Round 11==== The City v Newton game was discontinued at halftime due to the score line. Newton had started the match a man short and the score line had already blown out to 37\u20135 by the interval. ===Roope Rooster knockout competition=== The first round match between Marist Old Boys and Maritime ended controversially with Marist complaining that the match had finished early (when they were trailing by 10 points to 8. They protested and the match was replayed with Maritime winning 21 to 10. The final was won by City Rovers who defeated Maritime in the final in front of a large crowd by 30 points to 14. Over \u00a3230 were taken at the gate which was a record for Carlaw Park, albeit in its first season of use. From this 50 percent went to the Auckland League Sick and Injured Players' Fund, 25 percent to the Hospital Radium Fund, and 25 percent to the St. John Ambulance Association . ====Round 1==== ====Semi final==== ====Round 1 replay==== ====Semi final==== ====Final==== ==Top try scorers and point scorers== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !Rank!!Player!!Team!!Tries |- |1||Ben Davidson||City Rovers||13 |- |2||Ivan Littlewood||Maritime||12 |- |3||A Eustace||Marist Old Boys||10 |- |4||Alf Townsend||City Rovers||8 |- |5||Dougie McGregor||Ponsonby United||7 |- |5||H Hawkes||City Rovers||7 |- |5||Brien||Maritime||7 |- |8||Bill Davidson||City Rovers||6 |- |8||P Gallagher||Marist Old Boys||6 |- |10||Bill Walsh||Ponsonby United||5 |- |10||Eric McGregor||Ponsonby United||5 |- |10||George Mormon||Ponsonby United||5 |- |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !Rank!!Player!!Team!!Tries!!Con!!Pen!!Mark!!Drop Goal!!Points |- |1||Bill Davidson||City Rovers||4||15||3||1||0||50 |- |2||Ben Davidson||City Rovers||13||2||0||0||0||43 |- |3||Dougie McGregor||Ponsonby United||7||7||2||0||0||39 |- |4||Ivan Littlewood||Maritime||12||1||0||0||0||38 |- |5||A Eustace||Marist Old Boys||10||0||0||0||0||30 |- |6||Arthur Singe||Marist Old Boys||4||3||3||0||0||24 |- |7||Alf Townsend||City Rovers||8||0||0||0||0||24 |- |7||Eric Grey||Maritime||4||3||3||0||0||24 |- |9||Craddock Dufty||Newton Rangers||0||7||3||0||1||22 |- |10||H Hawkes||City Rovers||7||0||0||0||0||21 |- |10||Brien||Maritime||7||0||0||0||0||21 |- |} == Other club matches and lower grades == === Lower grade clubs === There were 7 lower grades in 1921 if you include the Sixth Grade which was split into an A and B grade, and the cadet competition. Clubs with only lower grade teams were: Grades were made of the following teams with the winning team in bold: *Second Grade: Maritime, Newton, Otahuhu, Ellerslie, City Rovers, Ponsonby, Manukau, Marist Old Boys. Newton defeated Maritime in the Second Grade final by 17 points to 11 at Carlaw Park to win the Second Grade Cup. *Third Grade (Myers Cup): Point Chevalier, North Shore, Kingsland, Ponsonby, Ellerslie, Newton. *Fourth Grade: City Rovers, City Rovers B, Kingsland, Manukau, Point Chevalier, Richmond, Maritime, Otahuhu, Ponsonby, and Takapuna. *Fifth Grade: Manukau, Northcote, Otahuhu, Ponsonby, Richmond, Maritime A, City Rovers, Maritime B, Manukau, Northcote, North Shore, Marist Old Boys, Takapuna. City Rovers defeated Richmond by 5 points to 2 to win the championship. *Sixth Grade: Ponsonby United, Ellerslie, Otahuhu, Kingsland B, Otahuhu A, Kingsland A, City Rovers A, Takapuna, Marist Old Boys, Richmond, Manukau, Maritime, Ellerslie B, Marist Old Boys B *Sixth Grade B: Richmond, Maritime, Marist Old Boys, Ellerslie, and Ponsonby United. *Cadet Competition: Senior Cadets 13th Company A, Senior Cadets 18th Company, 24th Company, Senior 4th Company, Senior Cadets 13th Company B, 51st Senior Cadets Company (Devonport), 23rd Company, 37 Company, 34th Senior Cadets Company (Mt Eden). This competition was won by the 18th Company of Senior Cadets after they won the final game of the season defeating the 13th Company by 7 points to 2. === Challenge Shield === The Thacker Shield was held by Ponsonby United coming into the 1921 season however there was a dispute over whether the shield should be held by North Island teams as it was unclear if it had been intended for competition among South Island teams only. The New Zealand council decided that the rules should be amended to allow North Island teams to hold it but the donor, Dr. H. T.J. Thacker and the Canterbury Rugby League would not agree to them. As such the shield was returned to the donor. Mr. C Weaver donated a trophy to take its place and this became known as the Challenge Shield and it was this that Ponsonby went on to defend twice. They first hosted Petone from Wellington who they beat 18\u201313. In the curtain-raiser Petone juniors were defeated by Richmond by 14 points to 8. In the evening the Petone players were entertained at the Druids' Hall by the Ponsonby club and Auckland League. They later defeated Huntly 19\u20138 before losing the Shield to local rivals City Rovers === Exhibition matches === {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" |+ class=\"nowrap\" | List of exhibition matches |- | ! scope=\"col\" | Date ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" | Score ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" | Score ! scope=\"col\" | Venue ! scope=\"col\" | Attendance |- ! scope=\"row\" | Exhibition match | 18 June || Hamilton|| 19 || Maritime || 16 || Hamilton |- ! scope=\"row\" | Exhibition match | 13 Aug || Cambridge|| 16 || City Rovers || 14 || Victoria Square, Cambridge |- |} ==Auckland representative fixtures== It was a very busy season for the Auckland representative team with ten matches played. Though in reality B and C teams played some of the fixtures as matches were played at the same time in different centres. They won seven matches and lost three. On 20 August Auckland played three matches, which showed off their depth. One at Carlaw Park versus King Country, one in Hamilton against South Auckland, and one against Wellington on the Basin Reserve. They won against King Country and Wellington, with a loss against South Auckland. ===Auckland v New Zealand=== ===Auckland v Wellington (Northern Union C.C.)=== ===Auckland v Hawkes Bay (Northern Union C.C.)=== ===Auckland v King Country=== ===South Auckland (Waikato) v Auckland=== ===Wellington v Auckland=== ===West Coast v Auckland=== No full team lists were published for this match and none of the scorers were listed either in match reports from any newspaper in New Zealand. The match report did however mention that the following players for Auckland performed well: Maurice Wetherill, W Flynn, G Yardley, T Peckham, V Thomas, and Bill Stormont. It is most likely that Auckland fielded the same touring team that played in Wellington 4 days prior and in Christchurch 3 days later. ===Canterbury v Auckland=== ===Hawkes Bay v Auckland B=== ===Auckland v South Auckland (Waikato)=== ===Auckland representative matches played and scorers=== There was no scoring for the West Coast match where Auckland won by 47 points to 7. Bill Davidson led Auckland in scoring with 40 points from 6 tries and 11 conversions. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !No!!Name!!Club Team!!Play!!Tries!!Con!!Pen!!Points |- |1||Bill Davidson||City Rovers||4||6||11||0||40 |- |2||Bert Avery||Marist Old Boys||4||9||0||0||27 |- |3||H Hawkes||City Rovers||5||7||0||0||21 |- |4||Thomas McClymont||Ponsonby United||4||4||4||0||20 |- |5||Ben Davidson||City Rovers||4||6||0||0||18 |- |6||M Flynn||Maritime||6||0||8||0||16 |- |7||Bill Stormont||Marist Old Boys||5||3||1||0||11 |- |7||Wally Somers||Newton||2||3||1||0||11 |- |9||Charles Woolley||Fire Brigade||5||2||0||0||6 |- |9||John Lang||Maritime||4||2||0||0||6 |- |9||George Paki||City Rovers||2||2||0||0||6 |- |12||George Yardley||Maritime||4||1||1||0||5 |- |12||Tim Peckham||City Rovers||4||1||1||0||5 |- |12||Arthur Singe||Marist Old Boys||4||1||1||0||5 |- |12||Eric Grey||Maritime||4||1||1||0||5 |- |16||Frank Delgrosso||Ponsonby United||2||1||0||0||3 |- |16||Maurice Wetherill||City Rovers||7||1||0||0||3 |- |16||G Cargill||Marist Old Boys||3||1||0||0||3 |- |16||Leonard Newdick||Newton Rangers||1||1||0||0||3 |- |16||Ivan Littlewood||Maritime||1||1||0||0||3 |- |16||Wilfred McNeil||Ponsonby United||2||1||0||0||3 |- |16||C James||Newton Rangers||2||1||0||0||3 |- |16||John McGregor||Maritime||2||1||0||0||3 |- |24||Sam Lowrie||Ponsonby United||3||0||0||0||0 |- |24||Bill Williams||Newton Rangers*||3||0||0||0||0 |- |24||H Wynn||Devonport United||2||0||0||0||0 |- |24||V Thomas||City Rovers||2||0||0||0||0 |- |24||P Gallagher||Marist Old Boys||1||0||0||0||0 |- |24||Nelson||Devonport United||1||0||0||0||0 |- |24||Nelson Bass||Newton Rangers||1||0||0||0||0 |- |24||James Hing||Marist Old Boys||1||0||0||0||0 |- |24||Joe Meadows||Ponsonby United||1||0||0||0||0 |- |24||Bill Walsh||Ponsonby United||1||0||0||0||0 |- |24||Craddock Dufty||Newton Rangers||1||0||0||0||0 |- |24||George Mormon||Ponsonby United||1||0||0||0||0 |- |24||J Price||Devonport United||1||0||0||0||0 |- |24||S Delaney||Newton Rangers||1||0||0||0||0 |- |24||Billy Ghent||Marist Old Boys||1||0||0||0||0 |- |24||M Clark||?||1||0||0||0||0 |- |24||F Turner||Marist Old Boys||1||0||0||0||0 |- |24||N Ballantyne||Maritime||1||0||0||0||0 |- |24||Charles Webb||Devonport United||1||0||0||0||0 |- |24||Alf Townsend||City Rovers||1||0||0||0||0 |- |24||A Eustace||Marist Old Boys||1||0||0||0||0 |- |} \\- Bill Williams began the season playing for Newton Rangers however after they were struggling for numbers and defaulted a game he transferred to the Fire Brigade team where he played 3 matches in June and July. == New Zealand representatives from Auckland == Team to tour Australia Backs * Eric Grey (Maritime) * Charles Woolley (Fire Brigade) * Bill Davidson (City Rovers) * Bert Laing (City Rovers) * Clarrie Polson (Newton Rangers) Forwards * Wally Somers (Newton Rangers) * Bill Williams (Newton Rangers) * Henry Tancred (City Rovers) * George Paki (City Rovers) * Joe Meadows (Ponsonby) * Bert Avery (Maritime) == References == == External links == * Auckland Rugby League Official Site |} Category:Auckland Rugby League seasons Auckland Rugby League ",
