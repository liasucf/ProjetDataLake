He has raced in six countries, namely France, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Germany, the United States and Hong Kong. He showed top- class form as a two-year-old in 2016 when he won two of his three races including the Group 1 Crit\u00e9rium de Saint-Cloud. He failed to win in the following year but ran second in the Prix du Jockey Club and fourth in the Irish Derby. In 2018 he won four consecutive races, namely the Prix d'H\u00e9douville, Grand Prix de Chantilly, Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud (Group 1) and Prix Foy. In 2019 he won a third Group 1 race when he took the Prix Ganay and recorded his biggest win in October when he took the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. ==Background== Waldgeist is a chestnut horse with a white blaze bred in England by the Waldlerche Partnership.

He was sent into training with Andr\u00e9 Fabre in France. He was sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo became one of the world's leading stallions, earning his tenth champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland title in 2018. His other progeny include Cape Blanco, Frankel, Golden Lilac, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle, Found Minding and Ruler of the World. Waldgeist's dam Waldlerche showed high class form in France, winning the Prix Penelope in 2012. before becoming a successful broodmare whose other foals have included the Prix de Malleret winner Waldlied. Waldlerche was a half-sister to the St Leger winner Masked Marvel and closely related to the Deutsches Derby winner Waldpark. ==Racing career== ===2016: two-year-old season=== Waldgeist made his debut in a maiden race over 1600 metres at Chantilly Racecourse on 8 September in which he started odds-on favourite and won by two lengths from Called To The Bar, a colt who went on to win several Group races. He was stepped up in class for the Group 3 Prix de Cond\u00e9 over 1800 metres at the same track a month later but despite starting favourite he finished third in a three-way photo finish, beaten a neck and a short head by Frankuus and Prinz Hlodowig. Twelve days later the colt was moved up to the highest class for the Group 1 Crit\u00e9rium de Saint-Cloud over 2000 metres on soft ground and started at odds of 10/1 in a thirteen-runner field. After racing in mid-division Waldgeist made a strong run up the stands- side (the right hand side from the jockeys' viewpoint), took the lead 150 metres from the finish and won by a length from Best Solution with the favourite Capri half a length away in third. The unplaced horses included Prinz Hlodowig, Frankuus, Wings of Eagles and Rekindling. Boudot commented \"He is still quite tender and has plenty to learn so we wanted to give him a good lesson last time. He still lacks a little strength but has a lot of quality and will make a good three-year-old. It is great to win the race for my boss and he is certainly a horse to watch out for next year\". In the official European Classification of two-year-olds for 2016 Waldgeist was given a rating of 114, making him the tenth best juvenile colt of the season, eight pounds behind the top-rated Churchill. ===2017: three-year-old season=== Waldgeist began his second campaign by starting favourite for the Group 2 Prix Greffulhe over 2000 metres at Saint-Cloud Racecourse on 8 May and finished second of the five runners behind Recoletos. In the Prix du Jockey-Club at Chantilly four weeks later he produced a sustained late run to take the lead in the closing stages but was caught on the line and beaten a short head by the favourite Brametot.

Four weeks later at the same track he was made the 2.6/1 favourite for the 2400 metre Prix d'H\u00e9douville.

After racing in third place he made a sustained run in the straight and got the better of a closely contested struggle with Coronet in the last 100 metres to win by a short head. After the race Gestut Ammerland's Dietrich von Boetticher said \"It was a great performance and, although he has taken time to mature, he is stronger now as a four-year-old. He has proved himself since the start of the season and was given a great ride by Pierre- Charles Boudot today\". Following a break of two and a half months Waldgeist returned to the track for the Prix Foy (a major trial race for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe) at Longchamp on 15 September. Starting the 0.6/1 favourite he won in \"impressive\" style as he took the lead in the last 100 metres and pulled away to win by two and a half lengths from Talismanic. The four other beaten runners were Cloth of Stars, Way To Paris, Capri and the Japanese challenger Clincher. In the 2018 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe on 7 October Waldgeist started at odds of 6/1, making him easily the best-fancied of the French-trained runners.

He was settled in third place by Boudot before taking the lead 200 metres out and drawing away to win \"readily\" by four and a half lengths from Study of Man. Fabre commented \"He's five now, and I can train him harder. He takes the work better. Remember, he was beaten a short head in the Prix du Jockey Club. He was unlucky and should have won that day, so he is competitive at this trip\". In June Waldgeist was sent to Royal Ascot for the Prince of Wales's Stakes over ten furlongs. In a race run in driving rain he finished third behind Crystal Ocean and Magical. In the following month he returned to Ascot for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. After racing in mid-division he stayed on strongly in the straight to finish third behind Enable and Crystal Ocean. As on 2018, Waldgeist prepared for the Arc de Triomphe in the Prix Foy and won again, coming home two lengths clear of his three opponents at odds of 2/5. On 6 October Waldgeist started the 13.1/1 fifth choice behind Enable, Sottsass, Japan and Ghaiyyath in the 98th running of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Boudot settled Waldgeist in mid-division as Ghaiyyath set the pace from Fierement, Magical and Enable.
