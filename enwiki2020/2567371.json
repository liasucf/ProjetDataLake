The game is attended by 39,464 fans braving 39-degree weather. *April 17 \u2013 Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Dick Ruthven, signed from Fresno State, makes his major league debut without ever playing in the minor leagues. He starts against the Montreal Expos, allowing four runs in less than two innings, but did not figure in the decision as the Phillies won 9-6. *April 27 \u2013 In 50-degree weather, Kansas City Royals rookie Steve Busby no-hits the host Detroit Tigers 3\u20130. It is the first Royals no-hitter, and the first in Tiger Stadium since Virgil Trucks' in . With the designated hitter rule in effect, Busby becomes the first pitcher of a no-hitter to not come to bat. *May 8 **For the second time in his career, Willie Stargell of the Pittsburgh Pirates hits a home run out of Dodger Stadium. His blast off Andy Messersmith hits the right field pavilion roof 470 feet away. His first home run, a 506-foot shot, came off Alan Foster on August 5, . The Los Angeles Dodgers win, 7\u20134. **In a 9\u20137 losing effort against the San Francisco Giants, St. Louis Cardinals ace Bob Gibson makes his 242nd consecutive start.

For Mays, older than a half dozen of the old Mets, it is the 655th homer of his career. Rusty Staub drives in two runs to back Jon Matlack. In the Old Timers' Game, the Brooklyn Dodgers/New York Yankees team loses to the Mets 1\u20130 in two innings. *June 13 \u2013 At Riverfront Stadium, St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Rick Wise loses a no-hitter when the Cincinnati Reds' Joe Morgan singles with one out in the ninth inning. It will be the only hit Wise allows in an 8\u20130 shutout win. Wise, who no-hit the Reds at Riverfront in , was bidding to join Addie Joss as the only pitchers to throw two no\u2013hitters against the same team. *June 19 **In a Dodgers 4\u20130 victory over Cincinnati, Pete Rose (single) and Willie Davis (HR) each collect their 2,000th career hit. **Dave Winfield debuts in a San Diego Padre 7-3 loss to the Houston Astros. Winfield\u2014who was also drafted by the Minnesota Vikings of the NFL and basketball's Atlanta Hawks (NBA) and Utah Stars (ABA) -- would go 1 for 4 in his debut, and never spend a day in the minor leagues. After a 22-year career, he is voted into baseball's Hall of Fame. *June 20 **Cy Acosta of the Chicago White Sox becomes the first American League pitcher to bat since the DH rule went into effect. Acosta strikes out in the eighth inning, but is credited with an 8\u20133 victory over the California Angels. **Bobby Bonds leads off with a home run, but the Giants lose 7\u20135 to Cincinnati. It is Bonds' 22nd leadoff home run, breaking Lou Brock's National League record. *June 23 \u2013 Pitcher Ken Brett of the Philadelphia Phillies tops the Montreal Expos 7\u20132, and hits a home run for his fourth consecutive game, setting a major league record.

He will total 10 for his career. *June 28 \u2013 Willie Stargell hits his 300th career home run helping the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the St. Louis Cardinals 6\u20130. ===July=== *July 1 \u2013 Luis Aparicio of the Boston Red Sox steals the 500th base of his career in a 9\u20135 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. It is the highest total in the American League since Eddie Collins retired in 1930. *July 3 \u2013 Brothers Gaylord Perry (Indians) and Jim Perry (Tigers) pitch against each other for the only time in their careers. Neither finishes the game, but Gaylord is charged with the 5\u20134 loss. Two Norm Cash home runs help the Tigers. *July 4 \u2013 The Minnesota Twins bring their first-round June draft pick, pitcher Eddie Bane, straight to the major leagues, in an attempt to boost interest and attendance (the brainchild of owner Calvin Griffith). Bane brings a 40-4 record with him from Arizona State University, and goes seven innings in his debut, a no-decision start. A crowd of 45,890 is on hand at Metropolitan Stadium. *July 9 \u2013 In a record-setting walkathon between the Cincinnati Reds and Montreal Expos, 25 bases on balls are handed out as Montreal strolls to an 11\u20136 win. Well off the American League's two-team mark of 30, this tops the National League record of 23, last reached on July 7, 1911. Six Montreal pitchers walk 16, one short of the record for an NL team, while two Reds pitchers walk nine. Hal King pinch hits a grand slam for the Reds in the 6th inning, his second pinch homer in nine days. *July 11: **Jim Northrup, batting leadoff for the Detroit Tigers, drives in eight runs in a 14\u20132 win over Texas. **In San Diego, the Pittsburgh Pirates drub the Padres 10\u20132. Willie Stargell contributes the 302nd home run of his career to pass Ralph Kiner as the all- time Pirate home run leader. **The New York Mets sell Jim Fregosi to The Texas Rangers. *July 15: **Willie McCovey hits his 400th career home run helping San Francisco Giants beat Pittsburgh Pirates 12\u20130. **Nolan Ryan pitches his second no hitter of the season (and second of seven for his career.

It is career home run #700 for Aaron, only the second player to reach that milestone. Babe Ruth, with 714, is the other. *July 24 \u2013 The National League wins the All-Star Game at Kansas City, 7\u20131. A record 54 players are used, including Willie Mays, who strikes out in his final All-Star appearance, and Catfish Hunter, who sustains a fractured thumb that will sideline him for four weeks.

By 1 vote. *July 30 \u2013 At Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum, Jim Bibby of the Texas Rangers no-hits the Oakland Athletics 6\u20130. The no-hitter is the first in the history of the Washington Senators/Texas Rangers franchise. ===August=== *August 1 \u2013 With the score tied at 2\u20132 in the top of the ninth at Fenway Park, in an incident that typifies both the Yankees \u2013 Red Sox rivalry and the feud between the two catchers involved, Thurman Munson of the New York Yankees barrels into Carlton Fisk of the Boston Red Sox while trying to score on Gene Michael's missed squeeze attempt. The incident triggers a 10-minute bench- clearing brawl in which both catchers are ejected. The Red Sox win 3\u20132 in the bottom of the ninth, with Mario Guerrero's two-out single scoring Bob Montgomery (who had replaced the ejected Fisk) for the winning run. *August 5 \u2013 Atlanta Braves knuckleballer Phil Niekro no-hits the San Diego Padres 9\u20130. He walks three and strikes out four in recording the first no-hitter by the franchise in Atlanta. *August 6 \u2013 An exhibition game between the Milwaukee Brewers and the Atlanta Braves held at Milwaukee draws 33,337. The Brewers win, 7\u20135, in the fourth and last exhibition between the two teams. But the big thrill is provided by Hank Aaron, who hits a home run. *August 7 \u2013 Two days after Phil Niekro's no-hitter, the Braves purchase Joe Niekro, Phil's pitching brother, from the Detroit Tigers. *August 11 \u2013 Chicago White Sox rookie Brian Downing cracks his first major league hit, a home run off Detroit's Mickey Lolich. Downing's debut dinger is a first in the majors since at least 1945 \u2013 an inside-the-park homer. It'll be matched in two years by the Giants Johnnie LeMaster, who will do it in his first at bat. *August 15 \u2013 In Pittsburgh, Cincinnati Reds ace Jack Billingham beats the host Pittsburgh Pirates 1\u20130, notching his seventh shutout of the season. This ties the club record set by Hod Eller back in 1919. *August 17 \u2013 The New York Mets' Willie Mays hits the 660th (and last) home run of his career off Don Gullett of Cincinnati, but the Reds win 2\u20131 in 10 innings at Shea Stadium, after pinch hitter Hal King bats a walk-off home run, his third pinch homer of the year. *August 21 \u2013 Against the Cleveland Indians at Cleveland Stadium, Stan Bahnsen of the Chicago White Sox has a no-hitter broken up with two out in the ninth on a single by ex-teammate Walt Williams. The hit is the only one Bahnsen allows as the White Sox defeat the Indians 4-0. ===September=== *September 3 \u2013 After 11 years at the helm (944\u2013806 .539), Ralph Houk resigns as the New York Yankees' manager. The 'Major' will manage the Detroit Tigers next season. *September 3 \u2013 The San Francisco Giants overcome a 7 \u2013 1 deficit to beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 11 \u2013 8 at Candlestick Park during a nationally televised Monday Night baseball game on NBC. Bobby Bonds hit a walk-off grand slam into the right field seats to win the game for the Giants. *September 6 \u2013 Brothers Felipe Alou and Matty Alou are released by the New York Yankees. Felipe is sold to the Montreal Expos and Matty goes to the St. Louis Cardinals. *September 7 \u2013 Whitey Herzog is fired by the Texas Rangers with the club in the American League West cellar at 47-91. Del Wilber serves as interim manager for one game before owner Bob Short names Billy Martin, fired by the Tigers earlier in the season, as Herzog's permanent replacement. *September 19 \u2013 The Pittsburgh Pirates lose the first game of a crucial three game series at Shea for first place 7\u20133 to the New York Mets when Cleon Jones has just the second two home run performance of his career (the first time was on April 6, in the season opener against the Philadelphia Phillies). *September 20 \u2013 At Shea Stadium, in the top of the thirteenth inning, with Richie Zisk on first, the Pittsburgh Pirates' Dave Augustine belts what appears to be a home run over the left field wall. New York Mets left fielder Cleon Jones turns to play the ball off the wall and the ball hits the top of the wall and goes right into Jones' glove on the fly. He turns and throws to relay man Wayne Garrett, who throws home to catcher Ron Hodges to nail Zisk at the plate. Following the \"Ball on the Wall\" play, the Mets win the game in the bottom half of the inning to move within half a game of the first place Pirates. *September 27 \u2013 Capping a memorable season, Nolan Ryan strikes out 16 Minnesota Twins en route to a 5\u20134, 11-inning win for the California Angels. Rich Reese is Ryan's final strikeout, his 383rd of the season, which breaks Sandy Koufax's season record. *September 30 \u2013 The New York Yankees play their final game in the original Yankee Stadium, losing to the Detroit Tigers 5\u20132. Yankee Stadium remains closed until 1976 while undergoing major renovations. ===October\u2013December=== *October 1 \u2013 Two make-up games were played after the scheduled end of the regular season on September 30: the Mets won at the Cubs 6\u20134 and the Pirates lost at home to the Padres 3\u20134; making a potential second game between the Cubs and Mets unnecessary. *October 8 \u2013 In Game 3 of the National League Championship Series, the New York Mets' Rusty Staub homers in the first and second innings as the Mets crush the Cincinnati Reds 9\u20132 at New York's Shea Stadium, in a game featuring a bench-clearing brawl involving future Phillies teammates Pete Rose and Bud Harrelson. *October 10 \u2013 Like , no one thought the Mets would win the National League pennant, but they amazingly did as New York's Tom Seaver hurls the Mets into the World Series with a 7\u20132 victory over the Reds in Game 5 of the 1973 National League Championship Series. New York has 13 hits in the contest. *October 13 \u2013 The Oakland Athletics score two unearned runs in the third inning of game one of the 1973 World Series when the usually sure handed F\u00e9lix Mill\u00e1n allows a ground ball to go through his legs. They are the only runs New York Mets starter Jon Matlack allows, but they are enough to give Oakland the 2\u20131 game one victory. *October 14 \u2013 In one of the more bizarre games in World Series history, the Mets defeat the Athletics 10-7 in 12 innings in Game 2 by scoring four runs in the 12th, three of which were the result of two errors by Oakland second baseman Mike Andrews. After the game, Athletics owner Charlie O. Finley forced Andrews to sign a false affidavit stating he was disabled, which would have rendered him ineligible for the remainder of the series. A's manager Dick Williams rallied to Andrews' defense and commissioner Bowie Kuhn nullified the affidavit. Nevertheless, Finley ordered Williams to bench Andrews for the remainder of the series. Williams, in defiance, sent Andrews to the plate as a pinch hitter in Game 4 in New York three nights later as the Mets' home crowd gave a standing ovation. *October 21 \u2013 Bert Campaneris and Reggie Jackson hit two-run home runs in the third inning as the Oakland Athletics defeated the New York Mets, 5\u20132, in Game Seven of the World Series, for their second straight World Championship. Jackson is selected the Series MVP. *October 23 \u2013 Athletics owner Charlie Finley reveals that he will not release manager Dick Williams from his contract unless he receives adequate compensation from the team that signs him. Williams had resigned following the World Series victory two days earlier. *November 27 \u2013 San Francisco Giants left fielder Gary Matthews, who hit .300 with 12 home runs and 58 RBI in 145 games, outpolls eight others receiving 11 of 24 nominations for the National League Rookie of the Year Award. The runners-up are Steve Rogers (P), Bob Boone (C), Dan Driessen (3B), El\u00edas Sosa (P), Ron Cey (3B), Johnny Grubb (CF), Davey Lopes (2B) and Richie Zisk (RF). ==Movies== *Bang the Drum Slowly ==Births== ===January=== *January 2 \u2013 Mike Metcalfe *January 3 \u2013 Da Rond Stovall *January 5 \u2013 Fred Rath Jr. *January 5 \u2013 Ram\u00f3n Tat\u00eds *January 8 \u2013 Mike Cameron *January 9 \u2013 Aaron Holbert *January 10 \u2013 Gary Rath *January 14 \u2013 Troy Brohawn *January 14 \u2013 Rod Myers *January 15 \u2013 Chris Cumberland *January 15 \u2013 Wayne Gomes *January 19 \u2013 Chris Stynes *January 20 \u2013 Julio Santana *January 23 \u2013 Nelson Paulino *January 24 \u2013 Mike Glavine *January 25 \u2013 Terrell Wade *January 28 \u2013 Jacob Cruz *January 29 \u2013 Brian Edmondson *January 29 \u2013 Jason Schmidt *January 30 \u2013 Bob Henley ===February=== *February 3 \u2013 Ryan Long *February 4 \u2013 Chris Coste *February 8 \u2013 Keith McDonald *February 14 \u2013 Daniel Garibay *February 18 \u2013 Shawn Estes *February 22 \u2013 Rick Heiserman *February 22 \u2013 Russ Johnson *February 23 \u2013 Jason Boyd *February 24 \u2013 Stubby Clapp ===March=== *March 4 \u2013 Brian Barber *March 4 \u2013 Rick Eckstein *March 5 \u2013 Felipe Crespo *March 5 \u2013 Ryan Franklin *March 6 \u2013 Terry Adams *March 6 \u2013 Roberto Dur\u00e1n *March 8 \u2013 Mark Lukasiewicz *March 8 \u2013 Justin Thompson *March 9 \u2013 Aaron Boone *March 9 \u2013 C.
