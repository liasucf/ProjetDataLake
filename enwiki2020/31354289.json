    "text": "exterior of the main headquarters of the FBI Cleveland division The FBI Cleveland field office (also called the Cleveland division) is a branch of the Federal Bureau of Investigation located in the city of Cleveland. Some of the most notable events in the history of this field office is the founding of InfraGard, an information network in the United States. The current Special Agent in Charge of the Cleveland division is Stephen D Anthony. ==Cleveland Office History== The field office is currently one of 56 such sites in major metropolitan locations within the United States. The \"Cleveland FBI\" is the main HQ of the other nine satellite offices or \"resident agencies\" scattered throughout the 40 counties that the CLE FBI covers, which include Ashland, Cuyahoga, Erie, Geauga, Lake, Lorain, Lucas, Mahoning, Medina, Stark, and Summit among others. These subdivision agencies are in Akron, Canton, Elyria, Lima, Mansfield, Painesville, Sandusky, Toledo, and Youngstown. They are charged with maintaining law and order for over 5.5 million people http://cleveland.fbi.gov/division_map.htm. As Cleveland was a major city in the 1910s, the growing organization of secret police established a local bureau office by 1914, predating start of the World War I and capturing anti- war socialists: Charles Ruthenberg, Amos Hitchcock, and Eugene Debs. In 1924, J. Edgar Hoover closed the Cleveland office, opting to merge it with the Detroit Division. However, by 1935, the office having been too far afield to protect both Cleveland, at the time the 6th largest city in the US with over 900,000 residents and Detroit, then the 4th largest city in the country with over 1.6 million, was reopened and has remained open ever since https://www.archives.gov/research/census/1940 . In 1936, FBI Cleveland played a major role in the elimination of the Barker-Karpis gang by arresting Harry Campbell, who had ties to Karpis. This was a high crime era for the country, the preceeding year the body of suspected underworld doctor Joseph Moran was discovered in Lake Erie, he was most likely killed by Fred Barker and Alvin Karpis. Karpis alleged upon capture that Moran was buried. Also in 1936, Karpis was arrested in New Orleans with Fred Hunter. The following year, Cleveland also caught Alfred Brady, Clarence Lee Schaffer, and James Dahlover who were involved in a string of robberies http://cleveland.fbi.gov/history.htm. Then in 1956, Cleveland became an important FBI location as it sits on the border of the country in the Cold War when the office captured and charged communists leaders under the Smith Act, an anti-subversion law. During the height of the Second \"Red Scare\" in America or McCarthyism, many would be fifth column suspects were rounded up by the FBI. Joseph Brandt, Martin Chauncey, Frank Hashmall, Anthony Krchmarek, Israel Kwatt, and Lucille Bethencourt were found guilty, following the work of the Cleveland FBI. In the early 1980s, Cleveland enacted the FBI backed Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act or RICO Act high-level Ohio Operation Busmark that ultimately led to the arrest of gangsters, mobsters, and racketeers which included Angelo Lonardo, the then acting head of the Cleveland crime family, Joseph N. Gallo, tied to the Gambino crime family, Frederick Graewe, and Kevin MacTaggart. In 2002, Cleveland did extensive work to bring about the conviction of major Ohio racketeer politician Congressman James Traficant who was ultimately sentenced for 10 felonies including \"taking bribes, filing false tax returns, racketeering, and forcing his aides to perform chores at his farm in Ohio and on his houseboat in Washington\" http://edition.cnn.com/2002/LAW/04/11/traficant.trial/. ==See also== * Federal Bureau of Investigation * FBI Atlanta Field Office * FBI Buffalo Field Office * List of FBI field offices ==References== ==External links== * Official Website Category:Buildings and structures in Cleveland Category:Office buildings in Ohio Cleveland ",
