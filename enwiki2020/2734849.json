    "text": "Skolt Sami ( , \"the S\u00e1mi language\", or , \"the Eastern S\u00e1mi language\", if a distinction needs to be made between it and the other Sami languages) is a Uralic, Sami language that is spoken by the Skolts, with approximately 300 speakers in Finland, mainly in Sevettij\u00e4rvi and approximately 20\u201330 speakers of the Nju\u00f5\u02b9ttj\u00e4u\u02b9rr (Notozero) dialect in an area surrounding Lake Lovozero in Russia. Skolt Sami also used to be spoken in the Neiden area of Norway. It is written using a modified Roman orthography which was made official in 1973. The term Skolt was coined by representatives of the majority culture and has negative connotation which can be compared to the term Lapp. Nevertheless, it is used in cultural and linguistic studies. thumbnail|300px|Sami dialects and settlements in Russia: ==History== Neiden, Norway On Finnish territory Skolt Sami was spoken in four villages before the Second World War. In Petsamo, Skolt Sami was spoken in Suonikyl\u00e4 and the village of Petsamo. This area was ceded to Russia in the Second World War, and the Skolts were evacuated to the villages of Inari, Sevettij\u00e4rvi and Nellim in the Inari municipality. On the Russian (then Soviet) side the dialect was spoken in the now defunct Sami settlements of Motovsky, Songelsky, Notozero (hence its Russian name \u2013 the Notozersky dialect). Some speakers still may live in the villages of Tuloma and Lovozero. On Norwegian territory Skolt Sami was spoken in the S\u00f8r-Varanger area with a cultural centre in Neiden. The language is not spoken as mother tongue any more in Norway. ==Status== A quadrilingual street sign in Inari in (from top to bottom) Finnish, Northern Saami, Inari Saami, and Skolt Saami. Inari is the only municipality in Finland with 4 official languages. The village workshop in Sevettij\u00e4rvi ===Finland=== In Finland, Skolt Sami is spoken by approximately 400 people. According to Finland's Sami Language Act (1086/2003), Skolt Sami is one of the three Sami languages that the Sami can use when conducting official business in Lapland. It is an official language in the municipality of Inari, and elementary schools there offer courses in the language, both for native speakers and for students learning it as a foreign language. Only a small number of youths learn the language and continue to use it actively. Skolt Sami is thus a seriously endangered language, even more seriously than Inari Sami, which has a nearly equal number of speakers and is even spoken in the same municipality. In addition, there are a lot of Skolts living outside of this area, particularly in the capital region. ==Use== ===Media=== From 1978 to 1986, the Skolts had a quarterly called S\u00e4\u00e4\u02b9mo\u0111\u0111\u00e2z published in their own language. Since 2013, a new magazine called Tu\u00f5ddri pee\u02b9rel has been published once a year. The Finnish news program Yle O\u0111\u0111asat featured a Skolt Sami speaking newsreader for the first time on August 26, 2016. Otherwise Yle O\u0111\u0111asat presents individual news stories in Skolt Sami every now and then. In addition, there have been various TV programs in Skolt S\u00e1mi on YLE such as the children's TV series Binnab\u00e1nna\u0161. ===Religion=== The first book published in Skolt Sami was an Eastern Orthodox prayer book (, Prayerbook for the Orthodox) in 1983. Translation of the Gospel of John was published () in 1988 and Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom (, Liturgy of our Holy Father John Chrysostom) was published in 2002 Skolt Sami is used together with Finnish in worship of the Lappi Orthodox Parish () at churches of Ivalo, Sevettij\u00e4rvi and Nellim. ===Music=== Like Inari Sami, Skolt Sami has recently borne witness to a new phenomenon, namely it is being used in rock songs sung by Tiina Sanila-Aikio, who has published two full-length CDs in Skolt Sami to date. ===Education=== In 1993, language nest programs for children younger than 7 were created. For quite some time these programs received intermittent funding, resulting in some children being taught Skolt Sami, while others were not. In spite of all the issues these programs faced, they were crucial in creating the youngest generations of Skolt Sami speakers. In recent years, these programs have been reinstated. In addition, 2005 was the first time that it was possible to use Skolt Sami in a Finnish matriculation exam, albeit as a foreign language. In 2012, Ville-Riiko Fofonoff () was the first person to use Skolt Sami for the mother tongue portion of the exam; for this, he won the Skolt of the Year Award the same year. ==Writing system== Skolt Sami uses the ISO basic Latin alphabet with the addition of some special characters: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" ! Letter ! Phoneme(s) |- | A a | |- | \u00c2 \u00e2 | |- | B b | |- | C c | |- | \u010c \u010d | |- | \u01b7 \u0292 | |- | \u01ee \u01ef | |- | D d | |- | \u0110 \u0111 | |- | E e | , |- | F f | |- | G g | |- | \u01e6 \u01e7 | |- | \u01e4 \u01e5 | |- | H h | |- | I i | , |- | J j | |- | K k | |- | \u01e8 \u01e9 | |- | L l | |- | M m | |- | N n | |- | \u014a \u014b | |- | O o | |- | \u00d5 \u00f5 | |- | P p | |- | R r | |- | S s | |- | \u0160 \u0161 | |- | T t | |- | U u | , |- | V v | |- | Z z | |- | \u017d \u017e | |- | \u00c5 \u00e5 | |- | \u00c4 \u00e4 | |} Notes: * The letters Q/q, W/w, X/x, Y/y and \u00d6/\u00f6 are also used, although only in foreign words or loans. * No difference is made in the standard orthography between and . In dictionaries, grammars and other reference works, the letter is used to indicate . * The combinations and indicate the consonants and respectively. Additional marks are used in writing Skolt Sami words: * A prime symbol \u02b9 (U+02B9 MODIFIER LETTER PRIME) or standalone acute accent \u00b4 or \u02ca (U+00B4 ACUTE ACCENT or U+02CA MODIFIER LETTER ACUTE ACCENT) is added after the vowel of a syllable to indicate suprasegmental palatalization. * An apostrophe \u02bc (U+02BC MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE) is used in the combinations and to indicate that these are two separate sounds, not a single sound. It is also placed between identical consonants to indicate that they belong to separate prosodic feet, and should not be combined into a geminate. It distinguishes e.g. lue\u02b9\u0161tted \"to set free\" from its causative lue\u02b9\u0161t\u02bcted \"to cause to set free\". * A hyphen \u2013 is used in compound words when there are two identical consonants at the juncture between the parts of the compound, e.g. \u01e9i\u00f5tt-tel \"mobile phone\". * A vertical line \u02c8 (U+02C8 MODIFIER LETTER VERTICAL LINE), typewriter apostrophe or other similar mark indicates that a geminate consonant is long, and the preceding diphthong is short. It is placed between a pair of identical consonants which are always preceded by a diphthong. This mark is not used in normal Skolt Sami writing, but it appears in dictionaries, grammars and other reference works. ==Phonology== Special features of this Sami language include a highly complex vowel system and a suprasegmental contrast of palatalized vs. non-palatalized stress groups; palatalized stress groups are indicated by a \"softener mark\", represented by the modifier letter prime (\u02b9). ===Vowels=== The system of vowel phonemes is as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" ! ! front ! central ! back |- align=\"center\" ! close | | | |- align=\"center\" ! close-mid | | | |- align=\"center\" ! open-mid | | | |- align=\"center\" ! open | | | |} Skolt Sami has vowel length, but it co-occurs with contrasts in length of the following consonant(s). Before a long consonant, vowels are short, while before a short consonant vowels are long (written with a doubled letter). For example, le\u02b9tt \u2018vessel\u2019 vs. lee\u02b9tt \u2018vessels\u2019. The vowels can combine to form twelve opening diphthongs: {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" | ! front ! front to central ! back to front ! back to central ! back |- align=\"center\" ! close to close-mid | | | | | |- align=\"center\" ! close to open-mid | | | | | |- align=\"center\" ! close to open | | | | | |- align=\"center\" ! close-mid to open-mid | | | | | |- align=\"center\" ! close-mid to open | | | | | |} Like the monophtongs, all diphthongs can be short or long, but this is not indicated in spelling. Short diphthongs are distinguished from long ones by both length and stress placement: short diphthongs have a stressed second component, whereas long diphthongs have stress on the first component. Diphthongs may also have two variants depending on whether they occur in a plain or palatalized environment. This has a clearer effect with diphthongs whose second element is back or central. Certain inflectional forms, including the addition of the palatalizing suprasegmental, also trigger a change in diphthong quality. {| class=\"wikitable\" !plain !palatalized |- |i\u00f5 |i\u00f5\u02b9 |- |i\u00e2 |ie\u02b9 |- |e\u00e2 |rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"center\"| e\u00e4\u02b9 |- |e\u00e4 |- |u\u00f5 |u\u00f5\u02b9 |- |u\u00e5 |rowspan=\"2\" valign=\"center\"| ue\u02b9 |- |u\u00e2 |- |u\u00e4 |u\u00e4\u02b9 |} ===Consonants=== The inventory of consonant phonemes is the following: {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" ! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"| ! rowspan=\"2\"| Labial ! colspan=\"2\"| Dental / Alveolar ! Postalveolar ! rowspan=\"2\"| Palatal ! rowspan=\"2\"| Velar |- ! ! ! |- align=\"center\" ! colspan=\"2\"| Nasal | | | | | | |- align=\"center\" ! rowspan=\"2\"| Plosive / affricate ! | | | | | | |- align=\"center\" ! | | | | | | |- align=\"center\" ! rowspan=\"2\"| Fricative ! | | | | | | |- align=\"center\" ! | | | | | | |- align=\"center\" ! colspan=\"2\"| Trill | | | | | | |- align=\"center\" ! rowspan=\"2\"| Approximant ! | | | | | | |- align=\"center\" ! | | | | | | |} * Unvoiced stops and affricates are pronounced preaspirated after vowels and sonorant consonants. * Voiced stops and affricates are usually pronounced just weakly voiced. * Older speakers realize the palatal affricates as plosives . * In initial position, is realized as glottal . Consonants may be phonemically short or long (geminate) both word-medially or word-finally; both are exceedingly common. Long and short consonants also contrast in consonant clusters, cf. ku\u00f5skk\u00e2d 'to touch' : ku\u00f5sk\u00e2m 'I touch'. A short period of voicelessness or h, known as preaspiration, before geminate consonants is observed, much as in Icelandic, but this is not marked orthographically, e.g. jo\u02b9\u01e9\u01e9e 'to the river' is pronounced . ===Suprasegmentals=== There is one phonemic suprasegmental, the palatalizing suprasegmental that affects the pronunciation of an entire syllable. In written language the palatalizing suprasegmental is indicated with a free-standing acute accent between a stressed vowel and the following consonant, as follows: :: v\u00e4\u00e4\u02b9rr 'mountain, hill' (suprasegmental palatalization present) :: cf. v\u00e4\u00e4rr 'trip' (no suprasegmental palatalization) The suprasegmental palatalization has three distinct phonetic effects: * The stressed vowel is pronounced as slightly more fronted in palatalized syllables than in non-palatalized ones. * When the palatalizing suprasegmental is present, the following consonant or consonant cluster is pronounced as weakly palatalized. Suprasegmental palatalization is independent of segmental palatals: inherently palatal consonants (i.e. consonants with palatal place of articulation) such as the palatal glide /j/, the palatal nasal /\u0272/ (spelled ) and the palatal lateral approximant /\u028e/ (spelled ) can occur both in non-palatalized and suprasegmentally palatalized syllables. * If the word form is monosyllabic and ends in a consonant, a non- phonemic weakly voiced or unvoiced vowel is pronounced after the final consonant. This vowel is e-colored if suprasegmental palatalization is present, but a-colored if not. ===Stress=== Skolt Sami has four different types of stress for words: * Primary stress * Secondary stress * Tertiary stress * Zero stress The first syllable of any word is always the primary stressed syllable in Skolt Sami as Skolt is a fixed-stress language. In words with two or more syllables, the final syllable is quite lightly stressed (tertiary stress) and the remaining syllable, if any, are stressed more heavily than the final syllable, but less than the first syllable (secondary stress). Using the abessive and the comitative singular in a word appears to disrupt this system, however, in words of more than one syllable. The suffix, as can be expected, has tertiary stress, but the penultimate syllable also has tertiary stress, even though it would be expected to have secondary stress. Zero stress can be said to be a feature of conjunctions, postpositions, particles and monosyllabic pronouns. ==Grammar== Skolt Sami is a synthetic, highly inflected language that shares many grammatical features with the other Uralic languages. However, Skolt Sami is not a typical agglutinative language like many of the other Uralic languages are, as it has developed considerably into the direction of a fusional language, much like Estonian. Therefore, cases and other grammatical features are also marked by modifications to the root and not just marked with suffixes. Many of the suffixes in Skolt Sami are portmanteau morphemes that express several grammatical features at a time. ===Umlaut=== Umlaut is a pervasive phenomenon in Skolt Sami, whereby the vowel in the second syllable affects the quality of the vowel in the first. The presence or absence of palatalisation can also be considered an umlaut effect, since it is also conditioned by the second-syllable vowel, although it affects the entire syllable rather than the vowel alone. Umlaut is complicated by the fact that many of the second-syllable vowels have disappeared in Skolt Sami, leaving the umlaut effects as their only trace. The following table lists the Skolt Sami outcomes of the Proto-Samic first-syllable vowel, for each second- syllable vowel. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" ! Proto ! *\u0101, *\u014d ! *\u0113 ! *\u00eb, *u ! *i |- ! Skolt ! a ! e ! \u00e2, u ! e |- ! *\u00eb | \u00e2 || \u00e2\u02b9 || \u00f5 || \u00f5\u02b9 |- ! *o | \u00e5 || \u00e5\u02b9 || o || o\u02b9 |- ! *i | e || e\u02b9 || i || i\u02b9 |- ! *u | o || u\u02b9 || u || u\u02b9 |- ! *\u0101 | \u00e4 || \u00e4\u02b9 || a || a\u02b9 |- ! *ea | e\u00e4 || e\u00e4\u02b9, i\u1eb9\u02b9 || i\u00e2 || ie\u02b9 |- ! *ie | e\u00e2 || ie\u02b9 || i\u00f5 || i\u00f5\u02b9 |- ! *oa | u\u00e4 || u\u00e4\u02b9, u\u1eb9\u02b9 || u\u00e5 || ue\u02b9 |- ! *uo | u\u00e2 || ue\u02b9 || u\u00f5 || u\u00f5\u02b9 |} Some notes: * i\u1eb9\u02b9 and u\u1eb9\u02b9 appear before a quantity 2 consonant, e\u00e4\u02b9 and u\u00e4\u02b9 otherwise. As can be seen, palatalisation is present before original second-syllable *\u0113 and *i, and absent otherwise. Where they survive in Skolt Sami, both appear as e, so only the umlaut effect can distinguish them. The original short vowels *\u00eb, *u and *i have a general raising and backing effect on the preceding vowel, while the effect of original *\u0101 and *\u014d is lowering. Original *\u0113 is fronting (palatalising) without having an effect on height. ===Nouns=== ====Cases==== Skolt Sami has 9 cases in the singular (7 of which also have a plural form), although the genitive and accusative are often the same. The following table shows the inflection of \u010du\u00e4cc ('rotten snag') with the single morphemes marking noun stem, number, and case separated by hyphens for better readability. The last morpheme marks for case, i marks the plural, and a is due to epenthesis and does not have a meaning of its own. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! !Singular !Plural |- !Nominative |\u010du\u00e4cc |\u010du\u00e4\u0292\u0292 |- !Genitive | \u010du\u00e4\u0292\u0292 || \u010du\u00e4\u0292\u0292-a-i |- !Accusative | \u010du\u00e4\u0292\u0292 || \u010du\u00e4\u0292\u0292-a-i-d |- !Illative | cu\u00e5c'c-u || \u010du\u00e4\u0292\u0292-a-i-d |- !Locative | \u010du\u00e4\u0292\u0292-a-st || \u010du\u00e4\u0292\u0292-a-i-n |- !Comitative | \u010du\u00e4\u0292\u0292-a-in || \u010du\u00e4\u0292\u0292-a-i-vui\u00b4m |- !Abessive | \u010du\u00e4\u0292\u0292-t\u00e4\u00e4 || \u010du\u00e4\u0292\u0292-a-i-t\u00e4\u00e4 |- !Essive | \u010du\u00e4cc-a-n || \u2013 |- !Partitive | \u010du\u00e4cc- a-d || \u2013 |} =====Nominative===== Like the other Uralic languages, the nominative singular is unmarked and indicates the subject or a predicate. The nominative plural is also unmarked and always looks the same as the genitive singular. =====Genitive===== The genitive singular is unmarked and looks the same as the nominative plural. The genitive plural is marked by an -i. The genitive is used: * to indicate possession (Tu\u02b9st lij muu \u01e9e\u02b9rjj. 'You have my book.') * to indicate number, if said the number is between 2 and 6. (Sie\u02b9zzest lij ku\u00f5\u02b9htt p\u00f5\u00f5rt. 'My father's sister (my aunt) has two houses.') * with prepositions (r\u00e4\u00e4i + [GEN]: 'by something', 'beyond something') * with most postpositions. (Sij m\u00f5\u02b9nne \u00e4\u00e4kk\u00e4d \u00e5rra. 'They went to your grandmother's (house).', 'They went to visit your grandmother.') The genitive has been replacing the partitive for some time and is nowadays more commonly used in its place. =====Accusative===== The accusative is the direct object case and it is unmarked in the singular. In the plural, its marker is -d, which is preceded by the plural marker -i, making it look the same as the plural illative. The accusative is also used to mark some adjuncts, e.g. obb t\u00e4\u00e4\u02b9lv ('the entire winter'). =====Locative===== The locative marker in the singular is -st and -n in the plural. This case is used to indicate: * where something is (Ku\u00e4\u02b9\u0111est lij \u01e9e\u02b9rjj: 'There is a book in the kota.') * where it is coming from (Ni\u00f5\u0111 pu\u00f5\u02b9tte domoi \u010ce\u02b9vetj\u00e4\u00e4u\u02b9rest: 'The girls came home from Sevettij\u00e4rvi.') * who has possession of something (Su\u02b9st lij \u010d\u00e2ust\u00f5k: 'He/she has a lasso.') In addition, it is used with certain verbs: * to ask someone s.t. : k\u00f5\u00f5\u010d\u010d\u00e2d [+loc] =====Illative===== The illative marker actually has three different markers in the singular to represent the same case: -a, -e and -u. The plural illative marker is -d, which is preceded by the plural marker -i, making it look the same as the plural accusative. This case is used to indicate: * where something is going * who is receiving something * the indirect object =====Comitative===== The comitative marker in the singular is -in and -vui\u02b9m in the plural. The comitative is used to state with whom or what something was done: * Nj\u00e4\u00e4\u02b9lm sekstet leei\u02b9nin. The mouth is wiped with a piece of cloth. * Vu\u00f5\u02b9l\u01e7\u01e7em paa\u02b9rnivui\u02b9m ceerkvest. I left church with the children. * Vu\u00f5\u02b9l\u01e7\u01e7em vue\u02b9bbinan ceerkvest. I left church with my sister. To form the comitative singular, use the genitive singular form of the word as the root and -in. To form the comitative plural, use the plural genitive root and -vui\u02b9m. =====Abessive===== The abessive marker is -t\u00e4\u00e4 in both the singular and the plural. It always has a tertiary stress. * Vu\u00f5\u02b9l\u01e7\u01e7em paa\u02b9rnit\u00e4\u00e4 ceerkvest. I left church without the children. * Sij m\u00f5\u02b9nne ni\u00f5\u0111t\u00e4\u00e4 p\u00f5\u02b9rtte. They went in the house without the girl. * Sij m\u00f5\u02b9nne ni\u00f5\u0111it\u00e4\u00e4 p\u00f5\u02b9rtte. They went in the house without the girls. =====Essive===== The dual form of the essive is still used with pronouns, but not with nouns and does not appear at all in the plural. =====Partitive===== The partitive is only used in the singular and can always be replaced by the genitive. The partitive marker is -d. 1\\. It appears after numbers larger than six: * k\u00e4\u00e4u\u02b9c \u010d\u00e2ust\u00f5kk\u00e2d: 'eight lassos' This can be replaced with k\u00e4\u00e4\u02b9uc \u010d\u00e2ust\u00f5\u00f5\u01e5\u01e5. 2\\. It is also used with certain postpositions: * ku\u00e4\u02b9tte'd vu\u00e2stta: 'against a kota' This can be replaced with ku\u00e4\u02b9\u0111 vu\u00e2stta' 3\\. It can be used with the comparative to express that which is being compared: * k\u00e5\u02b9lled pue\u02b9rab: 'better than gold' This would nowadays more than likely be replaced by pue\u02b9rab ko k\u00e5\u02b9ll ==== Pronouns ==== ===== Personal pronouns ===== The personal pronouns have three numbers: singular, plural and dual. The following table contains personal pronouns in the nominative and genitive/accusative cases. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! !English !nominative !English !genitive |- !First person (singular) | I || mon || my || muu |- !Second person (singular) | you (thou) || ton || your, yours || tuu |- !Third person (singular) | he, she || son || his, her || suu |- !First person (dual) | we (two) || mu\u00e4na || our || mu\u00e4nnai |- !Second person (dual) | you (two) || tu\u00e4na || your || tu\u00e4nnai |- !Third person (dual) | they (two) || su\u00e4na || theirs || su\u00e4nnai |- !First person (plural) | we || mij || our || mij |- !Second person (plural) | you || tij || your || tij |- !Third person (plural) | they || sij || their || sij |} The next table demonstrates the declension of a personal pronoun he/she (no gender distinction) in various cases: {| class=\"wikitable\" ! !Singular !Dual !Plural |- !Nominative | son || su\u00e4na || sij |- !Genitive | suu || su\u00e4nnai || sij |- !Accusative | suu || su\u00e4nnaid || si\u02b9jjid |- !Illative | su\u02b9nne || su\u00e4nnaid || si\u02b9jjid |- !Locative | su\u02b9st || su\u00e4nnast || sii\u02b9st |- !Comitative | suin || su\u00e4nnain || si\u02b9jjivui\u02b9m |- !Abessive | suut\u00e4\u00e4 || su\u00e4nnait\u00e4\u00e4 || si\u02b9jjit\u00e4\u00e4 |- !Essive | suu\u02b9nen || su\u00e4nnan || \u2013 |- !Partitive | suu\u02b9\u0111ed || \u2013 || \u2013 |} ==== Possessive markers ==== Next to number and case, Skolt Sami nouns also inflect for possession. However, usage of possessive affixes seems to decrease among speakers.

A full inflection table of all person-marked forms of the verb kuull\u00e2d ('to hear') is given below. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ ! !Non-past !Past !Potential !Conditional !Imperative |- !1st Person Singular |kuulam |ku\u02b9llem |kuul\u017eem |kuul\u010dem | - |- !2nd P.

Changes to the stem are based on verbs being categorized into several inflectional classes. The different inflectional suffixes are based on the categories listed below. ====Person==== Skolt Sami verbs conjugate for four grammatical persons: * first person * second person * third person * fourth person, also called the indefinite person ====Mood==== Skolt Sami has 5 grammatical moods: * indicative * imperative (Pue\u02b9tted s\u00f5rgg domoi! 'Come home soon!') * conditional * potential * optative ====Number==== Skolt Sami verbs conjugate for two grammatical numbers: * singular * plural Unlike other Sami varieties, Skolt Sami verbs do not inflect for dual number. Instead, verbs occurring with the dual personal pronouns appear in the corresponding plural form. ====Tense==== Skolt Sami has 2 simple tenses: * past (Pu\u00f5\u02b9ttem \u0161koou\u02b9le j\u00e5htta. 'I came to school yesterday.') * non-past (Evvan pu\u00e4tt mu \u00e5rra t\u00e4\u02b9bbe. 'John is coming to my house today.') and 2 compound tenses: * perfect * pluperfect ==== Non-finite verb forms ==== The verb forms given above are person-marked, also referred to as finite. In addition to the finite forms, Skolt Sami verbs have twelve participial and converb forms, as well as the infinitive, which are non-finite. These forms are given in the table below for the verb kuull\u00e2d ('to hear'). {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ ! !Verb form |- !Infinitive |kuull\u00e2d |- !Action Participle |kuull\u00e2m |- !Present Participle |kuulli |- !Past Participle |kuull\u00e2m |- !Passive Participle |kullum |- !Progressive Participle |kuullmen |- !Temporal Participle |kuuleen |- !Instrumental Participle |kullee\u02b9l |- !Abessive Participle |kuulkani |- !Negative converb |kuul, kullu, kuul\u017ee, kuul\u010de (all forms exist, they underlie idiolectal variation) |} ==== Auxiliary verbs ==== Skolt Sami has two auxiliary verbs, one of which is lee\u00b4d (glossed as 'to be'), the other one is the negative auxiliary verb (see the following paragraph). Inflection of lee\u00b4d is given below. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ ! !Non-past !Past !Potential !Conditional !Imperative |- !1st Person Singular |le\u00e4m |le\u00b4jjem |le\u02b9\u017e\u017eem |le\u02b9\u010d\u010dem |\u2013 |- !2nd P.

Pl. |lie, li\u00e2 (both forms exist, they underlie idiolectal variation) |le\u02b9jje |le\u02b9\u017e\u017ee |le\u02b9\u010d\u010de |le\u00e4k'kaz |- !4th Person |le\u00e4t |le\u02b9jje\u0161 |le\u02b9\u017e\u017eet |le\u02b9\u010d\u010de\u0161 |\u2013 |} Lee'd is used, for example, to assign tense to lexical verbs in the conditional or potential mood which are not marked for tense themselves: * Ji\u00f5m \u00e2\u02b9te mon ni k\u00f5\u00f5jj\u010de, jos mon te\u00e2\u0111\u010dem, le\u02b9\u010d\u010dem ve\u00e4r raajj\u00e2m oudd\u00e2l. (negation (1st P. Sg.) \u2013 then \u2013 1st P. Sg. \u2013 even \u2013 ask (negated conditional) \u2013 if \u2013 1st P. Sg. \u2013 know (1st P. Sg. conditional) \u2013 be (1st P. Sg. conditional) \u2013 soup \u2013 make (past participle, no tense marking) \u2013 before) 'I wouldn't even ask if I knew, if I had made soup before!' =====Negative verb===== Skolt Sami, like Finnish, the other Sami languages and Estonian, has a negative verb. In Skolt Sami, the negative verb conjugates according to mood (indicative, imperative and optative), person (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th) and number (singular and plural). {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" ! colspan=\"2\" | Person ! Indicative ! Imperative ! Optative |- ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"30\" | 1 ! Singular | ji\u00f5m || \u2013 || \u2013 |- ! Plural | je\u00e4\u02b9p || \u2013 || je\u00e4l\u02c8lap |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | 2 ! Singular | ji\u00f5k | colspan=\"2\" | je\u00e4\u02b9l |- !

Unlike the other Sami languages, Skolt Sami no longer has separate forms for the dual and plural of the negative verb and uses the plural forms for both instead. === Word order === ==== Declarative clauses ==== The most frequent word order in simple, declarative sentences in Skolt Sami is subject\u2013verb\u2013object (SVO). However, as cases are used to mark relations between different noun phrases, and verb forms mark person and number of the subject, Skolt Sami word order allows for some variation. An example of an SOV sentence would be: * Neezzan su\u00e2jjk\u00e5\u00e5utid ku\u00e5rru. (woman (Pl., Nominative) \u2013 protection (Sg., Nominative) + skirt (Pl., Accusative) \u2013 sew (3rd P. Pl., Past)) 'The women sewed protective skirts.' Intransitive sentences follow the order subject-verb (SV): * J\u00e4\u00e4u\u02b9r k\u00e2\u02b9lmme. (lake (Pl., Nominative) \u2013 freeze (3rd P. Pl., Present)) 'The lakes freeze.' An exception to the SOV word order can be found in sentences with an auxiliary verb. While in other languages, an OV word order has been found to correlate with the auxiliary verb coming after the lexical verb, the Skolt Sami auxiliary verb lee'd ('to be') precedes the lexical verb. This has been related to the verb- second (V2) phenomenon which binds the finite verb to at most the second position of the respective clause. However, in Skolt Sami, this effect seems to be restricted to clauses with an auxiliary verb. An example of a sentence with the auxiliary in V2 position: * Kuusk\u00f5\u00f5zz le\u02b9jje \u00e4\u00e4ld poorr\u00e2m. (northern light (Pl., Nominative) \u2013 be (3rd P. Pl., Past) \u2013 female reindeer (Sg., Accusative) \u2013 eat (Past Participle)) 'The northern lights had eaten the female reindeer.' ==== Interrogative clauses ==== ===== Polar questions ===== In Skolt Sami, polar questions, also referred to as yes-no questions, are marked in two different ways. Morphologically, an interrogative particle, -a, is added as an affix to the first word of the clause. Syntactically, the element which is in the scope of the question is moved to the beginning of the clause. If this element is the verb, subject and verb are inversed in comparison to the declarative SOV word order. * Vue\u02b9l\u01e7\u01e7ve\u02b9ted\u2013a tu\u00e4na muu ooud\u00e2st e\u010d\u010dan \u00e4\u00e4u\u02b9d ool? (leave (2nd P. Pl., Present, Interrogative) \u2013 2nd P. Dual Nominative \u2013 1st P. Sg. Genitive \u2013 behalf \u2013 father (Sg. Genitive 1st P. Pl.) \u2013 grave (Sg. Genitive) \u2013 onto) 'Will the two of you go, on my behalf, to our father's grave?' If an auxiliary verb is used, this is the one which is moved to the initial sentence position and also takes the interrogative affix. * Le\u00e4k\u2013a \u00e4\u00e4\u02b9v\u00e4\u00e4m t\u00f5n uus? (be (2nd P. Sg., Present, Interrogative) \u2013 open (Past Participle) \u2013 that (Sg. Accusative) \u2013 door (Sg. Accusative)) 'Have you opened that door?' * Le\u00e4k\u2013a ton Jefremoff? (be (2nd P. Sg., Interrogative) \u2013 2nd P. Sg. Nominative \u2013 Jefremoff) 'Are you Mr. Jefremoff?' A negated polar question, using the negative auxiliary verb, shows the same structure: * Ij\u2013a k\u00f5skklum\u00e2s villjad pu\u00e4ttam? (Negation 3rd P. Sg., Interrogative \u2013 middle \u2013 brother (Sg. Nominative, 2nd P. Sg.) \u2013 come (Past Participle)) 'Didn't your middle brother come?' An example of the interrogative particle being added to something other than the verb, would be the following: * V\u00f5l\u2013a lie mainn\u00e2z? (still (Interrogative) \u2013 be (3rd P. Sg., Present) \u2013 story (Pl., Nominative)) 'Are there still stories to tell?' ===== Information questions ===== Information questions in Skolt Sami are formed with a question word in clause-initial position. There also is a gap in the sentence indicating the missing piece of information. This kind of structure is similar to Wh-movement in languages such as English. There are mainly three question words corresponding to the English 'what', 'who', and 'which' (out of two). They inflect for number and case, except for the latter which only has singular forms. It is noteworthy that the illative form of mii ('what') corresponds to the English 'why'. The full inflectional paradigm of all three question words can be found below. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ ! colspan=\"2\" | !What !Who !Which |- ! rowspan=\"9\" |Singular !Nominative |mii |\u01e9ii |ku\u00e4bba\u017e |- !Accusative |m\u00e2i\u02b9d |\u01e9e\u00e4n |ku\u00e4bba |- !Genitive |m\u00f5\u00f5n |\u01e9e\u00e4n |ku\u00e4bba |- !Illative |m\u00f5\u00f5zz ('why') |\u01e9e\u00e4zz |ku\u00e4bb\u017ee |- !Locative |m\u00e2\u02b9st |\u01e9e\u00e4\u02b9st |ku\u00e4bbast |- !Comitative |m\u00f5in |\u01e9e\u00e4in |ku\u00e4bbain |- !Abessive |m\u00f5nt\u00e4\u00e4 |\u01e9e\u00e4nt\u00e4\u00e4 |ku\u00e4bbat\u00e4\u00e4 |- !Essive |m\u00e2\u00e2\u02b9den |\u01e9e\u00e4\u02b9\u0111en |ku\u00e4bb\u017een |- !Partitive |m\u00e2\u00e2\u02b9\u0111ed |\u01e9e\u00e4\u02b9\u0111ed |ku\u00e4bb\u017eed |- ! rowspan=\"7\" |Plural !Nominative |m\u00f5\u00f5k |\u01e9e\u00e4k | - |- !Accusative |m\u00e2id |\u01e9e\u00e4id | - |- !Genitive |m\u00e2\u00e2i |\u01e9e\u00e4i | - |- !Illative |m\u00e2id |\u01e9e\u00e4id | - |- !Locative |m\u00e2in |\u01e9e\u00e4in | - |- !Comitative |m\u00e2\u00e2ivui\u02b9m |\u01e9e\u00e4ivui\u02b9m | - |- !Abessive |m\u00e2\u00e2it\u00e4\u00e4 |\u01e9e\u00e4it\u00e4\u00e4 | - |} Some examples of information questions using one of the three question words: * M\u00e2i\u02b9d re\u00e4\u01e5\u01e5ak? (what (Sg., Accusative) \u2013 cry (2nd P. Sg., Present)) 'What are you crying about?' * M\u00f5\u00f5zz pue\u02b9tti\u01e9? (what (Sg., Illative) \u2013 come (2nd P. Sg., Past)) 'Why did you come?' * \u01e8ii tu\u02b9st le\u00e4i risttje\u00e4\u02b9nn? (who (Sg., Nominative) \u2013 2nd P. Sg., Locative \u2013 be (3rd P. Sg., Past) \u2013 godmother (Sg., Nominative) 'Who was your godmother?' * Ku\u00e4bba\u017e alttad heibbad? (which (Sg., Nominative) \u2013 begin (3rd P. Sg., Present) \u2013 wrestle (Infinitive)) 'Which one of you will begin to wrestle?' In addition to the above-mentioned, there are other question words which are not inflected, such as the following: * ko\u02b9st: 'where', 'from where' * koozz: 'to where' * ku\u00e4\u02b9ss: 'when' * m\u00e4\u02b9htt: 'how' * m\u00e5kam: 'what kind' An example sentence would be the following: * Koozz vu\u00f5\u02b9l\u01e7\u01e7i\u01e9? (to where \u2013 leave (2nd P. Sg., Past)) 'Where did you go?' ==== Imperative clauses ==== The Skolt Sami imperative generally takes a clause- initial position. Out of the five imperative forms (see above), those of the second person are most commonly used. * Pu\u00e4\u02b9\u0111 mij \u00e5rra ku\u00e2ssa! (come (2nd P. Sg., Imperative) \u2013 1st P. Pl., Genitive \u2013 way \u2013 on a visit) 'Come and visit us at our place!' Imperatives in the first person form, which only exist as plurals, are typically used for hortative constructions, that is for encouraging the listener (not) to do something. These imperatives include both the speaker and the listener. * \u00c4\u02b9l\u01e7\u01e7ep heibbad! (start (1st P. Pl., Imperative) \u2013 wrestle (Infinitive)) 'Let's start to wrestle!' Finally, imperatives in the third person are used in jussive constructions, the mood used for orders and commands. * Ku\u00e4r\u014b\u014baz sij tie\u02b9rm ool! (climb (3rd P. Pl., Imperative) \u2013 3rd P. Pl., Nominative \u2013 hill (Sg., Genitive) \u2013 onto) 'Let them climb to the top of the hill!' ==References== == Bibliography == * Feist, Timothy.
