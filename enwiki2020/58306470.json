They flourished in marine environments during the Paleocene, ranging from 58.7\u201355.8 million years ago. Cucullaea gigantea average about 8\u201314 cm in length, about twice the size of its relative Cucullaea recendens which average 5\u20138 cm. Cucullaea were infaunal suspension feeders, meaning they burrowed into the seafloor and strained their food from the water.
