He is best known as the former drummer of Death in Vegas and the current drummer of British band Squeeze. ==Early life== Hanson's father and sister both died in a plane crash in 1983. == Career == In 1985, Hanson formed the band Shot, which was signed by IRS records. However nothing was ever released. Simon Hanson was then spotted by a member of the band The Blessing and joined them on tours. Together they signed with MCA Records and recorded Locusts and Wild Honey. Jimmy Miller was called in to produce three tracks on the album. Miller was hugely influential on Hanson\u2019s work as Miller had been himself a drummer. Miller taught him that being creative, is not always being in control. Unfortunately Miller died before the album\u2019s release, in 1994. In the early 1990s, Hanson worked with Tina Hamilton at Session Connection, playing drums with Ace of Base, Natalia Imbruglia, Hall and Oates and the P.F. Project amongst others. By the mid-nineties he started touring with Energy Orchard and worked on the Pain Killer album released in 1995. Hanson recorded with artist Bap Kennedy on MCA label. In 1995 he toured with Energy Orchard replacing drummer Dave Toner, as they were the support band of The Animals\u2019 tour in Germany. From 1996 to 1998 he toured with Tony Hadley and recorded with Bruce Woolley and the Radio Science Orchestra. Hanson joined The Aloof in 1997 and discovered the emerging world of Dance music. As the drummer of The Aloof he recorded the Seeking Pleasure album released in 1998 signed by East West Records. At that time the Radio Science Orchestra wrote, co-produced and performed the title track \"Storm\", performed by Grace Jones for the 1998 film The Avengers. Death in Vegas 2000 By 1998 Hanson joined Death in Vegas and recorded the album Contino Sessions, released in 1999, before touring with the band in the UK and in the US. Hanson also played the drums on the album Scorpio Rising. Hanson that had been so far influenced by rock and roll in previous years, discovered dance and house music while touring with Death in Vegas. This experience with dance music was to influence his playing style which evolved to become a combination of rock and roll and dance music. In the late nineties Simon Hanson performed live on tours with hard rock and rock and roll bands The Quireboys and The Dogs D'Amour. In 1996 he worked with The Dogs D\u2019Amour frontman Tyla and Spike Gray from the Quireboys with whom he recorded the album Flagrantly Yours, under the name Spike and Tyla's Hot Knives. In 1999 Hanson was called in to play the drums on Rick Wakeman\u2019s concept album Return to the Centre of the Earth, a sequel to the previous Journey to the Centre of the Earth (1974). From 1999, Hanson recorded with Death in Vegas. He participated on the Contino Rooms and Scorpio Rising albums including collaborations with Iggy Pop and Liam Gallagher. He also toured with the band in France, the U.K. and the U.S.A. In May 2000 Hanson appeared as the drummer in a fictional version of Slade for the movie Married 2 Malcom starring Mark Addy, Josie Lawrence and Hywel Bennett. Squeeze Cornbury 2013 Between 2000 and 2006 Hanson lent his talent as a drummer to various bands amongst which included The Men They Couldn't Hang, Baxter Dury, Joy Zipper, The Boy Least Likely To and Secret Affair.

Together they recorded Squeeze's first album in twelve years, Spot the Difference, consisting entirely of new recordings of older Squeeze songs. It was a huge honour for Simon Hanson to become a member of Squeeze as he had been a long term fan of Squeeze and friend of Glenn Tilbrook. Since 2010 Tilbrook and Hanson have been touring together. In 2010, while on a tour in Colchester, Tilbrook asked Hanson to sing a Kevin and Dave, a song that they had co-written together. Whilst on the road Simon decided to write his own songs, often writing and recording on the back of the tour bus, using an iPad that which given to him. His first solo album Songs from the Silver Box was released spring 2013. One of the track\u2019s titles is \"A9 South Road\" and was written between Aberdeen and Glasgow.
