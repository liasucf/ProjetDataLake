Blei, Andrew Y. Ng, Michael I. Jordan. Latent Dirichlet allocation. The Journal of Machine Learning Research, Volume 3, 3/1/2003Michael I. Jordan, ed. Learning in Graphical Models. Proceedings of the NATO Advanced Study Institute, Ettore Maiorana Centre, Erice, Italy, September 27-October 7, 1996 He is one of the leading figures in machine learning, and in 2016 Science reported him as the world's most influential computer scientist. == Biography == Jordan received his BS magna cum laude in Psychology in 1978 from the Louisiana State University, his MS in Mathematics in 1980 from Arizona State University and his PhD in Cognitive Science in 1985 from the University of California, San Diego.Vitae MICHAEL I. JORDAN Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Department of Statistics, University of California. Accessed September 3, 2013 At the University of California, San Diego, Jordan was a student of David Rumelhart and a member of the PDP Group in the 1980s. Jordan is currently a full professor at the University of California, Berkeley where his appointment is split across the Department of Statistics and the Department of EECS. He was a professor at the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT from 1988 to 1998. == Work == In the 1980s Jordan started developing recurrent neural networks as a cognitive model. In recent years, his work is less driven from a cognitive perspective and more from the background of traditional statistics. Jordan popularised Bayesian networks in the machine learning community and is known for pointing out links between machine learning and statistics. He was also prominent in the formalisation of variational methods for approximate inference and the popularisation of the expectation-maximization algorithm in machine learning. ===Resignation from Machine Learning=== In 2001, Jordan and others resigned from the editorial board of the journal Machine Learning. In a public letter, they argued for less restrictive access and pledged support for a new open access journal, the Journal of Machine Learning Research, which was created by Leslie Kaelbling to support the evolution of the field of machine learning.Editorial Board of the Kluwer Journal, Machine Learning: Resignation Letter (2001) ==Honors and awards== Jordan has received numerous awards, including a best student paper award (with X. Nguyen and M. Wainwright) at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2004), a best paper award (with R. Jacobs) at the American Control Conference (ACC 1991), the ACM - AAAI Allen Newell Award, the IEEE Neural Networks Pioneer Award, and an NSF Presidential Young Investigator Award. In 2010 he was named a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery \"for contributions to the theory and application of machine learning.\" Jordan is a member of the National Academy of Science, a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has been named a Neyman Lecturer and a Medallion Lecturer by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics. He received the David E. Rumelhart Prize in 2015 and the ACM/AAAI Allen Newell Award in 2009. He also won 2020 IEEE John von Neumann Medal. In 2016, Jordan was identified as the \"most influential computer scientist\", based on an analysis of the published literature by the Semantic Scholar project. ==References== ==External links== *Homepage (at University of California, Berkeley) *Published papers (chronological) Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Artificial intelligence researchers Category:Machine learning researchers Category:University of California, San Diego alumni Category:Fellows of the American Statistical Association Category:Fellows of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence Category:UC Berkeley College of Engineering faculty Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Engineering Category:Rumelhart Prize laureates Category:Fellows of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Category:Fellows of the Cognitive Science Society ",
