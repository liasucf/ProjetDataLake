Released on October 16, 2001,https://www.amazon.com/Less-Hood-Blaze- Dead-Homie/dp/B00005Y7DU the album is his second release on the Psychopathic label, following his self-titled debut EP. 1 Less G n Da Hood was produced by Twiztid, Mike Puwal, Fritz \"the Cat\" Van Kosky, and Violent J, and features appearances by guests Anybody Killa, Monoxide Child, Violent J, Jamie Madrox, and Shaggy 2 Dope. == Reception == Allrovi wrote, \"Combining the seriousness of a violent life in the ghetto with the juvenile antics of the Insane Clown Posse doesn't quite sound like a formula for success, but Detroit rapper and ICP affiliate Blaze somehow made it work\". == Reissue == In 2006, the album was reissued under the title 1 Less G in the Hood: Deluxe G Edition. The reissue contained material from Blaze's self-titled EP, the 2001 album, and three additional bonus tracks. The reissue also deleted the introduction \"The Eulogy\", which was replaced by the Blaze Ya Dead Homie EP intro, and the songs \"Str8 Outta Detroit\", \"Here I Am\" and \"Hatchet Execution\", which remain unavailable due to the fact that the original version of 1 Less G N Da Hood is out of print and these tracks did not appear on any other albums. 1 Less G In The Hood: Deluxe G Edition peaked at #19 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart, #25 on the Top Independent Albums chart, and #86 on the Top R&B;/Hip- Hop Albums chart. ==Legacy== The album is widely considered a \"Juggalo Classic\" as it was a big hit for Blaze with it being dubbed \"Blaze's own \"'The Great Milenko'\". In early June 2017 it was announced that Blaze Ya Dead Homie would be performing 1 Less G N Da Hood in its entirety at Attack Of The Ninjas 2017 Afterparty. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Blaze Ya Dead Homie \u2013 Vocals *Anybody Killa \u2013 Performer *Jamie Madrox \u2013 Vocals *Monoxide \u2013 Performer *Sabrina \u2013 Vocals *Shaggy 2 Dope \u2013 Cut *Jami Spittler \u2013 Graphic Design, Concept *Twiztid \u2013 Producer *Violent J \u2013 Vocals, Producer *Eric \"EWolf\" Wheeler \u2013 Photography *Chyna Dawl- voicemail vocals ==Charts== ===Deluxe G Edition=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"center\"|Chart (2006) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |Top Heatseekers |align=\"center\"|19 |- |Top Independent Albums |align=\"center\"|25 |- |Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums |align=\"center\"|86 |} == References == Category:2001 debut albums Category:Blaze Ya Dead Homie albums Category:Psychopathic Records albums Category:Albums produced by Joseph Bruce Category:Albums produced by Mike Puwal Category:Albums produced by Jamie Spaniolo Category:Albums produced by Paul Methric ",
