These include six systems (shad-dar\u015bana) \u2013 Sankhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mimamsa and Vedanta.Andrew Nicholson (2013), Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History, Columbia University Press, , pages 2-5 In Indian tradition, the word used for philosophy is Darshana. This word comes from the Sanskrit root drish (to see, to experience).Meaning of word Darshana These are also called the Astika (theistic) philosophical traditions and are those that accept the Vedas as an authoritative, important source of knowledge. Ancient and medieval India was also the source of philosophies that share philosophical concepts but rejected the Vedas, and these have been called n\u0101stika (heterodox or non-orthodox) Indian philosophies. N\u0101stika Indian philosophies include Buddhism, Jainism, C\u0101rv\u0101ka, \u0100j\u012bvika, and others.P Bilimoria (2000), Indian Philosophy (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, , page 88 Western scholars have debated the relationship and differences within \u0101stika philosophies and with n\u0101stika philosophies, starting with the writings of Indologists and Orientalists of the 18th and 19th centuries, which were themselves derived from limited availability of Indian literature and medieval doxographies. The various sibling traditions included in Hindu philosophies are diverse, and they are united by shared history and concepts, same textual resources, similar ontological and soteriological focus, and cosmology.Carl Olson (2007), The Many Colors of Hinduism: A Thematic-historical Introduction, Rutgers University Press, , pages 101-119 While Buddhism and Jainism are considered distinct philosophies and religions, some heterodox traditions such as C\u0101rv\u0101ka are often considered as distinct schools within Hindu philosophy.R Thomas (2014), Hindu Perspectives on Evolution: Darwin, Dharma, and Design.

Potter (1961), A Fresh Classification of India's Philosophical Systems, The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 21, No. 1, pages 25-32 ==Classifications== In the history of Hinduism, the six orthodox schools had emerged before the start of the Common Era, and some schools emerged possibly even before the Buddha Students' Britannica India (2000), Volume 4, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, , page 316 Some scholars have questioned whether the orthodox and heterodox schools classification is sufficient or accurate, given the diversity and evolution of views within each major school of Hindu philosophy, with some sub-schools combining heterodox and orthodox views. Since ancient times Indian philosophy has been categorized into \u0101stika and n\u0101stika schools of thought. The orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy have been called \u1e63a\u1e0ddar\u015bana (\"six systems\"). This schema was created between the 12th and 16th centuries by Vedantins. It was then adopted by the early Western Indologists, and pervades modern understandings of Hindu philosophy. ===\u0100stika=== There are six \u0101stika (orthodox) schools of thought. Each is called a dar\u015bana, and each dar\u015bana accepts the Vedas as authority. Each astika darsana also accepts the premise that Atman (soul, eternal self) exists.Klaus Klostermaier (2007), Hinduism: A Beginner's Guide, , Chapter 2, page 26John Plott, James Dolin and Russell Hatton (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 60-62 The schools of philosophy are: # Samkhya - An atheistic and strongly dualist theoretical exposition of consciousness and matter. # Yoga - A school which emerged from Sankhya and emphasises on practical use of Sankhya theory. This schools focuses on meditation, contemplation and liberation. # Ny\u0101ya or logic - The school of epistemology which explores sources of knowledge. # Vai\u015be\u1e63ika - An empiricist school of atomism. # M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 - An anti-ascetic and anti-mysticist school of orthopraxy. This school deals with the correct interpretation of the verses in Vedas. # Ved\u0101nta - The last segment of knowledge in the Vedas, or j\u00f1\u0101nak\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da (section of knowledge). Vedanta is also referred as Uttara-Mimamsa. Ved\u0101nta came to be the dominant current of Hinduism in the post-medieval period. ===N\u0101stika=== Schools that do not accept the authority of the Vedas are n\u0101stika philosophies, of which four (heterodox) schools are prominent: # C\u0101rv\u0101ka, a materialism school that accepted the existence of free will. # \u0100j\u012bvika, a materialism school that denied the existence of free will.James Lochtefeld, \"Ajivika\", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A\u2013M, Rosen Publishing. , page 22AL Basham (2009), History and Doctrines of the Ajivikas - a Vanished Indian Religion, Motilal Banarsidass, , Chapter 1 # Buddhism, a philosophy that denies existence of \u0101tman (soul, self)Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, , page 64; Quote: \"Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anatt\u0101, Sanskrit: an\u0101tman, the opposed doctrine of \u0101tman is central to Brahmanical thought). Put very briefly, this is the [Buddhist] doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence.\"; John C. Plott et al (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 63, Quote: \"The Buddhist schools reject any \u0100tman concept.

It has been a key, much debated field of study in Hinduism since ancient times. Pram\u0101\u1e47a is a hindu theory of knowledge and discusses the valid means by which human beings can gain accurate knowledge. The focus of pram\u0101\u1e47a is how correct knowledge can be acquired, how one knows, how one doesn't, and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired. Ancient and medieval Hindu texts identify six pram\u0101\u1e47as as correct means of accurate knowledge and truths: # Pratyak\u1e63a - Direct perception # Anum\u0101\u1e47a - Inference or indirect perception # Upam\u0101\u1e47a - Comparison and analogy # Arth\u0101patti - Postulation, derivation from circumstances # Anupalabdi - Non-perception, absence of proof # Shabda - Word, testimony of past or present reliable experts Each of these are further categorized in terms of conditionality, completeness, confidence and possibility of error, by the different schools. The schools vary on how many of these six are valid paths of knowledge. For example, the C\u0101rv\u0101ka n\u0101stika philosophy holds that only one (perception) is an epistemically reliable means of knowledge, the Samkhya school holds that three are (perception, inference and testimony), while the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 and Advaita schools hold that all six are epistemically useful and reliable means to knowledge. ==S\u0101mkhya== Samkhya is the oldest of the orthodox philosophical systems in Hinduism, with origins in the 1st millennium BCE.Sharma, C. (1997). A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, , p.149 It is a rationalist school of Indian philosophy, and had a strong influence on other schools of Indian philosophies.Roy Perrett, Indian Ethics: Classical traditions and contemporary challenges, Volume 1 (Editor: P Bilimoria et al), Ashgate, , pages 149-158 S\u0101mkhya is an enumerationist philosophy whose epistemology accepted three of six pram\u0101\u1e47as as the only reliable means of gaining knowledge. These were pratyak\u1e63a (perception), anum\u0101\u1e47a (inference) and sabda (\u0100ptavacana, word/testimony of reliable sources).Eliott Deutsche (2000), in Philosophy of Religion : Indian Philosophy Vol 4 (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, , pages 245-248 Samkhya school espouses dualism between consciousness and matter. It regards the universe as consisting of two realities: Puru\u1e63a (consciousness) and prakriti (matter). Jiva (a living being) is that state in which puru\u1e63a is bonded to prakriti in some form. This fusion, state the Samkhya scholars, led to the emergence of buddhi (awareness, intellect) and ahankara (individualized ego consciousness, \u201cI-maker\u201d). The universe is described by this school as one created by Purusa-Prakriti entities infused with various permutations and combinations of variously enumerated elements, senses, feelings, activity and mind.Samkhya - Hinduism Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2014) Samkhya philosophy includes a theory of gunas (qualities, innate tendencies, psyche).Gerald James Larson (2011), Classical S\u0101\u1e43khya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 154-206 Guna, it states, are of three types: Sattva being good, compassionate, illuminating, positive, and constructive; Rajas guna is one of activity, chaotic, passion, impulsive, potentially good or bad; and Tamas being the quality of darkness, ignorance, destructive, lethargic, negative. Everything, all life forms and human beings, state Samkhya scholars, have these three gunas, but in different proportions.James G. Lochtefeld, Guna, in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Vol. 1, Rosen Publishing, , page 265 The interplay of these gunas defines the character of someone or something, of nature and determines the progress of life.T Bernard (1999), Hindu Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 74\u201376Haney, William S., Culture and Consciousness: Literature Regained, Bucknell University Press (1 August 2002). P. 42. . Samkhya theorises a pluralism of souls (Jeevatmas) who possess consciousness. Samkhya has historically been theistic or non-theistic, and there has been debate about its specific view on God.

Plott et al (1984), Global History of Philosophy: The period of scholasticism, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 367Andrew J. Nicholson (2013), Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History, Columbia University Press, , Chapter 4, pg. 77 The Samkhya karika, one of the key texts of this school of Hindu philosophy, opens by stating its goal to be \"threeadhyatmika, adhibhautika and adhidaivika - that is, suffering caused internally by self, cause by other human beings, caused by acts of nature kinds of human suffering\" and means to prevent them.Samkhya karika by Iswara Krishna, Henry Colebrooke (Translator), Oxford University Press The text then presents a distillation of its theories on epistemology, metaphysics, axiology and soteriology. For example, it states, The soteriology in Samkhya aims at the realization of Puru\u1e63a as distinct from Prakriti; this knowledge of the Self is held to end transmigration and lead to absolute freedom (kaivalya).Larson, Gerald James. Classical S\u0101\u1e43khya: An Interpretation of Its History and Meaning. Motilal Banarasidass, 1998. P. 13. . ==Yoga== In Indian philosophy, Yoga is, among other things, the name of one of the six \u0101stika philosophical schools.For a brief overview of the Yoga school of philosophy see: . The Yoga philosophical system aligns closely with the dualist premises of the Samkhya school.Edwin Bryant (2011, Rutgers University), The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali IEP The Yoga school accepts Samkhya psychology and metaphysics, but is considered theistic because it accepts the concept of personal god (Ishvara), unlike Samkhya.M\u00fcller (1899), Chapter 7, \"Yoga Philosophy\", p. 104. Bollingen Series XXVI; Edited by Joseph Campbell, page 280 The epistemology of the Yoga school, like the S\u0101mkhya school, relies on three of six pr\u0101ma\u1e47as as the means of gaining reliable knowledge: pratyak\u1e63a (perception), anum\u0101\u1e47a (inference) and \u015babda (\u0101ptavacana, word/testimony of reliable sources). The universe is conceptualized as a duality in Yoga school: puru\u1e63a (consciousness) and prak\u1e5bti (matter); however, the Yoga school discusses this concept more generically as \"seer, experiencer\" and \"seen, experienced\" than the Samkhya school.Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, , pages x-xi, 101-107, 142 and Introduction chapter A key text of the Yoga school is the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. Patanjali may have been, as Max M\u00fcller explains, \"the author or representative of the Yoga- philosophy without being necessarily the author of the Sutras.\"Max M\u00fceller, The six systems of Indian philosophy, Longmans, page 410 Hindu philosophy recognizes many types of Yoga, such as r\u0101ja yoga, j\u00f1\u0101na yoga,The Encyclopedia of Yoga and Tantra by Georg Feuerstein karma yoga, bhakti yoga, tantra yoga, mantra yoga, laya yoga, and hatha yoga.The Encyclopedia of Yoga and Tantra, Georg Feuerstein The Yoga school builds on the Samkhya school theory that j\u00f1\u0101na (knowledge) is a sufficient means to moksha. It suggests that systematic techniques/practice (personal experimentation) combined with Samkhya's approach to knowledge is the path to moksha. Yoga shares several central ideas with Advaita Vedanta, with the difference that Yoga is a form of experimental mysticism while Advaita Vedanta is a form of monistic personalism.Personalism Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (2013)Northrop Frye (2006), Educated Imagination and Other Writings on Critical Theory, 1933-1962, University of Toronto Press, , page 291 Like Advaita Vedanta, the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy holds that liberation/freedom in this life is achievable, and that this occurs when an individual fully understands and realizes the equivalence of Atman (soul, self) and Brahman.Mike McNamee and William J. Morgan (2015), Routledge Handbook of the Philosophy, Routledge, , pages 135-136, Quote: \"As a dualistic philosophy largely congruent with Samkhya's metaphysics, Yoga seeks liberation through the realization that Atman equals Brahman; it involves a cosmogonic dualism: purusha an absolute consciousness, and prakriti original and primeval matter.\"Mike Burley (2012), Classical Samkhya and Yoga - An Indian Metaphysics of Experience, Routledge, , pages 141-142 ==Vai\u015be\u1e63ika== The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika philosophy is a naturalist school. It is a form of atomism in natural philosophy.Analytical philosophy in early modern India J Ganeri, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy It postulates that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to param\u0101\u1e47u (atoms), and that one's experiences are derived from the interplay of substance (a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements), quality, activity, commonness, particularity and inherence. Knowledge and liberation are achievable by complete understanding of the world of experience, according to Vai\u015be\u1e63ika school. The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika dar\u015bana is credited to Ka\u1e47\u0101da Ka\u015byapa from the second half of the first millennium BCE.Oliver Leaman, Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy. Routledge, , 1999, page 269.Michael Brannigan (2009), Striking a Balance: A Primer in Traditional Asian Values, Rowman & Littlefield, , page 7 The foundational text, the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika S\u016btra, opens as follows: The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika school is related to the Ny\u0101ya school but features differences in its epistemology, metaphysics and ontology.DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology (Editor: Anthony Marsella), Springer, , pages 172-175 The epistemology of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika school, like Buddhism, accepted only two means to knowledge as reliable \u2013 perception and inference. The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika school and Buddhism both consider their respective scriptures as indisputable and valid means to knowledge, the difference being that the scriptures held to be a valid and reliable source by Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas were the Vedas. Vai\u015be\u1e63ika metaphysical premises are founded on a form of atomism, that reality is composed of four substances (earth, water, air, and fire). Each of these four are of two types: atomic (param\u0101\u1e47u) and composite. An atom is, according to Vai\u015be\u1e63ika scholars, that which is indestructible (anitya), indivisible, and has a special kind of dimension, called \u201csmall\u201d (a\u1e47u). A composite, in this philosophy, is defined to be anything which is divisible into atoms. Whatever human beings perceive is composite, while atoms are invisible. The Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas stated that size, form, truths and everything that human beings experience as a whole is a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements, their gu\u1e47a (quality), karma (activity), s\u0101m\u0101nya (commonness), vi\u015be\u1e63a (particularity) and amav\u0101ya (inherence, inseparable connectedness of everything).M Hiriyanna (1993), Outlines of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 228-237 ==Ny\u0101ya== The Ny\u0101ya school is a realist \u0101stika philosophy.Nyaya: Indian Philosophy Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2014) The school's most significant contributions to Indian philosophy were its systematic development of the theory of logic, methodology, and its treatises on epistemology.B Gupta (2012), An Introduction to Indian Philosophy: Perspectives on Reality, Knowledge and Freedom, Routledge, , pages 171-189PT Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought: Toward a Constructive Postmodern Ethics, State University of New York Press, , page 223 The foundational text of the Ny\u0101ya school is the Ny\u0101ya S\u016btras of the first millennium BCE. The text is credited to Aksapada Gautama and its composition is variously dated between the sixth and second centuries BCE.B. K. Matilal \"Perception. An Essay on Classical Indian Theories of Knowledge\" (Oxford University Press, 1986), p. xiv. Ny\u0101ya epistemology accepts four out of six pr\u0101ma\u1e47as as reliable means of gaining knowledge \u2013 pratyak\u1e63a (perception), anum\u0101\u1e47a (inference), upam\u0101\u1e47a (comparison and analogy) and \u015babda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts).DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology (Editor: Anthony Marsella), Springer, , page 172 In its metaphysics, the Ny\u0101ya school is closer to the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika school than the others. It holds that human suffering results from mistakes/defects produced by activity under wrong knowledge (notions and ignorance).Vassilis Vitsaxis (2009), Thought and Faith, Somerset Hall Press, , page 131 Moksha (liberation), it states, is gained through right knowledge. This premise led Ny\u0101ya to concern itself with epistemology, that is, the reliable means to gain correct knowledge and to remove wrong notions. False knowledge is not merely ignorance to Naiyayikas; it includes delusion. Correct knowledge is discovering and overcoming one's delusions, and understanding the true nature of the soul, self and reality.BK Matilal (1997), Logic, Language and Reality: Indian Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 353-357 The Ny\u0101ya S\u016btras begin: ==M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101== The M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 school emphasized hermeneutics and exegesis.Mimamsa Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2014) It is a form of philosophical realism.M.

Hiriyanna (1993), Outlines of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 298-335 The classical M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 school is sometimes referred to as p\u016brvam\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 or Karmam\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 in reference to the first part of the Vedas.Chris Bartley (2013), Purva Mimamsa, in Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy (Editor: Oliver Leaman), Routledge, 978-0415862530, page 443-445 The M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 school has several sub-schools defined by epistemology. The Pr\u0101bh\u0101kara subschool of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 accepted five means to gaining knowledge as epistimetically reliable: pratyak\u1e63a (perception), anum\u0101\u1e47a (inference), upam\u0101\u1e47a (comparison and analogy), arth\u0101patti (postulation, derivation from circumstances), and \u015babda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts). The Kum\u0101rila Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da sub-school of M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 added a sixth way of knowing to its canon of reliable epistemology: anupalabdi (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof). The metaphysics of the M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 school consists of both atheistic and theistic doctrines, and the school showed little interest in systematic examination of the existence of God. Rather, it held that the soul is an eternal, omnipresent, inherently active spiritual essence, then focussed on the epistemology and metaphysics of dharma. To them, dharma meant rituals and duties, not devas (gods), because devas existed only in name. The M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101kas held that the Vedas are \"eternal authorless infallible\", that Vedic vidhi (injunctions) and mantras in rituals are prescriptive karya (actions), and that the rituals are of primary importance and merit. They considered the Upanishads and other texts related to self-knowledge and spirituality to be of secondary importance, a philosophical view that the Vedanta school disagreed with. M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 gave rise to the study of philology and the philosophy of language.Peter M. Scharf, The Denotation of Generic Terms in Ancient Indian Philosophy (1996), Chapter 3 While their deep analysis of language and linguistics influenced other schools,Annette Wilke and Oliver Moebus (2011), Sound and Communication: An Aesthetic Cultural History of Sanskrit Hinduism, Walter de Gruyter GmbH (Berlin), , pages 23-24, 551-663 their views were not shared by others. M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101kas considered the purpose and power of language was to clearly prescribe the proper, correct and right. In contrast, Vedantins extended the scope and value of language as a tool to also describe, develop and derive. M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101kas considered orderly, law-driven, procedural life as the central purpose and noblest necessity of dharma and society, and divine (theistic) sustenance means to that end. The Mimamsa school was influential and foundational to the Vedanta school, with the difference that M\u012bm\u0101\u1e43s\u0101 developed and emphasized karmak\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da (the portion of the \u015bruti which relates to ceremonial acts and sacrificial rites, the early parts of the Vedas), while the Vedanta school developed and emphasized j\u00f1\u0101nak\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da (the portion of the Vedas which relates to knowledge of monism, the latter parts of the Vedas).Oliver Leaman (2006), Shruti, in Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy, Routledge, , page 503 ==Ved\u0101nta== The Ved\u0101nta school built upon the teachings of the Upanishads and Brahma Sutras from the first millennium BCEOliver Leaman (1999), Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy, Routledge, , page xiv and is the most developed and best-known of the Hindu schools. The epistemology of the Vedantins included, depending on the sub-school, five or six methods as proper and reliable means of gaining any form of knowledge:P Bilimoria (1993), Pram\u0101\u1e47a epistemology: Some recent developments, in Asian philosophy - Volume 7 (Editor: G Floistad), Springer, , pages 137-154 pratyak\u1e63a (perception), anum\u0101\u1e47a (inference), upam\u0101\u1e47a (comparison and analogy), arth\u0101patti (postulation, derivation from circumstances), anupalabdi (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) and \u015babda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts). All of these have been further categorized by each sub- school of Vedanta in terms of conditionality, completeness, confidence and possibility of error. The emergence of Vedanta school represented a period when a more knowledge-centered understanding began to emerge. These focussed on jnana (knowledge) driven aspects of the Vedic religion and the Upanishads. This included metaphysical concepts such as \u0101tman and Brahman, and an emphasis on meditation, self-discipline, self-knowledge and abstract spirituality, rather than ritualism. The Upanishads were variously interpreted by ancient- and medieval-era Vedanta scholars. Consequently, the Vedanta separated into many sub-schools, ranging from theistic dualism to non-theistic monism, each interpreting the texts in its own way and producing its own series of sub- commentaries.Knut Jacobsen (2008), Theory and Practice of Yoga : 'Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 77; JN Mohanty (2001), Explorations in Philosophy, Vol 1 (Editor: Bina Gupta), Oxford University Press, page 107-108Oliver Leaman (2000), Eastern Philosophy: Key Readings, Routledge, , page 251; R Prasad (2009), A Historical-developmental Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, Concept Publishing, , pages 345-347 ===Advaita=== Advaita literally means \"not two, sole, unity\". It is a sub-school of Vedanta, and asserts spiritual and universal non-dualism.Advaita Vedanta Sangeetha Menon (2012), IEP Its metaphysics is a form of absolute monism, that is all ultimate reality is interconnected oneness.Eliot Deutsch, Advaita Vedanta: A Philosophical Reconstruction, University of Hawaii Press, , pages 10-14 This is the oldest and most widely acknowledged Vedantic school. The foundational texts of this school are the Brahma Sutras and the early Upanishads from the 1st millennium BCE. Its first great consolidator was the 8th century scholar Adi Shankara, who continued the line of thought of the Upanishadic teachers, and that of his teacher's teacher Gaudapada. He wrote extensive commentaries on the major Vedantic scriptures and is celebrated as one of the major Hindu philosophers from whose doctrines the main currents of modern Indian thought are derived.Adi Shankara, Sengaku Mayeda, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2013) According to this school of Vedanta, all reality is Brahman, and there exists nothing whatsoever which is not Brahman.Richard Brooks (1969), The Meaning of 'Real' in Advaita Ved\u0101nta, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 19, No. 4, pages 385-398 Its metaphysics includes the concept of m\u0101y\u0101 and \u0101tman. M\u0101y\u0101 connotes \"that which exists, but is constantly changing and thus is spiritually unreal\".AC Das (1952), Brahman and M\u0101y\u0101 in Advaita Metaphysics, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 2, No. 2, pages 144-154 The empirical reality is considered as always changing and therefore \"transitory, incomplete, misleading and not what it appears to be\".H.M. Vroom (1996), No Other Gods, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, , page 57Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty (1986), Dreams, Illusion, and Other Realities, University of Chicago Press, , page 119Lynn Foulston and Stuart Abbott (2009), Hindu Goddesses: Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, , pages 14-16 The concept of \u0101tman is of soul within each person, each living being. Advaita Vedantins assert that \u0101tman is same as Brahman, and this Brahman is within each human being and all life, all living beings are spiritually interconnected, and there is oneness in all of existence.John Koller (2007), in Chad Meister and Paul Copan (Editors): The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion, Routledge, , pages 98-106 They hold that dualities and misunderstanding of m\u0101y\u0101 as the spiritual reality that matters is caused by ignorance, and are the cause of sorrow, suffering. J\u012bvanmukti (liberation during life) can be achieved through Self-knowledge, the understanding that \u0101tman within is same as \u0101tman in another person and all of Brahman \u2013 the eternal, unchanging, entirety of cosmic principles and true reality.Michael Comans (1993), The question of the importance of Samadhi in modern and classical Advaita Vedanta, Philosophy East & West. Vol. 43, Issue 1, pages 19-38Arvind Sharma (2007), Advaita Ved\u0101nta: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 19-40, 53-58, 79-86 ===Vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dvaita=== Ramanuja (c. 1037\u20131137) was the foremost proponent of the philosophy of Vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dvaita or qualified non-dualism. Vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dvaita advocated the concept of a Supreme Being with essential qualities or attributes. Vi\u015bi\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dvaitins argued against the Advaitin conception of Brahman as an impersonal empty oneness. They saw Brahman as an eternal oneness, but also as the source of all creation, which was omnipresent and actively involved in existence. To them the sense of subject-object perception was illusory and a sign of ignorance. However, the individual's sense of self was not a complete illusion since it was derived from the universal beingness that is Brahman. Ramanuja saw Vishnu as a personification of Brahman. ===Dvaita=== Dvaita refers to a theistic sub- school in Vedanta tradition of Hindu philosophy.Hindu Philosophy, IEP, Quote: \"Dvaita: Madhva is one of the principal theistic exponents of Ved\u0101nta. On his account, Brahman is a personal God, and specifically He is the Hindu deity Vi\u1e63\u1e47u.\" Also called as Tattvav\u0101da and Bimbapratibimbav\u0101da, the Dvaita sub- school was founded by the 13th-century scholar Madhvacharya. The Dvaita Vedanta school believes that God (Vishnu, supreme soul) and the individual souls (j\u012bv\u0101tman) exist as independent realities, and these are distinct.James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Volume 1 & 2, Rosen Publishing, , pages 12-13, 213-214, 758-759 Dvaita Vedanta is a dualistic interpretation of the Vedas, espouses dualism by theorizing the existence of two separate realities. The first and the only independent reality, states the Dvaita school, is that of Vishnu or Brahman. Vishnu is the supreme Self, in a manner similar to monotheistic God in other major religions.Michael Myers (2000), Brahman: A Comparative Theology, Routledge, , pages 124-127 The distinguishing factor of Dvaita philosophy, as opposed to monistic Advaita Vedanta, is that God takes on a personal role and is seen as a real eternal entity that governs and controls the universe.Christopher Etter (2006), A Study of Qualitative Non-Pluralism, iUniverse, pp. 59-60, . Like Vishishtadvaita Vedanta subschool, Dvaita philosophy also embraced Vaishnavism, with the metaphysical concept of Brahman in the Vedas identified with Vishnu and the one and only Supreme Being. However, unlike Vishishtadvaita which envisions ultimate qualified nondualism, the dualism of Dvaita was permanent. Salvation, in Dvaita, is achievable only through the grace of God Vishnu. ===Dvait\u0101dvaita (Bhedabheda)=== Dvait\u0101dvaita was proposed by Nimbarka, a 13th-century Vaishnava Philosopher from the Andhra region. According to this philosophy there are three categories of existence: Brahman, soul, and matter. Soul and matter are different from Brahman in that they have attributes and capacities different from Brahman. Brahman exists independently, while soul and matter are dependent. Thus soul and matter have an existence that is separate yet dependent. Further, Brahman is a controller, the soul is the enjoyer, and matter the thing enjoyed. Also, the highest object of worship is Krishna and his consort Radha, attended by thousands of gopis; of the Vrindavan; and devotion consists in self-surrender. ===\u015auddh\u0101dvaita=== \u015auddh\u0101dvaita is the \"purely non-dual\" philosophy propounded by Vallabha Acharya (1479\u20131531). The founding philosopher was also the guru of the Vallabh\u0101 samprad\u0101ya (\"tradition of Vallabh\") or Pu\u1e63\u1e6dim\u0101rga, a Vaishnava tradition focused on the worship of Krishna. Vallabhacharya enunciates that Brahman has created the world without connection with any external agency such as M\u0101y\u0101 (which itself is His power) and manifests Himself through the world.Devarshi Ramanath Shastri, \u201cShuddhadvaita Darshan (Vol.2)\u201d, Published by Mota Mandir, Bhoiwada, Mumbai, India, 1917. That is why Shuddhadvaita is known as \u2018Unmodified transformation\u2019 or \u2018Avik\u1e5bta Pari\u1e47\u0101mav\u0101da\u2019. Brahman or Ishvara desired to become many, and he became the multitude of individual souls and the world. The Jagat or Maya is not false or illusionary, the physical material world is. Vallabha recognises Brahman as the whole and the individual as a \u2018part\u2019 (but devoid of bliss) like sparks and fire.\u201cBrahmav\u0101d Sa\u1e45graha\u201d, Pub. Vaishnava Mitra Mandal Sarvajanik Nyasa, Indore, India, 2014. ===Acintya Bheda Abheda=== Chaitanya Mahaprabhu (1486\u20131534), stated that the soul or energy of God is both distinct and non-distinct from God, whom he identified as Krishna, Govinda, and that this, although unthinkable, may be experienced through a process of loving devotion (bhakti). He followed the Dvaita concept of Madhvacharya.Lord Chaitanya (krishna.com) \"This is called acintya-bheda- abheda-tattva, inconceivable, simultaneous oneness and difference.\" This philosophy of \"inconceivable oneness and difference\". ==C\u0101rv\u0101ka== The C\u0101rv\u0101ka school is one of the n\u0101stika or \"heterodox\" philosophies .R Thomas (2014), Hindu Perspectives on Evolution: Darwin, Dharma, and Design, Sociology of Religion, Vol. 75, No. 1, pages 164-165, Quote: \"some of the ancient Hindu traditions like Carvaka have a rich tradition of materialism, in general, other schools...\"Jessica Frazier (2014), Hinduism in The Oxford Handbook of Atheism (Editors: Stephen Bullivant, Michael Ruse), Oxford University Press, , pages 367-378; Bill Cooke (2005), Dictionary of Atheism, Skepticism, and Humanism, , page 84 It rejects supernaturalism, emphasizes materialism and philosophical skepticism, holding empiricism, perception and conditional inference as the proper source of knowledgeKN Tiwari (1998), Classical Indian Ethical Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 67; Roy W Perrett (1984), The problem of induction in Indian philosophy, Philosophy East and West, 34(2): 161-174V.V.

One virulently anti-supernatural system is/was the so-called Carvaka school.\", C\u0101rv\u0101ka is an atheistic school of thought. It holds that there is neither afterlife nor rebirth, all existence is mere combination of atoms and substances, feelings and mind are an epiphenomenon, and free will exists.R Bhattacharya (2011), Studies on the Carvaka/Lokayata, Anthem, , pages 53, 94, 141-142>Johannes Bronkhorst (2012), Free will and Indian philosophy, Antiqvorvm Philosophia: An International Journal, Roma Italy, Volume 6, pages 19-30 B\u1e5bhaspati is sometimes referred to as the founder of C\u0101rv\u0101ka (also called Lokayata) philosophy. Much of the primary literature of Carvaka, the Barhaspatya sutras (ca. 600 BCE), however, are missing or lost.Ramkrishna Bhattacharya (2013), The base text and its commentaries: Problem of representing and understanding the Carvaka / Lokayata, Argument: Biannual Philosophical Journal, Issue 1, Volume 3, pages 133-150 Its theories and development has been compiled from historic secondary literature such as those found in the shastras, sutras and the Indian epic poetry as well as from the texts of Buddhism and from Jain literature.Dale Riepe (1996), Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 53-58 The Tattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha by the skeptic philosopher Jayar\u0101\u015bi Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da has been considered by many scholars to be an unorthodox C\u0101rv\u0101ka text. One of the widely studied principles of C\u0101rv\u0101ka philosophy was its rejection of inference as a means to establish valid, universal knowledge, and metaphysical truths. In other words, the C\u0101rv\u0101ka epistemology states that whenever one infers a truth from a set of observations or truths, one must acknowledge doubt; inferred knowledge is conditional.MM Kamal (1998), The Epistemology of the Carvaka Philosophy, Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies, 46(2): 13-16 ==Shaivism== Early history of Shaivism is difficult to determine.. However, the Upanishad (400 \u2013 200 BCE) is considered to be the earliest textual exposition of a systematic philosophy of Shaivism.. Shaivism is represented by various philosophical schools, including non-dualist (abheda), dualist (bheda), and non-dualist-with-dualist (') perspectives. Vidyaranya in his works mentions three major schools of Shaiva thought\u2014Pashupata Shaivism, Shaiva Siddhanta and Pratyabhij\u00f1a (Kashmir Shaivism).Cowell and Gough (1882), p. xii. ===P\u0101\u015bupata Shaivism=== P\u0101\u015bupata Shaivism (P\u0101\u015bupata, \"of Pa\u015bupati\") is the oldest of the major Shaiva schools.Flood (2003), p. 206. The philosophy of Pashupata sect was systematized by Lakulish in the 2nd century CE. Pa\u015bu in Pa\u015bupati refers to the effect (or created world), the word designates that which is dependent on something ulterior. Whereas, Pati means the cause (or principium), the word designates the Lord, who is the cause of the universe, the pati, or the ruler.Cowell and Gough (1882), p. 104-105. Pashupatas disapproved of Vaishnava theology, known for its doctrine servitude of souls to the Supreme Being, on the grounds that dependence upon anything could not be the means of cessation of pain and other desired ends. They recognised that those depending upon another and longing for independence will not be emancipated because they still depend upon something other than themselves. According to P\u0101\u015bupatas, soul possesses the attributes of the Supreme Deity when it becomes liberated from the 'germ of every pain'.Cowell and Gough (1882), p. 103 P\u0101\u015bupatas divided the created world into the insentient and the sentient. The insentient was the unconscious and thus dependent on the sentient or conscious. The insentient was further divided into effects and causes. The effects were of ten kinds, the earth, four elements and their qualities, colour etc. The causes were of thirteen kinds, the five organs of cognition, the five organs of action, the three internal organs, intellect, the ego principle and the cognising principle. These insentient causes were held responsible for the illusive identification of Self with non-Self. Salvation in P\u0101\u015bupata involved the union of the soul with God through the intellect.Cowell and Gough (1882), p. 107 ===Shaiva Siddhanta=== Considered normative Tantric Shaivism, Shaiva SiddhantaXavier Irudayaraj,\"Saiva Siddanta,\" in the St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India, Ed. George Menachery, Vol.III, 2010, pp.10 ff.Xavier Irudayaraj, \"Self Understanding of Saiva Siddanta Scriptures\" in the St. Thomas Christian Encyclopaedia of India, Ed. George Menachery, Vol.III, 2010, pp.14 ff. provides the normative rites, cosmology and theological categories of Tantric Shaivism.Flood (2006), p. 120. Being a dualistic philosophy, the goal of Shaiva Siddhanta is to become an ontologically distinct Shiva (through Shiva's grace).Flood (2006), p. 122. This tradition later merged with the Tamil Saiva movement and expression of concepts of Shaiva Siddhanta can be seen in the bhakti poetry of the Nayanars. ===Kashmir Shaivism=== Kashmir Shaivism arose during the eighthKashmir Shaivism: The Secret Supreme, By Lakshman Jee or ninth century CEDyczkowski, p. 4. in Kashmir and made significant strides, both philosophical and theological, until the end of the twelfth century CE.The Trika \u015aaivism of Kashmir, Moti Lal Pandit, pp. 1 It is categorised by various scholars as monisticKashmir Shaivism: The Secret Supreme, Swami Lakshman Jee, pp. 103 idealism (absolute idealism, theistic monism, realistic idealism,Dyczkowski, p. 51. transcendental physicalism or concrete monism).
