Li then step in to perform for him. When Li got on stage, he was holding a Coca Cola bottle in his hand and loudly addressed the audience. \"I went to the United States, and I went to Spain; young people around the world are drinking Coca-Cola and are singing songs that are in English,\u201d he said, according to one report.These are the words reported by Xiao-Wen Ding.

This is how Li started to challenge the singers of Western songs and the MC: Li Shuangze: To return from abroad to our land is really gratifying, but I still drink Coke ...... (Turning to the first singer) You as a Chinese are singing foreign songs, how does that taste? The first singer: The song has a good melody; Chinese songs, quite apart from the national anthem, are also sung. Li: Because we have you, Miss Tao as MC, please answer this question today. She presided over the program for ten years and will be able to give us a satisfactory answer. Tao: Today I'm hosting the show, but I did not expect to take a test! Not that we do not sing our own songs - but, please tell me, where are modern Chinese folk songs? Li: Huang Chunming has said in his \"Xiangtu zuqu \u300a\u9109\u571f\u7d44\u66f2\u300b[Native Suite]\": \"Whether we were capable of it or not, we wrote our own songs.

The symbolic meaning of smashing a Coke bottle and the significance of the song sung right after this Coca Cola bottle was smashed, was well understood by the KMT-controlled media. They hit back immediately, creating the terms Coca Cola Incident and Tamkang Incident for what had just happened on the Tamkang campus. It was clear that they wanted to intimidate Li Shuangze and those who had dared to applaud his act of protest. The result of this media campaign was unforeseen by them. They made Li's protest known island-wide. And thus, the Coca Cola \u201cincident ... at the concert in Tamkang University inspired a lot of students, and in this way the slogan 'sing songs in our own language' was introduced.\u201dMei-fen Hsin, Popular Music in Taiwan: Language, Social Class and National Identity, Durham (UK) : Durham University, 2012, Ph. D. thesis. p.161. It turned into the Let's Sing Our Own Songs Movement,See Liu Chi, in a program of \u201cChina Beat\u201d on China Radio International. and young people began to write their own songs in their own language.The author of this text, Long Yingtai (at Peking University) mentions especially Meilidao (\u7f8e\u9e97\u5cf6Formosa) \u2013 the song composed by Li Shuangze, with lyrics by Liang Jingfeng. See Long Yingtai, on Aug. 1, 2010, in . - Liang Jingfeng, Wang Jinpeng, Li Shuangzi and a few others at Tamkang were actually the source of the new political bend of the xing minge (\u65b0\u6c11\u6b4cnew folk song) movement \u2013 a direction that was informed by political goals that they laid down in their articles in Qiaochao magazine. This direction that the song movement was taking is also discussed in the 1992 article \u201cDanjiang-Xiachao luxian de minge yundong (shang)\" (\u6de1\u6c5f\uff0d\u590f\u6f6e \u8def\u7dda\u7684\u6c11\u6b4c\u904b\u52d5\uff08\u4e0a\uff09/ On the Tamkang Xiachiao (China Tide) Line of the Folk Movement), in the journal: \u300aDaoyu bianyuan \u5cf6\u5dbc\u908a\u7de3 Isle Margins\u300b, issue 5/1992, pp. 96-107. Their position becomes also clear in an article that Wang Jinping published in Cactus Magazine with respect to Taiwan Nativist Literature. See Wang Jinping, \u201cDapo wenxue zhongli de shenhua \u6253\u7834\u6587\u5b78\u4e2d\u7acb\u7684\u795e\u8a71 / Breaking the myth of the neutrality of literature), in: \u300aXian ren zhang \u4ed9\u4eba\u638c Cactus\u300b no.1/1977, pp. 81-93 But it was not only the desire to sing folk songs in native dialects languages, thus above all in Taiwanese and Hakka, as well as in standard Chinese that was strengthened. The allusive songs that were sung began also to express a spirit of defiance and opposition to the dictatorial KMT regime. Thus, with the spirit of identity that was strengthened, both Taiwan Nativist Literature and the pro-democracy Tangwai movement received a boost. Today a memorial to Li Shuangze has been erected officially on the Tamkang Campus in Tamshui. ==References== Category:1976 in Taiwan Category:Events in Taiwan ",
