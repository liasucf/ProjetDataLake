Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film's cast, use of practical effects and visual atmosphere, while criticizing its final act for losing focus. He wrote that \"it's an admirably ambitious and accomplished debut for its tyro filmmaker who should easily move on to bigger things.\" Despite praising the visual aesthetic of the film, Michael Rechtshaffen of Los Angeles Times was more critical, writing that \"Ultimately, just as the events tread a fine line between fantasy and reality, so does the film teeter precipitously between promise and pretense.\" Dylan Andresen of Film Threat gave the film a 7 out of 10 score, writing that \"Ultimately Impossible Monsters is a perfectly adequate film with good production values and quite a few engaging twists and turns. If you are interested in the psychology of dreams and nightmares, or the thrill of a murder mystery, then this film is worth a watch.\" == Accolades == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Award !Category !Result |- | rowspan=\"2\" |New Jersey International Festival |Narrative Feature |Won (Honorable Mention) |- |Best Feature Film |Won (Honorable Mention) |- |Arizona Underground Film Festival |Best Narrative Feature | |- |} == References == == External links == * * * * Category:Films set in New York City Category:American horror thriller films Category:2019 horror films Category:American psychological horror films Category:2010s horror thriller films Category:English-language films Category:Films about fictional painters Category:American psychological thriller films Category:2010s psychological horror films Category:Films about sleep disorders ",
