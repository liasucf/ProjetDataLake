    "text": "Haft Sang (; \"Seven stones\") is an Iranian television series by the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB). It began airing in 2014, one day after the beginning of Ramadan. It is an unauthorised adaptation (or, as some commentators say, shot-for-shot copy) of the American television series Modern Family. 20th Century Fox did not authorise the production of this series.() The show is named after \"haft sang\" or lagori, a children's game. Each episode is around 40 to 50 minutes long, twice as long as each episode of the original American version. As a result, the series has been said to have a slower pace compared to the American version.Harris, Aisha. \"The Story Behind That Iranian Version of Modern Family\" (Archive). Slate. July 3, 2014. Retrieved on May 21, 2015. Some subplots in the American version are not present in Haft Sang, such as the ones that pertain to homosexuality or dating. ==Characters== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Character Name in Haft Sang !Corresponding Character in Modern Family |- |Mohsen |Phil Dunphy |- |Leila |Claire Dunphy |- |Shaahin |Luke Dunphy |- |Shadi |Alex Dunphy |- |Amir* |Haley Dunphy |- |Anoush |Dylan Marshall |- |Nasir |Jay Pritchett |- |Mehri |Gloria Pritchett |- |Hamed |Manny Delgado |- |Behrooz** |Mitch Pritchett |- |Elham** |Cam Tucker |} *Portrayal of friendships between boys and girls is not permitted on Iranian television. As such, the character of Haley Dunphy is replaced by that of a teenage boy, Amir. Haley's boyfriend, Dylan, is accordingly changed to Anoush, Amir's friend. **Due to complications in televising homosexuality in Iran, the Iranian equivalents of Mitch and Cam are a heterosexual couple, Behrooz and Elham. Accordingly, the reason for them adopting a child is due to Elham's infertility. ==References== ==External links== * \"Can you guess the difference between Iran\u2019s Modern Family remake and the original?.\" Pink News. *YouTube video comparing Modern Family and Haft Sang frame-by-frame.
