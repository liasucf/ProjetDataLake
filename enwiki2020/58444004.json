    "text": "No Postage Necessary is a 2017 American romantic comedy independent film written and directed by Jeremy Culver as his second narrative feature and starring George Blagden, Charleene Closshey, Robbie Kay, Stelio Savante, with Michael Beach and Raymond J. Barry. The film integrates current political happenings \u2014 including the Silk Road (referred to \"The Spice Trail\" in the film's script), hacktivism, and cyberterrorism \u2014 into a dramedy set in Plant City, Florida. Principal photography began in Plant City in August 2016 filming on 35mm film. The film initially premiered on October 14, 2017 as an Official Selection of the Heartland Film Festival. The shortened and final version later premiered on June 28, 2018 at the Tampa Theatre in Hillsborough County, Florida where the movie was filmed exclusively. It released in theaters in ten markets across the United States on July 6, 2018 by Two Roads Picture Co. as well as on the decentralized application Vevue, making history as the first film to ever release via blockchain technology and available to stream using cryptocurrency as payment. The film's script is now part of the Core Collection of the Margaret Herrick Library at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. No Postage Necessary received mixed reviews, with praise for its heartfelt performances, music, production values, and ending that is \"satisfying without artifice\", but criticism suggesting it relies too heavily on its unique distribution strategy as its \"hook\". ==Plot== Brilliant computer hacker Sam Collins is on probation and barred from the internet; his parole officer is Harry. He steals from mailboxes and works at a local dessert shop with hacking cohort Stanley, now going by David and claiming to have undergone a spiritual awakening. When Sam steals a letter written by Josie to her dead Marine husband, he begins stalking her, stealing her letters, and finding the courage to introduce himself. FBI agent Ames accuses Sam of stealing Bitcoins, which were actually stolen by David, and are now lost. Sam and Josie begin to date tentatively. When Sam hears about the job interview Harry arranges for him, he performs a social media attack to prove to his prospective employers he can tighten up their cybersecurity without having to use the Internet, which his probation terms prohibit him from doing. When Harry finds out, he scolds Sam. Ames increases pressure on Sam to relinquish the missing bitcoins, and goes on a hunt for Sam when he later finds out that his own personal bitcoin wallet has been emptied. Sam attempts to come clean to Josie. When Ames finds out that Sam has been stealing mail, he arrests Sam for the crime, interrupting his apology to Josie. Ames' departure is interrupted by the arrival of Harry and local police reinforcements, where Ames is arrested for money laundering. Jack, Josie's father, consoles Josie, including the revelation that her letters to her late husband---all addressed to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier---were always returned, because the Tomb receives no mail, and he kept them in a special box after taking out a post office box for them to be returned. Meanwhile, Harry recommends early parole release for Sam. David, now going by his real name Stanley, hacks into the Department of Justice in order to email Harry and take the blame for Sam's mail theft. Sam visits Josie at work, but she feels violated by how Sam has hacked into her life, but tells him of her plans to move to Nashville to enroll her daughter Daisy into a special needs school. A month later, Josie receives an acceptance letter for Daisy to the school with an anonymous scholarship for Daisy's tuition and fees. Josie, Jack, and Daisy move to Nashville. Sam interviews to enlist in the Army, offering his special computer intelligence skills, deciding to chase his dreams and while helping others. After he's accepted, he writes a letter to Josie, who smiles when receiving it, convinced that Sam is now becoming the man he wanted to be. ==Cast== ;Main * George Blagden as Sam Collins, a tech genius and disaffected computer hacker who champions the underdog usually to his own detriment. * Charleene Closshey as Josie Cartwright, a young war widow and single mother raising her 6 year old daughter Daisy. * Robbie Kay as Stanley, Sam\u2019s computer protege and partner in crime, searching for life\u2019s answers through spirituality. * Stelio Savante as Special Agent Ames, a FBI officer investigating tech crimes and responsible for Sam\u2019s first run in with the law. * Michael Beach as Harry, Sam\u2019s probation officer. * Raymond J.
