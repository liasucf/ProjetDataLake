    "text": "The Supreme Advisory Council (, DPA), is a defunct advisory council for the President of Indonesia. Its function was to give advice on state and foreign affairs. The council was established on September 25, 1945 by Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta, under the name of Advisory Council (, MP). Eventually, the name was changed into Supreme Advisory Body (, BPA), and later into the current name. During the liberal democracy period in Indonesia, the organization was dissolved in 1950, and was restructured into the National Council () on 1957. The National Council was dissolved on 1959, and formed the Temporary Supreme Advisory Council, with Sukarno, the president of Indonesia, as its chairman. After the fall of Sukarno, the council was restored as a structural organization in 1967. It was dissolved on 31 July 2003 after the amendments to the Constitution of Indonesia. The functions of the council, which is previously regulated in the section IV of the constitution, was removed. During the New Order, the abbreviation of DPA is often abbreviated as Dewan Pensiunan Agung (Supreme Retirement Council). This was due to the large number of retired generals and politicians in the council. Professor Harun Al- Rasjid from the Law Faculty of the University of Indonesia, also abbreviated it as Dewan Paling Anteng (Most Serene Council). Rasjid stated that the result of the Supreme Advisory Council is unknown by the public and for its existence to be reviewed. == Background == There was no credible source about the background of the council's formation when it was embodied in the Constitution of Indonesia. In the supplement of the constitution, the council was compared to the Council of State, leading to possibility that the council was based on the in the Dutch East Indies. In the founding fathers of Indonesia itself, there was an opinion that the council was based on the village traditions in Indonesia, on which the villagers decided matters and resolve conflict with a \"council of elders\". This \"council of elders\" was in par with the Supreme Advisory Council, which was composed of retired politicians. == History == === Formation === The council was established one month and one week after the proclamation of independence of the Republic of Indonesia. When it was first established on September 25, 1945. The name for the council was Advisory Council, which was suggested by Mohammad Yamin. The name was approved to use by Sukarno. However, several months later, the name was changed to the Supreme Advisory Body. It was later changed again into the Supreme Advisory Council. === First council === The Supreme Advisory Council was formed with the announcement of the formation of the council in the Official Gazette No. 4 of 1945. Due to the emergency situation of the country, the council was not formed with a binding law. The priority at that time was to form a temporary advisory council as soon as possible under the Constitution of Indonesia. The council was formed on 25 September 1945 with Margono Djojohadikusumo as its chairman and Radjiman Wediodiningrat, Syech Dahlan Djambek, Agus Salim, K.R.M.T.H. Wurjaningrat, H. Adnan, Mochammad Enoch, Dr. Latumeten, Pangeran Mochammad Noor, Sukiman Wirjosandjojo, Nyonya Soewarni Pringgodigdo, as its members. Several months after its formation, on 6 November 1945, chairman of the council Margono resigned from his position. He was replaced by Wiranatakusumah on 29 November 1945. Later, in 1948, there was an addition of eleven members to the council, namely Ario Soerjo, Sutardjo Kartohadikusumo, Abdul Wahab Hasbullah, Ki Hadjar Dewantara, Frits Laoh, Daud Beureu'eh, Anwarudin, Oerip Soemohardjo, Ernest Douwes Dekker, Moch. Sjafei, and Liem Ing Hwie. On 24 April 1948, Wiranatakusumah was installed as the Wali Negara of Pasundan. Ario Soerjo replaced him as the chairman, but several days later he was assassinated on 10 November 1948. To replace him, the deputy chairman of the council Sutardjo Kartohadikusumo was installed on 15 November 1948. Ki Hadjar Dewantara replaced Sutardjo's position as the deputy chairman. == List of Chairmen == {|class=wikitable |- !No. !Photo !Name !From !Until !Period !Deputy !Notes |- |style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |100px |Margono Djojohadikusumo |style=\"text-align:center;\"|25 September 1945 |style=\"text- align:center;\"|6 November 1945 | rowspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 | rowspan=\"4\" |Agus Salim (until 1946) Sukiman Wirjosandjojo (until January 1948) Ario Soerjo (until April 1948) Sutardjo Kartohadikusumo (until November 1948) | rowspan=\"4\" | |- |style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |100px |Raden Adipati Aria Muharam Wiranatakusumah |style=\"text-align:center;\"|29 November 1945 |style=\"text- align:center;\"|24 April 1948 |- |style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 |100px |Ario Soerjo |style=\"text-align:center;\"|24 April 1948 |style=\"text- align:center;\"|10 November 1948 |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" |4 |100px |Sutardjo Kartohadikusumo | style=\"text-align:center;\" |10 November 1948 | style=\"text-align:center;\" |17 August 1950 |- | colspan=\"7\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |Supreme Advisory Council dissolved (17 August 1950 - 22 July 1959) | |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" |5 |100px |Sukarno | style=\"text- align:center;\" |22 July 1959 | style=\"text-align:center;\" |23 April 1966 |style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |Roeslan Abdulgani (until 1962) Sartono (from 1962) Sujono Hadinoto (from 1964) | |- | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | - | 100px |Johannes Leimena | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |23 April 1966 | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |4 March 1968 | rowspan=\"2\" | | rowspan=\"2\" |Sartono | rowspan=\"2\" | |- | |Muhammad Dahlan |- | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |6 | rowspan=\"2\" |100px | rowspan=\"2\" |Wilopo | style=\"text-align:center;\" |4 March 1968 | style=\"text-align:center;\" |28 March 1973 |style=\"text-align:center;\"|4 |Muhammad Ilyas (until 1970) | |- |style=\"text-align:center;\"|28 March 1973 |style=\"text-align:center;\"|31 March 1978 |style=\"text-align:center;\"|5 |M.
