    "text": "The 2016\u201317 British and Irish Cup was the eighth season of the annual rugby union competition for second tier, semi-professional clubs from Britain and Ireland. London Welsh are the defending champions having won the 2015\u201316 final against Yorkshire Carnegie 10\u201333 at Headingley Carnegie Stadium, Leeds on 10 April 2016. There have been six different winners and six different losing finalists in the seven seasons of its existence. The format of the competition is similar to last season with Scottish clubs not competing. For the second consecutive season the four Welsh teams are the reserve sides of the teams competing in the Pro12 competition instead of clubs from the Welsh Premier Division. ==Competition format== The competition format is a pool stage followed by a knockout stage. The pool stage consists of five pools of four teams playing home and away matches. The top side in each pool, plus the three best runners-up, progress to the knockout stage. The eight quarter-finalists are ranked, with top four teams having home advantage. The four winning quarter-finalists progress to the semi-final draw. Most of the matches are played on the same weekends as the European Champions Cup and European Challenge Cup. First round matches began on 14 October 2016 and the final was held on the 21 April 2017. ==Participating teams and locations== The allocation of teams is as follows: * \u2013 twelve clubs from RFU Championship * \u2013 four Irish provinces represented by 'A' teams * \u2013 four Welsh regions represented by Premiership Select teams. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !| Club !| Country !| League !| Stadium !| Capacity !| Area |- |Bedford Blues | England |RFU Championship |Goldington Road |align=center|6,000 |Bedford |- |Cardiff Blues Premiership Select | Wales |N/A |Cardiff Arms Park Sardis Road The Wern |align=center|12,125 7,861 4,500 |Cardiff Pontypridd Merthyr Tydfil |- |Connacht Eagles | Ireland |Irish Interprovincial Rugby Championship |Galway Sportsgrounds Dubarry Park |align=center|9,500 10,000 |Galway Athlone |- |Cornish Pirates | England |RFU Championship |Mennaye Field |align=center|4,000 |Penzance |- |Doncaster Knights | England |RFU Championship |Castle Park |align=center|5,000 |Doncaster |- |Ealing Trailfinders | England |RFU Championship |Trailfinders Sports Ground |align=center|3,020 |West Ealing, London |- |Jersey Reds | England |RFU Championship |St. Peter |align=center|4,000 |Saint Peter |- |Leinster A | Ireland |Irish Interprovincial Rugby Championship |Donnybrook Stadium |align=center|6,000 |Dublin |- |London Irish | England |RFU Championship |Madejski Stadium | align=center|7,579 |Reading, Berkshire |- |London Scottish | England |RFU Championship |Richmond Athletic Ground |align=center|4,500 |Richmond, London |- |London Welsh | England |RFU Championship |Old Deer Park |align=center|5,850 |Richmond, London |- |Munster A | Ireland |Irish Interprovincial Rugby Championship |Towns Park The Showgrounds Old Chapel Irish Independent Park CIT Stadium |align=center|400 1,000 N/A 8,200 1,100 |Midleton Ennis Bandon Cork Cork |- |Newport Gwent Dragons Premiership Select | Wales |N/A |Pandy Park CCB Centre |align=center|3,000 1,000 |Crosskeys Ystrad Mynach |- |Nottingham Rugby | England |RFU Championship |Lady Bay Sports Ground |align=center|3,000 |Nottingham |- |Ospreys Premiership Select | Wales |N/A |The Gnoll Talbot Athletic Ground Llynfi Road |align=center|5,000 3,000 N/A |Neath Port Talbot Maesteg |- |Richmond | England |RFU Championship |Richmond Athletic Ground |align=center|4,500 |Richmond, London |- |Rotherham Titans | England |RFU Championship |Clifton Lane |align=center|2,500 |Rotherham |- |Scarlets Premiership Select | Wales |N/A |Church Bank Playing Fields Carmarthen Park Parc y Scarlets |align=center|3,000 3,000 14,870 |Llandovery Carmarthen Llanelli |- |Ulster A | Ireland |Irish Interprovincial Rugby Championship |Shaw's Bridge Eaton Park Kingspan Stadium |align=center|1,300 1,000 18,196 |Belfast Ballymena Belfast |- |Yorkshire Carnegie | England |RFU Championship |Sandhill Lane Stadium Moor Lane Silver Royd |align=center|N/A N/A 1,950 |Selby Pontefract Scalby |} ==Pool stages== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Key to colours |- | bgcolor=\"#ccffcc\"| | Winner of each pool, advance to quarter-finals. |- | bgcolor=\"#ccccff\"| |Three highest-scoring second-place teams advance to quarter-finals. |- |} ===Pool 1=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !
