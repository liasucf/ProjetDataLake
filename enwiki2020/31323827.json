History Dacusville Named for Archibald Dacus Archibald Dacus was born in Lunenburg County, Virginia in 1869, to John and Mara Dacus. In the late seventeen hundreds, he moved with several of his family to Upper State South Carolina. He ran a trading post on the old Indian Road that ran from Virginia through North and South Carolina into Georgia territory, at what soon came to be called Dacusville, to trade with the Indians and passers-by, as well as local people. It is said that this was first called \"The Trap.\" This was also a stage coach stop. History relates there had been a post office in this vicinity since Revolutionary War days which had been operated from more than one location by various people. Archibald Dacus began to operate the Post Office from his trading post (Store) and the place was called \"Dacusville\" after him. ==References== h Category:Unincorporated communities in Pickens County, South Carolina Category:Unincorporated communities in South Carolina ttp://files.usgwarchives.net/sc/pickens/cemeteries/p287.txt#:~:text=History%20relates%20there%20had%20been,called%20%22Dacusville%22%20after%20him.
