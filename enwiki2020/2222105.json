The island, like the other Aeolian Islands, was settled since the Neolithic Age, around 3000 BC. As evidenced by archaeological findings, the island was occupied by a new people during the Bronze Age. The island was uninhabited for many centuries until occupied by the Greeks. Roman and Byzantine remains can also be found on the island. Since the 1970s Filicudi was rediscovered and populated by photographers and artists such as Sergio Libiszewsky, Ettore Sottsass, novelist Roland Zoss, and editor Giulio Einaudi. Their perceptions brought the island into the focus of modern tourism. ==People== * John Bonica (born 1917), anesthesiologist and professional wrestler * Roland Zoss (born 1951), novelist and composer ==See also== *List of volcanoes in Italy * List of islands of Italy ==References== ==External links== * *Private page of a novelist living on Filicudi *A commercial touristic website about Filicudi *Info about the island *Filicudi Society of Waltham Massachusetts Category:Aeolian Islands Category:Frazioni of the Metropolitan City of Messina ",
