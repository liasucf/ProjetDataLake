    "text": "Meursault is a commune in the C\u00f4te-d'Or department and region of Bourgogne- Franche-Comt\u00e9 in eastern France. ==Geography and viticulture== Meursault is an Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC) in the C\u00f4te de Beaune subregion of the Burgundy wine region. It lies along the foot of the C\u00f4te-d'Or escarpment, around Beaune and with the broad Sa\u00f4ne valley plain to its east. Meursault produces mainly white wines from Chardonnay grapes, primarily in a style with a clear oak influence, which have led to descriptions such as \"buttery\" to be applied to powerful examples of Meursault wines. Within the Meursault AOC there are some Premier Cru vineyards, but no Grand Cru. This has however not stopped the wines of Meursault from competing with the white burgundies from the villages Chassagne-Montrachet and Puligny-Montrachet, where several Grands Crus are situated. The town of Meursault is home to the international wine event La Paul\u00e9e de Meursault. ==History== Meursault is situated on a prehistoric settlement. Mont M\u00e9lian is a Gallo-Roman camp. The old Roman Fort remains are still visible on the hill (known and signposted as \"La Montagne\") above the village. The name of Meursault derives from muris saltus, the \"mouse-leap\" stream of the Ruisseau des Cloux, so named by the Roman soldiers.Wilson, James E. (1998): Terroir, The Role of Geology, Climate, And Culture in the Making of the French Wines University of California Press. The h\u00f4pital de Meursault is an old hospital, dating from the twelfth century, that was originally used to treat leprosy. Meursault was used in the film La Grande Vadrouille. The town hall, very recognisable with its Burgundy coloured roof, is used in some scenes, with it catching fire. ==Administration== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ List of mayors |- ! Year !! Name !!
