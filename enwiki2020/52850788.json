    "text": "Victor Tournachon-Molin (1771\u20131837) was a French printer and bookseller. He was the father of the famous photographer Nadar. He was also the first French printer to publish the translation of Giacomo Casanova's masterpiece, Histoire de ma vie, from 1825 to 1829. ==Translation of Histoire de ma vie== After the success of the first German edition of Giacomo Casanova's memoirs, Victor Tournachon edited a pirate edition, without access to the original manuscript. This first French edition was a German to French translation from the French to German Sch\u00fctz translation, which results in a very approximate and imperfect text. == See also == * Histoire de ma vie == References == Category:French printers Category:1771 births Category:1837 deaths ",
