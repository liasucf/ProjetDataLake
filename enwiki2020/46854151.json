    "text": "==Brunei vs Vietnam== In the first game of the tournament it was Vietnam who opened the scoring midway through the first half when an unmarked L\u00ea Thanh B\u00ecnh poked in H\u1ed3 Ng\u1ecdc Th\u1eafng's cross. Vietnam would score again just after the break in similar circumstances as Tr\u1ea7n Phi S\u01a1n was once again unmarked to head in Nguy\u1ec5n C\u00f4ng Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng's free kick. Vietnam would score four times in the last 15 minutes as the Brunei side tired, first M\u1ea1c H\u1ed3ng Qu\u00e2n finished after a teammate headed the ball down to him, then Ng\u1ecdc Th\u1eafng and H\u1ed3ng Qu\u00e2n exchanged some neat passes before the former's cross hit into the net by Ph\u1ea1m \u0110\u1ee9c Huy. Four minutes later Ng\u1ecdc Th\u1eafng's cross was not properly dealt with by the Bruneian defense resulting in H\u1ed3ng Qu\u00e2n laying the ball off for C\u00f4ng Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng to score, and with a minute left in normal time Ph\u1ea1m M\u1ea1nh H\u00f9ng's effort from outside the box was beyond the goalkeeper's reach to complete the rout. {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- | GK || 1 ||Md Ahsanuddin Hj Md Dani |- | DF || 4 ||Md Khairil Shahme Suhaimi |- | DF || 5 ||Suhaimi Anak Sulau |- | MF || 8 ||Ak Yura Indera Putera Pg Yunos |- | FW || 9 ||Faiq Jefri Bolkiah (c) || || |- | MF || 10 ||Muhammad Nur Ikhmal Damit |- | MF || 11 ||Md Aminuddin Zakwan Tahir |- | MF || 20 ||Muhd Saiful Ammar Hj Adis || || |- | DF || 22 ||Azri Zahari || || |- | DF || 24 ||Mohd Hanif Hamir |- | MF || 27 ||Azwan Ali Rahman |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- | MF || 3 ||Mohd Asnawi Syazni Aziz || || |- | FW || 21 ||Mohd Shafie Hj Mohd Effendy || || |- | FW || 29 ||Md Nur Syazwan Halidi || || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=3| Stephen Ng Heng Seng |} |valign=\"top\"| |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- | GK || 27 ||Ph\u00ed Minh Long |- | DF || 3 ||Ph\u1ea1m M\u1ea1nh H\u00f9ng (c) |- | MF || 11 ||\u0110\u1ed7 Duy M\u1ea1nh |- | DF || 12 ||V\u0169 Ng\u1ecdc Th\u1ecbnh |- | MF || 13 ||Hu\u1ef3nh T\u1ea5n T\u00e0i || || |- | MF || 14 ||Nguy\u1ec5n Huy H\u00f9ng || || |- | FW || 16 ||L\u00ea Thanh B\u00ecnh || || |- | MF || 18 ||H\u1ed3 Ng\u1ecdc Th\u1eafng || |- | FW || 20 ||Tr\u1ea7n Phi S\u01a1n |- | MF || 23 ||Ph\u1ea1m \u0110\u1ee9c Huy |- | DF || 26 ||B\u00f9i Ti\u1ebfn D\u0169ng |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- | FW || 10 ||Nguy\u1ec5n C\u00f4ng Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng || || |- | FW || 17 ||M\u1ea1c H\u1ed3ng Qu\u00e2n || || |- | DF || 22 ||Nguy\u1ec5n Thanh Hi\u1ec1n || || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=3| Toshiya Miura |} |} {| width=50% style=\"font- size: 90%\" | Assistant referees: Ghulam Abbas (Kuwait) Goh Gek Pheng Jeffrey (Singapore) Fourth official: Foo Chuan Hui (Singapore) |} ==Laos vs Thailand== Thailand bossed the early stages of the game, and finally broke the deadlock in only 10 minutes as Narubadin Weerawatnodom headed home fellow defender Peerapat Notechaiya's corner. Nine minutes later Thai play-maker Chanathip Songkrasin found Pinyo Inpinit with a fine reverse-pass which the latter put on a plate for Chananan Pombuppha, who couldn't miss. Seven minutes before half time Peerapat broke down the flank and his cross was powerfully dispatched by Nurul Sriyankem. Just a minute after the break Peerapat claimed his third assist of the game as his corner was headed in by Chananan. At the hour mark Nurul was adjudged to have been fouled by Sengdao Inthilath in the box and Chananan confidently scored the penalty kick to complete his hat-trick. The sixth Thai goal came through some lovely interplay between the substitutes ended with Tristan Do floating a fine cross over the Laotian goalkeeper and left Chananan with the task of heading into the empty net for his fourth goal of the game. To their credit Laos never gave up and had too great chances, one in the 35 minute when Thai goaltender Chanin Sae-Eae had to pull off a diving save to keep out Soukaphone Vongchiengkham's effort, and in the 51 when substitute Maitee's shot went just over. {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- | GK || 1 ||Vathana Keodouangdeth |- | DF || 13 ||Bounthavy Sipasong |- | DF || 12 ||Thenthong Phonsettha || || |- | DF || 19 ||Sengdao Inthilath || |- | DF || 14 ||Soukchinda Natphasouk |- | MF || 21 ||Tiny Bounmalay (c) |- | MF || 15 ||Phoutthasay Khochalern |- | MF || 8 ||Keoviengphet Liththideth || || |- | MF || 10 ||Soukaphone Vongchiengkham || || |- | MF || 7 ||Khonesavanh Sihavong |- | FW || 2 ||Thinnakone Vongsa |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- | MF || 11 ||Maitee Maitee || || |- | FW || 9 ||Sitthideth Khanthavong || || |- | FW || 16 ||Sinnalone Sihalath || || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=3| Dave Booth |} |valign=\"top\"| |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- | GK || 1 ||Chanin Sae-Eae |- | DF || 5 ||Adisorn Promrak |- | DF || 2 ||Peerapat Notechaiya |- | DF || 8 ||Artit Daosawang |- | DF || 13 ||Narubadin Weerawatnodom || || |- | MF || 12 ||Nurul Sriyankem || || |- | MF || 6 ||Sarach Yooyen (c) |- | MF || 7 ||Thitipan Puangchan |- | MF || 18 ||Chanathip Songkrasin |- | MF || 11 ||Pinyo Inpinit || || |- | FW || 23 ||Chananan Pombuppha |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- | MF || 14 ||Pakorn Prempak || || |- | DF || 19 ||Tristan Do || || |- | MF || 29 ||Rungrath Poomchantuek || || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=3| Choketawee Promrut |} |} {| width=50% style=\"font-size: 90%\" | Assistant referees: Mohammad Reza Mansouriri (Iran) Ahmed Ferdous (Bangladesh) Fourth official: Sukhbir Singh (Singapore) |} ==Malaysia vs Timor-Leste== Malaysia took the lead in only the eleventh minute as Nurridzuan Abu Hassan cross was missed by several players although it fell to midfielder D. Saarvindran who effortlessly scored. Muhammad Syafiq Ahmad had a great opportunity to double the lead three minutes later when a defensive slip up let him through on goal although his shot was deflected for a corner. Thirteen minutes before half time Malaysian midfielder Nazmi Faiz Mansor was shown a straight red card for allegedly spitting at an opponent in an off the ball situation. Chances were few and far between in the second half as 10 man Malaysia were hesitant to take chances and Timor-Leste could not break through their defence. In the seventy third minute the two Malaysian substitutes combined well, with Nazirul Naim Che Hashim's corner being headed against the bar by S. Kumaahran. Timor-Leste's best chance came five minutes from time as Mohd Farhan Abu Bakar had to dive at full stretch to make a superb save from captain Anggisu's free kick. {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- | GK || 1 ||Mohd Farhan Abu Bakar |- | DF || 29 ||Matthew Davies |- | DF || 26 ||Mohd Amer Saidin |- | DF || 25 ||Adam Nor Azlin |- | DF || 17 ||Mohd Fandi Othman (c) |- | MF || 12 ||Gary Steven Robbat || || |- | MF || 16 ||Nurridzuan Abu Hassan || || |- | MF || 28 ||Mohd Amirul Hisyam Awang Kechik |- | MF || 6 ||D.

In only the eleventh minute when the former found Phoutthasay Khochalern outside the box who unleashed a well place shot to score the first goal of the game. Despite the early dominance by Laos, Brunei grew into the game and had several good opportunities fall to their captain and former Arsenal and Chelsea academy player Faiq Jefri Bolkiah. In the 19th minute he dribbled past two defenders to see his shot go just wide, while three minutes later the Laotian goalkeeper had to be alert to his well placed free-kick. Faiq Jefri was desperately unlucky in the 32nd minute when his fine run and shot had Soukthavy Soundala beaten but his effort rebounded off the post. It was Laos' turn to hit the word work ten minutes later with Sihavong and Soukaphone coming well again but the former's effort coming back of the underside of the crossbar. In the 55th minute Bruneian goalkeeper Ahsanuddin had to make a fantastic one handed save from Phoutthasay's long range effort, and again ten minutes later from Khouanta Sivongthong. Brunei finally got their equaliser in the 67th minute when a quick counterattack ended with Azwan Ali Rahman placing a shot into the top corner. Parity would only last seven minutes though as Soukchinda Natphasouk got behind the Bruneian defence to turn in Soukaphone's low cross. The Laotians held on for the win in a fine match. {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- | GK || 1 ||Md Ahsanuddin Hj Md Dani |- | DF || 4 ||Md Khairil Shahme Suhaimi || |- | DF || 5 ||Suhaimi Anak Sulau |- | DF || 22 ||Azri Zahari |- | DF || 24 ||Mohd Hanif Hamir |- | MF || 3 ||Mohd Asnawi Syazni Aziz |- | MF || 10 ||Muhammad Nur Ikhmal Damit |- | MF || 11 ||Md Aminuddin Zakwan Tahir |- | MF || 20 ||Muhd Saiful Ammar Hj Adis || || |- | MF || 27 ||Azwan Ali Rahman |- | FW || 9 ||Faiq Jefri Bolkiah (c) |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- | FW || 21 ||Mohd Shafie Hj Mohd Effendy || || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=3| Stephen Ng Heng Seng |} |valign=\"top\"| |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- | GK || 18 ||Soukthavy Soundala |- | DF || 12 ||Thenthong Phonsettha |- | DF || 19 ||Sengdao Inthilath |- | DF || 14 ||Soukchinda Natphasouk || || |- | MF || 21 ||Tiny Bounmalay (c) |- | MF || 15 ||Phoutthasay Khochalern || || |- | MF || 17 ||Vilayout Sayyabounsou |- | MF || 11 ||Maitee Maitee || |- | MF || 10 ||Soukaphone Vongchiengkham |- | MF || 7 ||Khonesavanh Sihavong || || |- | FW || 2 ||Thinnakone Vongsa |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- | DF || 20 ||Khouanta Sivongthong || || |- | MF || 26 ||Lembo Saysana || || |- | FW || 23 ||Xaisongkham Champathong || || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=3| Dave Booth |} |} {| width=50% style=\"font-size: 90%\" | Assistant referees: Saparmammet Gurbanov (Turkmenistan) Ahmed Ferdous (Bangladesh) Fourth official: Foo Chuan Hui (Singapore) |} ==Thailand vs Timor-Leste== A surprisingly resolute Timorese side managed to stem a Thai attack that had scored six in the previous game. Thailand should have taken the lead in the 41st minute when Sarach Yooyen's free-kick was parried by Ramos Maxanches, but only a few yards out with no pressure and the whole goal to aim at Nurul Sriyankem some how managed to blast his shot way over. Thailand finally were able to capitalise on their vast dominance a minute before half-time as Chanathip Songkrasin's decisive pass was composedly finished by Rungrath Poomchantuek. In the second half Thailand had a great opportunity to double their lead when they were awarded a penalty kick after Nurul was tripped in the box in the 54th minute. Chananan Pombuppha had scored four in his previous game and was given the responsibility but Maxanches dove low to his right to save the shot. Timor- Leste defended well but offered little in attack as Thailand won by the single goal. {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- | GK || 1 ||Chanin Sae-Eae |- | DF || 2 ||Peerapat Notechaiya || || |- | DF || 8 ||Artit Daosawang |- | DF || 13 ||Narubadin Weerawatnodom |- | DF || 17 ||Tanaboon Kesarat |- | MF || 12 ||Nurul Sriyankem || |- | MF || 6 ||Sarach Yooyen (c) |- | MF || 29 ||Rungrath Poomchantuek |- | MF || 7 ||Thitipan Puangchan || || |- | MF || 18 ||Chanathip Songkrasin |- | FW || 23 ||Chananan Pombuppha || || |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- | DF || 3 ||Suriya Singmui || || |- | FW || 22 ||Chenrop Samphaodi || || |- | MF || 4 ||Chaowat Veerachat || || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=3| Choketawee Promrut |} |valign=\"top\"| |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- | GK || 12 ||Ramos Maxanches |- | DF || 2 ||Ezequiel Fernandes |- | DF || 4 ||Filipe Oliveira |- | DF || 15 ||Agostinho |- | DF || 18 ||Candido Oliveira |- | MF || 11 ||Nataniel Reis |- | MF || 10 ||Nilo Soares || || |- | FW || 5 ||Henrique Cruz || || |- | FW || 6 ||Anggisu Barbosa (c) |- | FW || 19 ||Feliciano Goncalves || |- | FW || 9 ||Jairo Neto || || |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- | MF || 14 ||Frangcyatma Alves || || |- | MF || 23 ||Jos\u00e9 Fonseca || || |- | DF || 17 ||Nidio Neto || || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=3| F\u00e1bio Magr\u00e3o |} |} {| width=50% style=\"font-size: 90%\" | Assistant referees: Alisher Usmanov (Uzbekistan) Ghulam Abbas (Kuwait) Fourth official: Yousef Al-Marzouq (Kuwait) |} ==Vietnam vs Malaysia== Malaysia started strongly and could have scored in the first minute, goaltender Ph\u00ed Minh Long having to produce a one-handed save to keep D. Saarvindran's free-kick from finding the back of the net. V\u00f5 Huy To\u00e0n had a goal disallowed for offsides, but Vietnam opened the scoring five minutes later as C\u00f4ng Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng was fouled in the box by Adam Nor Azlin and M\u1ea1c H\u1ed3ng Qu\u00e2n scored from the resulting penalty kick. C\u00f4ng Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng grabbed Vietnam's second goal just before hald time as he slotted H\u1ed3 Ng\u1ecdc Th\u1eafng's pass into the bottom corner. C\u00f4ng Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng was tormenting the Malaysian defence and won another penalty kick just moments into the second half as he was fouled by Mohd Farhan Abu Bakar this time, with Huy To\u00e0n given the responsibilities and scoring. Incredibly only six minutes later Vietnam would score again, C\u00f4ng Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng with a great free-kick into the top corner. Malaysia finally restored some pride as Nurridzuan Abu Hassan found space in the Vietnamese defence to cross for Syahrul Azwari Ibrahim to score. With ten minutes to go Vietnam restored their four-goal lead when Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n To\u00e0n chipping the ball over Abu Bakar who was off his goal-line to cap off a resounding performance. {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- | GK || 27 ||Ph\u00ed Minh Long |- | DF || 6 ||Nguy\u1ec5n Minh T\u00f9ng || || |- | DF || 26 ||B\u00f9i Ti\u1ebfn D\u0169ng |- | DF || 15 ||Qu\u1ebf Ng\u1ecdc H\u1ea3i (c) |- | DF || 22 ||Nguy\u1ec5n Thanh Hi\u1ec1n |- | MF || 2 ||Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu D\u0169ng || |- | MF || 11 ||\u0110\u1ed7 Duy M\u1ea1nh |- | MF || 25 ||V\u00f5 Huy To\u00e0n |- | MF || 18 ||H\u1ed3 Ng\u1ecdc Th\u1eafng || || |- | FW || 17 ||M\u1ea1c H\u1ed3ng Qu\u00e2n || |- | FW || 10 ||Nguy\u1ec5n C\u00f4ng Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng || || |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- | DF || 12 ||V\u0169 Ng\u1ecdc Th\u1ecbnh || || |- | FW || 20 ||Tr\u1ea7n Phi S\u01a1n || || |- | FW || 19 ||Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n To\u00e0n || || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=3| Toshiya Miura |} |valign=\"top\"| |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- | GK || 1 ||Mohd Farhan Abu Bakar || |- | DF || 29 ||Matthew Davies |- | DF || 26 ||Mohd Amer Saidin |- | DF || 25 ||Adam Nor Azlin |- | DF || 17 ||Mohd Fandi Othman (c) |- | MF || 12 ||Gary Steven Robbat || || |- | MF || 16 ||Nurridzuan Abu Hassan |- | MF || 28 ||Mohd Amirul Hisyam Awang Kechik || |- | MF || 6 ||D.

They would come to rue that miss in the 24th minute as Jairo Neto slotted Nidio Neto through ball through the Bruneian goalkeeper's to open the scoring. Brunei found a way back in the 68th minute as Asnawi was fouled in the box by Maxanches. Captain Faiq Jefri Bolkiah took the responsibility and confidently smashed the penalty kick home to equalise. However just as in the previous game Brunei conceded again six minutes after equalising, from just outside the box the other Brazilian-born Timorese player in the squad Paulo Helber stole the ball from Muhd Saiful Ammar Hj Adis and unleashed a powerful effort and although Md Ahsanuddin Hj Md Dani got both hands to the shot he could not keep it out. {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- | GK || 12 ||Ramos Maxanches |- | DF || 2 ||Ezequiel Fernandes |- | DF || 3 ||Jorge Sabas Victor |- | DF || 4 ||Filipe Oliveira || |- | MF || 17 ||Nidio Neto || || |- | DF || 18 ||Candido Oliveira || || |- | MF || 16 ||Paulo Helber || || |- | MF || 23 ||Jos\u00e9 Fonseca |- | MF || 11 ||Nataniel Reis |- | FW || 6 ||Anggisu Barbosa (c) |- | FW || 9 ||Jairo Neto |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- | DF || 15 ||Agostinho || || |- | FW || 19 ||Feliciano Goncalves || || |- | MF || 10 ||Nilo Soares || || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=3| F\u00e1bio Magr\u00e3o |} |valign=\"top\"| |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- | GK || 1 ||Md Ahsanuddin Hj Md Dani |- | DF || 4 ||Md Khairil Shahme Suhaimi |- | DF || 5 ||Suhaimi Anak Sulau |- | DF || 22 ||Azri Zahari |- | DF || 24 ||Mohd Hanif Hamir || |- | MF || 3 ||Mohd Asnawi Syazni Aziz || || |- | MF || 8 ||Ak Yura Indera Putera Pg Yunos || || |- | MF || 10 ||Muhammad Nur Ikhmal Damit |- | MF || 11 ||Md Aminuddin Zakwan Tahir || || |- | MF || 27 ||Azwan Ali Rahman |- | FW || 9 ||Faiq Jefri Bolkiah (c) |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- | MF || 20 ||Muhd Saiful Ammar Hj Adis || || |- | FW || 21 ||Mohd Shafie Hj Mohd Effendy || || |- | MF || 19 ||Ak Mohd Abd Halim Pg Hj Hassan || || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=3| Stephen Ng Heng Seng |} |} {| width=50% style=\"font-size: 90%\" | Assistant referees: Saoud Ahmed Al-Maqaleh (Qatar) Saparmammet Gurbanov (Turkmenistan) Fourth official: Hiroyuki Kimura (Japan) |} ==Malaysia vs Thailand== The match started at a frenetic pace as with in the first ten minutes Chanathip Songkrasin and Chananan Pombuppha had efforts go just wide. Malaysia too had their chances as a swift counterattack in the 14th minute saw captain Gary Steven Robbat racing towards goal but he shot wide under pressure from Narubadin Weerawatnodom. In the 27th minute Narubadin put in a great cross for the unmarked Thitipan Puangchan right in front off the goal but he somehow headed wide. Narubadin's crosses were troubling the Malaysians and it caused problems again in the 53rd minute as he crossed for Rungrath Poomchantuek and last ditch challenge was needed by Mohd Amer Saidin to prevent the latter from scoring. Malaysia almost took the lead five minutes later when Syahrul Azwari Ibrahim cut inside his defender and unleashed a tremendous curling effort destined for the top corner which Thai goalkeeper Chanin Sae-Eae had to be at full stretch to keep out. Thailand had an even better chance themselves in the 68th minute when Mohd Farhan Abu Bakar had to dive down low to keep Tanaboon Kesarat's long range effort out, and the rebound was pounced upon by Chananan but his shot was deflected by a Malaysian defender for a corner. But a goal did come nine minutes from time as Tristan Do passed to his captain Sarach Yooyen who from just outside the box unleashed a powerful left-footed effort that gave the Malaysian goalkeeper no chance. Thailand could have even scored another when Nurul Sriyankem was one-on-one with the goalkeeper but Abu Bakar managed to make the block.

Chenrop would score again thirteen minutes later as he was completely unmarked to head in Chaowat Veerachat's cross. Rungrath Poomchantuek had a goal disallowed for offsides three minutes before that, but Thailand kept attacking and where rewarded with another goal six minutes after the break when Pakorn Prempak taped a free-kick to Thitipan who blasted the shot into the net. Tristan Do was next to score as the defender stole the ball from Suhaimi Anak Sulau and proceeded to shoot past Md Ahsanuddin Hj Md Dani although the Bruneian goalkeeper probably could have done better. He himself was injured on the play and had to be substituted, but his replacement Md Nur Syazwan Halidi could not stop another substitute Nurul Sriyankem from scoring in stoppage time as Thailand made it five. The result also guarantied Thailand would advance out of the group. {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- | GK || 20 ||Somporn Yos |- | DF || 3 ||Suriya Singmui |- | DF || 5 ||Adisorn Promrak (c) |- | DF || 19 ||Tristan Do || |- | MF || 4 ||Chaowat Veerachat |- | MF || 17 ||Tanaboon Kesarat |- | MF || 14 ||Pakorn Prempak |- | MF || 7 ||Thitipan Puangchan || || |- | MF || 24 ||Siwakorn Jakkuprasat || |- | MF || 29 ||Rungrath Poomchantuek |- | FW || 22 ||Chenrop Samphaodi || || |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- | MF || 11 ||Pinyo Inpinit || || |- | MF || 12 ||Nurul Sriyankem || || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=3| Choketawee Promrut |} |valign=\"top\"| |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- | GK || 1 ||Md Ahsanuddin Hj Md Dani || || |- | DF || 2 ||Mohd Nur Azees Awang Ali |- | DF || 4 ||Md Khairil Shahme Suhaimi |- | DF || 5 ||Suhaimi Anak Sulau |- | DF || 12 ||Mohd Aman Hj Abd Rahim |- | DF || 24 ||Mohd Hanif Hamir |- | DF || 25 ||Mohd Rakin Ramli |- | MF || 18 ||Muhammad Nadzri Hj Erwan || || |- | MF || 19 ||Ak Mohd Abd Halim Pg Hj Hassan |- | FW || 21 ||Mohd Shafie Hj Mohd Effendy |- | FW || 9 ||Faiq Jefri Bolkiah (c) || || |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- | FW || 29 ||Md Nur Syazwan Halidi || || |- | MF || 8 ||Ak Yura Indera Putera Pg Yunos|| || |- | GK || 30 ||Abdul Hafiz Abdul Rahim || || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=3| Stephen Ng Heng Seng |} |} {| width=50% style=\"font-size: 90%\" | Assistant referees: Alisher Usmanov (Uzbekistan) Saparmammet Gurbanov (Turkmenistan) Fourth official: Ma Ning (China) |} ==Timor-Leste vs Vietnam== Vietnam opened the scoring in the twelfth minute as Tr\u1ea7n Phi S\u01a1n headed in a cross from his captain Qu\u1ebf Ng\u1ecdc H\u1ea3i.

Nonetheless there was still plenty to play for as the winner would top the group and both teams played a fast-paced, physical, and attacking game. Chananan Pombuppha had two great chances in the opening twenty minutes but on both occasions his effort was wide. Chananan redeemed himself in the 22nd minute as it was his pass that set up Pakorn Prempak to score the opening goal from an acute angle. Pakorn could have had a second eight minutes later when this time Chaowat Veerachat with the pass but the former's shot was straight at Vietnamese goalkeeper Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n Ti\u1ebfn. Just moments latter Vietnam had the chance to equalise but Ph\u1ea1m M\u1ea1nh H\u00f9ng's cross to the unmarked \u0110\u1ed7 Duy M\u1ea1nh was headed wide. In similar circumstances before the end of the half Tr\u1ea7n Phi S\u01a1n, whose pace and skill caused Thailand all sorts of problems, found L\u00ea Thanh B\u00ecnh with a great pass, but although the former was again unmarked he too headed off target. Thailand thought they had doubled their advantage in the 51st minute when Chaowat passed it to Chananan only for the latter to see his effort come off the woodwork. Nonetheless they would get their second when Pakorn who was adjudged to have been fouled in the box by B\u00f9i Ti\u1ebfn D\u0169ng. Thitipan Puangchan took the responsibility and calmly scored the penalty kick. With sixteen minutes to go Thanh B\u00ecnh was denied by a sliding challenge from Thai captain Adisorn Promrak, and three minutes later it was three for Thailand as Tristan Do managed to turn the defender marking him before unleashing a powerful curling shot perfectly placed in the top corner. in the last minute of the game Vietnam would grab a consolation goal as Thanh B\u00ecnh turned and volleyed a pass in spectacular style to make some amends for the chances he missed earlier in the game, as Thailand conceded their first goal of the tournament but still topped the group in an entertaining game. {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- | GK || 1 ||Ph\u1ea1m V\u0103n Ti\u1ebfn |- | DF || 3 ||Ph\u1ea1m M\u1ea1nh H\u00f9ng (c) |- | DF || 12 ||V\u0169 Ng\u1ecdc Th\u1ecbnh |- | DF || 22 ||Nguy\u1ec5n Thanh Hi\u1ec1n |- | DF || 26 ||B\u00f9i Ti\u1ebfn D\u0169ng || || |- | MF || 23 ||Ph\u1ea1m \u0110\u1ee9c Huy |- | MF || 14 ||Nguy\u1ec5n Huy H\u00f9ng || || |- | MF || 16 ||L\u00ea Thanh B\u00ecnh |- | MF || 11 ||\u0110\u1ed7 Duy M\u1ea1nh || || |- | FW || 19 ||Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n To\u00e0n |- | FW || 20 ||Tr\u1ea7n Phi S\u01a1n |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- | DF || 6 ||Nguy\u1ec5n Minh T\u00f9ng|| || |- | MF || 18 ||H\u1ed3 Ng\u1ecdc Th\u1eafng || || |- | FW || 10 ||Nguy\u1ec5n C\u00f4ng Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng || || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=3| Toshiya Miura |} |valign=\"top\"| |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- | GK || 1 ||Chanin Sae-Eae |- | DF || 5 ||Adisorn Promrak (c) |- | DF || 2 ||Peerapat Notechaiya || || |- | DF || 19 ||Tristan Do |- | DF || 8 ||Artit Daosawang |- | MF || 4 ||Chaowat Veerachat |- | MF || 7 ||Thitipan Puangchan || |- | MF || 14 ||Pakorn Prempak || || |- | MF || 24 ||Siwakorn Jakkuprasat |- | MF || 11 ||Pinyo Inpinit || || |- | FW || 23 ||Chananan Pombuppha |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- | DF || 3 ||Suriya Singmui || || |- | MF || 29 ||Rungrath Poomchantuek || || |- | FW || 22 ||Chenrop Samphaodi || || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=3| Choketawee Promrut |} |} {| width=50% style=\"font-size: 90%\" | Assistant referees: Saparmammet Gurbanov (Turkmenistan) Ghulam Abbas (Kuwait) Fourth official: Mooud Bonyadifard (Iran) |} ==Laos vs Malaysia== {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- | GK || 18 ||Soukthavy Soundala |- | DF || 12 ||Thenthong Phonsettha |- | DF || 14 ||Soukchinda Natphasouk || || |- | MF || 21 ||Tiny Bounmalay (c) |- | MF || 15 ||Phoutthasay Khochalern |- | MF || 7 ||Khonesavanh Sihavong || || |- | MF || 11 ||Maitee Maitee |- | MF || 10 ||Soukaphone Vongchiengkham || || |- | MF || 8 ||Keoviengphet Liththideth |- | FW || 2 ||Thinnakone Vongsa |- | FW || 16 ||Sinnalone Sihalath |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- | MF || 17 ||Vilayout Sayyabounsou || || |- | FW || 9 ||Sitthideth Khanthavong|| || |- | FW || 23 ||Xaisongkham Champathong || || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=3| Dave Booth |} |valign=\"top\"| |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- | GK || 1 ||Mohd Farhan Abu Bakar |- | DF || 3 ||Shahrul Mohd Saad |- | DF || 29 ||Matthew Davies |- | DF || 26 ||Mohd Amer Saidin || |- | DF || 17 ||Mohd Fandi Othman (c) |- | MF || 12 ||Gary Steven Robbat |- | MF || 16 ||Nurridzuan Abu Hassan || || |- | MF || 18 ||Syahrul Azwari Ibrahim |- | MF || 19 ||Muhamad Faizat Mohd Ghazli || || |- | MF || 8 ||Saiful Ridzuwan Selamat |- | FW || 9 ||Muhammad Syafiq Ahmad || || |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- | DF || 21 ||Nazirul Naim Che Hashim || || |- | DF || 24 ||Ariff Farhan Isa || || |- | DF || 5 ||Muhammad Syazwan Tajudin || || |- |colspan=3|Coach: |- |colspan=3| Ong Kim Swee |} |} {| width=50% style=\"font-size: 90%\" | Assistant referees: Ghulam Abbas (Kuwait) Ahmed Ferdous (Bangladesh) Fourth official: Hiroyuki Kimura (Japan) |} ==References== Group B ",
