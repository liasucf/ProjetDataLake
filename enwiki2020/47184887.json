    "text": "The 2003\u201304 NSW Premier League season was the fourth season of the revamped NSW Premier League. The Belconnen Blue Devils took out the minor premiership on 47 competition points, after having a superior goal difference over second placed St George Saints. However, the Devils lost two of three games in the finals series, including the grand final 2\u20130 to Bankstown City Lions. Thus, the Lions were the premiers for the 2003\u201304 NSW Premier League season. Throughout the season many Premier League, Super League, Division One and Division Two teams competed in a newly formed FA Cup-style knockout competition called the Continental Tyres Cup in which the Sydney Crescent Star were crowned champions after defeating Bonnyrigg White Eagles in a penalty shootout at Gabbie Stadium. ==Clubs== Teams promoted from Super League: (After the end of the 2003 season.) *Sydney Crescent Star Teams relegated to Super League: (After the end of the 2002\u201303 season.) * Fairfield Bulls {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:100%;\" !
