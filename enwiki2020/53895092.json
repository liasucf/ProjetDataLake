A prototype set, 8201, was built in 1984 based on the 3901 series set 3905. 11 sets were damaged during the 1995 Great Hanshin Earthquake; 15 cars spanning across all 11 sets were heavily damaged by the quakes and were scrapped. There were no sets with all six cars scrapped due to heavy damage by the quakes, and as such, the remaining cars from those sets were randomly inserted into various sets, with additional newly built cars. ===Refurbishment=== From 2002 to 2015, the entire fleet of 8000 series sets underwent a period of refurbishment. Changes included a new color scheme resembling that of later 9300 series cars, the replacements of longitudinal bench seats in some cars with transverse seating, LED headlights and LED destination boards. The first set to undergo refurbishment, 8211, was returned to service on 11 April 2002. The last set to undergo refurbishment, 8239, was returned to service in October 2015.
