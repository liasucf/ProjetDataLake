It was inaugurated in 1919 after a proposal by the celebrated aeronautics engineer Albert Caquot (1881\u20131976). == Description == Occupying over of land and hangars, it is one of the oldest aviation museums in the world. The museum's collection contains more than 19,595 items, including 150 aircraft, and material from as far back as the 16th Century. Also displayed are more modern air and spacecraft, including the prototype for Concorde, and Swiss and Soviet rockets. The museum also has the only known remaining piece \u2014 the jettisoned main landing gear \u2014 of the L'Oiseau Blanc (The White Bird), the 1927 aircraft which attempted to make the first Transatlantic crossing from Paris to New York. On May 8, 1927, Charles Nungesser and Fran\u00e7ois Coli aboard L'Oiseau blanc, a 450-hp Lorraine- powered Levasseur biplane took off from Le Bourget. The aircraft jettisoned its main landing gear (which is stored at the museum), which it was designed to do as part of its trans-Atlantic flight profile, but then disappeared over the Atlantic, only two weeks before Lindbergh's monoplane completed its successful non-stop trans-Atlantic flight to Le Bourget from the United States.
