    "text": "Belshazzar's Feast by Rembrandt, c. 1635 Belshazzar (6th century BC), son of the last king of the Neo-Babylonian empire, Nabonidus, has inspired many works of art and cultural allusions, often with a religious motif. While a historical figure, depictions and portrayals of him are most often based on his appearance in the biblical story of Belshazzar's feast in the Book of Daniel. This story is the origin of the idiomatic expression \"the writing is on the wall\". ==The writing is on the wall== In chapter 5 in the Book of Daniel, a hand writes Hebrew letters on a wall, which Daniel interprets as \"Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin\". These words mean that Belshazzar is doomed. The phrase \"The writing is on the wall\", or \"The writing on the wall\", has become a idiomatic expression referring to the foreshadowing of any impending doom, misfortune, or end. If \"the writing is on the wall\" something bad is about to happen. A person who does not or refuses to see \"the writing on the wall\" is being described as ignorant to the signs of a cataclysmic event that will likely occur in the near future. One of the earliest known uses of the phrase in English is in the writings of a Captain L. Brinckmair in 1638, during the Thirty Years' War. Brinckmair writes: \"Remarkable Prodigies..are in themselves like the writing on the Wall in Beshazzars Palace, which Sooth-sayers, Astrologians, and Chaldeans could neither understand nor reade\u2019.\" ==Music== George Frideric Handel wrote the oratorio Belshazzar in 1744 * The Play of Daniel (Ludus Danielis), believed to have been first performed in the 12th century, and written by students at the school of Beauvais Cathedral.
