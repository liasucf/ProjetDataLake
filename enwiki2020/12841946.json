    "text": "The Make-Up was a Washington, D.C. based band formed in 1995, consisting of Ian Svenonius, James Canty, Steve Gamboa, Michelle Mae, and for a brief period Alex Minoff. During the Make-Up's five years of activity, they released four studio albums, two live albums, a compilation of singles and B-sides, and a number of singles and splits. A posthumous live album was also released in 2006. The band was also the subject of the short film Blue is Beautiful by James Schneider, later repackaged as part of In Film/On Video in 2006. The Make-Up released records through many independent record labels, most notable among them were Dischord Records, K Records, Southern Records, and their own Black Gemini Records. On their many releases, the Make-Up recorded with producers including Brendan Canty, Calvin Johnson, Guy Picciotto, Royal Trux (\"Adam and Eve\"), John Loder, and Ian MacKaye. __TOC__ ==Albums== {|class=\"wikitable\" ! width=\"33\"| Year ! width=\"300\"| Title ! width=\"425\"| Notes |- |align=\"center\"| 1996 | Destination: Love - Live!
