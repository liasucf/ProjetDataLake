    "text": "The 2019 Humpty's Champions Cup was held from April 23 to 28 at the Merlis Belsher Place in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. It was the eighth and final Grand Slam event of the 2018\u201319 curling season. In the men's final, Brendan Bottcher defeated Kevin Koe 6\u20135 to win his 3rd career Grand Slam. In the women's final, Silvana Tirinzoni defeated Kerri Einarson 6\u20133 to win her 2nd career Slam. ==No tick zone== The 2019 Champions Cup tested a new rule, where tick shots were disallowed in the 8th and extra ends. Any rock that touches the centre line in those ends was not allowed to be moved by an opposing rock until after the fifth rock of the end had been played. This rule had previously been used in the defunct Elite 10 Grand Slam event. ==Qualification== The champions of thirteen Grand Slam, national or regional championships, and world championship events are invited to the Champions Cup. The champions of two World Curling Tour events, based on the strength of field, are also invited. If a team qualifies from more than one event or declines the invitation, champions of World Curling Tour events with the highest strength of field are invited until the field of 15 teams is completed. ===Men=== {| class=wikitable !
