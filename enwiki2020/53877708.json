    "text": "Tono Maria also known as the \u201cVenus of South America\u201d was another woman, similar to Sarah Baartman\u2019s case, that was exhibited in the \u201cLondon shows\u201d or freak shows in the 1800s. Tono Maria, a Botocudo (derived from the Portuguese word, botoque for plug) woman from the South American region (now the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais) was known for her scars, social codes that signified her sexual transgressions, her full figure and large lip and ear plugs. Tono Maria\u2019s features fascinated the London spectators and further fueled their studies in scientific racism and western superiority. ==Life== Tono Maria was displayed in a London freak show, and described in an 1822 article called the \u201cSketches of Society: The Shows of London\u201d as the Venus of South America whose \u201ccharms are reputed to have been irresistible in her native land in which she made conquest of no fewer than three chieftains in succession.\" She is described at the time as being \"about forty years of age\".Sketches of Society: The Shows of London.\u201d The London Literary Gazette and Journal of the Belle Lettres, 1822. pg 123. Accessed April 14, 2017. https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435059865105;view=1up;seq=131 == Symbolism == Author Janell Hobson briefly recounts Tono Maria in her memoir, Venus in the Dark, and describes how the London spectators viewed her nearly 100 scars, each supposedly representing a sexual transgression committed in her own tribe, as a social stigma, a mark of excess sexuality representing how nonwhites were \"openly licentious, debauched, and depraved\u201d in comparison with European white women who were considered \u201cpure\u201d and \u201crefined\u201d.Janell Hobson. Venus in the Dark: Blackness and Beauty in Popular Culture. Routledge. Taylor & Francis Group. pg 46. 2005. Accessed April 15, 2017. Author Rosemarie Garland Thompson mentions Tono Maria in her book, Extraordinary Bodies, as a spectacle that \u201cconfirmed the Englishman\u2019s sense of physical mastery\u201d and was seen as a cautionary tale of female sexual appetite.Rosemarie Garland Thompson.
