    "text": "Pure Instinct is the thirteenth studio album by the German hard rock band Scorpions, released in 1996. Reviewers criticized the album for having too many ballads and not enough hard rock or even rock. The cover art for this album, as with several earlier Scorpions albums, was replaced with an alternative cover for some releases due to the nudity on the original cover. This is the only Scorpions album on which session musician Curt Cress plays drums. The album has more ballads than non-ballads. The song \"You and I\" gained some popularity and was often played in Scorpions concerts. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;Scorpions *Klaus Meine \u2013 lead vocals *Rudolf Schenker \u2013 rhythm guitars, backing vocals *Matthias Jabs \u2013 lead guitars, backing vocals *Ralph Rieckermann \u2013 bass, backing vocals *Curt Cress \u2013 drums, percussion ;Additional musicians *Pitti Hecht - percussion *Luke Herzog, Koen van Bael - keyboards ;Production *Erwin Musper \u2013 producer, engineer, mixing *Keith Olsen \u2013 producer of tracks 1 and 7 *Evelien Tjebbes, Attie Bauw, Peter Kirkman \u2013 assistant engineers *George Marino \u2013 mastering at Sterling Sound, New York ==Charts== ===Album=== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"330px\" !align=\"center\"|Year !align=\"center\"|Chart !align=\"center\"|Position |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"10\"|1996 |align=\"center\"|German Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|8 |- |align=\"center\"|Finnish Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|10 |- |align=\"center\"|French Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|11 |- |align=\"center\"|Swiss Albums Top 100 |align=\"center\"|15 |- |align=\"center\"|Austrian Top 40 Albums |align=\"center\"|20 |- |align=\"center\"|Oricon Japanese Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|28 |- |align=\"center\"|Belgian Ultratop (Wallonia) |align=\"center\"|37 |- |align=\"center\"|Swedish Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|38 |- |align=\"center\"|Dutch MegaCharts |align=\"center\"|95 |- |align=\"center\"|Billboard 200 (US) |align=\"center\"|99 |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"550px\" !align=\"center\"|Year !align=\"center\"|Title !align=\"center\"|Chart !align=\"center\"|Position |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"8\"|1996 |align=\"center\"|\"Wild Child\" |align=\"center\"|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks (US) |align=\"center\"|19 |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"5\"|\"You and I\" |align=\"center\"|German Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|22 |- |align=\"center\"|Swiss Singles Top 75 |align=\"center\"|23 |- |align=\"center\"|French Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|23 |- |align=\"center\"|Austria Top 40 Singles |align=\"center\"|34 |- |align=\"center\"|Swedish Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|37 |- |align=\"center\"|\"Does Anyone Know\" |align=\"center\"|German Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|81 |- |align=\"center\"|\"When You Came into My Life\" |align=\"center\"|German Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|97 |- |align=\"center\" rowspan=\"1\"|1997 |align=\"center\"|\"Where The River Flows\" |align=\"center\"|German Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|97 |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !scope=\"column\"|Chart (1996) !scope=\"column\"|Position |- |align=\"left\"|German Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|55 |} == Certifications == {| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font- size: 95%;\" |- |Country |Organization |Year |Sales |- |Germany |BVMI |1996 |Gold (+ 250,000) |- |France |SNEP |1996 |Gold (+ 100,000) |- |Finland |IFPI Finland |1996 |Gold (+ 25,000) |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Official album page * \"You and I\" video * \"When You Came into My Life\" video Category:1996 albums Category:Scorpions (band) albums Category:Atlantic Records albums Category:East West Records albums ",
