    "text": "Anabalaya Films is an Indian film production and distribution company headed by K. Prabhakaran. The film had been a leading production studio in the Tamil film industry in the 1990s, but has struggled following the switch to digital film-making. == History == The studio is led by K. Prabhakaran, who later adapted the stagename of Anbalaya Prabhakaran. In the 1990s, the studio garnered a niche specialism for making small budget Tamil films with upcoming directors. Some of the directors that the studio introduced includes Agathiyan and Prabhu Solomon. Apart from producing, Prabhakaran also acted in his productions mostly portraying negative roles. In the early 2000s, Prabhakaran signed on Arjun to work on a film for the studio. The duo initially planned to team up for a film titled Chanakya to be directed by Shaji Kailas, but later dropped the plan, and subsequently Arjun directed and starred in Parasuram (2003). In 2007, the studio made a comeback by producing the low-budget college drama Pazhaniappa Kalloori starring Naveen Chandra, Madhu Shalini and Akshaya Rao in the lead roles. The film took a small opening and went unnoticed at the box office. Following the slowdown of the studio's market share and work, Prabhakaran began working as an actor and appeared in minor supporting roles. He also became actively involved in the Tamil Film Producers Council. == Filmography == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"width: 82%; text-align: center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Language ! scope=\"col\" | Director ! scope=\"col\" | Cast ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Synopsis ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" |Pattikaatu Thambi | 1988 | Tamil | | Arjun, Nirosha, Sabitha Anand | | |- ! scope=\"row\" |Yogam Rajayogam | 1989 | Tamil | T.
