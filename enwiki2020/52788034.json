In 1804 he became a professor of Greek literature at the University of Kiel, then in 1818 relocated to the University of Bonn as a professor of classical philology. At Bonn, he served as director of the philological seminar.Karl Felix Halm: ADB:Heinrich, Karl Friedrich In: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie (ADB).
