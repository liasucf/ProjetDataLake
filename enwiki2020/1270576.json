    "text": "Oblique view from Apollo 15 Panoramic Camera Feuill\u00e9e is a small lunar impact crater in the eastern part of the Mare Imbrium. It was named after French natural scientist Louis Feuill\u00e9e. It lies less than a half crater diameter to the northwest of Beer, and the two formations form a nearly matched pair. To the west is the small but prominent crater Timocharis. Like Beer, Feuill\u00e9e is a circular, bowl-shaped formation with a small interior floor at the midpoint of the sloping inner walls. This sharp-edged crater is not notably worn or eroded, and lacks any distinguishing features. It does, however, lie across a wrinkle ridge in the surface of the lunar mare, a feature that is best observed under oblique lighting conditions when the crater is near the terminator. The crater name is incorrectly spelled Feuillet on some lunar charts. ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== * Beer Lunar Topographic Orthophotomap, LTO41A4, May 1974 Category:Impact craters on the Moon Category:Mare Imbrium ",
