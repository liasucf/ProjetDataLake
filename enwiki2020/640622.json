A 1999 coup led to Azali Assoumani taking power. A new constitution was introduced in 2001, decentralising power by granting autonomy to the three islands. Azali subsequently won presidential elections in 2002, which were boycotted by the opposition. ==Electoral system== At the time of the elections, only 18 of the 33 members of the Assembly of the Union were directly elected in single-member constituencies. The remaining 15 were chosen by the legislatures of the three islands, Anjouan, Moh\u00e9li and Grande Comore, with each island electing five members. The direct elections were held in 18 single-member constituencies using the two-round system. ==Campaign== In 2004 there was only one national political party, the Convention for the Renewal of the Comoros led by Assoumani, which favoured more centralised government. Prior to the elections a loose coalition, the Camp of the Autonomous Islands, was formed by opposition groups organised by the presidents of the three islands. ==Results== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right !rowspan=2|Party !colspan=3|First round !colspan=3|Second round !rowspan=2|Total seats !rowspan=2|+/\u2013 |- !Votes !% !Seats !Votes !% !Seats |- |align=left|Camp of the Autonomous Islands|| || ||8|| || ||4||12||New |- |align=left|Convention for the Renewal of the Comoros|| || ||2|| || ||4||6||New |- |align=left|Indirectly-elected members||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||15||\u2013 |- |align=left|Invalid/blank votes|| ||\u2013||\u2013|| ||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left|Total|| || ||10|| || ||8||33||\u201310 |- |align=left|Registered voters/turnout|| || ||\u2013|| || ||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left colspan=9|Source: IPU |} All fifteen of the indirectly-elected seats were won by the Camp of the Autonomous Islands.Tom Lansford (2015) Political Handbook of the World 2015, CQ Press ==References== 2004 Category:2004 elections in Africa Legislative election 2004 ",
