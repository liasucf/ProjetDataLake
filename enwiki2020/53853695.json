He graduated from Mark T. Sheehan High School in 1983 and Quinnipiac University in 1997 with a degree in Marketing, and from Quinnipiac University School of Law in 2001.

Fishbein is a founding member of the Connecticut General Assembly Conservative Caucus and is currently its Vice-Chairman. On May 30, 2020, Fishbein retweeted an image of Joe Biden with the caption, \"If you aren't setting fire to buildings...then you ain't black.\" Fishbein said in an apology that he didn't \"know the extent of what was going on\" and eventually removed the tweet on Monday, June 1, following criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. On Tuesday, June 2, the Wallingford Town Council voted unanimously to censure Fishbein, calling the retweet \"backwards and unsophisticated\". == Electoral history == {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"4\" |Connecticut House of Representatives 90th District (Special) Election, 2016 |- |Party |Candidate |Votes |% |- |Republican* | Craig C.
