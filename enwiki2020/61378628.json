    "text": "Change 21 () is a parliamentary group for the congressional term of 2016 to 2021 in the Congress of Peru. The group was introduced on March 20, 2018, led by then-congressman Kenji Fujimori, and was formally recognized on December 19 of the same year by the President of Congress Daniel Salaverry. Its members are former members of Popular Force. == History == On December 21, 2017, proposals to impeach President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski reached the floor of Congress. Ultimately, the proposal to impeach the president failed as 10 members of the majority opposition party Popular Force voted against removing Kuczynski from the presidency. On December 31, 2017, the party's Disciplinary Committee recommended dismissing the ten members from Popular Force. On March 1, 2018, following dismissal from the party, Kenji Fujimori resigned leadership of the Fujimorist faction, changing moving towards a more progressive and liberal agenda. Later in January, Fujimori informally nicknamed his group as the Avengers, a reference to the fictional film Avengers: Infinity War. On March 20, the informal group announced the creation of the political faction Cambio 21 with plans to become an official political party with the incarcerated former president Alberto Fujimori as leader. On December 19, the President of Congress Daniel Salaverry formally recognized the faction. == Congressional members == Current congressional members of Change 21 are former members of Popular Force: Estelita Bustos, Maritza Garc\u00eda, Clayton Galv\u00e1n, Marvin Palma, Luis Yika, Yesenia Ponce, Roberto Vieira and Lizbeth Robles. Guillermo Boc\u00e1ngel, Bienvenido Ram\u00edrez and Kenji Fujimori were suspended from Congress before the formal recognition of Change 21 as a congressional faction. == References == Category:Political parties established in 2018 Category:Progressive parties Category:Political parties in Peru Category:Parliamentary groups Category:Peru Category:Peru politics stubs Category:Fujimorism ",
