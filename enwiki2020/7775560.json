After Kuybyshev Krai was itself transformed into Kuybyshev Oblast, the Mordovian ASSR was separated from it and subordinated directly to the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. On December 7, 1990, the Mordovian ASSR adopted the Declaration on the legal status of the Republic of Mordovia, which changed the status of the republic from ASSR to an SSR. In 1990, shortly before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the republic became the Republic of Mordovia. In its present form, the republic has existed since January 25, 1994.http://www.roslenta.ru/page_pid_24_region_43.htm ==See also== *Mordovia in the Soviet Union *First Secretary of the Mordovian Communist Party ==References== Category:Autonomous republics of the Soviet Union Category:States and territories established in 1934 ",
