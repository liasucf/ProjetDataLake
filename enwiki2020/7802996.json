When the latter died without heirs in the October 1597, Cesare inherited the duchy. The legitimacy of the succession was recognised by the Emperor Rudolph II but not by Pope Clement VIII: thus, as Ferrara was nominally a Papal fief, the city was returned to the Papal States, despite the attempts of the young duke, who sought help from the major powers to no avail.. The capital was therefore moved to Modena, which he entered on 30 January 1598. His first years were troublesome: he had to face the quarrels between the Modenese and Ferrarese nobles who had come with him, the attempt at independence of Maro Pio of Sassuolo, and a war against Lucca for the possession of Garfagnana. == Marriage and issue == On 30 January 1586, he married Virginia de' Medici, daughter of Cosimo I de' Medici, who suffered increasing symptoms of madness until her death in 1615. He was succeeded by his son, Alfonso. * Giulia d'Este (1588-1645) died unmarried; * Alfonso III d'Este, Duke of Modena (1591-1644), father of Francesco I d'Este, Duke of Modena; * Laura d'Este (1594-1630) married Alessandro I Pico, Duke of Mirandola and had issue; * Luigi d'Este, Lord of Montecchio and Scandiano (1593/1594-1664), had issue; * Caterina d'Este (1595-1618) died unmarried; * Ippolito d'Este (1599-1647) died unmarried; * Niccolo d'Este (1601-1640) married Sveva d'Avalos, no issue; * Borso d'Este (1605-1657) married Ippolita d'Este (daughter of his brother Luigi) and had issue (including Maria Angela Caterina d'Este); * Foresto d'Este (1606-1639/1640); * Angela Caterina d'Este (died 1651), died unmarried, nun |- ==External links== *Il Castello Estense: genealogical tree Category:1562 births Category:1628 deaths Category:People from Ferrara Cesare Cesare Cesare Category:16th-century Italian nobility Category:17th-century Italian people Category:Burials at the Corpus Domini Monastery, Ferrara ",
