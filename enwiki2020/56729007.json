The journalist Daniela Heunis of Rhodes University described him as follows, after an in-depth interview and research :\" He represented South African society before the 1994 elections. He was well loved and was not a racist. De Villiers's music forms showed such a unity with the poetry that it had the character of folk songs. De Villiers exclusively composed music for texts in Afrikaans, which made him inaccessible to most foreigners except speakers of Dutch. He obtained unity between music and the text by internalizing the text before composing. He then let the music be heard through the words. When he started composing, he realized that the Afrikaans songs sung at the time were inaccessible to the man in the street, and he wanted to change that Quoting from Arthur Honegger, he said: \"My inclination and my effort have always been to write music which would be comprehensible to the great massive listeners and at the same time sufficiently free of banality to interest genuine music lovers\u201d. His outlook was to be honest with oneself. He said \u201cone can only compose what one is, otherwise it will be fictitious.' This also contributed to his selection of the texts he used. Before he began composing, he would recite the poem to himself, to find the rhythm of the words and the main stresses in the verse. He then acquainted himself with the vowel sounds. He tried to understand the purpose and meaning of the words in the music. He is recognized as having composed songs with character. The text with the singable melodies of his songs made them cultural possessions. An example is his settings of the Boerneef poems \"Aandblom is 'n witblom\", \"Doer boe teen die rant\", etc. == Death == He died at his home in Stellenbosch on 18 May 2015. == References == * * * Category:20th-century classical musicians Category:1924 births Category:2015 deaths Category:South African musicians ",
