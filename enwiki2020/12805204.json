It consists of four operational reactors; a fifth unit is still under construction. Owner and operator of the nuclear power station is Rosenergoatom. Balakovo NPP participates in a twinning program between nuclear power stations in Europe and Russia; since 1990 it has been in partnership with Biblis Nuclear Power Plant. == Reactor data == The Balakovo Nuclear Power Plant has four operating units: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

This had been demonstrated on unit 1. ==Gallery== File:BalNPP m st.jpg|Interior View File:BalNPP m st2.jpg|Steam Turbine Maintenance File:BalNPPcons2.jpg|Reactor under Construction File:BalakovoNPP bv.jpg|Aerial View File:BalakovoNPP sw.jpg|Distribution Station File:BalakovoNPP CR.jpg|Control Room File:BalNPPhist2.jpg|Steam Generator Transport File:Balakovo NPP u 5 6.jpg|Unit 5 Construction ==Incidents== On 27 June 1985 during startup of the first reactor unit, a human error (later attributed to inexperience and haste) unexpectedly opened a pressurizer relief valve, and steam entered the staff work area. Fourteen people were killed. This event is cited as one of the predecessors of the Chernobyl disaster.Medvedev, Grigory. \"The Truth About Chernobyl\", I.
