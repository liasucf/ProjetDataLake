Her love for musical theatre started at an early age when her parents would go to New York City on vacation, bringing home cast recordings for Padgett as souvineres. She took part in her high school theatre program, being cast as Maria in West Side Story at sixteen, a role she \"had no business playing.\" Eager to work and get out of North Carolina, Padgett enrolled in the two year program at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in New York City, as opposed to a traditional four year program. Following graduation, Padgett quickly booked the role of Demeter in the non-Equity national tour cast of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats in 2005. She departed the tour after a year, and started attending open calls in the city while balancing odd jobs. Padgett danced at bar mitzvahs and entertained at children's birthday parties as Nemo from Disney's Finding Nemo. In 2007, she made her Broadway debut in Grease in the ensemble, and as a swing, understudying Sandy, Patty, and Cha-Cha. In 2008, Padgett departed the production and joined the cast of Legally Blonde, as Cece/District Attorney, and understudying Shandi/Brooke, Margot, and Pilar. After Legally Blonde closed, Padgett was offered the role of Sandy in the first national tour company of Grease. She played the role for a year.http://www.newyorktheatreguide.com/questionsandanswers/emilypadgett.htm ===2009-2013: Rock of Ages and Flashdance=== In 2009, Padgett was cast as Waitress #1, and understudied Kerry Butler's role in the rock musical Rock of Ages on Broadway.
