Thanks to Carlo Aquino's earnest portrayal, you will care for what happens to Primo's character. There were some nice touches, like the wrist tattoos which change with each change in Primo's situation.\" Hawson also praised the director of the film and stated, \"I [re]commend director Joseph Teoxon for his audacious choice of a complex time-themed sci-fi love story (by Pertee Brinas) for a debut feature, and pulling it off satisfactorily despite obvious technical limitations.\" Ace Antipolo on his blog website Movies for Millennials, gave the film 5 out of 5 stars and comparing the film to 2004's science fiction psychological thriller The Butterfly Effect starring Ashton Kutcher. He also stated that, \"Though the two films have a similar premise, Throwback Today has more heart. It's more lighter in tone and thus, far more enjoyable than the other one. Although the concept of changing your past isn't new anymore as we have seen a lot of films recycling the same concept over and over again, this sci-fi entry stands out with its fun and entertaining execution.\" Antipolo also praised Carlo Aquino's performance to the film. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2017 films Category:Philippine films Category:Philippine science fiction films Category:2010s science fiction comedy-drama films Category:2017 comedy films Category:Philippine comedy-drama films Category:Films about time travel Category:2017 drama films ",
