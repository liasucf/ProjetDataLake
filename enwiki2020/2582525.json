    "text": "Bedfordale is a semi-rural suburb in the south-east of Perth, Western Australia, located within the City of Armadale. Located approximately 40 km from Perth in the Darling Range, some of the local attractions include Churchman Brook Dam, Wungong Dam and the Elizabethan Pub. The area is popular for hiking and cycling. Being close to Armadale railway station provides easy access to the city by train. It was first named as a townsite in 1905. The area is named after Admiral Sir Frederick Denham Bedford (1838-1913), Governor of Western Australia from 24 March 1903 to 22 April 1909. Governor Bedford chose some of the older street names to commemorate several famous Admirals. The town hosts the Elizabethan Village which has full size replicas of Anne Hathaway's cottage and Shakespeare's Birthplace, built by British engineer Leo Fowler in the 1970s. ==References== Category:Suburbs of Perth, Western Australia Category:Darling Range Category:Suburbs in the City of Armadale ",
