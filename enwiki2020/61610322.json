It features various viral videos from the Internet, usually involving failed do-it-yourself attempts at stunts, to which Wojciech and his panelists add mock commentary. The Polish Ridiculousness producers, as well as the show's network, MTV, do not accept viewer submissions and air a disclaimer before and after each episode warning that, because of the dangerous nature of the stunts being shown, any attempts to submit a video to the show will be discarded sight unseen. This is the Polish spin-off of the American show Ridiculousness. == Production == On August 2016, MTV Poland confirmed a new show Niemo\u017cliwe Made in Poland which premiered on September 11, 2016.
