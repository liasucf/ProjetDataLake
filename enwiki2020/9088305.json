    "text": "Dean Burk (March 21, 1904 \u2013 October 6, 1988) was an American biochemist, medical researcher, and a cancer researcher at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and the National Cancer Institute. In 1934, he developed the Lineweaver\u2013Burk plot together with Hans Lineweaver.. Lineweaver and Burk collaborated with the eminent statistician W. Edwards Deming on the statistical analysis of their data: they used the plot for illustrating the results, not for the analysis itself. Dean was the second of four sons born to Frederic Burk, the founder of the San Francisco Normal School, a preparatory school for teachers which eventually became San Francisco State University. He entered the University of California at Davis at the age of 15. A year later, he transferred to the University of California at Berkeley, where he received his B.S. in Entomology in 1923. Four years later he earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry. ==Professional career== Burk joined the Department of Agriculture in 1929 working in the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory. In 1939, he joined the Cancer Institute as a senior chemist. He was head of the cytochemistry laboratory when he retired in 1974. He also taught biochemistry at the Cornell University medical school from 1939 to 1941. He was a research master at George Washington University. Burk was a close friend and co-author with Otto Heinrich Warburg.Weiterentwicklung der zellphysiologischen Methoden: angewandt auf Krebs, Photosynthese und Wirkungsweise der R\u00f6ntgenstrahlung: Arbeiten aus den Jahren 1945\u20131961, (Thieme, Stuttgart 1962) (Trans: Further Developments of Methods in Cellular Physiology applied to Cancer, Photosynthesis and the Effects of X-ray Radiation) Texts in German and English. He was a co-developer of the prototype of the Magnetic Resonance Scanner.I Weisman, L. Bennett, L. Maxwell Sr., M. Woods, and D. Burk (1972)\"Recognition of Cancer in vivo by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance\", Science 178, 1288 \u2013 1290. Burk published more than 250 scientific articles in his lifetime.Burk D, Schade AL. On respiratory impairment in cancer cells. Science. 1956 Aug 10;124(3215):270-2. He later became head of the National Cancer Institute's Cytochemistry Sector in 1938, although he is often mistaken as leading the entire facility. ==Retirement== After retiring from the NCI in 1974, Dean Burk remained active. He devoted himself to his opposition to water fluoridation.J Yiamouyiannis, D Burk \"Fluoridation and cancer, age-dependence of cancer mortality related to artificial fluoridation\" Fluoride 1977.Consummer Health Articles: FLUORIDATION He and a coauthor published an analysis of cancer mortality in 10 cities that fluoridated the drinking water supply and 10 that didn't. The paper was criticized for using overly broad grouping and making assumptions about variations in racial composition of cities. Epidemiologists from the National Cancer Institute analyzed the and found no significant increase in cancer mortality associated with fluoridation. According to Burk \"fluoridation is a form of public mass murder.\"619 F. 2d 932 \u2013 Yiamouyiannis v. Consumers Union of United States Inc Dean Burk argued on Dutch television against a water fluoridation proposal which was before the Dutch Parliament in the Netherlands. He also was an avid supporter of laetrile; a cancer treatment now regarded by the medical establishment as ineffective and potentially dangerous.Burk, D. (1970). Laetrile and Cancer. Science News. ==Recognition== For his work on photosynthesis, Dean Burk received the Hillebrand Prize in 1952. Dean Burk and Otto Heinrich Warburg discovered the photosynthesis I-quantum reaction that splits CO2 activated by respiration.Otto Warburg - Biography - Nobelprize.org For his techniques to distinguish between normal cells and those damaged by cancer, Dean Burk was awarded the Gerhard Domagk Prize in 1965. ==References== Category:1904 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Cancer researchers Category:American biochemists Category:University of California, Davis alumni Category:Water fluoridation ",
