His name is first documented in 1499 as being a chaplain and school rector in Vadstena. He was ordained a priest as a Bridgettine monk in Vadstena Abbey. In 1507 he went to Rome to seek permission to rebuild the Santa Brigida convent and church, which had been left falling apart. After three years M\u00e5nsson's efforts managed to restore the building and in 1513 founded a church on the site and transferred the ownership to Vadstena Abbey. M\u00e5nsson remained in Rome and became director of the monastery in Rome. M\u00e5nsson was appointed Bishop of V\u00e4ster\u00e5s in 1524 by Pope Clement VII.\"P\u00e5ven Clemens VII utn\u00e4mner Peder M\u00e5nsson (Petrus Magni) till biskop i V\u00e4ster\u00e5s.\", Riksarkivet.

Through M\u00e5nsson's consecration, the apostolic succession was retained in the Church of Sweden when he consecrated the Archbishop of Uppsala Laurentius Petri, the first Lutheran archbishop. Nevertheless, Peder was an opponent of the Protestant Reformation. He retained his post in V\u00e4ster\u00e5s till his death on May 17, 1534. ==References== Category:1534 deaths Category:Bishops of V\u00e4ster\u00e5s Category:16th-century Swedish people Category:Year of birth missing ",
