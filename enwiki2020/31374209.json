Murle Lindstrom, age 23, won the title for her first LPGA Tour victory, two strokes ahead of runners-up Ruth Jessen and Jo Ann Prentice. The first of her four wins on tour, it was the only major title for Lindstrom, later known as Murle Breer. Defending champion Mickey Wright was a co-leader after 36 holes, but fell back on Saturday morning in the third round and finished five strokes back in a tie for fourth. Wright had won three of the previous four years; she won her fourth U.S. Women's Open two years later in 1964. Jessen led after each of the first three rounds, but a final round 80 (+8) dropped her back. Thirty professionals and eleven amateurs made the 36-hole cut at 166 (+22) or better; the low amateur was JoAnne Gunderson at 313 (+25), tied for fifteenth place. ==Past champions in the field== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" !Player || Country || Year(s) won || R1 || R2 || R3 || R4 || Total || To par || Finish |- | align=left|Louise Suggs || align=left| || 1949, 1952 || 80 || 77 || 74 || 75 || 306 || +18 || T4 |- | align=left|Mickey Wright || align=left| || 1958, 1959, 1961 || 75 || 73 || 81 || 77 || 306 || +18 || T4 |- | align=left|Patty Berg || align=left| || 1946 || 85 || 75 || 75 || 77 || 312 || +24 || T13 |- | align=left|Kathy Cornelius || align=left| || 1956 || 79 || 79 || 78 || 76 || 312 || +24 || T13 |- | align=left|Betsy Rawls || align=left| || 1951, 1953, 1957, 1960 || 86 || 74 || 80 || 79 || 319 || +31 || T21 |- | align=left|Betty Jameson || align=left| || 1947 || 79 || 83 || 82 || 83 || 327 || +39 || T32 |} Source: ==Final leaderboard== Saturday, June 30, 1962 {| class=\"wikitable\" !
