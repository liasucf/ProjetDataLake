The abbey gave rise to the village of Assen (which was not a town until the 19th century). It was devastated by a fire in 1418. In 1460 it joined the Trinitarian Order. The community ceased to exist during the Protestant Reformation, around 1596; its formal dissolution took place in 1602. In 1601 the church tower collapsed, and badly damaged the church, which was rebuilt in 1662: of the mediaeval structure only the south wall remained. In 1848 the church was sold to the municipality, which used it as a community centre. Since 1982 it has been used as part of the Drents Museum. == Bibliography == * Anselme Dimier and Ernst Coester: Mittelalterliche Frauenabteien in Frankreich und Benelux.
