    "text": "The Temple of Flux going up in flames The Temple of Flux was a large temporary art project created by The Flux Foundation for Burning Man 2010. The Temple was the tenth built at the festival and one of the largest. Built of white- washed wood, the design was notable for being highly abstract in nature, consisting of 5 landforms that described cave and canyon-like spaces (a reflection on the festival's theme of \"Metropolis\"). The piece was approximately 100'x200'x40'. Designed by Jess Hobbs, Rebecca Anders and PK (Peter Kimelman) it was built by a crew of 300 over a period of 4 months. The project was assembled in 2 weeks in the Black Rock Desert by a team of that approached 150 people. The sculpture stood for 10 days and then was burned in a performance at the festival's conclusion. Reported costs vary from $160,000 to $180,000. ==References== Category:Public art in the United States Category:Burning Man ",
