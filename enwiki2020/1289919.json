    "text": "James Lillywhite (23 February 1842 \u2013 25 October 1929) was an English Test cricketer and an umpire. He was the first ever captain of the English cricket team in a Test match, captaining two Tests against Australia in 1876\u201377, losing the first, but winning the second. Lillywhite was born in Westhampnett in Sussex, the son of a brickmaker, John Lillywhite. In the 1861 census the 19 year old James' profession is given as Tile Maker. He was the nephew of William Lillywhite, and so cousin to William's sons, James Lillywhite senior, John, Fred and Harry. Lillywhite is termed \"junior\" in sources to differentiate between him and his cousin James senior. He became a professional cricketer, and played first-class cricket for Sussex from 1862 and 1883. He played one final first-class match in 1885. Before the pre-Ashes Test-playing tour to Australia in 1876\u201377, Lillywhite also joined tours to North America in 1868 in a team led by Edgar Willsher, to Australia in 1873\u201374 in a team led by W.G. Grace. He also joined three further tours to Australia in teams led by Alfred Shaw, in 1881\u201382, 1884\u201385 and 1886\u201387. ==Test cricket== James Lillywhite and Dave Gregory were the 1st ever Test Captains. Neither were great with the bat. Of the 2 James top scored in the 1st Test scoring 10 in the 1st Innings on 17-Mar and scored 4 in the 2nd Innings on 19 March. James, having lost the toss, had his side put into bat which meant that James was the 1st ever Test player as he led out his England side. He was 35 years 20 days old. As his team followed him out he was passed by England No: 1 Harry Jupp and England No: 8 Tom Emmett who were both 35 years old but older than James Lillywhite. He stood as a first-class umpire between 1883 and 1901, including six Test matches. He umpired all four Test matches between Australia and England in the 1881\u201382 season (being partnered by John Swift in three matches and George Coulthard in the other). He was one of the organisers of Arthur Shrewsbury's team to Australia in 1884\u201385 but, in spite of his experience, the Australian captain Billy Murdoch refused to allow him to umpire the first ever Test match at Adelaide. However, along with Ted Elliott, he umpired in the second Test of that series, when the entire Australian team refused to play unless they received fifty per cent of gate takings. Nine new faces appeared for Australia, and were soundly beaten. Lillywhite's other match as umpire was the drawn fourth Test between England and Australia at Old Trafford in 1899. He died in Chichester, the last English survivor of the first Test match. ==See also== *History of Test cricket (to 1883) *History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) *History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) *Australian Test Cricket Umpires *List of Test umpires ==References== ==External links== * *Cricinfo page on James Lillywhite *CricketArchive page on James Lillywhite *Profile from CricketArchive Category:1842 births Category:1929 deaths Category:English Test cricket umpires Category:England Test cricket captains Category:Sussex cricketers Category:United South of England Eleven cricketers Category:People from Chichester District Category:North of the Thames v South of the Thames cricketers Category:Players cricketers Category:Cricketers who have taken ten wickets in an innings Category:English cricketers Category:Players of the South cricketers Category:Married v Single cricketers Category:Left-Handed v Right-Handed cricketers Category:North v South cricketers Category:W.
