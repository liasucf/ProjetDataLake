The top 9 in each kayak event (including the host nation, Peru) will qualify along with the top 8 in each canoe event.

One wild card spot will also be allocated A further 5 spots will be available for each extreme event. All athletes qualified in slalom can compete in the extreme events. At the end of qualification, one spot in kayak women, women's extreme kayak and men's canoe slalom along with the wild card quota (for a total of four quotas) were not used. ===Qualification table=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=170|Event!! width=120|K1 Men !! width=120|C1 Men !! width=120|K1 Women !! width=120|C1 Women!! width=120|Extreme K1 Men !! width=130|Extreme K1 Women |- | || ' || ' ' || ' || ' || || |- !

Countries are listed in alphabetical order. *Note: Total quotas awarded were 40 (9 in men's kayak, 7 in men's canoe, 8 in both women's kayak and canoe, 5 in men's extreme and 4 in women's kayak). The total numbers above reflect double starters. *Other countries may double up until the conclusion of entries. ==Sprint== A total of 125 quotas were distributed. An athlete can only qualify one boat for their country. In each discipline the competitions will start with the larger boats and work their way down till the last event. In the second event and onward (if applicable) for each discipline, places can only be qualified by athletes that have not already qualified. Countries qualified in the largest boat per discipline/gender are required to compete in the smaller boats as well (even if they do not qualify additional athletes). This is summarized per event below. There will be 5 wild card spots handed out to countries that failed to qualify, but competed at the qualification tournament. An athlete qualifying in event can compete in another event, as long as no other boat from their country is competing. Only one country did not qualify: Jamaica. They will be awarded with a wild card slot in the event their athlete competed. The other four wild card spots will be reallocated. The USA qualified one more athlete then the maximum allowed in men's kayak. That spot will be reallocated. In both canoe disciplines, both filled their quotas. In women's kayak 11 quota spots need to be reallocated. Argentina qualified an extra slot in kayak (11 in total) which will need to be reallocated, leaving a total of 17 spots to be reallocated. Three nations: Dominican Republic, Venezuela and host nation Peru received reallocated quotas even though they did not compete at the qualifiers. ===Men's K4 500m=== {|class=\"wikitable\" width=550 |- !
