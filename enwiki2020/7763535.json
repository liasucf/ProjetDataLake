    "text": "San Francisco de B\u00e1nica, or simply B\u00e1nica, is a municipality of the El\u00edas Pi\u00f1a province, on the border with Haiti and near the Artibonite river. The name B\u00e1nica comes from the Ta\u00edno name of the region, Banique (\"land of ebony\"). ==History== The town was founded in 1504 by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, who later went to conquest the island of Cuba, on the left side of the River Artibonite. It was an important town in those years but later it lost its importance. In the 18th century, the Spanish government moved the city to its present place, away from the river, and brought families from the Canary Islands to live there. During the Haitian Revolution, many people fled to other places. When the Haitians occupied the eastern part of the island (the present Dominican Republic), they administered the town as part of the Department of Artibonite. After the Independence in 1844, the town was elevated by the Dominican government to the category of municipality of the Azua province. But again the town was abandoned by its inhabitants. After the \"Restoration War\" (1863\u20131865), some families from other towns close to the Haitian border came to live in B\u00e1nica. B\u00e1nica was the first place where Dominican President Rafael Trujillo implemented his campaign against the Haitians, later known as the Parsley Massacre. B\u00e1nica was made a municipality of the San Juan province in 1938 and then, in 1942, of the new province of El\u00edas Pi\u00f1a. ==Economy== The main economic activity of the municipality is agriculture. Commerce with Haiti is also an important economic activity in the city. ==Places of interest== # Iglesia de San Francisco de As\u00eds (Saint Francis of Assisi Church). It is a very interesting colonial Catholic church. It is not known when it was built but in 1740 the Bishop Domingo Pantale\u00f3n \u00c1lvarez Abr\u00e9u wrote that in B\u00e1nica \"there is a new church\". # Reloj de sol (Sundial). In one of his faces there is date, 1795, that could be the date when it was built. There were only two sundials in the old Spanish colony: one in Santo Domingo and another in B\u00e1nica. # Cerro de San Francisco (Saint Francis Hill). It is a rocky hill at 1.5 km from the city. Here there is a cave visited by many people to pray to Saint Francis; they get wet with water that falls from the top of the cave and they put limestone dust in their faces so when they get back to town they are identified by their white faces. The hill is protected by law because here there is the only wild population of Pereskia marcanoi, a cactus with leaves and beautiful small purple flowers; its common name is Rosa de B\u00e1nica (\"B\u00e1nica Rose\"). ==References== Category:Populated places in El\u00edas Pi\u00f1a Province Category:Municipalities of the Dominican Republic Category:Populated places established in 1504 ",
