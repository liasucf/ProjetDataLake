    "text": "The gens Staia was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. Few members of this gens are mentioned by ancient writers, but a number are known from inscriptions. The most illustrious of the Staii was Lucius Staius Murcus, governor of Syria in 44 BC, and a military commander of some ability who served under several leading figures of the period. ==Origin== The nomen Staius is of Oscan origin, and belongs to a large class of gentilicia formed using the suffix '. The first of the Staii appearing in history was a Samnite, as were many of the other Staii known from inscriptions.PW, \"Staius\".Chase, p. 120. The nomen is frequently confused with that of Statius. ==Praenomina== The earliest Staii bore Oscan praenomina, such as Minatus and Ovius, but in subsequent generations they bore praenomina more typical at Rome, including Numerius and Tiberius. In imperial times, the chief names used by the Staii were Lucius, Marcus, and Gaius, the most common praenomina at all periods of Roman history. They occasionally used other common names, such as Publius, Gnaeus, and Sextus. ==Members== * Minatus Staius, a Samnite general during the Third Samnite War, who was captured and sent to Rome in 296 BC.Livy, x. 20.PW, \"Staius\", No. 1. * Minatus Staius Ov. f., named in an inscription from Delos in Achaia, dating to the third quarter of the second century BC.. * Tiberius Staius Min. l., a freedman mentioned in an inscription from Delos, dating from 125 BC.. * Staia Ov. f., named in a sepulchral inscription from Cumae in Campania, dating from the first half of the first century BC.Camodeca, \"Nuove iscrizioni da Cumae\", p. 65. * Lucius Staius Sex. f.
