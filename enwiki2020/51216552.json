In 2013, he joined Montevideo Wanderers' youth team before moving to Italy where he joined Pescara's youth team. ===Pescara=== Torreira playing for Pescara in 2014 Before the 2014\u201315 season, Torreira was called up for Pescara's first team and, on 25 October 2014, he sat on the bench for the first time. He made his senior debut in Serie B on 16 May 2015 against Varese, playing the game as a starter. He played 58 minutes before being replaced with Matteo Politano. ===Sampdoria=== On 1 July 2015, Torreira was transferred to Sampdoria for \u20ac1.5 million, but he remained with Pescara on loan for the 2015\u201316 season to gain first-team experience. On 2 July, his loan to Pescara became official. On 9 August 2015, Torreira scored his first professional goal against F.C. S\u00fcdtirol in the 2015\u201316 Coppa Italia. After the Pescara loan ended, Torreira returned to Sampdoria on 1 July 2016. On 21 August 2016, Torreira made his Serie A debut in their opening game against Empoli at the Stadio Carlo Castellani. He started the game and played the entirety of the 90+ minutes on the field. He became a regular for Sampdoria in the 2016\u201317 season, and continued showing his importance to the team in the 2017\u201318 season; scoring vital goals, including the second goal in Sampdoria's 3\u20132 win over Juventus in November. ===Arsenal=== On 10 July 2018, Torreira joined English club Arsenal for an undisclosed fee, believed to be around \u00a326 million. Torreira was given the number 11 shirt, previously worn by Mesut \u00d6zil, who took the vacant number 10 following the departure of Jack Wilshere. ====2018\u201319: Debut season, European runner-up==== Torreira made his Premier League debut on 12 August, coming on as a substitute on the 70th minute in a 2\u20130 defeat to Manchester City. Torreira registered his first assist of the season, by setting up Alexandre Lacazette's winning goal in a 3\u20132 win over Cardiff City. Torreira made his full-debut and his Europa League debut for Arsenal in the 4\u20132 win over FC Vorskla Poltava on 2 September, before being replaced in the 57th minute by Matteo Guendouzi. Torreira's performance in Arsenal's 1\u20131 draw with Liverpool drew particularly high praise from fans and pundits alike, picking up the man-of-the-match award. On 2 December, Torreira scored his first Arsenal goal and picked up another man-of- the-match award against Tottenham Hotspur when he latched on to a pass from Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to slot the ball past Hugo Lloris to give Arsenal a fourth goal in a 4\u20132 North London derby victory. A week later, on 8 December, Torreira scored a late 83rd-minute winner against Huddersfield Town with a bicycle kick, giving him his second goal in as many games at the Emirates Stadium. In the match, Torreira was also awarded his fifth consecutive Arsenal Man of the Match performance. Torreira was dismissed in stoppage time, during the club's reverse fixture against Tottenham at Wembley, after a late challenge on Tottenham, defender Danny Rose, the match ended 1\u20131 and was Torreira's first red card for Arsenal, although Arsenal attempted to appeal the ban, their appeal was rejected by the FA, this meant that Torreira's ban would still result in a three-match ban, meaning Torreira would miss Arsenal's games against Manchester United, Newcastle United and Everton. ESPN's Bill Barnwell named Torreira the third best signing of the Premier League season. ====2019\u201320: FA Cup win==== Torreira made his first appearance of the season in Arsenal's 2\u20131 win over Burnley. Torreira scored his first goal of the season in Arsenal's 3\u20131 defeat to Liverpool after replacing Dani Ceballos in the 61st minute. He struggled for playing time early on in the season, but regained a starting position under new Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta. On 2 March, Torreira suffered a presumably season-ending ankle injury in an FA Cup win against Portsmouth. However, the Premier League suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic gave Torreira enough time to heal and return to fitness by the time the season restarted in June. He played only sparingly for the rest of the season. ====2020\u201321: Loan to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid==== On 5 October 2020, Torreira joined Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on a season-long loan. ==International career== Uruguay at the 2018 FIFA World Cup Torreira was born in Uruguay, and is of Spanish descent through his paternal grandfather from Galicia. He holds a Spanish passport, and was scouted by the senior Italy national football team before he was capped by Uruguay. Torreira was called up to full Uruguay squad for the 2018 China Cup in March 2018. He made his debut in the 2\u20130 win over the Czech Republic in the China Cup semi-final. In June 2018, he was named in Uruguay's final 23-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. The tournament served as a breakthrough for Torreira, who played in all five of Uruguay's games. ==Style of play== Upon signing for Arsenal in 2018, The Independent's Jack Austin stated \"Torreira is exactly the kind of no-nonsense midfielder the club have been craving\", adding that in Uruguay colours during the 2018 World Cup \"he went about his job as the deep-lying pivot in the middle of the park with none of the fuss and all of the discipline of a player who has built a tidy reputation for himself in Serie A\", while assessing his chief weaknesses as a lack of height in aerial duels and little goal threat. WhoScored notes that Torreira is a player who likes to shoot from distance and often gets fouled. They also note that he likes to play short passes and make tackles. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |Pescara |2014\u201315 |Serie B |5||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||3||0||8||0 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Pescara (loan) |2015\u201316 |Serie B |29||4||2||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||3||1||34||6 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !34||4||2||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||6||1||42||6 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Sampdoria |2016\u201317 |Serie A |35||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||36||0 |- |2017\u201318 |Serie A |36||4||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||38||4 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !71||4||3||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||74||4 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Arsenal |2018\u201319 |Premier League |34||2||4||0||12||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||50||2 |- |2019\u201320 |Premier League |29||1||4||1||6||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||39||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !63||3||8||1||18||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||89||4 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Atl\u00e9tico Madrid (loan) |2020\u201321 |La Liga |1||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !169||11||13||2||18||0||6||1||206||14 |} 1 Other tournaments include Serie B Promotion playoffs ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !colspan=\"3\"|Uruguay |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2018||13||0 |- |2019||10||0 |- |2020||1||0 |- !Total||24||0 |} ==Honours== Arsenal *FA Cup: 2019\u201320 *UEFA Europa League runner-up: 2018\u201319 Uruguay *China Cup: 2018, 2019 ==References== Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:People from Fray Bentos Category:Uruguayan footballers Category:Uruguay international footballers Category:Serie B players Category:Serie A players Category:Premier League players Category:La Liga players Category:Delfino Pescara 1936 players Category:U.C.
