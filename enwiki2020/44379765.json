In February 2016, Vin Diesel announced initial release dates for the ninth and tenth films, with the ninth film initially set to be released on April 19, 2019. After the spin-off Hobbs & Shaw was announced, the release date for the ninth film was pushed back to April 10, 2020. In April 2017, Diesel and Dwayne Johnson confirmed their returns. On October 25, 2017, Diesel revealed in a Facebook live video that Justin Lin, who directed from The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006) through Fast & Furious 6 (2013), and actress Jordana Brewster, who portrayed Mia Toretto in five of the franchise's films, would be returning for the ninth and tenth films. On April 4, 2018, Johnson stated that he was unsure if he was returning for the ninth film due to working on the spin-off, and he confirmed in January 2019 that he would not be appearing in the film. In May 2018, Daniel Casey was hired to write the screenplay after Morgan left due to his work on the Hobbs and Shaw spin-off film. Michelle Rodriguez was also confirmed to reprise her role. In February 2019, Universal Pictures announced that it was delaying the film by six weeks which would shift the release date from April 2020 to May 2020. It was reported that the delay was so that the film would not compete with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's No Time to Die, which was given a release date of April 8, 2020. In June 2019, John Cena was officially cast in the film, after an initial announcement from Diesel in April. In July 2019, Finn Cole, Anna Sawai, and Vinnie Bennett joined the cast of the film. That same month, it was announced Helen Mirren and Charlize Theron would reprise their roles. Michael Rooker and MMA Fighter Francis Ngannou were added to the cast in August. In October 2019, Ozuna and Cardi B joined the cast of the film. === Filming === Principal photography began on June 24, 2019, at Leavesden Studios in Hertfordshire, England.

Part of the film was also shot in Tbilisi, Georgia. Filming wrapped on November 11, 2019. In July 2019, stuntman Joe Watts, who doubled for Diesel, sustained a serious head injury during filming at Leavesden Studios. In September 2020, Michelle Rodriguez confirmed the film would be set in the outer space as well, which was teased by Diesel. ==Music== F9s official soundtrack will be released concurrently with the film. In the lead up to the soundtrack, a mixtape titled Road to F9 was released on July 31, 2020, and features music inspired by the film. The mixtape was preceded by the lead single \"One Shot\" by YoungBoy Never Broke Again and Lil Baby. == Release == F9 was originally scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States on May 22, 2020 by Universal Pictures, but on March 12, the film was pushed back 10 months to April 2, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On October 2, 2020, the film moved to May 28, 2021, after No Time to Die was moved to its release slot. ===Marketing=== The first official trailer for the film was released on January 31, 2020. ==Future== A sequel, intended to be the final installment in the main saga, was set for release for April 2, 2021.
