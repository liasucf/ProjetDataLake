Appointed by letters patent in March 2015, he was designated acting Clerk upon the retirement of Sir Robert Rogers in August 2014. He announced his retirement in a letter to the Speaker on 14 November 2018. ==Clerk of the House of Commons== Natzler had previously served as Clerk Assistant to Sir Robert Rogers. On notice of Rogers' proposed retirement, Commons Speaker John Bercow secured the agreement of the House of Commons Commission to a change in the person specification for the role of Clerk of the House of Commons and Chief Executive of the House of Commons Service. Following a controversial recruitment process, Bercow proposed the selection of Carol Mills, then secretary of the Department of Parliamentary Services in the Parliament of Australia, for the job of Clerk of the House and Chief Executive, sending the formal nomination to the Prime Minister with the request that it be passed to the Sovereign, who makes the appointment by letters patent. The appointment process was questioned by many MPs and the nomination itself was opposed by several. As a result, on the retirement of Rogers, Natzler was appointed as acting Clerk. The House of Commons established a committee on the governance of the House, chaired by former Cabinet Minister Jack Straw. The committee reported in December 2014.\"House of Commons Governance report published\", House of Commons news release, 14 December 2014. Inter alia the committee recommended that \"The Clerk of the House should remain Head of the House service, appointed by Letters Patent, but should not also be titled Chief Executive\" and that \"a new post of Director General of the House of Commons should be created, reporting to the Clerk but with clearly delineated autonomous responsibilities for the delivery of services.\" The recommendations of the report were debated and agreed to by the House on 22 January 2015.\"Governance report debated\", House of Commons news release, 22 January 2015.
