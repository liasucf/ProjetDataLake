That infra-estrura sporting is estate of the Olhanense and will have a sufficient capacity for house around 10 thousand people. With the presence of the Olhanense in the Portuguese Liga in middle part of the 1970s the club seriously thinking about the construction of a new stadium for the club. The competitive demands of the club and the precarious conditions of the Stadium Padinha like this imposed. The wealthy Arcanjo family of the city of Olh\u00e3o, gave up the lands to the club for the construction of the Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Arcanjo. The beginning of the works of construction will have occurred still in the decade of the 1970s, however, barely in the decade of the 1980s the Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Arcanjo stayed promptly and was officially inaugurated to become the home of the Olhanense. In 2009 the stadium was renovated to introduce the club to the Portuguese Liga. It has sold-out crowds for both of the games with SC Braga, Benfica, FC Porto and Sporting CP.
