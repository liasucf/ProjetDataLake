His layname was Seol (\uc124 hanja: \u859b) or Bak (\ubc15 hanja: \u6734). Like a great number of other Korean Buddhist monks of the 6th-8th centuries, Won Gwang traveled to China in search of a more thorough grounding in the sacred texts of Buddhism. In 589 Wongwang went to Sui China, where for eleven years he was educated in the major texts of both Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism. Won Gwang returned to Silla in 600 and promulgated the Mahayana form of Buddhism. His method was to teach the faith to the common people free of complex jargon and employing common words.Chae, Taeg-su, \"The United Silla Period: the Golden Age of Buddhism.\" In The History and Culture of Buddhism in Korea (Seoul:Dongguk University Press, 1993), p. 81. Won Gwang is best known for his \"Five Commandments for Secular Life\" (\uc138\uc18d\uc624\uacc4Sesok-ogye \u4e16\u4fd7\u4e94\u6212), which later were attributed as a guiding ethos for the Hwarang. These five commandments were to serve as moral guideposts for the Buddhist layperson. They are an interesting fusion of the Buddhist beliefs and strong sense of patriotism that characterized Silla Buddhism. To Won Gwang, viewing Silla as a true Buddha Land and under constant threat from the neighboring kingdoms of Baekje and Goguryeo, the defense of that land and a Buddhist piety were not at all contradictory. These five principles were as follows: #Loyalty to one's lord (\u4e8b\u541b\u4ee5\u5fe0; \uc784\uae08\uc740 \ucda9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc12c\uaca8\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4) #Devotion towards one's parents (\u4e8b\u89aa\u4ee5\u5b5d; \uc5b4\ubc84\uc774\ub97c \ud6a8\ub3c4\ub85c\uc368 \uc12c\uaca8\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4) #Trust among friends (\u4ea4\u53cb\u4ee5\u4fe1; \ubc97\uc740 \ubbff\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc0ac\uadc0\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4) #Never retreat in battle (\u81e8\u6230\u7121\u9000; \uc804\uc7c1\uc5d0 \uc784\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub7ec\ub098\uc9c0 \uc544\ub2c8\ud558\uc5ec\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4) #Be selective in the taking of life (\u6bba\u751f\u6709\u64c7; \ud568\ubd80\ub85c \uc0b4\uc0dd\uc744 \ud558\uc9c0 \ub9d0\uc544\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4) The precise dates of Won Gwang\u2018s life are unknown. Won Gwang\u2018s biography appears in the 13th century Haedong Goseungjeon. ==Popular culture== * Portrayed by Lee Dae-ro in the 2012-2013 KBS1 TV series The King's Dream. == References == Category:6th-century births Category:7th-century deaths Category:Silla Buddhist monks Category:Buddhist teachers Category:Korean Buddhist scholars Category:History of Buddhism ",
