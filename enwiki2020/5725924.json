    "text": "Juan de Torquemada (c. 1562 - 1624) was a Franciscan friar, active as missionary in Spanish colonial Mexico and considered the \"leading Franciscan chronicler of his generation.\"Brading, p. 273. Administrator, engineer, architect and ethnographer, he is most famous for his monumental work commonly known as Monarqu\u00eda indiana (\"Indian Monarchy\"), a survey of the history and culture of the indigenous peoples of New Spain together with an account of their conversion to Christianity, first published in Spain in 1615 and republished in 1723. Monarquia Indiana was the \"prime text of Mexican history, and was destined to influence all subsequent chronicles until the twentieth century.\"Brading, p. 277. It was used by later historians, the Franciscan Augustin de Vetancurt and most importantly by eighteenth-century Jesuit Francisco Javier Clavijero. No English translation of this work has ever been published. ==Life== ===Early years=== There are few firm biographical details concerning Juan de Torquemada, most of which have to be deduced from his own work. Even basic information is subject to uncertainty and controversy. Born at Torquemada, Palencia, north central Spain, at an unknown date before 1566 (Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla argues in detail for 1562) he was brought by his parents to New Spain probably while still a child. He took the Franciscan habit, as is generally agreed, in 1579, and pursued a course of studies in Latin, theology, philosophy and Nahuatl. Brief notices in his own works put him at the convent in Tlacopan in 1582 and (while still a youth) at the convent in Chiauhtla - the presumption being that these relate to his novitiate.Monarqu\u00eda indiana: for Tlacopan, Lib. XIV, cap. 35; for Chiauhtla, Lib. XV, cap. 38 and Lib. XX, cap. 80. The passages relating to Chiauhtla are quoted by Le\u00f3n-Portilla, p. 24. It is uncertain if he began his studies at the convento mayor de San Francisco in Mexico City, but it is presumed that part at least of his studies were conducted while resident at the convent of Santiago, Tlatelolco. Among his teachers he names fray Juan Bautista (who taught him theology) and Antonio Valeriano (who taught him Nahuatl and whom he especially praised for his talents).Monarqu\u00eda indiana: for Juan Bautista, see Lib. XX, cap. 79; for Valeriano, see Lib. V, cap 10. Both passages quoted by Le\u00f3n-Portilla, p. 23. At some time in the early 1580s he was sent by his superiors to Guatemala where he encountered the conquistador Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo. By 1584 he was certainly at the convent of San Francisco, where he assisted in the infirmary. The conjectured date of his priestly ordination is 1587 or 1588.For the various dates cited in this paragraph, see Le\u00f3n-Portilla, pp. 21, 23, 24. Moreno Toscano, p. 498, regarded 1565 as the only probable date of birth but (following Icazbalceta, although offering no arguments herself), accepts 1579 as the date Torquemada took the habit. She does not discuss the date of his ordination. For Torquemada's impression of the aged D\u00edaz (hombre de todo cr\u00e9dito), see Monarqu\u00eda indiana, Lib. IV, cap. 4 (quoted by Le\u00f3n-Portilla, p. 21). See also Alcina Franch (1973), pp.256f. who accepts a date between 1563 and 1565 for his birth or even 1559 if 1579 is taken as the date of his profession at age 20. He is almost certain to have personally known other notable Franciscan friars who were his contemporaries and who were animated, as he was, by a profound interest in the pre-hispanic life and culture of the conquered Indians in New Spain, especially Andr\u00e9s de Olmos, Ger\u00f3nimo de Mendieta, and Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan.Le\u00f3n-Portilla, p. 27; Moreno Toscano, p.499 (who mentions only Ger\u00f3nimo de Mendieta). ===Missionary activity, 1588-1602=== Map of central Mexico, the main area of Torquemada's activity Shortly after ordination (which, in this period, was normally conferred on aspirant Franciscans at age 25),Le\u00f3n-Portilla, p. 21. he was sent as a missionary to Nueva Galicia, a large territory in central western New Spain, the capital of which was Guadalajara and which extended north to Zacatecas and west to the Pacific. He is next heard of as guardian of the convent at Tlaxcala (east of Mexico City and north of Puebla), and although no dates can be assigned to his travels, at this time he is known to have been engaged in missionary work in the central region around Toluca (a town not far to the south-west of Mexico City) and at various places in Michoac\u00e1n (an area west of Mexico City, extending to the Pacific). Among his achievements during this phase of his life was his role as one of the founders of the Confraternity of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Soledad (Our Lady of Solitude), the indigenous members of which performed, on Sundays, edifying plays and scenes written in their own language by Torquemada for the purposes of inculcating in them and in spectators the Catholic faith.See Le\u00f3n-Portilla: for the location of his missionary activity, pp. 25-27; for his election as guardian of the convent at Tlaxcala, p. 22; for his part in the founding of the confraternity, pp. 27f. (quoting from Monarqu\u00eda indiana, Lib. 20, cap. 79 and the Septima relaci\u00f3n of Chimalpahin); for his election as guardian at Tulancingo, p. 31. In 1600 and 1601 (possibly in 1599 as well) he was guardian of the convent of Zacatl\u00e1n (in the central highlands north-east of Mexico City). In 1602 he was guardian of the convent of Tulancingo. Then, in 1603, he was elected guardian of the convent of Santiago Tlatelolco, taking up his post there on 22 July; a post he held, it seems, for eight and a half years.Le\u00f3n-Portilla: for the starting date, see p. 31 (quoting the Anales coloniales de Tlatelolco; for Torquemada as guardian of the convent of Tlaxcala in February 1612, see p. 39 (citing the Aprobaci\u00f3n of [27] February of that year provided for the Monarqu\u00eda indiana by fray Luis V\u00e1ez. ===At Tlatelolco, 1603-1612=== While guardian of the convent at Tlatelolco, he assumed numerous heavy burdens, both intellectual and practical, not all of which related to the affairs of the Franciscans.In the general Prologue to Monarqu\u00eda indiana he emphasises how heavy these burdens were, not (he says) in order to boast of his talents but to show how much he accomplished in the comparatively few years when he was also writing (when he had the time) his magnum opus. Among those which did may be mentioned the fact that the guardian of the convent was ex officio President of the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco, a post which entailed general oversight of the conduct of the institution under its rector. The College had, however, so far declined from the ambitious plans which attended its ceremonial opening in 1536 that, by the end of the 16th century, it had become an elementary school where local Indian children learnt reading, writing, manners and good behaviour.For the guardian as ex officio president of the institution, see Moreno Toscano, p. 499 (although she mis-assigns the start of his guardianship to 1600). For the decline of the institution before Torquemada's guardianship, see Juan Estarellas, \"The College of Tlatelolco and the Problem of Higher Education for Indians in 16th Century Mexico\", History of Education Quarterly, Vol. 2, No. 4 (Dec., 1962), pp. 234-243 , at pp. 240f. ====Administrator==== In 1604 he visited Zacatecas to assist in the establishment of a Franciscan province to be headquartered there, and in 1606 he spent time in Michoac\u00e1n and Jalisco for the same purpose - the establishment of a new province in Jalisco (headquartered in Guadalajara), carved out of the province of San Pedro y San Pablo covering Michoac\u00e1n-Jalisco.Le\u00f3n-Portilla, p. 34. For the division of Franciscan provinces in New Spain at this time, see Habig, p. 228, with the map on p. 216. A surge of vocations from among the criollos as well as a renewed influx of friars from Spain had necessitated a new alignment of responsibilities. A generation before (in 1570), numbers of friars in Nueva Galicia had fallen to 16, four of whom were elderly. In striking contrast to this long period of decline, in 1601 and 1602 alone, 14 friars had arrived from Spain destined for Nueva Galicia and 32 more for Zacatecas. Between 1610 and 1618 these numbers were augmented by another 40 arrivals.Foin, pp. 219-221 for the low number in 1570; p. 234, table of arrivals 1610 onwards. ====Engineer==== a contemporary painting showing Mexico City in 1628; the view east, overlooking Lake Texcoco Abnormally high rainfall in August 1604 led to a devastating flood of Mexico City - one of several inundations from Lake Texcoco which sometimes took years to recede. The city was still virtually an island at this time. Other such inundations occurred in 1555, 1580, 1607 and 1629 resulting in the decision in 1629 (imperfectly implemented) to drain part of the lake.Louisa Hoberman, pp. 212 and 222, and see Mathes, pp. 425-428. As an emergency measure, Viceroy Juan de Mendoza asked the Franciscan provincial to assign members of his Order to help in various urgent remedial works. Torquemada participated, specifically in the reconstruction of the calzadas (causeways) of Los Misterios (leading north-east to Guadalupe \u2013 works which took five months of continuous activity to complete, employing thousands of labourers) and of that leading west to Chapultepec. When these works were finished, the friars organised the cleaning of the main drains of the city. It was only through the friars' petitioning the Viceroy that he ordered the labourers to be paid and fed at government expense.See passages in Monarqu\u00eda indiana, Lib. V, cap. 60, partly quoted by Le\u00f3n-Portilla, pp. 33f. and Pr\u00f3logo general (p. XXIX of IIH edn.). The three main causeways dating from the Aztec period are described in Monarqu\u00eda indiana, Lib. III, cap. 23; the Spaniards built two more (ibid., cap. 26). ====Architect==== Commencing in 1604, Torquemada took in hand the construction of a new church of Santiago de Tlatelolco, a project which had been stalled for many years. He reported that it proceeded in great part thanks to contributions in cash and kind by local Indians, many of whom donated their labour.Monarqu\u00eda indiana, Lib. XVII, cap. 5, quoted by Victoria (1990) at pp. 75f. It is notable for the massive bases of the towers flanking the main entrance, designed to resist earthquake.Interior of the church of Santiago de Tlatelolco The work was completed in 1609 or 1610, and on 14 July 1610 the church was consecrated.Le\u00f3n-Portilla (p. 36) quotes the anonymous Anales coloniales de Tlatelolco and the Diario of Chimalpahin on the events of 14 and 15 July 1610; Victoria (1990) at p. 76 quotes the same passages, accepting 1610 as the relevant year. In his later work (1994, p. 38), he preferred the date 1609 for the completion of the building works, relying on a passage in Monarqu\u00eda indiana, Lib. XVII, cap. 4. It was built in the form of a Latin cross with a series of shallow domes in the vault over the nave and a large dome over the crossing, with a semi-dome over the apse. The following day, on Sunday 15 July 1610 (the feast of Santiago) the altarpiece or retablo behind the high altar was inaugurated.Chimalpahin in his Diario is explicit that the consecration occurred on 14 July, the eve of the feast (\"14 de julio de mil seiscientos diez a\u00f1os, siendo las v\u00edsperas de Santiago ap\u00f3stol\"), and that the retablo was inaugurated the following day, a Sunday, the feast of Santiago, 15 July; in the Roman Calendar that feast is celebrated on 25 July. This sumptuous structure was arranged in four registers with an apex. It was decorated with 14 paintings by the celebrated Basque painter Baltasar de Echave Orio (who is also credited with designing the retablo), alternating with carved wooden statues standing in niches. At the centre of the second register, directly above the later neo-classic ciborium (presumptively installed in the first decades of the 19th century and visible in a 19th century lithograph which shows the arrangement of the retablo), was a carved and painted panel in high relief of the patron saint of the church, Santiago Matamoros, the only part of the retablo that has survived.The retablo is described in Victoria (1990) pp. 78, based on a lithograph published in 1861 in Manuel Ram\u00edrez Aparicio's book Los conventos suprimidos de M\u00e9xico, and reproduced as fig. 1 to Victoria's article; fig. 2 is a photograph of the Santiago panel. It is Victoria (1990, p. 77 and p. 78, cf. (1994) pp. 111f.) who attributes the design of the retablo to Echave. Torquemada applauded the skill of the Indian craftsmen and singled out for praise one of those who worked on the retablo, Miguel Mauricio, calling him an artist second to none among the Spanish.Monarqu\u00eda indiana, Lib. XII, cap. 34. Western fa\u00e7ade of church of Santiago de Tlatelolco Most of the decoration of the church was either removed by the civil authorities, looted, damaged or destroyed during the turmoil of the era of La Reforma in the mid-19th century.See Victoria (1990), p. 74. The church then became a customs warehouse, and as late as 1944 the convent was a military gaol; but the use of the church has since been restored to the Franciscans and the Santiago panel has been returned to its original location on the wall above the altar.Arroyo: for the fate of the church, 1; for the fate of the retablo, 2. A curious episode attaches to the building of the church. Allegations were made that Torquemada had exploited and abused the Indian workforce and had severely beaten one particular labourer \"almost to death\" (a punto de muerte). An official investigation was initiated by the Archbishop of M\u00e9xico on 16 February 1605, but there is no record of the outcome and there was no interruption to Torquemada's work on the church.See Le\u00f3n-Portilla, pp. 36f., who comments that gratuitous violence, especially against Indians, is not congruent with everything else we know about the character and disposition of Torquemada. ====Historian==== It was while he was guardian of the convent of Tlatelolco that Torquemada also put in hand the organisation of the materials he had been gathering for many years previously, and (between 1605 and 1612) their redaction into the great work he had been projecting - the history of the aboriginal nations of New Spain, and their conquest and evangelisation by the Spanish. In addition to the voluminous unpublished writings of other Franciscans to which he had unimpeded access, Torquemada possessed many original documents acquired during his missionary work, as well as the oral testimony he had obtained from people he had encountered on his various travels.For the dates of composition, see Le\u00f3n-Portilla, p. 20. In 1609 he had been named chronicler of the Franciscan Order by Fray Bernardo de Salva, Franciscan Commissary General of the Indies.Alcina Franch, p.258 citing Monarqu\u00eda indiana. The letter of appointment, dated 6 April 1609 is at pp. XXI and XXII of the preliminares to the IIH online edn. On completion of the work he took the manuscript to Spain in order to oversee its publication (as to which see below). ===Last years, 1613-1624=== On 8 January 1614, in the year following his return from Spain, Torquemada was elected provincial of the province of the Holy Gospel (del Santo Evangelio de M\u00e9xico) a post he held for the usual three-year term until the election of a successor on 14 January 1617.For the terminal dates of service as provincial, see Le\u00f3n-Portilla, pp. 42f. At that time the province of the Holy Gospel comprised M\u00e9xico City, the modern State of M\u00e9xico, and the State of Puebla, together with the custodia of Tampico on the Gulf Coast.Habig, p. 220, with map at p. 216. In 1908 the provinces were consolidated into three, and Santo Evangelio comprised all the southern States of Mexico: Habig, p. 223. For Puebla as comprised within the province at this time, see the review by John P. Harrison of: Francisco Morales, O.F.M., \"Ethnic and Social Background of the Franciscan Friars in Seventeenth Century Mexico\" (1973), in Catholic Historical Review, Vol. 63, No. 1 (January 1977), pp. 60f., at p. 60. In an ongoing dispute over the division of elective posts within the province conducted between the criollos (ethnic Spaniards born in New Spain) and the peninsulares (those born in Spain but who had emigrated to New Spain), Torquemada identified himself not as a peninsular (which he could justly claim to be) but as a member of an intermediate group of men who came out to New Spain in their childhood and regarded themselves as hijos de la provincia (sons of the province). The dispute became especially bitter under Torquemada's successor as provincial Juan L\u00f3pez, a peninsular, with respect to whom Torquemada expressed deep- seated hostility, accusing him in private correspondence (two letters written in October 1620 to a former confr\u00e8re of his, then resident in Spain) of being a liar and an hombre sin Dios (a man without God), and asserting that Hell held no man worse or more false (este mal hombre de fray Juan L\u00f3pez . . digo que otro peor no lo tiene el infierno ni m\u00e1s falso).Le\u00f3n-Portilla, pp. 43-46, quoting the relevant parts of the letters and (p. 46) remarking upon the harshness and violence of Torquemada's language when denouncing lies and injustice. At the age of 62 or thereabouts, Torquemada died suddenly on New Year's Day, 1624, in choir in the convent at Tlatelolco after having sung matins with the community at midnight. He had apparently been in good health. The cause of death was likely a heart attack, given that an indigenous witness said he said \"Help me, unloose my chest where my heart is.\"Alcina Franch, p.259 quoting \"Unos anales colonialies, 1948, pp. 182-84. He died in the presence of his brother friars and of the guardian of the convent of San Francisco. His body was conducted in solemn procession from Tlatelolco to Mexico City accompanied by many mourners who paused at seven places on the way in order to sing responses. On arrival at the church of San Francisco (the mother church of the province), it was interred in the sanctuary, on the right-hand side near the high altar.Details taken from the Anales coloniales de Tlatelolco, quoted by Le\u00f3n-Portilla (pp. 47f.). Moreno Toscano (p. 501) asserts that he died at the convent of San Francisco. Alcina Franch (p. 60, but hesitantly - al parecer, he notes) understood that at the time of death Torquemada himself was guardian of the convent of San Francisco. ==Literary works== ===Monarqu\u00eda indiana=== ====Introduction==== By way of providing impetus to and official sanction for Torquemada's history, fray Bernardo Salva, the Comisario general de Indias (acting by specific direction from his immediate superior, Arc\u00e1ngelo de Messina, the minister general of the Order) wrote a letter dated 6 April 1609 from Madrid, in which he gave written authority and instructions to Torquemada to compile a chronicle of the life and work of the members of the Franciscan Order active in New Spain, as well as a wide-ranging account of the history and culture of the peoples they had evangelised. For that purpose, as Salva wrote, Torquemada was to utilise the voluminous historical and ethnographic writings of his fellow Franciscans (now, all of them dead) to which he had access, almost nothing of which had by then been published: works by Andr\u00e9s de Olmos, Ger\u00f3nimo de Mendieta, Motolin\u00eda, and Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan. Of these, only de Mendieta was mentioned by name by Salva. The work is a \"remarkably dense text,\" because of its theological digressions, contradictions, and anachronisms, since Torquemada incorporated material without resolving contradictory and competing points of view from his sources.Brading, pp.281-83. In addition to the texts written by Spaniards, Torquemada draws on the work of mestizo Tlaxcala patriot Diego Mu\u00f1oz Camargo, and Texcoco indigenous nobility Fernando Alva Ixtlilxochitl, Juan Bautista Pomar, and Antonio de Pimentel, and the account of the conquest from the Tlatelolco point of view compiled by Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan. He incorporates a large quantity of information taken from indigenous pictographs and manuscripts.Brading, p.281. Torquemada interviewed elderly indigenous people about their ancestors and recorded their oral traditions. The Monarqu\u00eda indiana is the best work on what was known of the indigenous past at the beginning of the seventeenth century. It is considered an especially important source on the Mexica, Totonac, Pipil and Nicoya cultures. At the time of its publication, Torquemada referred to his history under the abbreviated title Libros rituales y monarqu\u00eda indiana or Monarqu\u00eda y historia indiana, but others were already calling it the Monarqu\u00eda indiana, the name by which it has generally been known ever since.In the preliminares to the IIH online edn see: Torquemada's pr\u00f3logo general (pp. XXIX and XXXI); for the 2nd edn, the printer's proemio and the requisite government tax certificate (pp. IX and XXXVII respectively). Antonio de Herrera, chronicler royal, had an advance copy of the work which he attacked under the name Monarqu\u00eda indiana at the end of his own Historia general de los hechos de los Castellanos en las islas y tierra firme del mar oc\u00e9ano published in parts between 1601 and 1615; see Gurr\u00eda Lacroix, pp. 431f. ====Vision of history and purpose of the work==== The leading motif of Torquemada's monumental history \u2013 elaborated by him in many places, especially in the general prologue to the entire work \u2013 can be characterised as the merciful action of Divine Providence in choosing the Spanish to liberate the Indians from their subjection to the Devil who had deceived these innocent peoples into practising a religion marred by errors and polluted by abominations such as human sacrifice.Moreno Toscano, pp. 501-503; Le\u00f3n-Portilla, pp. 351-361, 364; Rubial Garc\u00eda, p. 351. On this interpretation the fall of the Aztec monarchy was a Divine chastisement and Spain the rod.See, e.g., Phelan, pp. 114f. But, for all that, Torquemada was sympathetic to the positive achievements of the Indians, and, by situating their history and culture within the framework of the Old Testament and of the former glories of the empires of Egypt, Greece and Rome, he encouraged the educated elite of the Old World to recognise the indigenous nations of the New World as their peers.Phelan, pp. 115-117; Moreno Toscano, pp. 506-508; Le\u00f3n- Portilla, pp. 349f., 364; Cline, p. 372; Rubial Garc\u00eda, p. 351. His history was, of set purpose, a laborious inquiry into the truth of things, requiring (as he says in his general prologue) diligence, maturation, and the exercise of prudence in adjudicating among conflicting testimonies.. . fuera de otras mil cosas, una diligencia grande en la inquisici\u00f3n de las cosas verdaderas, una madureza no menor en conferir las dudosas y en computar los tiempos, una prudencia particular y se\u00f1alada en tratar las unas y las otras, y sobre todo, en la era en que estamos, es menester un \u00e1nimo santo y desembarazado para pretender agradar s\u00f3lo a Dios, sin aguardar de los hombres el premio o alg\u00fan inter\u00e9s. It was not written as an entertainment or to satisfy mere curiosity, but with a serious didactic purpose and to edify, for he believed that the record of the events of the past constitute not only an antidote to human mortality and the brevity of life, but also a hermeneutic key to understanding the present, thereby offering man an opportunity to progress.Moreno Tuscano, p. 502; Le\u00f3n-Portilla, pp. 342-344; Rubial Garc\u00eda, p. 347. ====Method==== The distinguished scholar and administrator, Howard F. Cline, who, at the time of his death was Director of the Hispanic Foundation of the Library of Congress in Washington D.C.See the obituary by John J. Finan in The Hispanic American Historical Review, Vol. 51, No. 4 (November, 1971), pp. 646-653, at p. 646. gave, in 1969, this positive assessment of Torquemada's skill as an historian :-Cline, p. 372. > Historians generally see their tasks broken into three main stages: as > comprehensive as possible collection of relevant documentation, followed by > critical and evaluative appraisal of it, and finally, a synthesis based on > verified data. Contrary to a considerable body of hostile secondary > discussion, critical examination of Juan de Torquemada's Monarqu\u00eda Indiana > indicates a surprisingly high level of workmanship in at least the first two > phases. Although what he strove for in synthesis - an accurate record that > would place native Mexican cultures on a par with ancient, classical, and > for him modern societies - is an early and interesting example of a > comparative approach, the classical and Biblical citations he employed for > such comparisons are now largely of curiosity value, except as clues to his > own ambience and personal outlook. Torquemada was a skilled and careful > historian, constrained only by some obvious usages and common attitudes of > his age. Like others of his time, he puzzled over the problems of fitting > native peopling of the New World and their development into a Biblical > framework, and seldom doubted authenticity of miracles, or the Providential > intervention which accounted for Cortes' Conquest as an expression of Divine > Will. But for the most part he went at his tasks with professional coolness, > and a rather high degree of historiographical craftsmanship. ====Subject-matter==== Salva's letter of 6 April 1609 itself expressed the full ambit of Torquemada's work as eventually written, including, as regards the converted Indians: \"their rituals, ceremonies, laws, governments and governors, their mode of conservation and conversation, their kings, kingdoms, cities and domains, their origin and beginnings, their division into provinces and kingdoms [sic]; the diversity of their languages, their riches and means of sustenance, their gods and worship, and, with great particularity, the manner in which friars and ministers initially converted them and how they have followed up on those conversions . . .\"Letter from fray Bernardo Salva, publ. as part of the preliminares to the IIH online edition, pp. XXI and XXII:- \". . de las vidas de tantos religiosos santos y graves . . como tambi\u00e9n de los nuevamente convertidos, de sus ritos y ceremonias, de sus leyes, rep\u00fablicas y gobiernos; del modo de su conservaci\u00f3n y conversaci\u00f3n, de sus reyes, reinos, ciudades y se\u00f1or\u00edos, de su origen y principios, de la divisi\u00f3n, provincias y reinos; de la diversidad de sus lenguas, de las riquezas y sustentos de ellos, de sus dioses y adoraciones y con mucha particularidad del modo que los religiosos y ministros tuvieron en el principio de aquellas conversiones y c\u00f3mo han proseguido y prosiguen en ellas; con el modo de su entrada y el que tienen en la administraci\u00f3n de los santos sacramentos, donde tan copioso fruto se ha cogido; y con las dem\u00e1s cosas notables que en \u00e9sa y las dem\u00e1s provincias de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a se pudieren verificar y sacar en limpio, poni\u00e9ndolo vuestra reverencia todo en buen estilo y modo historial.\" The work was published in three hefty volumes under a title which gives a precise conspectus of its subject-matter and author: LOS VEINTE IUN LIBROS RITUALES I MONARCHIA Indiana con el origen y guerras de los Indios Ocidentales, de sus Pobla\u00e7ones, Descubrimiento, Conquista, Conversion y otras cosas maravillosas de la mesma [sic] tierra discribuydos en tres tomos. COMPUESTO POR F. JUAN DE TORQUEMADA Ministro Provincial de la Orden de Nuestro Serafico Padre, San Francisco En la Provincia del Santo Evangelio de Mexico en la Nueva Espana.As printed on the title-page of the 2nd edition, lacking accents; word-breaks introduced, and medial \"s\" written in modern style. The first volume comprises five books which principally treat of the creation of the world and the origin of the peoples who occupied New Spain (I, II), as well as the diverse nations constituting the Aztec Empire (III), followed by its conquest by the Spanish (IV) and its subsequent re-organisation (V). To the second volume were assigned nine books which deal with the religion (VI-X), government (XI), laws (XII), institutions (XIII) and social and military life of the indigenous peoples together with remarks on various geographical features and their cultural relevance (XIV). The subject of the seven books which constitute the third volume is the evangelisation of the Indians, with particular focus (especially in the last three books) upon the life, work and fate of Franciscan missionaries. The main focus is on the history and culture of the peoples of what is now central Mexico, with particular attention given to Texcoco, Azcapotzalco, Tlaxcala, Tlatelolco, and Tenochtitlan as well as the Totonacs living further east, towards the Gulf of Mexico. Nevertheless, the work also includes among its subjects other peoples living in Central America (Honduras and Guatemala), in the Caribbean, and in North and South America (specifically: Florida, New Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, the Andean civilisations, and even parts of Brasil).For an overview, see Cline, pp. 377-386. Torquemada describes the 1576 epidemic in New Spain in the following terms: > In the year 1576 a great mortality and pestilence that lasted for more than > a year overcame the Indians. It was so big that it ruined and destroyed > almost the entire land. The place we know as New Spain was left almost > empty. He reported that two million, mostly indigenous, people died, according to a survey conducted by Viceroy Don Mart\u00edn Enr\u00edquez de Almanza.Quoted in Rodolfo Acuna-Soto, et al.,\"Large Epidemics of Hemorrhagic Fevers in Mexico 1545-1815\" ====Sources==== Fragment of a pictograph (known as a \"codex\") similar to the prehispanic historical materials utilised for the Monarqu\u00eda indiana The great diversity of sources employed by Torquemada, including precious indigenous documents now lost as well as colonial texts (published and unpublished), is fully laid out in exhaustive tables of analysis for each of the books in volume 7 of the IIH critical edition, following extensive study by the research seminar conducted under the leadership of Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla between 1969 and 1971.In addition to the tables of analysis, see also Le\u00f3n- Portilla, p. 95. The indigenous sources are discussed at pp. 96-109; those in Spanish, at pp. 109-127. Biblical, ecclesiastical, and classical sources are discussed in the essay \"Fuentes b\u00edblicas, cl\u00e1sicas y contemporaneas\" by Elsa Cecilia Frost (ibid.) pp. 267-274, and listed in the three appendices to that essay. At the end of the 17th century a charge of plagiarism was raised by fray Agust\u00edn de Vetancur who claimed that Torquemada had published under his own name the Historia eclesi\u00e1stica indiana, a history written by Jer\u00f3nimo de Mendieta which had never been published, but the manuscript of which had been entrusted by Mendieta to Juan Bautista and by him to Torquemada. The accusation was rejected by Rodr\u00edgues Franco in his Proemio to the second edition of Monarqu\u00eda indiana, but it was taken up by the famous Mexican historian Joaqu\u00edn Garc\u00eda Icazbalceta in the 19th century after acquiring the manuscript of Mendieta's work which he published in 1870, pointing out the areas of exact correspondence between both works.The charge was levelled by Vetancur in Teatro Mexicano: Cr\u00f3nica de la Provincia del Santo Evangelio de M\u00e9xico, Menologio Franciscano, Mexico (1697-98). The transfer of Mendieta's manuscript is asserted by Juan Bautista in the Pr\u00f3logo to his 1606 book of sermons in Nahuatl. For the Proemio to the 2nd edn see the preliminares to the IIH online edn at pp. IX-XVI; the response to Vetancur is at pp. XII-XIV. See, on all this, Gurr\u00eda Lacroix, pp. 57-67. One 20th century scholar considered the charge to be:-See Phelan, chapter 13, especially at pp. 112-114. The quote comes from footnote 4. On p. 114 Phelan observes that in Book IV Torquemada borrowed from Herrera who borrowed from Cervantes de Salazar and L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara, both of whom \"derived much of their material from Motolin\u00eda\". He continued: \"It is both impertinent and superfluous to squander moral indignation about the plagiarism of these authors . .\" > . . not completely justified in view of the fact that Torquemada was ordered > by his superiors to use all historical works available and that politically > speaking it was desirable that the Monarqu\u00eda indiana should not be too > closely identified with the Historia eclesi\u00e1stica indiana, lest the oblivion > of the latter overtake the former. The various ways in which the accusation has been made are discussed in Gurr\u00eda Lacroix' essay (\"Acusaci\u00f3n de plagiario\") in volume 7 of the IIH edition. As Woodrow Borah put it in his review:-At p. 565. On this point, see also Casta\u00f1eda de la Paz, passim, esp. p. 189 (where she discusses Chimalpahin's use of work by Tezozomoc) and pp. 193f. (where she discusses Tezozomoc's use of earlier documents). > Jorge Gurr\u00eda Lacroix, who died before this volume appeared, examines at > considerable length the old charge of plagiarism raised against Fray Juan in > his use particularly of Mendieta's chronicle, and by doing so, of Mendieta > in his use of Motolini\u00e1's writing. The charges are disposed of, one hopes > definitively, by making clear the customs of the time and the specific > instructions to Torquemada from his Order. Chronicles were regarded as > community property to be used as the Order decided. The charge occasionally resurfaces, even if only obliquely and by association.See, e.g., Merrim, p. 213; Carman, p. 84. Almost the entirety of Mendieta's history is reproduced throughout the course of Books 15-21 of the Monarqu\u00eda indiana (where it comprises about 80% of the text),Le\u00f3n-Portilla, p. 122. but in the general prologue Torquemada acknowledged his use of prior writings by Francisco Xim\u00e9nez, Motolin\u00eda, Sahag\u00fan, and Mendieta, and 66 specific references are made to Mendieta in the course of the work (only 36 of which have been identified). Nevertheless, Torquemada indisputably used these sources far more extensively than he gave credit for.Alcina Franch, pp. 63-67, especially at pp. 64 and 66. ====Publication==== Once the work was in its final shape, Torquemada took the manuscript to Spain personally, despite the Comisario general de Indias (Bernardo Salva) having previously invited him to send it.Letter dated 6 April 1609 from Salva, publ. in the preliminares to the IIH online edn at pp. XXIf. The evidence that Torquemada took it to Spain resides in the permits issued in New Spain for his departure and Spain for his return (unfortunately, lacking dates) - see Le\u00f3n-Portilla, pp. 40-42. Precise dates for the trip are not known, but the termini within which the trip must have occurred can be stated with confidence. Among the documents Torquemada took to Spain with him were the various permits relative to the printing of the book which were issued in M\u00e9xico, the latest of which (the licence proper) was dated 17 May 1612. Back in Mexico, he officiated at a wedding in Xochimilco (where he was now guardian) on 10 October 1613. In between, he can be presumptively placed in Madrid on and before 4 February 1613 and again, on and before 5 May of the same year, those being the dates when written approval for the printing was granted by two officials resident in that city, who stated they had read and approved the manuscript.Le\u00f3n-Portilla: permits issued in Mexico before departure (including the licence granted by the provincial dated 17 May 1612), and Torquemada's presence in Xochimilco on 10 October 1613, p. 40; recommendations issued in Madrid, p. 41 (one, acting at the request of a senior Franciscan, with oversight of all the friars in the Indies, was by fray Francisco de Arribas, confessor of King Philip III of Spain; the other, acting by order of the Royal Council of Castile, was by Pedro de Valencia, chronicler royal). The first edition was printed by Mathias Clavijo in Seville in 1615; that is, two years after Torquemada had returned to Mexico, so his presence in Seville can only have been to select and arrange matters with the printer, and not to oversee the actual printing or check the galley-proofs. Le\u00f3n-Portilla suggests these arrangements (including the choice of type and the layout) might have taken weeks at most, giving Torquemada time to visit Madrid and other places in the land of his birth.Le\u00f3n-Portilla, p. 41. That no doubt explains how it happened that the first edition lacked two passages present in the manuscript, as well as words from some of the chapter headings, and contained countless other mistakes which the printer of the second edition noted but did not specify in his Proemio. . . en el cuerpo de la historia y en las m\u00e1rgenes, eran innumerables las faltas (in the body of the History and in the margins, the mistakes were countless). The Proemio to the 2nd edn (dated 1725 although the title page says 1723) is in the preliminares to the IIH online edn (pp. VII-XVI). Gurr\u00eda Lacroix, p. 469, says the missing passages are the last paragraph of chapter 22, and the whole of chapter 66, but without identifying the book(s). Each of books 2, 4, 5, and 20 has more than 65 chapters, and only books 12, 18 and 21 have less than 22. Despite the blemishes which marred the body of the first edition, the printer of the second edition was unstinting in his praise of the analytic indices which, he said, greatly enriched the text. According to a modern commentator, expressing also the hope that similar works would not omit a scientific apparatus of this kind, \"their usefulness and erudition are formidable\".Gurr\u00eda Lacroix, p. 469: \"[Los \u00edndices] son en verdad, de una utilidad y erudici\u00f3n formidables y ojal\u00e1 que en la actualidad no se omitiera este tipo de aparato cient\u00edfico, en obras similares.\" ====Dedication==== Exceptionally, in the Carta nuncupatoria Torquemada dedicated his book to God \u2013 a la Sacrat\u00edsima Magestad del Rey del Cielo, Dios Nuestro Se\u00f1or (to the Sacred Majesty of the King of Heaven, God Our Lord) \u2013 explaining at length why he did so. As he well knew, the normal dedication of such works was to the King of Spain, to nobles, or to ecclesiastical dignitaries (usually the patrons of the author).Gurr\u00eda Lacroix, pp. 468 and 469. A comparable dedication to the Heavenly King appears in a book of Nahuatl sermons published in Mexico in 1606 written by fray Juan Bautista, former teacher and singular amigo (special friend) of Torquemada - as he describes himself in his own pr\u00f3logo. The title-page of Juan Bautista's book opens with these words: \"A Iesu Christo S[e\u00f1or] N[uestro] ofrece este sermonario en lengua mexicana su indigno siervo Fr[ay] Ioan Baptista . . (To Jesus Christ Our Lord, his unworthy servant Juan Bautista offers this book of sermons in the Mexican language). The dedication is repeated in a verse (v.2b) from the Vulgate edition of Psalm 45 (44) printed under an engraving of Jesus (Iesu Christo Nazareno) on the title-page: Dico ego opera mea Regi (I recite my works to the King). The title page announces the same dedication: Dico Ego Opera Mea Regi. Saeculorum Inmortali et Invisibili.The first phrase is taken from verse 2b of the Vulgate edition of Psalm 45 (44) (I recite my works to the King). The second (the immortal and invisible [King] of the ages) is taken from a verse in one of the Pauline Epistles (1 Tim.1:17) : \"regi autem saeculorum inmortali invisibili soli Deo honor et gloria in saecula saeculorum amen\" (But to the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen). ====Diffusion==== Although (as noted in the following sub-section) the greater part of the print-run of the first edition was said to have been lost in a shipwreck, the Monarqu\u00eda indiana was known in Mexico as early as 1624 when it was first cited in a book published there in that year. Between then and 1714 (that is to say, before the second edition) it was cited, even copiously on occasion, by at least eleven authors in works published for the most part in Mexico, but also in Madrid and Guatemala.Gurr\u00eda Lacroix, pp. 431-435. ====Subsequent history of the text==== Title page of the second edition of Monarqu\u00eda indiana, by Fray Juan de Torquemada, printed in three volumes in Madrid, 1723 (1725) The fate of the first edition, and details of the two subsequent facsimile reprints, are stated here as given in the essay \"Ediciones\" by Jorge Gurr\u00eda Lacroix in volume 7 of the IIH critical edition.pp. 467-470. As Nicol\u00e1s Rodr\u00edguez Franco, the printer of the second edition, informed his readers in his Proemio,For the Proemio see the preliminares to the IIH online edn, at pp. IX-XVI. The relevant parts are quoted by Gurr\u00eda Lacroix. few exemplars of the first edition survive because the greater part of the print-run was lost in a shipwreck, and only three copies were known to him.One in the Royal Library, one in the Colegio Imperial of the Jesuits, and one in a private collection. Eight copies of the first edition exist in various libraries in North America and Europe, two of which lack the original frontispiece, and the other six of which lack also the first 32 pages. A ninth copy exists in Mexico divided between one owner who possesses the first volume, and another who possesses the other two. The errors and omissions were made good in the second edition by reference to the original manuscript which, so Franco discloses, was in the library of Don Andr\u00e9s Gonz\u00e1lez de Barcia. The second edition has the date 1723 on the title page, but the Proemio itself is dated 20 January 1725, so the effective publication date must have been later than that.See remarks in footnote 1 on the first page of the general introduction by Le\u00f3n-Portilla to the critical edition published by IIH (vol. 7, pp.7-11). A third edition (a new facsimile reprint rather than a new edition) was printed in Mexico in 1943 by Salvador Ch\u00e1vez Hayhoe. The only addition was a title-page identifying the data relevant to the reprint. The fourth edition, published by Editorial Porr\u00faa in Mexico in 1969 with an Introduction by Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla, was another facsimile reprint of the second edition, but, this time, employing a magnificent large paper exemplar formerly owned by the Mexican historian Joaqu\u00edn Garc\u00eda Icazbalceta. The fifth edition (substantively, the third, critical edition) was published by the Instituto de Investigaciones Hist\u00f3ricas (IIH), a research institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), in seven volumes between 1975 and 1983. A research team was assembled under the direction of Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla with the task of establishing the text (without, however, the benefit of the original manuscript, which could not be located) and of publishing it in six volumes, with (among other materials) analytic indices tracking Torquemada's sources. The decision was taken to modernise the orthography and punctuation in order to facilitate reading. Members of the team wrote various scholarly studies relevant to Torquemada and the Monarqu\u00eda indiana, which were published in 1983 as volume 7 to the series. Since 2010, this edition had been available online.See Le\u00f3n- Portilla: Advertencia to the completed work, pp. V and VI of the preliminares to the online edn; general introduction to volume 7 (pp. 7-11); and the Presentaci\u00f3n dated May, 2010 on the home page of the project on the IIH website accessed, 15 January 2014. The completed work was warmly applauded by, e.g., Woodrow Borah in his review in The Hispanic American Historical Review, Vol. 65, No. 3 (Aug., 1985), pp. 564-565 (\"The great project has borne rich yield. We should wish for more seminars of this kind\"), but not without reservations as to the decision to modernise the text). ====Critical appraisal of the work==== Until the publication of Mendieta's Historia eclesi\u00e1stica indiana in 1870, Torquemada's work was held in high esteem but, thereafter, Icazbalceta's prestige combined with his vigorous denunciation of Torquemada's supposed plagiarism of his predecessor's previously unknown History, caused the Monarqu\u00eda indiana to fall into disrepute, and many commentators disparaged its method, content, and style. From the middle of the 20th century, the work of numerous scholars has gone far to rehabilitating Torquemada and re- assessing the significance of the Monarqu\u00eda indiana. According to John Leddy Phelan, writing in 1956 (second edition revised, 1970):-See Phelan, p. 117. > For the historian of ideas the Monarqu\u00eda indiana deserves to be restored to > a position of eminence as one of the classic sources of colonial > historiography. In the opinion of Alcina Franch (1969):-See Alcina Franch, Spanish text republished in 1988, p. 70. > \"Neither the ponderous and erudite digressions . . nor the supposed > plagiarism . . can obscure the genuine value of Torquemada's work; that is, > his extraordinary assemblage of materials available at the end of the 16th > century for tracing the ancient and contemporary history of Mexico, > unwittingly salvaging numerous old sources, reports, oral traditions, etc., > which, without him, would have been forever lost beyond recall.\" > (translation from the Spanish original) More recently, it has been said (1996):-Villalba, p.39. > La importancia de la obra de Torquemada no ha sido debidamente reconocida > por parte de los especialistas, pero aquellos que la han estudiado en > profundidad coinciden en hacer una valoraci\u00f3n muy positiva. (The importance > of Torquemada's work has not been properly recognised by specialists, but > those who have given it deep study concur in a very positive appraisal) And (2002):-Rubial Garc\u00eda, at p. 351:- \". . la obra de Torquemada era algo m\u00e1s que una versi\u00f3n censurada de la de Mendieta. Con una visi\u00f3n universalista . . Con su estudio, la cultura ind\u00edgena, m\u00e1s bien la n\u00e1huatl, se insertaba en el contexto de la civilizaci\u00f3n universal a la altura de Grecia, Roma o Egipto . . M\u00e1s que un texto hist\u00f3rico, la obra de Torquemada es una especulaci\u00f3n teol\u00f3gica, surgida para explicar, dentro del esquema filos\u00f3fico occidental, la existencia de los indios americanos y el papel que su conquista y evangelizaci\u00f3n jugaron dentro del contexto de la historia de la salvaci\u00f3n\". > Torquemada's work was more than a censored version of Mendieta's . . With > his study, indigenous culture - more particularly the Nahuatl - was inserted > into the context of universal civilisation on a par with Greece, Rome and > Egypt . . More than an historical text, Torquemada's work is a theological > speculation developed in order to explain, within a western philosophical > framework, the existence of the American Indians and the role that their > conquest and evangelisation play in the context of the history of salvation. > (translation from the Spanish original) As for the author's style, opinions diverge. A judicious and broadly positive assessment such as this was made in 1890 by the American historian and ethnologist Hubert Howe Bancroft:-Bancroft, p. 505. > He rises above the mere monk chronicler and strives to interest his readers > by variety of topics, as well as by treatment, which receives no > inconsiderable aid from a descriptive power of rare occurrence among his > confreres; other faults remain, however. While concise enough in the > narrative generally, he abandons himself to inappropriate deviations and > wordy argument, and revels in learned references. By contrast, a non-specialist (who thought Torquemada arrived in New Spain in 1583 and made other elementary mistakes about his life in the few sentences he devoted to it) offered this observation which can be taken to be representative of the opposite tendency:-Preibish, p. 20. At the time, he was librarian and Hispanic and Luso-Brazilian bibliographer at Syracuse University (New York). > The value of Monarquia Indiana as a history of prehispanic Mexico and of its > conquest by Cortes is marginal. This hodgepodge of facts and fiction and of > a few interesting details lost in tedious disquisitions is important for > other reasons. . . The merit of Torquemada, if merit it be, is the fact that > in his compilation he quoted [..] unpublished chronicles, sometimes > mentioning the names of their authors, sometimes plundering parts of their > work for his Monarqu\u00eda Indiana, thus saving them from oblivion. Torquemada's > plagiarism of Jeronimo de Mendieta's work . . part of which he included in > his pot-pourri without any change, proved very useful to Joaqu\u00edn Garc\u00eda > Icazbalceta [etc.] A statue of Blessed Sebastian outside the Franciscan church in Puebla ===Minor works=== One other work published in his lifetime is known, a hagiography of fray Sebasti\u00e1n de Aparicio, a Franciscan lay brother who had died on 25 February 1600 and whose reputation of exemplary living resulted in his beatification in 1789.Ronald J. Morgan, Spanish American Saints and the Rhetoric of Identity, Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 2002, pp. 39-66. Known by its shortened title Vida y milagros del santo confesor de Cristo, fray Sebasti\u00e1n de Aparicio (The Life and Miracles of the Holy Confessor of Christ, Friar Sebasti\u00e1n de Aparicio), it was printed in 1602 by Diego L\u00f3pez D\u00e1valos at the presses of the Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco, and in Seville in 1605.See the pr\u00f3logo of Juan Bautista to his Sermonario en lengua mexicana (1606). Also, Le\u00f3n-Portilla, p. 18 (in the footnote carried over from the previous page), and p. 31; and Rubial Garc\u00eda, pp. 343f. Torquemada himself mentioned playlets or scenes (\"comedias o reprecentaciones\") he had written in Nahuatl for members of the Confraternity of Our Lady of Soledad to perform at the chapel of San Jos\u00e9 de los naturales, a large mostly open space adjacent to the main Franciscan church of San Francisco de M\u00e9xico which could accommodate thousands of persons. None of these pieces have survived.Monarqu\u00eda indiana, Lib. XX, cap. 79 quoted by Le\u00f3n-Portilla at pp. 27f.). Other writings include two unpublished letters found in the General Archive of the Indies in Seville (dating from 1620), and two long apologetic \"Statements\" (or alegatos, dating from 1621) eventually published by Icazbalceta. These argue - one from a theological and canonical perspective, the other from a historical perspective - that members of the three Mendicant orders then active in New Spain should not be subjected to examination by the diocesan bishopsExcerpts from two of the letters (both dated to October 1620) are in Le\u00f3n-Portilla, at pp. 44f. The two alegatos (discussed ibid. at pp. 46f.) were published by Icazbalceta along with Mendieta's Historia in: C\u00f3dice Mendieta, Documentos franciscanos siglos XVI y XVII, Nueva colecci\u00f3n de documentos para la historia de M\u00e9xico, M\u00e9xico, 1892, Vol. 5, p. 125-240. ==References== ==Sources== * :- (Spanish version, originally published in 1969, of the chapter in the 1973 Handbook) *Arroyo, Salvador Guilliem Iglesia de Santiago de Tlatelolco, 1 and Iglesia de Santiago de Tlatelolco, 2, companion articles posted on the website of Instituto nacional de antropolog\u00eda y historia (INAH), a research institute of UNAM, accessed 12 January 2014 * * * * * * * *, Vol. 2, No. 4 (Dec., 1962), pp. 234\u2013243 * * * :- :- * Vol. 1, No. 2 * * :- * * * * * * Vol. XVI, n\u00fam. 61, pp. 73\u201380 * * ==External links== *Picture of the Cloister of the Monastery of Santiago Tlatelolco *Encarta (Archived 2009-10-31) Category:Aztec scholars Category:Novohispanic Mesoamericanists Category:17th-century Mesoamericanists Category:People of New Spain Category:1560s births Category:1624 deaths Category:People from the Province of Palencia Category:Colonial Mexico Category:Historians of Franciscan history ",
