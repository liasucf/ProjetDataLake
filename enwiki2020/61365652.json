    "text": "The Gavino Anaya House, at 2939 Duranes Rd., NW in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It is a terron building with a flat roof, two-foot thick walls, and low doors and windows, with no foundation. It was probably built in a linear style of a row of rooms, probably one at a time; two rooms added later transformed it to an L-shaped plan. It was assessed by historian Bainbridge Bunting to have been built in the early 1800s, and it is \"possibly the oldest least-altered house in the city. Because of its probable age and since it is one of only five minimally altered traditional early L-shaped homes still standing in Albuquerque, the Gavino Anaya House is of local significance.\" With ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Bernalillo County, New Mexico ",
