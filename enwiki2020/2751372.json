    "text": "Castle of St John The Castle of St John is an early 16th-century L-plan tower house in the centre of Stranraer, in Dumfries and Galloway, southwest Scotland. It was built by the Adairs of Kilhilt (who originally came from Ireland) c.1510. It has been used as a home, a court, a police station and as a military garrison during the \"Killing Times\" of Covenanter persecution in the 1680s. During the Victorian era, the castle was modified to serve as a prison, and it was used as an ARP base during the Second World War. The castle was refurbished in the late 1980s and is now a museum. ==References== ==External links== *Castle of St John - official site * St. John Category:Castles in Wigtownshire Category:Category A listed buildings in Dumfries and Galloway Category:Listed castles in Scotland Category:Listed prison buildings in Scotland Category:Museums in Dumfries and Galloway Category:History museums in Scotland Category:Prison museums in the United Kingdom Category:Defunct prisons in Scotland Category:Military and war museums in England Category:Stranraer Category:Tower houses in Scotland ",
