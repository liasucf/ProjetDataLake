    "text": "The Burmese alphabet (, ) is an abugida used for writing Burmese. It is ultimately a Brahmic script adapted from either the Kadamba or Pallava alphabet of South India and more immediately an adaptation of Old Mon or Pyu script. The Burmese alphabet is also used for the liturgical languages of Pali and Sanskrit. In recent decades, other, related alphabets, such as Shan and modern Mon, have been restructured according to the standard of the now- dominant Burmese alphabet. (See Burmese script.) Burmese is written from left to right and requires no spaces between words, although modern writing usually contains spaces after each clause to enhance readability. The earliest evidence of the Burmese alphabet is dated to 1035, while a casting made in the 18th century of an old stone inscription points to 984.Aung-Thwin (2005): 167\u2013178, 197\u2013200 Burmese calligraphy originally followed a square format but the cursive format took hold from the 17th century when popular writing led to the wider use of palm leaves and folded paper known as parabaiks. A stylus would rip these leaves when making straight lines.Lieberman (2003): 136 The alphabet has undergone considerable modification to suit the evolving phonology of the Burmese language. There are several systems of transliteration into the Latin alphabet; for this article, the MLC Transcription System is used. ==Alphabet== ===History=== A Pali manuscript of the Buddhist text Mahaniddesa showing three different styles of the Burmese script, (top) medium square, (centre) round and (bottom) outline round in red lacquer from the inside of one of the gilded covers The Burmese alphabet is an adaptation of the Old Mon scriptHarvey (1925): 307 or the Pyu script, and it is ultimately of South Indian origin, from either the Kadamba or Pallava alphabet. The scholar Aung-Thwin has argued that the Burmese script most likely descended from the Pyu script and not from the Old Mon script, as there is no historical record of Mon migration from Dvaravati to Lower Burma, no inscription found in the Dvaravati script in Lower Burma, no proven relationship between the writing systems of Dvaravati and Pagan, and there are no dated Old Mon inscriptions except for those written in the Burmese script, in the entire country of Myanmar. There is however a paleographic link between the Burmese script and Pyu script, and there were close cultural, linguistic, historic and political ties between Pyu and Burmese speakers for at least two to three centuries before the first contact between Burmese speakers and Mon speakers. Aung-Thwin therefore argues that Mon script descended from Burmese script and not vice versa. ===Arrangement=== As with other Brahmic scripts, the Burmese alphabet is arranged into groups of five letters for stop consonants called wek (, from Pali ) based on articulation. Within each group, the first letter is tenuis (\"plain\"), the second is the aspirated homologue, the third and fourth are the voiced homologues and the fifth is the nasal homologue. This is true of the first twenty-five letters in the Burmese alphabet, which are called grouped together as wek byi (, from Pali ). The remaining eight letters (, , , , , , , ) are grouped together as a wek (, lit. \"without group\"), as they are not arranged in any particular pattern. ===Letters=== A letter is a consonant or consonant cluster that occurs before the vowel of a syllable. The Burmese script has 33 letters to indicate the initial consonant of a syllable and four diacritics to indicate additional consonants in the onset. Like other abugidas, including the other members of the Brahmic family, vowels are indicated in Burmese script by diacritics, which are placed above, below, before or after the consonant character. A consonant character with no vowel diacritic has the inherent vowel (often reduced to when another syllable follows in the same word). The following table provides the letter, the syllable onset in IPA and the way the letter is referred to in Burmese, which may be either a descriptive name or just the sound of the letter, arranged in the traditional order: {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\" width=\"6%\" | Group name !!

Consonant letters may be modified by one or more medial diacritics (three at most), indicating an additional consonant before the vowel.

Typically, one circle should be done with one stroke, and all circles are written clockwise. Exceptions are mostly letters with an opening on top. The circle of these letters is written with two strokes coming from opposite directions. The 10 letters below are exceptions to the clockwise rule: \u1015, \u1016, \u1017, \u1019, \u101a, \u101c, \u101f, \u1003, \u100e, \u100f. Some versions of stroke order may be slightly different. The Burmese stroke order can be learned from \u1015\u1011\u1019\u1010\u1014\u103a\u1038 \u1019\u103c\u1014\u103a\u1019\u102c\u1016\u1010\u103a\u1005\u102c \u1042\u1040\u1041\u1047-\u1042\u1040\u1041\u1048 (Burmese Grade 1, 2017-2018), a textbook published by the Burmese Ministry of Education.

In addition, other modifying symbols are used to differentiate tone and sound, but are not considered diacritics. ===History=== La hswe () used in old Burmese from the Bagan to Innwa periods (12th century - 16th century), and could be combined with other diacritics (ya pin, ha hto and wa hswe) to form .Herbert et al (1989): 5\u20132MLC (1993) Similarly, until the Innwa period, ya pin was also combined with ya yit. From the early Bagan period to the 19th century, was used instead of for the rhyme Early Burmese writing also used , not the high tone marker , which came into being in the 16th century. Moreover, , which disappeared by the 16th century, was subscripted to represent creaky tone (now indicated with ). During the early Bagan period, the rhyme (now represented with the diacritic ) was represented with ). The diacritic combination disappeared in the mid-1750s (typically designated as Middle Burmese), having been replaced with the combination, introduced in 1638. The standard tone markings found in modern Burmese can be traced to the 19th century. ===Stacked consonants=== Certain sequences of consonants are written one atop the other, or stacked. A pair of stacked consonants indicates that no vowel is pronounced between them, as for example the m-bh in kambha \"world\". This is equivalent to using a virama on the first consonant (in this case, the m); if the m and bh were not stacked, the inherent vowel a would be assumed (* kamabha). Stacked consonants are always homorganic (pronounced in the same place in the mouth), which is indicated by the traditional arrangement of the Burmese alphabet into five-letter rows of letters called . Consonants not found in a row beginning with k, c, t, or p can only be doubled \u2013 that is, stacked with themselves. When stacked, the first consonant (the final of the preceding syllable, in this case m) is written as usual, while the second consonant (the onset of the following syllable, in this case bh) is subscripted beneath it. {|class=\"wikitable\" ! Group !! Possible combinations !! Transcriptions !! Example |- | K || , , , || kk, kkh, gg, ggh [also ng?] || dukkha (), meaning \"suffering\" |- | C || , , , , , , , || cc, cch, jj, jjh, nyc, nych, nyj, nyjh || wijja (), meaning \"knowledge\" |- \u100f\u1039\u100c | T || , , , , , || tt, tth, dd, ddh, nt, nd || kanda (), meaning \"section\" |- | T || , , , , , , , , || tt, tth, dd, ddh, nt, nth, nd, ndh, nn || manta. le: (), Mandalay, a city in Burma |- | P || , , , , , , , , || pp, pph, bb, bbh, mp, mb, mbh, mm || kambha (), meaning \"world\" |- | (other) || , , || ss, ll, ll || pissa (), meaning viss, a traditional Burmese unit of weight measurement |- |} Stacked consonants are mostly confined to loan words from languages like Pali, Sanskrit, and occasionally English. For instance, the Burmese word for \"paper\" (a Pali loan) is spelt , not *, although both would be read the same. They are not found in native Burmese words except for the purpose of abbreviation. For example, the Burmese word \"daughter\" is sometimes abbreviated to , even though the stacked consonants do not belong to the same row and a vowel is pronounced between. Similarly, \"tea\" is commonly abbreviated to . Also, ss is written \u103f, not \u101e\u1039\u101e. ==Digits== A decimal numbering system is used, and numbers are written in the same order as Hindu-Arabic numerals. The digits from zero to nine are: (Unicode 1040 to 1049). The number 1945 would be written as . Separators, such as commas, are not used to group numbers. ==Punctuation== There are two primary break characters in Burmese, drawn as one or two downward strokes: (called , , , or ) and (called , , or ), which respectively act as a comma and a full stop. There is a Shan exclamation mark . Other abbreviations used in literary Burmese are: * \u2014 used as a full stop if the sentence immediately ends with a verb. * \u2014 used as a conjunction. * \u2014 locative ('at'). * \u2014 ditto (used in columns and lists) ==See also== *Romanization of Burmese *Burmese script *Burmese Braille *Burmese respelling of the English alphabet == References == == Bibliography == * * * * *Hosken, Martin.
