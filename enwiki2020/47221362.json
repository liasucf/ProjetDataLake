He was natural of Ndjiakom-Esambira, on the district of Bata (in the current Litoral Province), he worked as a farmer in the northern banks of the Campo River as did many of the Fang people settled in the far north of the Continental Region of Equatorial Guinea at the districts of Bata, Niefang, Mikomeseng and Ebibey\u00edn respectively. He was a member of the Indigenous Trust and one of the leaders of the organization Cruzada Nacional de Liberaci\u00f3n de Guinea Ecuatorial (National Liberation Crusade of Equatorial Guinea) (CNLGE), created at the beginning of 1950, although some sources suggest a creation date at 1947 or 1948.

Some of his best known supporters were bubi Mark Ropo Uri and fang people Enrique Nvo and Francisco Micha Ondo, a prestigious catechist who served in the mission of Nkue-Efulan. In 1954, as proposed by Atanasio Ndongo, the CNLGE changed its name as Movimiento Nacional de Liberaci\u00f3n de Guinea Ecuatorial (National Liberation Movement of Equatorial Guinea)(MONALIGE)La Guinea Ecuatorial: Reminiscencia hist\u00f3rica, experiencia de las luces y de las sombras de un proyecto pol\u00edtico, art\u00edculo de Eugenio Nkogo Ond\u00f3. As the visible head of MONALIGE on the mainland, in November 28, 1959, Mane was arrested in Bata, near the Catholic Mission; he was transferred to the Marine barracks and then embarked on a ship that sailed to Bioko, but that did not reach the island. Since then it is believed he was thrown into the sea.Acacio Ma\u00f1\u00e9 El\u00e1, una historia por contar, Oyono Ayingono, Carmela.
