    "text": "Nybroegade 22 is a mid 19th-century property overlooking Slotsholmen Canal and Christiansborg in central Copenhagen, Denmark. The building and a house at Magstr\u00e6de on the other side of the block were listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1945. ==History== A painting of the previous building at the site J\u00f8rgen Peter Bech (1782-1846), who would later become a wealthy merchant and shipowner, bought a soap manufactory at the site in circa 1800. Bech was the maternal grandfather of the writer Wilhelm Bergs\u00f8e. Bergs\u00f8e often visited the house on Sundays and in holidays and has written about his grandfather's household in Nybrogade in De forbistrede b\u00f8rn. The current building at the site was built in 1852-1853 for decorative painter Carl L\u00f8ffler (1810-1853). He would, however, already die from cholera on 28 July that same year as one of approximately 4,800 victims of the 1853 Copenhagen cholera outbreak. He is buried in Assistens Cemetery. ==Architecture== The building is five storeys tall and seven bays wide. The roof features three dormer windows. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 16 July 1945. ==See also== * Warburg House == References == ==External links== Category:Listed residential buildings in Copenhagen Category:Residential buildings completed in 1853 ",
