In 2006 he defended at the Jagiellonian University his Ph.D. thesis on European Union election observation missions. Besides Polish and Turkish, he speaks English, French, Croatian, Spanish, Russian, German, and Arabic languages. Kumoch started his professional career at the Centre for Eastern Studies as an analyst on Balkan states (2000\u20132001). For the next ten years he has been covering international relations as a journalist. Following his position of Polish Press Agency foreign correspondent in Moscow, he was working for Przekr\u00f3j weekly (2005\u20132006) and Dziennik Polska-Europa-\u015awiat daily (2006\u20132009). Since 2010 he has been working again as an analyst on international relations at the Polish Institute of International Affairs (2010), the Sobieski Institute (2011\u20132013). Between 2011 and 2016 he was also engaged in the EU election observerion missions (EUEOMs) as an expert and press officer. In 2015 he was invitited by the president Andrzej Duda to the National Development Council \u2013 Security, Defense, Foreign Policy Section. On 14 October 2016 he was nominated Poland ambassador to Switzerland, accredited also to Liechtenstein. Within a week he presented his diplomatic credentials. As an ambassador, in 2017, he contributed to the discovery and publicity of Polish diplomats in Switzerland saving European Jews from Holocaust (\u0141ado\u015b Group). In 2019, he was awarded by the Minister of Culture for \"preserving the cultural heritage abroad\". He co-authored list of names of 3262 holders of passports issued by \u0141ado\u015b Group, which in December 2019 was presented at the Pilecki Institute in Warsaw. According to Lucien Scherrer of the Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung, \"within [Swiss] diplomatic and political circles Kumoch is seen as an agitator in service of the PiS government.\" Councilman Hans-Peter Portmann is quoted as saying: \"The fact that an ambassador intervenes in the press constantly is unusual. An emissary should adhere to local customs, including respect for the freedom of expression.\" Councilman Claude Janiak of the Switzerland-Poland Group, is also quoted: \"I wonder if it's part of [Kumoch's] job to foster a domestic Polish political dispute.\" His service has been highly appreciated in Poland though, being accepted by both ruling and opposing parties of Polish Sejm for next ambassador term, in Turkey. He received nomination on 2 March 2020. Kumoch is married, with two children. == Works == * == References == Category:1975 births Category:Ambassadors of Poland to Switzerland Category:Ambassadors of Poland to Turkey Category:Living people Category:University of Warsaw alumni Category:Diplomats from Warsaw Category:Polish political scientists Category:Journalists from Warsaw ",
