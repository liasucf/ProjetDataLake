    "text": "Theonomy, from theos (god) and nomos (law), is a hypothetical Christian form of government in which society is ruled by divine law. Theonomists hold that divine law, including the judicial laws of the Old Testament, should be observed by modern societies. Theonomy is distinct from the \"theonomous ethics\" proposed by Paul Tillich. ==Origin== Thomas Aquinas held that \"if a sovereign were to order these judicial precepts to be observed in his kingdom, he would not sin.\"Summa Theologica, I-II, q. 104, a. 3 Although Aquinas believed the specifics of the Old Testament judicial laws were no longer binding, he taught that the judicial precepts contained universal principles of justice that reflected natural law, a view on government known as \"General Equity Theonomy\".Clausen, Mark A., Professor of History, Cedarville University \"Theonomy in the Middle Ages\". Paper presented at the 2005 annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Marriott Wardman Park, Omni Shoreham, Washington Hilton, Washington, DC. In the later terminology of Christian reconstructionism, theonomy is the idea that God provides the basis of both personal and social ethics in the Bible. Theonomic ethics asserts that the Bible has been given as the abiding standard for all human government \u2013 individual, family, church, and civil \u2013 and that biblical Law must be incorporated into a Christian theory of biblical ethics. Some critics see theonomy as a significant form of dominion theology, which they define as a type of theocracy. Theonomy posits that the biblical law is applicable to civil law, and theonomists propose biblical law as the standard by which the laws of nations may be measured, and to which they ought to be conformed. ==Goals== Various theonomic authors have stated such goals as \"the universal development of Biblical theocratic republics,\"Chilton, David, Paradise Restored: A Biblical Theology of Dominion, Appendix A exclusion of non- Christians from voting and citizenship,North, Gary, Political Polytheism, p. 87 and the application of Biblical law by the state.Bahnsen, Greg, By This Standard: The Authority Of God's Law Today, pp. 346-347 Under such a system of biblical law, homosexual acts,DeMar, Gary, Ruler of the Nations, p. 212 adultery, witchcraft, and blasphemyNorth, Gary, Unconditional Surrender: God's Program for Victory, p. 118 would be punishable by death. Propagation of idolatry or \"false religions\" would be illegalAn Interview with Greg L. Bahnsen and could also be punished by the death penalty.Rushdoony, R.J., The Institutes of Biblical Law, (Nutley, NJ: Craig Press, 1973), pp. 38\u201339.Schwertley, Brian M., \"Political Polytheism\" More recent theonomic writers such as Joel McDurmon, President of American Vision, have moved away from this position, stating that these death penalties are no longer binding in the new covenant.Joel McDurmon, The Bounds of Love (2016). Polemicist and theonomy critic, JD Hall, who debated McDurmon in 2015,The Theonomy Debate | Joel McDurmon vs. Jordan Hall has argued that abandoning Mosaic penologies such as the death penalty means that McDurmon and others who hold similar positions cannot be said to hold to theonomy in any meaningful way.Hall, J.D., \"On Joel McDurmon\u2019s Abandonment of Theonomy\" According to theonomist Greg Bahnsen, the laws of God are the standard which Christian voters and officials ought to pursue. Civil officials are also not constrained to literally enforce every biblical law, such as one-time localized imperatives, certain administrative details, typological foreshadows, or those against envy and unbelief. \"Rulers should enforce only those laws for which God revealed social sanctions to be imposed.\"Bahnsen, Greg L. By This Standard: The Authority of God's Law Today, p. 10. Tyler, TX: Institute for Christian Economics, 1985 ==Relation to Reformed theology== Some in the modern Reformed churches are critical of any relationship between the historical Reformed faith and theonomy,See, for instance, Theonomy: A Reformed Critique published by the faculty of Westminster Theological Seminary and Westminster Seminary California. Also \"The Westminster Confession of Faith: A Theonomic Document?\" by Ligon Duncan. while other Calvinists affirm that theonomy is consistent with historic Reformed confessions.See Theonomic Ethics and the Westminster Confession by Kenneth Gentry, The New Puritanism: A Preliminary Assessment of Christian Reconstruction by Robert Bowman, Jr., Theonomy and the Westminster Confession by Martin Foulner, The Theonomic Precedent in the Theology of John Calvin by Christopher Strevel, and Calvinism and the Judicial Law of Moses by James Jordan, and The Theonomic Thesis in Confessional and Historical Perspective by Greg Bahnsen.
