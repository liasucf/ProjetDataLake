    "text": "Reese's Cupfusion is a dark ride attraction at Hersheypark. It began operation on Saturday, May 25. The ride features a turbulent journey through the Reese\u2019s Central to stop Mint and his misfit candies from stealing the Crystal Cup that collects Reese\u2019s Spirit. It was conceptualized and designed by Raven Sun Creative and is being built by Sally Corporation, the same manufacturer as that of Reese's Cupfusion's predecessor, Reese's Xtreme Cup Challenge, which closed on September 3, 2018. ==Ride experience== Riders take on the role of security agents at the Reese's factory. Lead by Commander Cup, the riders' keep the factory running by protecting the Reese's Crystal Cup. The cup collects your love of chocolate and peanut butter known as Reese\u2019s Spirit and creates energy that powers the factory. Mint the Merciless and his misfit candy crew try to steal it. The riders job is to fight back and to ensure the world is never deprived of Reese\u2019s. == References == Category:Hersheypark Category:Amusement rides introduced in 2019 ",
