He is currently the Chairman of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Council, the upper house of the bicameral legislature of Jammu and Kashmir. He was nominated as the Chairman of the Upper House on the 12th of April, 2015. == Political career == In the 2002 J&K; state Legislative Assembly Elections, the election campaign of the future first Cabinet Minister from Kargil, Haji Nisar Ali was launched from the transport office compound of Haji Anayat Ali which was a huge success. In the 2008 Legislative Assembly Elections, Haji Anayat Ali's support in the capacity of Youth Wing President of Islamia School Kargil, proved beneficial for National Conference in securing victory over the two MLA seats of the district. The 2008 LAHDC Kargil elections had also went in favor of the candidates whom he supported. In the 2009 Indian General Elections the MP seat of Ladakh went to Haji Ghulam Hassan Khan, the independent candidate supported by Islamia School Kargil with Haji Anayat Ali as its youth wing President. In late 2014, Haji Anayat Ali joined the Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party which was considered a reckless move at the time as PDP had no support base in Kargil. However the inclusion of a third option on the political scene of Kargil was well received by the masses. The 2014 Assembly Election results established PDP as a prominent political factor in the complex and competitive political equation of Kargil district as despite losing the elections it managed to gather almost 30% of the total vote cast. In early 2015 he was nominated as Member of the Legislative Council J&K;, representing Kargil. In August 2019, he left PDP to join BJP.https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/ladakh-mp-jamyang-tsering-namgyal- and-jammu-and-kashmir-legislative-council-chairman-haji-anayat-ali-kargil- leaders-join-bjp-1591883-2019-08-26 ==References== Category:Bharatiya Janata Party politicians from Ladakh Category:Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party politicians Category:Members of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Council Category:Living people Category:People from Kargil district Category:Jammu and Kashmir MLAs 2014\u20132018 Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Chairs of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Council Category:Members of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly Category:Ladakh politicians ",
