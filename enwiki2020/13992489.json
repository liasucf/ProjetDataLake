    "text": "Albin Pelak (born 9 April 1981) is a Bosnian-Herzegovinian football player. ==Career== Albin Pelak is a current FK Olimpik Sarajevo and former FK \u017deljezni\u010dar football player. He is most famous in Bosnian and Sarajevo circles for signing with \u017deljezni\u010dar after making an explicit promise to Sarajevo supporters that he would never play there. Prior to signing with \u017deljezni\u010dar, Pelak was one of the most popular players for Sarajevo, earning the praise of the press as well supporters for his high work rate and leadership ability. He was a key part of Sarajevo's exceptionally talented youth squad composed of players born in 1981/1982 that was one of the most talented squads in Bosnia- Herzegovina's history. Many players from that generation such as Alen \u0160koro, D\u017eemal Berberovi\u0107, Damir Mirvi\u0107 went on to have relatively successful careers in Europe. Pelak himself also made several tries, albeit unsuccessful at playing abroad, going to Cerezo Osaka of Japan in 2002 and Dinamo Zagreb of neighboring Croatia in 2003. While he did not stay at either club for very long, it has been reported that he has been paid handsomely for his failed bids abroad; his deal with Cerzo Osaka reportedly netted him \u20ac1 million. On 4 April 2009 Pelak ended his contract with FK \u017deljezni\u010dar and signed a contract with FK Olimpik Sarajevo, playing in Premier League. ==Club statistics== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !colspan=3|Club performance !colspan=2|League |- !Season !Club !League !Apps!!Goals |- !colspan=3|Bosnia and Herzegovina !colspan=2|League |- |1999/00||rowspan=\"4\"|Sarajevo||rowspan=\"4\"|Premier League||8||0 |- |2000/01||35||10 |- |2001/02||24||1 |- |2002/03||17||7 |- !colspan=3|Japan !colspan=2|League |- |2003||Cerezo Osaka||J1 League||3||1 |- !colspan=3|Bosnia and Herzegovina !colspan=2|League |- |2003/04||rowspan=\"3\"|Sarajevo||rowspan=\"3\"|Premier League||20||4 |- |2004/05||11||3 |- |2005/06||12||4 |- |2005/06||rowspan=\"2\"|\u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo||rowspan=\"2\"|Premier League||6||2 |- |2006/07||13||5 |- !colspan=3|Russia !colspan=2|League |- |2007||Zvezda Irkutsk||First Division||6||0 |- !colspan=3|Bosnia and Herzegovina !colspan=2|League |- |2007/08||rowspan=\"2\"|\u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo||rowspan=\"2\"|Premier League||11||3 |- |2008/09||12||3 |- |2009/10||Olimpik Sarajevo||Premier League|||| |- !rowspan=3| Country !!colspan=2| Bosnia and Herzegovina !129||37 |- !colspan=2|Japan !3||1 |- !colspan=2|Russia !6||0 |- !colspan=3|Total !138||38 |} ==National team statistics== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !colspan=3|Bosnia and Herzegovina national team |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2002||1||0 |- |2003||0||0 |- |2004||0||0 |- |2005||1||0 |- !Total||2||0 |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Bosniaks of Serbia Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina footballers Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina expatriate footballers Category:NK Vara\u017edin players Category:FK Sarajevo players Category:FK \u017deljezni\u010dar players Category:GNK Dinamo Zagreb players Category:Cerezo Osaka players Category:Expatriate footballers in Japan Category:J1 League players Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina international footballers Category:Sportspeople from Novi Pazar Category:FC Zvezda Irkutsk players Category:Expatriate footballers in Russia Category:FK Olimpik players Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Association football midfielders ",
