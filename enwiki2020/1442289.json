    "text": "Elections in Lithuania, are held to select members of the parliament, the president, members of the municipal councils and mayors, as well as delegates to the European Parliament. Lithuanian citizens can also vote in mandatory or consultative referendums. Lithuania was one of the first countries in the world to grant women a right to vote in the elections. Lithuanian women were allowed to vote by the 1918 Constitution of Lithuania and used their newly granted right for the first time in 1919. By doing so, Lithuania allowed it earlier than such democratic countries as the United States (1920), France (1945), and Switzerland (1971). 71 of the members in the 141-seat parliament, elected to a four-year term, are elected in single-seat constituencies, in a majority vote. The remaining 70 members are elected in a nationwide election based on proportional representation. The structure of the elections means that a large number of parties are represented in the parliament and coalition governments are common. The head of the state - the president - is elected to a five-year term in a majority vote, with the president eligible for up to two terms in office. More than 1500 municipal council members are elected in local elections to four-year terms, with the majority of the seats allocated using proportional representation and the mayors elected directly by residents in a majority vote. The Lithuanian representatives in the European Parliament, currently numbering 11, are elected using proportional representation every five years. 12 referendums have been organized in Lithuania, initiated by either citizens or the parliament. Of these, only four have seen the referendum question approved in a referendum deemed to have taken place. Voting in elections is generally open to all citizens of Lithuania who are at least 18 years of age. Citizens of other European Union countries that permanently reside in Lithuania can vote in the Lithuanian elections to the European Parliament. Voting in municipal elections is open to all residents of Lithuania, regardless of their citizenship. Voting process is organized by the Central Electoral Commission and subordinate electoral bodies and is monitored by local and international observers. The voters vote in a secret ballot and the elections have generally been assessed as free and fair, although allegations of irregularities have been common. == Elections to the Seimas == === Process and eligibility === Seimas Palace in VilniusThe parliament (Lietuvos Respublikos Seimas) has 141 members, elected to a four-year term, with 71 members elected in single-seat constituencies and 70 members elected by proportional representation. Lithuania exhibits a fragmented multi-party system, with a number of small parties in which coalition governments are common. Ordinary elections to the Seimas take place on the second Sunday of October. To be eligible for election, candidates must be at least 25 years old on the election day, not under allegiance to a foreign state and permanently reside in Lithuania. Persons serving or due to serve a sentence imposed by the court 65 days before the election are not eligible. Also, judges, citizens performing military service, and servicemen of professional military service and officials of statutory institutions and establishments may not stand for election. In addition, the Lithuanian law stipulates that a person who has been removed from office through impeachment may not be elected for four years after their removal, although the limit of four years has been suspended by the Lithuanian constitutional court, which stated that the Lithuanian constitution does not allow for persons impeached for a breach of constitution or their oath of office to stand in elections indefinitely. This provision of the constitution had been ruled to be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. Parliament members in the 71 single-seat constituencies are elected in a majority vote if the voter turnout in the constituency is at least 40%. If the voter turnout is less than 40%, the candidate with the most votes (and at least 20% of the votes) is declared a winner. If there are more than two candidates and no candidate wins in the first round, a second round of voting is held within 15 days. The two leading candidates from the first round are eligible for the second round of voting. The candidate that gets more votes in the second round is declared a winner, regardless of voter turnout. The remaining 70 seats are allocated to the participating political parties proportionally to the share of vote received, using the largest remainder method. Parties receiving less than 5% of the vote and joint multi- party electoral lists receiving less than 7% of the vote are not eligible to receive any seats, unless the remaining eligible parties received less than 60% of the vote. Candidates take the seats allocated to their parties based on the preference lists submitted before the election. The preference lists are adjusted by preference votes given by the voters. === Elections and results === Seven elections of the Seimas have been held in Lithuania since independence. The first election in independent Lithuania was held on 25 October 1992, with a run-off on 15 November. 24 parties and political movements contested the Seimas seats. The election was won by the (ex- communist) Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania, which gained 73 seats and 44% of the popular vote. Analysts attributed the victory to the support the party found among the Russian and Polish minorities, farmers, as well as to popular dissatisfaction with the economic situation, particularly the fuel shortage. S\u0105j\u016bdis, which had led Lithuania into independence finished distant second with 30 seats. The 1996 parliamentary election was held on 20 October with the run-off on 10 November. This time, Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania suffered as a result of poor economic situation and financial scandals, including one involving former Prime Minister Adolfas \u0160le\u017eevi\u010dius. The election was won by the Homeland Union - Lithuanian Conservative Party, which gained 70 seats and 31% of the vote. Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party were distant second with 16 seats, followed by Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania with 12. The 2000 parliamentary election was held on 8 October. The election was held in the context of economic crisis brought about by Russian financial crisis of 1998, austerity and high-profile privatization. Liberal Union of Lithuania won the most seats of any party in the election, with 33, although a joint list \"Social-Democratic Coalition of Algirdas Brazauskas\" won the highest share of the popular vote with 31%. The Liberal Union formed the government with New Union (Social Liberals), Lithuanian Centre Union and the Modern Christian Democrats. The coalition was short-lived and Algirdas Brazauskas, a social democrat, became the prime minister less than a year later. The Social Democrats remained at the helm of the government after the 2004 parliamentary election, which was held on 10 October, with the run-off on 24 October. The party was the third-largest in the parliament after the election with 20 seats, behind Labour Party with 39 and Homeland Union (Lithuanian Conservatives) with 25, but managed to govern together with New Union (Social Liberals) (11 seats), the Labour Party and the support of other parties. It was the first time since independence that a ruling government survived an election. The 2008 parliamentary election was held on 12 October, with a run-off on 26 October. Homeland Union won the election dominated by taxation and potential introduction of Euro. Rising inflation and potential economic downturn were also high on the agenda following several years of rapid growth. Homeland Union (45 seats) formed a coalition government with populist and short-lived National Resurrection Party (16 seats), Liberal Movement (11 seats) and Liberal and Centre Union (8 seats). Social Democrats was the largest party in opposition with 25 seats. The 2012 parliamentary election was held on 14 October, with a run-off on 28 October. The Social Democrats became the largest party in the Seimas and defeated the center-right coalition of Andrius Kubilius. The Social Democrats, with 38 seats, formed a government coalition with Labour Party (19 seats), Order and Justice (11 seats) and Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania (8 seats), with the latter party later withdrawing from the government. Homeland Union (33 seats) withdrew to the opposition after four years in government. The 2016 parliamentary election was held on 9 October, with a run-off on 23 October. The election was a surprise victory for Peasant and Greens Union, which won 54 seats in the parliament - the largest tally by a single party in Lithuania for 20 years. Homeland Union won the largest share of the vote (22.63%) and 20 mandates in the nationwide constituency, but a disappointing performance in single-member constituencies left the party a distant second with 31 seats. Peasants and Greens formed a coalition with the Social Democrats, who won 17 seats in the parliament. {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right !rowspan=2|Election !rowspan=2|Turnout !colspan=3|Largest party/list !colspan=3|2nd largest party/list !colspan=3|3rd largest party/list |- !

Algirdas Brazauskas, a former communist party leader, was the first elected president of independent Lithuania. Election took place on 14 February 1993, with Brazauskas defeating Stasys Lozoraitis, a Lithuanian diplomat, who had spent almost all his life in Italy and the United States representing interwar Lithuania. Brazauskas won with 60% of the vote. Brazauskas did not stand in the 1997-1998 presidential election, held on 21 December 1997, with the second round on 4 January 1998. In the election, Art\u016bras Paulauskas, a former Prosecutor General of Lithuania won the first round with 44.7% of the vote, but was defeated in the second round by Valdas Adamkus, a former US civil servant, who got 50% of the vote compared to 49.2% by Paulauskas. Adamkus stood for reelection in the Lithuanian presidential election, 2002\u20132003, which took place 22 December 2002, with the second round on 5 January 2003. After leading in the first round with 35.1% of the vote, Adamkus was convincingly defeated in the second round by Rolandas Paksas, a former Prime Minister and Mayor of Vilnius who received 54.2% of the vote. Rolandas Paksas was subsequently impeached and removed from office, prompting early election in 2004. Valdas Adamkus became the first President of Lithuania to be elected for a second term, leading the first round with 30.2% of the vote and defeating Kazimiera Prunskien\u0117 in the second round with 51.8%. Valdas Adamkus was not eligible to stand for reelection in 2009 due to term limits. In the election that took place on 17 May 2009, European Commissioner Dalia Grybauskait\u0117 won in the first round with more than 68% of the vote. Grybauskait\u0117 became the country's first female president. Grybauskaite was reelected in the 2014 presidential election that took place on 11 May 2014, with a second round held on 25 May. Grybauskait\u0117 received 45.9% of vote in the first round and defeated Zigmantas Bal\u010dytis in the second round with 57.9% of all votes. She became the first president of Lithuania to be reelected for a second consecutive term. {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right !rowspan=2|Election !colspan=2|Turnout, % !colspan=3|Winner, vote % !colspan=3|Runner-up, vote % |- !First round !Second round ! !First round !Second round ! !First round !Second round |- |align=right|1993||78.07||-||align=left|Algirdas Brazauskas||60.03||-||align=left|Stasys Lozoraitis||38.28||- |- |align=right|1997-1998||71.45||73.66||align=left|Valdas Adamkus||27.56||49.96||align=left|Art\u016bras Paulauskas||44.73||49.22 |- |align=right|2002-2003||53.92||52.65||align=left|Rolandas Paksas||19.40||54.15||align=left|Valdas Adamkus||35.06||44.83 |- |align=right|2004||48.40||52.46||align=left|Valdas Adamkus||30.18||51.83||align=left|Kazimiera Prunskien\u0117||20.60||46.66 |- |align=right|2009||51.76||-||align=left|Dalia Grybauskait\u0117||68.21||-||align=left|Algirdas Butkevi\u010dius||11.68||- |- |align=right|2014||52.23||47.37||align=left|Dalia Grybauskait\u0117||45.92||57.90||align=left|Zigmantas Bal\u010dytis||13.62||40.10 |} ==== Results of the 2014 election ==== {| class=wikitable style=text- align:right |- !rowspan=2|Candidate !rowspan=2|Party !colspan=2|First round !colspan=2|Second round |- !Votes !% !Votes !% |- |align=left|Dalia Grybauskait\u0117||align=left|Independent||612,485||45.92||701,999||57.90 |- |align=left|Zigmantas Bal\u010dytis||align=left|Social Democratic Party of Lithuania||181,659||13.62||486,214||40.10 |- |align=left|Art\u016bras Paulauskas||align=left|Labour Party||160,139||12.01||colspan=2 rowspan=5| |- |align=left|Naglis Puteikis||align=left|Independent||124,333||9.32 |- |align=left|Valdemar Toma\u0161evski||align=left|Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania||109,659||8.22 |- |align=left|Art\u016bras Zuokas||align=left|YES||69,677||5.22 |- |align=left|Bronis Rop\u0117||align=left|Lithuanian Peasant and Greens Union||55,263||4.14 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"|Invalid/blank votes||20,451||1.53||24,161||1.99 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"|Total||1,333,666||100||1,212,374||100 |- | style=\"text- align:left;\" colspan=\"2\"|Registered voters/turnout||2,553,335||52.23||2,559,398||47.37 |- | style=\"text- align:left;\" colspan=\"6\"|Source: |} == Municipal elections == === Election process and eligibility === Each municipality in Lithuania is governed by a municipal council and a mayor, who is a member of the municipal council. The number of members, elected on a four-year term, in each municipal council depends on the size of the municipality and varies from 15 (in municipalities with fewer than 5,000 residents) to 51 (in municipalities with more than 500,000 residents). 1,524 municipal council members were elected in 2015. Members of the council, with the exception of the mayor, are elected using proportional representation. Starting with 2015, the mayor is elected directly by the majority of residents of the municipality. Before 2015, the mayors were elected by the municipal councils. Ordinary elections take place on a date proclaimed by the parliament no earlier than two months and no later than a month before the end of the current term. To be eligible for election, candidates must be at least 20 years old on the election day and permanently reside in the respective municipality. Persons serving or due to serve a sentence imposed by the court 65 days before the election are not eligible. Also, residents performing military service, and servicemen of professional military service and officials of statutory institutions and establishments may not stand for election. The mayor is elected in a majority vote if the voter turnout in the constituency is at least 40%. If the voter turnout is less than 40%, the candidate with the most votes (and at least 20% of the votes) is declared a winner. If there are more than two candidates and no candidate wins in the first round, a second round of voting is held within 15 days. The two leading candidates from the first round are eligible for the second round of voting. The candidate that gets more votes in the second round is declared a winner, regardless of voter turnout. Council seats (other than the seat of the mayor) are allocated to the participating political parties proportionally to the share of vote received. Parties receiving less than 4% of the vote and joint multi-party electoral lists receiving less than 6% of the vote are not eligible to receive any seats, unless the remaining eligible parties received less than 60% of the vote. Candidates take the seats allocated to their parties based on the preference lists submitted before the election. The preference lists are adjusted by preference votes given by the voters. === Elections and results === {| class=wikitable style=text- align:right !rowspan=2|Election !rowspan=2|Turnout, % !rowspan=2|Total mandates !colspan=2|Largest party !colspan=2|2nd largest party !colspan=2|3rd largest party !rowspan=2|Source |- ! !Seats ! !Seats ! !Seats |- |1995||44.85||1488||align=left|Homeland Union - Lithuanian Conservatives||428||align=left|Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania||297||align=left|Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party||247||align=left| |- |1997||35.60Only includes turnout by 19:00 on election day, does not include votes by post or early voting||1459||align=left|Homeland Union - Lithuanian Conservatives||493||align=left|Democratic Labour Party of Lithuania||212||align=left|Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party||180||align=left| |- |2000||49.63||1562||align=left|New Union (Social Liberals)||270||align=left|Lithuanian Peasant Union||209||align=left|Homeland Union - Lithuanian Conservatives||199||align=left| |- |2002||49.23||1560||align=left|Social Democratic Party of Lithuania||332||align=left|Homeland Union - Lithuanian Conservatives||193||align=left|Union of Peasant and New Democracy Parties||190||align=left| |- |2007||41.30||1550||align=left|Social Democratic Party of Lithuania||302||align=left|Homeland Union - Conservatives, Political Prisoners and Deportees, Christian Democrats||256||align=left|Liberal and Centre Union||182||align=left| |- |2011||44.08||1550||align=left|Social Democratic Party of Lithuania||328||align=left|Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats||249||align=left|Labour Party||165||align=left| |} Direct elections for mayor were introduced in 2015. {| class=wikitable style=text- align:right !rowspan=2|Election !rowspan=2|Turnout, % !rowspan=2|Total mandates !rowspan=2|Mayor mandates !colspan=3|Largest party !colspan=3|2nd largest party !colspan=3|3rd largest party !rowspan=2|Source |- ! !Total seats !Mayors ! !Total seats !Mayors ! !Total seats !Mayors |- |2015||47.18||1523||59||align=left|Social Democratic Party of Lithuania||372||16||align=left|Homeland Union - Lithuanian Christian Democrats||258||11||align=left|Liberal Movement||225||9||align=left| |} == European elections == === Election process and eligibility === Lithuania joined the European Union in 2004. In the same year, the first election took place for 13 seats in the European Parliament allocated to Lithuania. As of 2014, the number of seats allocated to Lithuania was 11, down from 12 in 2009. Members of the parliament are elected by proportional representation for a five-year term. Ordinary elections take place on a Sunday on the same day as in other EU countries. Early voting is available during Wednesday and Thursday before the election. Mail-in voting and at-home voting is available for eligible voters. The vote is open to all citizens of Lithuania, as well as citizens of other EU countries that permanently reside in Lithuania, who are at least 18 years old on the election day. To be eligible for election, candidates must be at least 21 years old on the election day, citizen of Lithuania or citizen of another EU country permanently residing in Lithuania. Candidates are not allowed to stand for election in more than one country. Persons serving or due to serve a sentence imposed by the court 65 days before the election are not eligible. Also, judges, citizens performing military service, and servicemen of professional military service and officials of statutory institutions and establishments may not stand for election. The seats are allocated to the participating political parties or lists proportionally to the share of vote received. Parties or lists receiving less than 5% of the vote are not eligible to receive any seats, unless the remaining eligible parties received less than 60% of the vote. Candidates take the seats allocated to their parties based on the preference lists submitted before the election. The preference lists are adjusted by preference votes given by the voters. === Elections and results === Three elections to the European Parliament have taken place in Lithuania. Election in 2004 took place on 13 June 2004, together with the second round of the presidential election, resulting in a relatively high turnout of 48%. As with later elections, the election campaign in 2004 centered around domestic issues and not European policies, and populist parties featured prominently. The election was a disappointment for the governing Social Democrats, who received only 2 of the 13 seats, and their partners in the government, New Union (Social Liberals), who failed to win a seat. The biggest winners in the election were the populist Labor Party, who contested their first national election and walked away with 5 seats in the European Parliament. Election in 2009 took place on 7 June 2009. The onset of the financial crisis after years of economic growth led to economic and social security issues dominating the election agenda, despite the limited influence the European Parliament has over the economy of Lithuania. The election took place just three weeks after the presidential election and achieved a voter turnout of only 21% - the lowest turnout in any elections in post-communist Lithuania and one of the lowest in Europe.

Mandatory referendums must be held on these questions: # to amend Chapters I (The State of Lithuania) and XIV (Amending the Constitution) of the Constitution of Lithuania # to amend the June 8, 1992 Constitutional Act, \"On Non-Alignment of the Republic of Lithuania to Post-Soviet Eastern Alliances\" # to approve participation in international organizations if membership requires partial transfer of powers from state institutions A polling station in Lithuania on the 1991 Referendum day. Mandatory and consultative referendums can also be held on any other question if the proposal to hold the referendum is supported by at least 300,000 voters or the referendum is called by at least one quarter of all members of the parliament. The referendum is deemed to have taken place if more than half of the registered voters participate. The referendum question in a mandatory referendum is adopted if approved by more than half of all citizens participating in the referendum but no less than 1/3 of all citizens registered to vote. The following exceptions exist: * The provision of Article 1 of the Constitution (\"The State of Lithuania is an independent, democratic Republic\"), and the Constitutional Act of June 8, 1992 can only be amended upon approval of at least 3/4 of all citizens registered to vote. * Chapters I and XIV of the Constitution can only be amended upon approval of at least half of all citizens registered to vote. * Questions regarding participation in international organizations are adopted if approved by more than half of voters participating in the referendum. Questions in a consultative referendum are approved if supported by more than half of all citizens participating in the referendum. The parliament should then agree on the implementation of the question within one month. The parliament may still take into account the results of a consultative referendum even if it is invalid due to low participation. A total of 12 separate referendums have been organized in Lithuania (some of them with several referendum questions). Of these, four have seen the referendum question approved in a referendum deemed to have taken place. In February 1991, Lithuanian voter approved the independence of Lithuania from Soviet Union with 90.2% of voters participating (76.5% of voters eligible) voting in favor. In June 1992, the voters demanded through referendum an immediate withdrawal of Russian troops and compensation for damages from the Soviet Union. In October 1992 the Lithuanian Constitution was approved. In 2003, the Lithuanian membership in the European Union was approved 90% of participating voters (57% of all eligible voters). == Voting process == === Voters and voter lists === The minimum voting age in Lithuania is 18. Voting in elections for the parliament and the president, as well as participation in referendums is open to citizens of Lithuania. Voting in elections to the European Parliament is open to citizens of Lithuania, as well as citizens of other EU countries permanently residing in Lithuania, as long as they only vote in one country. Voting in local elections is limited to permanent residents of the respective municipalities, regardless of citizenship. Individuals who have been declared mentally incompetent by court are barred from voting. Voter lists or electoral rolls are compiled before each vote by the Central Electoral Commission. The electoral rolls should include every person eligible to vote, and include information about the person necessary to establish eligibility, such as name, surname, personal number, date of birth, passport or other ID number, as well as place of residence. The electoral roll of the Republic of Lithuania then forms the basis for electoral rolls of single-member constituencies and polling districts, that contain information necessary for individuals to vote. Electoral rolls are not public but voters may access information related to themselves in the electoral roll. Before the election, a poll card is sent to each voter, representing an invitation to vote. It may also be accessed and printed online. Citizens of Lithuania who do not reside in Lithuania but are entitled to vote, for example in the elections for the parliament, are entered in electoral rolls for the constituency in the territory where the parliament is situated. Voters who are aboard a ship and will not be able to return to Lithuania to vote, are entered on the electoral roll of the polling district on whose electoral roll the ship\u2019s crew is entered.
