The town was featured as the detour challenge of Leg 11 of the 5th Season of The Amazing Race. Victoria celebrates the Itik Festival every second week of November. The capital of Pila was once in Barangay Pagalangan, now one of Victoria's barangays. What remains of Pila's original parish church can still be found in Pagalangan, which in the past made that community a target of treasure hunters seeking antiques. Pagalangan ceased to be Pila's capital when the town center was moved due to frequent flooding. ==Barangays== Victoria is politically subdivided into 9 barangays. Two of these, Nanhaya and San Roque, are classified as urban while the rest are rural. * Banca-banca * Daniw * Masapang * Nanhaya (Poblacion) * Pagalangan * San Benito * San Felix * San Francisco * San Roque (Poblacion) ==Climate== ==Demographics== Victoria Town Hall In the , the population of Victoria, Laguna, was people, with a density of . ==Local Government== Municipal officials 2019-2022: * Mayor: ALMEDA, FRANKIE (NPC) * Vice Mayor: KAMPITAN, DWIGHT (PDPLBN) * Councilors: :* KAMPITAN, RJ (PDPLBN) :* REBONG, JAMES (PDPLBN) :* FERNANDEZ, CAYLENE PUSA (NP) :* HERRADURA, WILLY (NP) :* CORCUERA, JOY (PDPLBN) :* TOPE, MA.
