    "text": "\"The Golden Age of Rock 'n' Roll\" is a single by Mott the Hoople, from 1974's The Hoople. It reached number 16 on the UK Singles Chart. Performed live by Mott, \"The Golden Age of Rock 'n' Roll\" would usually follow a piano take on the first verse of Don McLean's \"American Pie\", hence following the latter's statement, \"The day the music died\". Ian Hunter would declare: \"Or did it? Ladies and gentlemen, The Golden Age of Rock 'n' Roll!\", whereupon the whole band launched into the song. This can be heard among the 2006 bonus tracks on The Hoople and on the Broadway disc of the 2004 remastered and expanded 30th Anniversary Edition of Live. Def Leppard covered the song for their 2006 covers album Yeah!. \"The one I assumed I'd breeze through was 'The Golden Age of Rock 'n' Roll',\" observed singer Joe Elliott, \"which I know backwards, inside out and in foreign languages. We had to take that one down a key because I just couldn't do it.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:Mott the Hoople songs Category:1974 singles Category:Songs written by Ian Hunter (singer) Category:1974 songs Category:CBS Records singles ",
