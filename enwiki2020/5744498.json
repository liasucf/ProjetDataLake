    "text": "Guerilla Poubelle is a French punk band formed in 2003. The name translates to 'Dustbin (Garbage Can) Guerrilla' in English. Their lyrics are based on anarchist and existentialist beliefs and the band are DIY enthusiasts, lead singer and guitarist Till being behind the record label and concert promoter Guerilla Asso founded in 2004. ==History== The band formed as a four-piece, following the break of ska-punk band Les Betteraves. The band originally incorporated a painter who painted and provided backing vocals during shows. Their debut album, entitled Il faut repeindre le monde\u2026 en noir (The world must be repainted\u2026 in black) was released in 2005. Following some line-up changes, the band became a three-piece. They have released numerous splits and EPs, as well as four albums, releasing music on their own Guerilla Asso, Asian Man Records and Crash Disques. In the summer of 2006, they released a split album with Coquettish, which was followed by a major Japanese tour. The band has toured widely (France, Europe, Japan, Canada, USA) and played over 1 000 live shows. Guerilla Poubelle has consistently refused to register with the French royalties collection society SACEM, in line with their values, despite selling a significant number of records for an independent band. ==Musical style and influences== The band have remained consistent over the years in playing mostly fast, short punk rock songs sung in French, with Till Lemoine's vocal delivery urgent and gritty. ==Members== * Till : guitar and vocals * Antho : bass * Paul : drums ==Past members== * Chamoule: Drums * Jokoko: painter * Ken: bass and vocals *Axel: drums * Alex: drums * Kojack: bass * Jamie: bass ==Quotes== \"(We) do not want our music consumed like yogurt.
