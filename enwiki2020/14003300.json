Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol. ii p.384 of the Dublin branch of the celebrated Quaker family which co-founded the town of Mountmellick. He graduated from the University of Dublin in 1881 and entered Gray's Inn in 1882. He was called to the Irish Bar in 1886 and became King's Counsel in 1909.Ball p.384 Pim served in the Liberal administration of H. H. Asquith as Solicitor-General for Ireland from 1913 to 1914.Ball p.384 The latter year he was sworn of the Irish Privy Council and promoted to Attorney-General for Ireland, a position he held until 1915, when he was appointed a justice of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice in Ireland. After the Easter Rising of 1916 he was briefly appointed a Lord Justice of Ireland, charged with emergency powers of government. After the establishment of the Irish Free State, like nearly all the pre- independence judges he was required to retire under the Courts of Justice Act 1924. He was a member of the Royal Irish Academy.Ball p.384 Maurice Healy in his memoir The Old Munster Circuit suggests that Pim's retirement probably came as a relief to him, since despite his great charm, courtesy and learning he was not a lawyer of adequate calibre for any of the offices he filled, and had not expected to be appointed to any more senior office than a county court judge.Healy, Maurice The Old Munster Circuit 1939 Mercier Press Edition p.267 Pim died in 1949. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1858 births Category:1949 deaths Category:Solicitors-General for Ireland Category:Attorneys-General for Ireland Category:Members of the Privy Council of Ireland Category:Alumni of Trinity College Dublin Category:Members of Gray's Inn Category:Judges of the High Court of Justice in Ireland Category:Barristers and advocates ",
