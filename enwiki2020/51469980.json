His birth was registered at Clare, South Australia. He was the eldest of four boys born to Rev. Tom Percy Wood (1880-1957) and Fannie n\u00e9e Newbury (1880-1969). He was brother to Jack Newbury Wood (8 November 1907 - 1989), Dean Charlton Wood (8 July 1910 - 27 February 1998) and Noel Herbert Wood (1 February 1912 - 10 November 2001). Noel Wood was also an artist. Their grandfather Thomas Percy Wood (14 April 1855 - 12 November 1937) was an Anglican Minister in South Australia and an accomplished watercolourist. Rex Wood studied painting at the South Australian School of Art under Mary Packer Harris (1891\u20131978), and was soon recognised as a pre-eminent realist in a wide variety of mediums. He was represented in a number of exhibitions alongside such luminaries as Ivor Hele and Hans Heysen. He began acting as art critic for The News in 1934, and his one-man exhibition in 1935 was well received. He had another exhibition in 1937, at the eve of his departure for England and the Continent. He studied at the Anglo-French Art Centre at St Johns Wood and the Southampton Row School of Art. He spent much of the war years in Portugal, maintaining some contact with Australia, sending the occasional column to The News, and purchasing some works for the Art Gallery of South Australia. He visited Australia in the mid-1950s then went back to Portugal,Alan McCulloch, Encyclopedia of Australian Art, first edition 1968; Hutchinson of London where he died in Estoril around 24 January 1970.
