    "text": "Weatherfield is a fictional town based on Salford which is the setting for the British ITV soap opera Coronation Street since its inception in 1960. Much of Weatherfield has been seen by viewers throughout the years, though the primary focus from the viewer's perspective is the eponymous Coronation Street, a cobbled street where many of the programme's characters live. Weatherfield areas are often shot on location around Salford and the neighbouring large city of Manchester, as its filmings studios, the Granada Studios complex on Quay Street in Manchester city centre (which closed 2013) and its replacement set MediaCityUK in Salford Quays (opened 2014), only house the outdoor sets of Coronation Street and its immediate surrounding streets. As part of 2010 Children In Need charity appeal, Weatherfield became twinned with Walford in a special programme uniting the two soaps Coronation Street and EastEnders called East Street. ==Education== ===Bessie Street Primary School=== Formerly \"Bessie Street Mixed Infants\" and \"Bessie Street Juniors\", \"Bessie Street Primary School\" is the main institution for primary education in Weatherfield. Headteachers: * Wilfred Perkins (1972\u20131974) * Mrs Nandhra (2010) * Miss Muirhouse (2014) * Brian Packham (2011\u20132013) * Mrs Glover (2014) * Melinda Calvert (2018\u2013) Many of the characters in the programme attended Bessie Street as children - before and after the programme was invented. These include Albert Tatlock (Jack Howarth), Ken Barlow (William Roache), Dennis Tanner (Philip Lowrie), Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), Nick Tilsley (Ben Price), Sarah- Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien), David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd), Chesney Brown (Sam Aston), Bethany Platt (Lucy Fallon), Joshua Peacock (Benjamin Beresford), Amy Barlow (Elle Mulvaney), Simon Barlow (Alex Bain), Asha Alahan (Tanisha Gorey), Aadi Alahan (Zennon Ditchett) and Max Turner (Harry McDermott). Some characters have also worked there, notably Ken who took his first teaching job at Bessie Street in 1961, the year after the series began. He worked there intermittently until 1974.Little. (2000) p.13. Esther Hayes (Daphne Oxenford), who lived at No. 5 Coronation Street until 1962, also worked as a teacher at the school.Little. (2000) p.20. The role of lollipop man at Bessie Street has been held by Albert, Percy Sugden (Bill Waddington), Jack Duckworth (Bill Tarmey) and most recently Dennis and Malcolm Lagg (Robert Fyfe). The headteacher was Brian Packham (Peter Gunn), but he has been replaced. Melinda Calvert (Janet Dibley) is currently the headteacher of Bessie Street. Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) goes to see his son, Simon, perform in the nativity play in December 2008; however, he is refused entry as he is drunk. He fights his way through and ruins the play. In 2013, Kylie Platt (Paula Lane) arrives drunk at her son Max's nativity play and the Platt family is removed immediately when Kylie tries to drag Max off the stage. In June 2014, Kylie and her husband, David, are called in as Max has been disruptive during lessons. This later leads to him being diagnosed with ADHD. Coronation Street residents currently attending the school are Jack Webster (Kyran Bowes), Hope Stape (Isabella Flanagan), Liam Connor (Charlie Wrenshall), Ruby Dobbs (Macy Alabi), Jake Windass (Bobby Bradshaw), Lily Platt (Brooke Malonie), and Joseph Brown (William Flanagan). ===Weatherfield High School=== Headteachers: * Sue Jeffers (1990\u20131997) * Mrs Paton (2000) * Miss Johnson (2002) Formerly \"Weatherfield Comprehensive School\", \"Weatherfield High School\" is the main institution for secondary education in Weatherfield. The school provides education for pupils aged 11-18. Lucille Hewitt (Jennifer Moss) is the first character to sit her O-level examinations at the newly formed Weatherfield Comprehensive in 1965Little. (2000) p.35. after the amalgamation of the Weatherfield School for Girls and the Weatherfield Boys' School. The school rarely features until Ken Barlow returns to teaching in 1991, taking a post in the English department. By this time, a teenage Tracy Barlow is a pupil at the school, along with Steve (Simon Gregson) and Andy McDonald (Nicholas Cochrane). Nick Tilsley (played by Warren Jackson and later Adam Rickitt) attends from 1992 to 1997. Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin) works as a caretaker at the school for a short time in the early 1990s. The school is referred to as 'Weatherfield Comp' in many scripts but since 2004, the school has been known as 'Weatherfield High'. Other former pupils include Jenny Bradley (Sally Ann Matthews) (during the 1980s), Toyah Battersby (Georgia Taylor) (towards the end of the 1990s), Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O'Brien) (who attended from 1998 to 2003), Candice Stowe (Nikki Sanderson), Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) and Aiden Critchley (Dean Ashton) who attended around the same time.

The school first appears in the programme in 1993, when Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) offers to pay for his estranged son Mark Redman (Christopher Cook) to be educated there.Little. (2000) p.212. In 2004, Oakhill reappears when Rosie Webster (Helen Flanagan) is accepted at the school, where she studies for her GCSEs. In 2020, Asha (Tanisha Gorey) and Aadi Alahan (Adam Hussain) transferred to Oakhill after Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) moved them from Weatherfield High hoping it would solve the problem of Asha's explicit video going viral. Scenes at Oakhill School are filmed on location at Cheadle Hulme School. ===Weatherfield Polytechnic/University=== Jenny Bradley (Sally Ann Matthews) briefly attends here, along with her friend and housemate Flick Khan. Jenny studies biology until she is expelled for neglecting her work. It is later attended by Andy McDonald (Nicholas Cochrane), by which time it has been reclassified as a university under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. Andy is successful in his studies, graduating with a lower second class honours degree. ==Local press== Weatherfield has its own local newspaper, The Weatherfield Gazette. A free local newspaper existed until 1990, known as The Weatherfield Recorder.Little. (2000) p.195. Weatherfield also has a tabloid newspaper called The Daily Pulse. ==Local shops and businesses== ===D&S; Alahan Corner Shop=== D&S; Alahan's Corner Shop is situated at 15 Coronation Street and is on the junction to Viaduct Street. It was owned by Dev Alahan (Jimmi Harkishin) and Sunita Alahan (Shobna Gulati), until the death of Sunita in The Rovers Return fire in 2013; now it is solely owned by Dev. D&S; Alahan's was hit by a tram in December 2010, while Sunita, Molly Dobbs (Vicky Binns) and her baby Jack were inside. Jack and Sunita were subsequently saved but Molly died. The shop was closed for the beginning of 2011 but re-opened in late February. Until December 2010, the corner shop was the only business that had stood since the very first episode. Another notable storyline for D&S; Alahan's involved Maya Sharma (Sasha Behar) setting fire to the shop in 2004, leading to an explosion whilst Dev and Sunita were in the flat above. ===The Kabin=== The Kabin is also at the junction of Coronation Street and Viaduct Street. The Kabin mainly sells newspapers, magazines, traditional sweets and seasonal goods (Christmas, Easter, Halloween). Originally opened by Rita Sullivan (Barbara Knox) as the Korner Kabin on Rosamund Street, it moved to its current location in 1990. In late 2009, Rita sells The Kabin to employee Norris Cole (Malcolm Hebden) so that she can go travelling. When she returns, she is re-employed by Norris. The Kabin, along with D&S; Alahan's Corner Shop and The Joinery wine bar, is involved in the tram crash in December 2010. The tram rips through the shop and the flats above, with Rita inside the shop. After initially believing that Rita is out at a friend's, Norris and Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) raise the alarm and Rita is eventually rescued. In 2019, Norris announces to Rita that he is selling The Kabin and later sells it to Brian Packham (Peter Gunn) and Cathy Matthews (Melanie Hill). Rita then finds out and tells Brian she is quitting as she does not want to work for them. Brian and Cathy apologise to Rita and offer her the job of manageress. ===Audrey's Salon=== Audrey's Salon is situated at the junction of Rosamund Street and Coronation Street. It is currently owned by Claudia Colby (Rula Lenska), Maria Connor (Samia Longchambon) and Rita Tanner (Barbara Knox). 2 Coronation Street has been a hairdresser's salon since 1991, shortly after it was built. It was originally a charity shop, run by Emily Bishop (Eileen Derbyshire) in 1990. Previous salon owners include Denise Osbourne (Denise Black) and Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls). ===Underworld=== Underworld is the underwear factory situated on Coronation Street, which has employed many residents of Weatherfield. The company was founded by Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) as Baldwins Casuals but was later owned by Carla Connor (Alison King). After Mike died, his son's Danny Baldwin (Bradley Walsh) and Adam Barlow (Sam Robertson) sell their shares to Paul (Sean Gallagher) and Liam Connor (Rob James-Collier). After Paul's death, his wife, Carla, inherits his 60% share in the factory. Carla's new husband Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien) purchases Liam's shares shortly before he dies but, after Tony is imprisoned for Liam's murder, Carla buys his shares. Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) purchases them in early 2010, then sells his 40% share back to Carla when the pair do not get along. In 2011, Frank Foster (Andrew Lancel) buys Nick's former share from Carla. In early June 2010, Tony takes revenge on Carla and Roy Cropper (David Neilson) by taking Carla and Roy's wife Hayley (Julie Hesmondhalgh) hostage, before setting the factory on fire with Carla inside (see \"Siege Week\"). She manages to escape but Tony walks back into the blazing factory and dies. During the re-construction of the factory John Stape (Graeme Hawley) and Charlotte Hoyle (Becky Hindley) hide the body of Colin Fishwick (David Crellin), who died inside No. 5 Coronation Street following an argument with the pair, under the floor of the factory. John had stolen Colin's identity to allow him to teach again. However, unbeknownst to John Owen Armstrong Construction is about to cement over the hole and, before John could do anything, the floor is covered with Colin underneath. The body remains undetected until July 2011, when drain problems with the factory toilets lead to the floor being dug up. John, terrified that his secret is about to be uncovered, manages to get himself on the labour team and goes to the factory late one night to find Colin's body; he is interrupted by his wife Fiz Stape (Jennie McAlpine), who discovers the body. Eventually, the police find out about John's cover up and investigate, but John makes a get away, leaving Fiz facing the blame for his crimes. Frank takes up a partnership with Carla, their relationship grows and they become engaged. As the wedding plans progress Carla realises that she still has feelings for Peter and she calls off the wedding. Frank rapes Carla at her flat, and she later reports this to the police. Frank is arrested but later released on bail on condition that he stay away from Carla and the business. Frank's mother steps into his shoes at the factory and interferes with Carla's life, making it harder for her to run the factory. Frank steals the clients from Underworld and sends in men to take his share of items and stock from the business to set up his new business elsewhere in the area. With no work for the staff, Carla makes the decision to lay off staff. First is by mutual agreement with Becky McDonald (Katherine Kelly), who walks out as she was the last to be employed at the factory. She is followed by Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) for the same reason. Carla also dismisses Sally Webster (Sally Dynevor), who is upset that Carla has done so, as Sally has worked for the factory and been loyal to the business for many years. Frank approaches Sally and offers her a supervisor's job at his new factory which she accepts. Frank later returns to Underworld merging his business with Carla's, bringing his staff with him. In April 2012, after Frank is found dead in the factory, his 40% share is to be purchased by Sally. After meeting with Frank's lawyers, Carla discovers that Frank has left his share of the factory to her, having forgotten to change his will after the rape, much to the happiness of her sister-in-law, Michelle Connor (Kym Marsh). In December 2013, Carla gives 50% of the business to her husband Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) after he loses the bookies but demands the shares back after uncovering his affair with Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan). In January 2014, the factory loses one of its much-loved staff members, as Hayley passes away from pancreatic cancer. In 2015, Carla has a breakdown, believing that she is responsible for the fire at Victoria Court. This causes her to lose focus at work, and she cancels meetings with clients and missing deadlines. She also starts gambling with the factory's money and drinking heavily. Concerned, Nick and Michelle call upon Aidan Connor (Shayne Ward) to help out. Aidan agrees to invest \u00a3100,000 in the factory in exchange for a 40% share. However, Carla continues to gamble, irritating Aidan. It soon emerges that Aidan borrowed money from his father, Johnny Connor (Richard Hawley) to buy the factory shares. Johnny insists that he now has a say in how the factory is run and settles with 22% of the shares; Aidan retained the 18%. Carla later discovers that Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) is to blame for the fire and begins to get her life back on track. After breaking up with her fianc\u00e9 Nick, Carla decides to move away to Devon. She eventually sells her 60% share of the factory to Johnny along with her flat. Adam returns to the street in 2016 and forms a plan to reclaim his former share of the factory from the Connors. He enlists the help of Alya to gain access to the factory to find financial evidence to prove that he is one of the legal owners of Underworld. However, his plan falls through as Alya tips the Connors off and they threaten to report him to the police unless he drops the case against them. Adam agrees as he knows that being reported to the police could compromise his legal career. In September 2017, the factory loses all of its business and everything inside. In March 2019, Gary Windass (Mikey North) sabotages the already fragile factory roof in order to get more building work. However, this causes the roof to collapse and injure the machinists, including Sally, Kirk Sutherland (Andrew Whyment), Sean Tully (Antony Cotton), Paul Foreman (Peter Ash), Gemma Winter (Dolly-Rose Campbell) and Emma Brooker (Alexandra Mardell). Rana Habeeb (Bhavna Limbachia) is also trapped in the wreckage, and later dies from her injuries on the day she is supposed to be marrying her fianc\u00e9e, Kate Connor (Faye Brookes). ===Viaduct Bistro=== Viaduct Bistro is situated on Viaduct Street under the viaduct. It was formerly a joiners' workshop before it was renovated and became The Joinery Wine Bar in 2010. The Joinery was first opened in early 2010 by Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) and Leanne Barlow (Jane Danson), but was owned by George Wilson (Anthony Valentine). On its first night Peter's alcoholism gets the better of him when he becomes drunk and violent, leaving Leanne devastated, so its first night is also its last. In mid-2035 after the siege which saw the factory burn down, Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) sees an opportunity to use it as temporary factory, but he does so under the name Nick's Knicks meaning it had nothing to do with Carla Connor (Alison King) or Underworld. After the closure of the temporary factory, Nick rents the space again from owner George and re-opens The Joinery in late 2010, employing ex-kebab shop worker Cheryl Gray (Holly Quin-Ankrah) as barmaid and Ciaran McCarthy (Keith Duffy) as chef, with ex- wife Leanne as manager to allow her to live her dream. However, Nick and Leanne grow close and embark on an affair. In December Ken Barlow (William Roache) walks in on them in the office looking for Peter and is disgusted with Leanne. The Joinery is destroyed following a gas explosion causing the tram to crash onto Coronation Street in front of the bar, which kills Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold) and nearly kills Peter. In 2011 Nick renovates and re-opens it as The Bistro, again employing Cheryl, along with his mother Gail (Helen Worth) as cleaner. Becky McDonald (Katherine Kelly) briefly works there after her split from husband Steve (Simon Gregson). Believing that his wife Kylie Platt (Paula Lane) needed to rest due to her pregnancy, David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) takes over her evening shifts. The Bistro loses two employees in Spring 2014 as Gloria Price (Sue Johnston) and Stella Price (Michelle Collins) both leave Weatherfield. As Leanne splits with Nick, he renames it Just Nick's. Later, due to staffing problems, he re-hires Leanne. She agrees but only if she can be promoted to manageress. She then plans a stylish revamp. Steph Britton (Tisha Merry) also begins working at the bistro as a waitress sometime in 2014 and is later joined by Gavin Rodwell. However, \"Gavin\" almost loses his job in January 2015 when he reveals to Steph that his real name is in fact Andy Carver (Oliver Farnworth) and that he has stolen his friend Gavin's identity and is using it to meet his father, Michael Rodwell (Les Dennis), who is engaged to Gail. Andy keeps his job despite this. Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill) begins working at the bistro as its head chef in September 2015 as he begins seeing his ex-wife Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford) again. In November, Steph learns that her ex-boyfriend Jamie Bowman (James Atherton) has threatened to post intimate pictures of her online. The pictures are later posted, infuriating Steph. With Leanne's support, she phones the police and Jamie is arrested. In January 2016, Andy and Steph's brother, Luke Britton (Dean Fagan), learns that Jamie is out on bail. They go to confront him at his new workplace, an upmarket bar. Andy reveals all to the manager, and Jamie and his friend Lee are sacked. This angers Jamie, so he and Lee plan to rob the bistro to frighten Steph. However, due to a powercut, Nick closes early so, unknown to Jamie, Steph isn't there. However, Nick's fianc\u00e9e Carla is in the bistro at the time of the break-in, after having a heated argument with Robert. Jamie and Lee search the restaurant but don't find any money or anything of value. Carla tells them to go whilst they can but Jamie gets angry and attacks Carla. Jamie snatches Carla's bag but she runs after them. As they climb into their getaway car, Carla tries to grab her bag. Jamie starts the car and drives down the cobbles taking Carla with them. Carla is pushed from the vehicle and falls, injuring herself badly. ===Preston's Petals=== Preston's Petals is the florist on Rosamund Street and is owned by Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne). Peter buys the shop in late 2008 from Dan (Matthew Crompton) and Harry Mason (Jack Ellis) after his return to Weatherfield. Shortly after, he moves into the flat above the Shop. In early 2009, Peter gets drunk while his son Simon Barlow (Alex Bain) is sleeping, he then lights a cigarette before dropping it and setting the place alight. Simon awakes to find it alight and manages to call Deirdre Barlow, who rushes out to the street and, seeing the blazing shop and flat, she fetches Luke Strong (Craig Kelly) and Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien) to help rescue Peter, Simon and Leanne, Simon's pet rabbit. In August 2010, Lewis Archer (Nigel Havers) cons Peter and the shop out of \u00a34,000. After befriending new employee and Peter's stepmother Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride), he starts forging betting slips while Deirdre is not looking and tricks Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) into believing that he has won \u00a34,000. CCTV reveals that he sneaked behind the desk and made the betting slip after the race had ended. After passionately kissing Deirdre, to the dismay of Peter, Leanne, Ken Barlow (William Roache) and Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls), he escapes to Barbados. John Stape (Graeme Hawley) works here until he too goes on the run when his crimes are discovered. On 4 September 2011, a drunken Carla Connor (Alison King) crashes her car into the front of the bookies, also running over Stella Price (Michelle Collins) who is left critically ill following the accident. In April 2013, Leanne sells her share behind Peter's back to Carla. Carla employs her brother, Rob Donovan (Marc Baylis), as a development consultant to bring Barlow's Bookies into the 21st century. When Rob is fired, he puts a bet down against Peter, which Peter cannot afford to pay. Rob wins, leading Peter to give him and Rob's girlfriend and Peter's stepsister, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), the bookies rent free for six months. They change it into a pawnbroker and Tracy calls it Barlow's Buys. Peter continues to rent the shop to Rob and Tracy, and the couple are annoyed when Peter increases their rent. In 2016, Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill) gives Tracy the idea of opening a florists. Seeing no future for Barlow's Buys, Tracy agrees and starts to plan the grand opening. In a bid to win Robert back after an argument, she calls the shop Preston's Petals. ===Jason Grimshaw Construction=== Jason Grimshaw Construction is the builder's yard situated on Victoria Street. It was formerly owned by Len Fairclough (Peter Adamson), and then by Bill Webster (Peter Armitage). It is part of a chain owned by Owen Armstrong (Ian Puleston-Davies), who buys it from Bill. He keeps on Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas) and hires Chris Gray (Will Thorp). Chris resigns when he discovers he has a brain tumour. In 2011, Owen hires Gary Windass (Mikey North) as a labourer and a builder, and drops Jason in late 2012. Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan) becomes bookkeeper in early 2013. However, Owen's daughter, Katy Armstrong (Georgia May Foote), takes over the role when Tina returns to her job at The Rovers Return. In 2014, Owen sells the yard to Jason's father, Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard) to ease his debt; Tony then gives the yard to Jason as an early birthday present. When Jason moves to Thailand in 2016, he gives control of the company to Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre), whilst retaining ownership. In 2019, Gary went into debt and was later caught out and had to shut the business down, Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) later found out about this and informed Jason of this she then put the yard on the market.

As Betterbuy, it was much featured in the programme but, as no current character works there, it was phased out in the early 2000s and is now only referred to occasionally by residents (usually after they have been shopping and come home with shopping bags reading Freshco). Izzy Armstrong (Cherylee Houston) works here for a time. In 2019, Chesney Brown (Sam Aston) and Gemma Winter (Dolly- Rose Campbell) are hired by Freshco with their quadruplets for a marketing campaign. ===Turner's Joinery=== Turner's Joinery is built under the viaduct archway that originally connected Coronation Street with Jubilee Terrace. It is not much mentioned recently. When Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) decides to build the bistro, he buys half of Turner's Joinery. There is, though, still part of Turner's under the viaduct, standing behind a double door not seen much because it is behind the corner shop.

(1993) p.10. During the 19th century, Newton and Ridley expanded its operations, moving towards the acquisition and construction of new public houses. There is a pub crawl called the Weatherfield 7. ===The Rovers Return Inn=== In 1902 Newton & Ridley acquired the freehold to the newly built public house on Coronation Street.Little. (1993) p.12. The pub was named Rovers Return Inn and is the principal meeting place in Coronation Street. Although the house is no longer owned by Newton and Ridley, the brewery's products are still available. Johnny and Jenny Connor currently own the pub, though there have been many previous owners. An electrical fault in 1986 resulted in a fire which destroyed the bar. Another big fire in 2013 was caused by Karl Munro (John Michie) in attempt to frame Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas), who was trying to fix an electrical fault. The name was chosen because of the historic Rover's Return in Withy Grove, Manchester, which occupied a 14th-century building. At some period it became a licensed house but ceased to be so in 1924. The building stood until 1958 when the City Council had it demolished.Frangopulo, N. J., ed. (1962) Rich Inheritance. Manchester: Education Committee; pp. 195\u201396 ===The Flying Horse=== In 1850, Newton and Ridley opened The Flying Dutchman at the corner of Jubilee Terrace.Little. (1993) p.85. The name was changed in 1905 to The Flying Horse for patriotic reasons. Until around 1985, The Flying Horse was the biggest rival pub to the Rovers Return, with the regulars from both houses clashing in many friendly contests such as a tug-of-war, mixed football and pub Olympics. The pub was reintroduced in 2009; however, it is now filled with dodgy characters. Beth Sutherland (Lisa George) mentioned the Flying Horse in July 2017 when talking to Roy Cropper (David Neilson). ===The Laughing Donkey=== The Laughing Donkey can be found on Omdurman Street, overlooking North Cross Park. It was the stronghold of Nellie Harvey (Mollie Sugden), acquaintance and nemesis of Rovers Return landlady, Annie Walker.Little. (1993) p.80-82. ===The Queens=== The Queens was built in 1931 and is situated towards the 'trendy' Weatherfield Quays, south of Weatherfield.Little. (1993) p.118-121.

All four have been popular in recent years. ===Valandro's=== Valandro's is an Italian restaurant. It was previously used as a secondary setting to restaurants such as The Clock, until bought by Carla Connor (Alison King) and Leanne Battersby (Jane Danson) in May 2007. After the unexpected death of Paul Connor (Sean Gallagher), however, Carla pulls out of the transaction, leaving Leanne to fund the cost of buying the business herself. She uses money earned from being an escort, combined with a \u00a310,000 loan from Roger Stiles (Andrew Dunn). Amidst a plethora of financial trouble and staffing problems, in July 2007 Leanne hires Paul Clayton (Tom Hudson) to work at the restaurant as head chef. Paul later takes out a loan in his grandfather Jack Duckworth's (Bill Tarmey) name and buys a share of the restaurant. The business was failing so, in 2008 Leanne convinces Paul to set fire to the restaurant to claim the insurance,Coronation Street: Paul Sets Fire to Valandro\u2019s on Product Reviews Net resulting in Paul fleeing the country. ===The Royal Panda=== The Royal Panda is a Chinese restaurant.

Shepherd) and Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) were both rushed here after a horrific lorry accident in August 2013. ===Rosamund Street Medical Centre=== The medical practice situated on the junction between Rosamund Street and Coronation Street. Gail Platt (Helen Worth) was employed as a receptionist at the practice, until 2010 when she lost the job for reading private medical records. Two former Coronation Street residents, Dr. Matt Ramsden (Stephen Beckett) and Dr. Matt Carter (Oliver Mellor) were employed there whilst they both lived in Weatherfield respectively. In 2016, Rana Habeeb (Bhavna Limbachia) began working here as a nurse. Deirdre Barlow (Anne Kirkbride) and Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) have also worked the Medical Centre as receptionists. Moira Pollock (Louiza Patikas) is the manageress of the Medical Centre.

One of them is a bus service called the Weatherfield Wayfarer, which is boarded at a stop on Rosamund Street. A bus shelter there provides Weatherfield residents with a comfortable wait guarded from the elements; however, when Victoria Street was closed due to the construction of the Victoria Court apartment complex, an alternative route was in operation, served by a temporary bus stop located outside the Medical Centre on the opposite side of Rosamund Street. The bus used in the series is currently provided by Stagecoach Manchesterhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/east_lancs/24750452636, often using a Middleton depot vehiclehttps://www.stevenknightmedia.com/fleet-news- ramblings/september-6th-2016, and is branded with the Weatherfield Wayfarer name. This, however is not the case on occasion where a substitution from a smaller bus operators in the Greater Manchester area is used. GM Buses vehicles were on occasion provided in the 1980s and 1990shttps://mancunian1001.wordpress.com/2013/10/29/lights-camera-atlantean- gm-buses-link-with-weatherfield/ when required, but following the deregulation of bus services, private bus operators took over the contract with Granada to provide a bus as and when required. Optare Solo vehicles are usually found as at 2020, however other vehicles have been used. Trams are also in operation through Weatherfield. Although most residents appear to prefer taking the bus, it has been revealed that Deirdre Barlow takes the tram to work (at the council offices in central Manchester), when she arrived home with stained clothes as \"someone spilt coffee down me on't tram\". The tram, based on the Metrolink network, runs along the viaduct on Viaduct Street, which separates Coronation Street and Jubilee Terrace. Although the Metrolink system opened in 1992, a tram stop did not appear on screen until 2018 when it was incorporated in a new Coronation Street set unveiled by Granada TV. The newly added tram stop, called Weatherfield North, made its first television appearance in April 2018. The episode broadcast on 6 December 2010 featured a disaster storyline, in which an out-of-service tram crashed off the viaduct at the end of Coronation Street after a gas blast at The Joinery broke the line. The track was damaged, causing a derailment which sent the front end of the tram into Dev and Sunita's corner shop and the other end into The Kabin. It is not the first time in Weatherfield's history that such a disaster has happened; there was a derailment of a goods train in 1967. ==References== Category:Coronation Street Category:Fictional neighborhoods Category:Fictional populated places in England ",
