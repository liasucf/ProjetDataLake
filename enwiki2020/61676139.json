The project costing about was funded through DOST Grants-in-Aid in 2016. At that time, the facility was meant to augment the PHL-Microsat program which was later succeeded by the Space Technology and Applications Mastery, Innovation and Advancement (STAMINA4Space) Program as well as to encourage people to take up a career in space technology. It opened on August 31, 2019. ==Facilities== ULyS3ES consists of two buildings designated as ULyS3ES-1 and ULyS3ES-2which hosts equipment and facilities that would allow the designing and development of small satellites and the testing and implementation of satellite bus and payload systems. It hosts a full anechoic chamber (FAC) to aid in measuring antenna radiation patterns and hasten the development of satellite communication systems. It also has a separate temperature and humidity test chamber. ==References== Category:2019 establishments in the Philippines Category:Space program of the Philippines Category:Research institutes in Metro Manila Category:University and college laboratories in the Philippines ",
