    "text": "Route 22A at Ballston station Route 26A at East Falls Church Station The REX at King Street station This is a list of bus routes operated by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA), branded as Metrobus in Northern Virginia. Most routes operated under Northern Virginia trolleys, the Alexandria, Barcroft and Washington Transit Company (AB&W;), and the Washington Virginia & Maryland Coach Company (WV&M;) prior to the 1960s. ==Numbering== Most Metrobus routes in VA begin with a single or double digit number followed by a letter. ==History== Many current routes operate under former streetcar routes. The streetcars provided the main transportation in the Northern Virginia area from the 1800s to the 1940s. At Google Books. The Alexandria, Barcroft and Washington Transit Company (AB&W;) and the Washington Virginia & Maryland Coach Company (WV&M;) operated some of the routes prior to 1973. In 1973, WMATA acquired the two bus companies along with other bus companies to form its current Metrobus system. At one point, most MD routes would enter into Downtown before Metro was built in which all buses would terminate at stations in various locations. Today, the main Northern VA hub is at Pentagon station which connects to Arlington Transit, DASH, Fairfax Connector, Loudoun County Transit, PRTC OmniRide, and Ride Smart Northern Shenandoah Valley lines. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, service has been mostly reduced to Sunday service schedules during the weekdays with select routes both added and suspended from March 18 until August 22, 2020. Routes 16C, 28A, 29K, 29N, and REX were the only routes that ran during the weekends with the rest of the routes suspended. On August 23, 2020, more routes came back during the weekdays and weekends returning Metrobus service to 75%. ==Routes== Most Virginia Metrobus routes operate inside Northern Virginia. However a few routes will go into Downtown DC under former streetcar routings and demand. {| class=wikitable style=\"font-size: 90%;\" | ! Route !colspan=3|Terminals ! Streets traveled !
