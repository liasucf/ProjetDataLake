This marked the first time Taeyeon released a soundtrack recording after three years, following \"All with You\" for Moon Lovers: Scarlet Heart Ryeo (2016). The song, titled \"\" (literally \"A Poem Titled You\") in Korean and \"All About You\" in English, was produced by Song Dong-woon, who had previously produced the soundtracks for hit dramas such as Descendants of the Sun and Goblin: The Lonely and Great God. \"All About You\" was released on July 21, 2019, as a digital single by YAMYAM Entertainment, under license by Kakao M. == Reception == \"All About You\" debuted atop the Gaon Digital Chart dated July 21\u201327, 2019.
