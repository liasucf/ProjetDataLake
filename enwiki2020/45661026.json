    "text": "Patricia A. Grady is an American neuroscientist internationally recognized for her research on stroke, which specializes in cerebral blood flow, metabolism, and function. She is director of the National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. Grady was elected to the Institute of Medicine in 1999 and is a member of several scientific organizations, including the Society for Neuroscience and the American Academy of Nursing. She is a fellow of the American Stroke Association and the American Neurological Association. Grady lectures and speaks nationally and internationally on topics including future directions in nursing research, developments in the neurological sciences, and Federal research opportunities. She is widely known within NIH as a leader supporting the advances of women in science. Before coming to NIH, Grady held several academic positions and served concurrently on the faculties of the University of Maryland School of Medicine and School of Nursing. Prior to being appointed director of NINR, Grady served as acting director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). == Early years == Grady was raised in South Florida. She excelled in science and was interested in health and decided on a career in nursing \u201cbecause it gave you flexibility and the potential to carry out the profession in any number of settings and a variety of lifestyles.\u201d Grady earned her undergraduate degree in nursing from Georgetown University. She received her graduate degrees from the University of Maryland: a master's degree from the School of Nursing and a doctorate in physiology from the School of Medicine. == Stroke research == Grady has authored or co-authored numerous articles and papers on hypertension, cerebrovascular permeability, vascular stress, and cerebral edema. She is an editorial board member of the major stroke journals. Her early research projects on stroke and brain function received funding from the NIH and the Office of Naval Research. Grady presented her scientific findings in a number of national and international scientific meetings, including symposia at NIH. In 1988, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) recruited her to become an administrator in the area of stroke. == NINDS == In 1988, Grady joined NIH as an extramural research program administrator in the NINDS in the areas of stroke and brain imaging. She served on the NIH Task Force for Medical Rehabilitation Research, which established the first long- range research agenda for the field of medical rehabilitation research. In 1992, she assumed the responsibilities of NINDS Assistant Director. From 1993 to 1995, she was Deputy Director and Acting Director of NINDS. == NINR director == Grady was appointed Director of NINR in 1995. Dr. Harold Varmus, the NIH Director at the time, praised Grady\u2019s appointment by announcing to the NIH community that \u201cher experience in conducting and managing neurological research makes her the ideal leader to carry out the NINR mission that includes linking biological and behavioral research programs to benefit people\u2019s health .\u201d Under her leadership, the NINR has more than doubled its budget and has significantly increased the number of research and training grants awarded. NINR\u2019s annual budget is about $150 million, and more than 80 percent goes toward funding the work of nurse scientists within NINR and around the country. Grady has been instrumental in shaping \u201cBringing Science to Life,\u201d the Institute\u2019s long-term strategic plan. Her tenure as Director of NINR has also seen an increased commitment on training the next generation of nurse scientists, dedicating more resources to training future scientists, as a percentage of budget, than nearly any other NIH institute. She retired from NIH on August 31, 2018. https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih- director/statements/statement-retirement-dr-patricia-grady. ==Awards and honors== In 2002, Grady received the first award of the Centennial Achievement Medal from Georgetown University School of Nursing and Health Studies.
