    "text": "Church of the Atonement, is an historic Carpenter Gothic Episcopal summer chapel in Fish Creek, Wisconsin, within the Episcopal Diocese of Fond du Lac. On March 7, 1985, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. ==History== The church was built in 1878 on the foundation of a fisherman's unfinished house, with lumber donated by Mrs. L. M. Griswold, wife of a local sawmill owner. The style is Carpenter Gothic, with exterior of board and batten and wood shingles. The congregation initially had twenty members, led by Mrs. Griswold and Sara Jeffcoat, a widowed schoolteacher. Early on the congregation was served by Reverend Joseph Jameson who was shared with congregations at Jacksonport, Algoma and Sturgeon Bay. In 1985 the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places for its religious and architectural significance. Today the church offers worship services in summer only, because the building remains unheated. Rotating clergy serve each Sunday morning. ==See also== * List of Registered Historic Places in Wisconsin ==References== Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Wisconsin Atonement Category:Churches in Door County, Wisconsin Category:Carpenter Gothic church buildings in Wisconsin Category:National Register of Historic Places in Door County, Wisconsin Category:1878 establishments in Wisconsin ",
