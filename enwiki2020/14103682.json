    "text": "Automotive Industries (AI) is one of the world's oldest continually published trade publication and the oldest specialising in the automaking business. It was founded in November 1895 as The Horseless Age, the second magazine created to cover the world's transition from horse-drawn conveyances to those powered by the new internal combustion engine. The magazine changed its name to The Automobile in July 1909, an era when gasoline, steam and electricity all vied for pre-eminence in motive power. The magazine's present name was established in November 1917. The title was briefly amended to Automotive and Aviation Industries during the World War II years, as the magazine expanded its coverage of technologies and production methods to include the aircraft industry, in which many automakers participated. ==References== ==External links== * * The Horseless Age Compilations in PDF at The Crittenden Automotive Library. * Automotive Industries archive at HathiTrust Category:Automobile magazines published in the United States Category:Monthly magazines published in the United States Category:Magazines established in 1895 Category:Magazines published in Kentucky Category:Professional and trade magazines ",
