She saw service as a convoy escort during the Second World War, seeing extensive service in the Mediterranean and Far East in 1945. She was sold to Federal Republic of Germany in 1959, where she was renamed Graf Spee and used as a cadet training ship. ==Construction== Flamingo was built by Yarrow Shipbuilders, Scotstoun, Scotland, was laid down on 26 May 1938, launched on 18 April 1939, and completed 3 November 1939.Blackman 1971, p. 131. She was adopted by the civil town of Runcorn in Cheshire as part of Warship Week in 1942. ==Royal Navy service== In 1940 Flamingo undertook convoy protection duties in the North Sea. In April of that year she undertook duties in support of military operations in Norway. The following month she transferred for duties in the Mediterranean and subsequently undertook convoy escort duties in the Red Sea. In April 1941 she transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet and was damaged in December 1941 by air attack, whilst in support of military operations in Tobruk. During 1942 and 1943 she underwent repair and was re- commissioned at Bombay in January 1944 for trials. She then undertook convoy defence duties in the Indian Ocean and remained as part of the British Pacific Fleet. In 1945 she supported military operations in the landing at Myebon, as part of the Burma Campaign. In May 1945 she returned to the UK for refit. Following the war she was placed in reserve, before refit for service in the Persian Gulf, which was completed in 1949. This involved the removal of the Anti-Submarine equipment on the Quarterdeck, which was replaced with a new deckhouse.Marriott, Leo (1983). Royal Navy Frigates 1945-1983.

She served there until 1955 when she returned to Devonport and was put on the disposal list. ==West German Navy service== In 1957, West Germany purchased seven escorts, including Flamingo for its newly established Bundesmarine. After refit by Vickers- Armstrongs (Shipbuilders) Ltd at Hebburn-on-Tyne, she was handed over to the Bundesmarine on 21 January 1959, and was renamed Graf Spee.Blackman, Raymond V B, Jane's Fighting Ships 1963-4, Sampson Low, Marston & Co.
