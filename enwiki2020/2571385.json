    "text": "The Illusionist is a 2006 American romantic mystery film written and directed by Neil Burger and starring Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, and Jessica Biel. It is based loosely on Steven Millhauser's short story \"Eisenheim the Illusionist\". The film tells the story of Eisenheim, a magician in turn-of- the-century Vienna, who reunites with his childhood love, a woman far above his social standing. The film also depicts a fictionalized version of the Mayerling incident. The film premiered at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival and opened the 2006 Seattle International Film Festival; it was distributed in limited release to theaters on August 18, 2006, and expanded nationwide on September 1. The film was a commercial and critical success. ==Plot== In Vienna, Austria-Hungary, 1889, a magician named Eisenheim is arrested by Chief Inspector Walter Uhl of the Vienna Police during a magic show involving necromancy. Later, Uhl explains the story of Eisenheim's life to Crown Prince Leopold. Eisenheim was born to a cabinet-maker and became interested in magic after meeting a travelling magician. He also fell in love with Sophie, the Duchess von Teschen, but the two were forbidden to see each other on account of the former being a peasant. They kept meeting secretly but were caught one day and separated by force. Eisenheim proceeded to study magic by travelling the world, and fifteen years later returned to Vienna to perform. During one performance, he encounters the adult Sophie and learns that she is expected to marry the Crown Prince Leopold, who, it is rumored, is brutal towards women and in the past even murdered one. Eisenheim conducts a private show for the Crown Prince and humiliates him in the course of it. In response, he is banned from performing again in Vienna. After the show, when Sophie comes to offer him help, they argue before surrendering to their feelings and making love. Eisenheim asks Sophie to flee with him, but Sophie is afraid that they will be hunted down and executed. Sophie also reveals that the Crown Prince is planning a coup d'etat against his elderly father, the Emperor Franz Joseph I. At the Mayerling hunting lodge, Sophie tries to end her engagement with Leopold. He reacts by chasing her into the stables with a sword, in full view of the servants. Sophie's body is discovered the next morning in the Vienna Woods, an unknown man blamed for her assassination. This throws Eisenheim into a deep depression. He eventually buys a theatre and begins a new series of magic shows, this time focusing exclusively on the summoning of dead spirits. Leopold secretly attends one of them, during which Eisenheim summons the spirit of Sophie, who says that someone in the theater is her murderer. Leopold, highly unnerved, orders Uhl to arrest Eisenheim for fraud, but Eisenheim manages to avoid jail by openly confessing to the public that his show is a mere illusion. Eisenheim is threatened that if he summons Sophie in his next performance, he will be arrested and likely imprisoned. Uhl attends the packed performance with dozens of officers, and in spite of the warnings, Eisenheim brings Sophie's spirit to life again. Uhl storms the stage with his officers, but to the shock and horror of the audience, Eisenheim is revealed to be a spirit when Uhl's hand passes through him. Eisenheim then fades away in front of everyone. Uhl reveals to Leopold that he has found evidence\u2014a jewel from Leopold's sword and Sophie's distinctive locket\u2014which could implicate Leopold in Sophie's murder. Uhl has already informed the Emperor and the Austro-Hungarian General Staff of Leopold's conspiracy to seize the throne. Leopold points a revolver at Uhl, threatening to kill him, but as officers of the imperial guard of the Austro-Hungarian Army arrive, Leopold shoots himself in the head. Later, as Uhl leaves the palace, he places Sophie's locket in his pocket. He is now no longer Chief Inspector of Police. As a boy approaches him, he is jostled by a bearded man in a long coat. The boy gives him a package containing Eisenheim's notebook about the Orange Tree trick, which Uhl had been unable to figure out. He asks the boy who it was that gave him the notebook, and the boy replies \"Herr Eisenheim.\" He checks his pocket and realizes the person who jostled him stole the locket. He sees the man and chases after him, but the man boards a train and escapes. Uhl realizes the jostling and the notebook are a message from the illusionist, and begins to rethink recent events. He concludes that Sophie and Eisenheim staged her death so that she could be free of Leopold. Uhl laughs delightedly at the brilliance of their plan. Later, and far away, Sophie and Eisenheim start a new life together in a cabin at the foot of a beautiful mountain. Eisenheim places Sophie's locket in her palm. ==Cast== * Edward Norton as Eisenheim the Illusionist (born Eduard Abramovich) ** Aaron Johnson as young Eisenheim * Paul Giamatti as Chief Inspector Walter Uhl * Jessica Biel as Duchess Sophie von Teschen ** Eleanor Tomlinson as young Sophie * Rufus Sewell as Crown Prince Leopold * Eddie Marsan as Josef Fischer, Eisenheim's manager * Jake Wood as Jurka *Tom Fisher as Willgut ==Production== The script was based loosely on \"Eisenheim the Illusionist\", a short story by Steven Millhauser from Millhauser's 1990 collection The Barnum Museum. Together with The Prestige and Scoop, The Illusionist was one of three films in 2006 to explore the world of stage magicians. Magic consultancy and technical advice during the production was supplied by James Freedman, Ricky Jay, Michael Weber and Scott Penrose. Director Neil Burger wrote, \"Starting in pre-production, James (Freedman) became a major collaborator; brainstorming, designing and refining everything from small sleight of hand tricks to major narrative set pieces. He worked with Edward Norton preparing him for his stage performances and acted as a hand double in various scenes. His contribution was enormous.\" Aaron Johnson, who plays the teenage Eduard in the beginning of the film, also learned how to do the ball trick seen in those scenes. The original story, on which the movie is based, does not include the artifice of the protagonist framing the crown prince for murder. Although the film is set in Austria, it was filmed mostly in the Czech Republic. The city of Vienna is represented in the film by T\u00e1bor and Prague, while the scenes set in Eisenheim's childhood village were shot in \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov. The Crown Prince's castle is actually the historical fortress of Konopi\u0161t\u011b (located near Bene\u0161ov), formerly the home of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria. The front gates of Leopold's Vienna palace (the Hofburg) were actually the front gates of Prague Castle. All other shots were at Barrandov Studios in Prague. ==Reception== As of June 29, 2008 the film had earned worldwide box office receipts of $87,892,388, including $39,868,642 in the United States, exceeding its reported $16.5 million budget..
