    "text": "Cody Ray Allen Garbrandthttp://boxing.nv.gov/uploadedFiles/boxingnvgov/content/results/2016_Results/12-30-16MMA.pdf (born July 7, 1991) is an American professional mixed martial artist, signed to the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). He is a former Pinnacle FC fighter and UFC bantamweight champion after becoming only the second fighter to defeat Dominick Cruz, handing him his first defeat in almost a decade at UFC 207. As of October 12, 2020, he is #4 in the UFC bantamweight rankings ==Background== Garbrandt was born and raised in Uhrichsville, Ohio, on July 7, 1991, mostly by his mother Jessica. Cody is ten months younger than his brother Zach, who he grew up constantly fighting. Garbrandt has claimed in several interviews that his drug addict father was never in the picture, spending most of his life in prison. Garbrandt's parents separated after a domestic abuse incident when Cody was one year old. Eventually, Cody was adopted by his mother's now ex-husband at the age of 10. At the ages of four and five, Cody and Zach, respectively, had already been dabbling into boxing with their uncle Robert Meese who was an Olympic alternate in the sport. However, their mother was concerned about the boys becoming punch-drunk thus forbidding boxing and directing them towards wrestling. At Claymont High School, Garbrandt competed in wrestling and football, winning a state championship as a freshman in 2007, by defeating Zach Neibert, 4-2, and was a runner-up in 2008. In football, Garbrandt won All-State honors as a linebacker during his junior season. After failing to claim the second state championship, Garbrandt stopped wrestling and convinced his mother to let him start training boxing seriously. Over about six years, Garbrandt compiled a 32-0 record as an amateur boxer. Despite not competing in wrestling during his final two years of high school, Garbrandt attended the national tournament as a senior and placed fifth, receiving All-American honors and interest from several NCAA Division I schools, such as PSU and Rutgers. However, Garbrandt ended up at Newberry College, a Division II school, before dropping out for academic and personal reasons. After dropping out, Garbrandt sold weed, worked as a bouncer, and eventually completed coal miner training in order to work in the field familiar to his family. However, he decided to commit completely to his amateur MMA career, which was afoot after helping several MMA camps with wrestling. ==Mixed martial arts career== ===Early career=== Garbrandt ended up taking his first amateur bout in 2009 and compiled an amateur MMA record of 6\u20132 before making his professional debut in 2012. His pro record currently stands at 12-3, with ten of his opponents being finished via strikes. Prior to his finish of James Porter in May 2014, he moved from Ohio to Sacramento, California to train at Team Alpha Male in an attempt to further his career. On the heels of a first-round finish of Charles Sanford in October 2014, he signed with the Ultimate Fighting Championship in the fall of 2014. ===Ultimate Fighting Championship=== Garbrandt made his promotional debut against Marcus Brimage on January 3, 2015, at UFC 182. He won the fight via TKO in the third round. Garbrandt faced Henry Briones on July 11, 2015, at UFC 189. He won the fight by unanimous decision. Garbrandt was expected to face John Lineker on February 21, 2016, at UFC Fight Night 83. However, Lineker pulled out of the fight during the week after contracting Dengue Fever and was replaced by Augusto Mendes. Garbrandt won the fight via TKO in the first round. Garbrandt faced fellow undefeated prospect Thomas Almeida on May 29, 2016, at UFC Fight Night 88. He won the fight by knockout in the first round and also earned a Performance of the Night bonus. Garbrandt next faced Takeya Mizugaki on August 20, 2016, at UFC 202. He won the fight via TKO in the opening minute of the first round. ==== UFC Bantamweight Championship ==== Garbrandt faced then-Bantamweight Champion Dominick Cruz on December 30, 2016, at UFC 207. He became champion, winning the fight by unanimous decision after knocking Cruz down on multiple occasions and nearly finishing him in the fourth round. Both participants were awarded Fight of the Night for their performance. In January 2017, the UFC announced that Garbrandt would be one of the coaches on The Ultimate Fighter 25 opposite former UFC Bantamweight champion (and former Team Alpha Male teammate) T.J. Dillashaw, with the two expected to face each other on July 8, 2017, at UFC 213. However the bout was scrapped on May 23 after Garbrandt sustained a back injury. The bout was rescheduled and eventually took place on November 4, 2017, at UFC 217. Garbrandt lost the fight via knockout in the second round to lose the UFC Bantamweight Championship. This was his first loss in professional MMA. Garbrandt faced T.J. Dillashaw in a rematch for the UFC Bantamweight Championship on August 4, 2018, at UFC 227. He lost the fight via TKO in the first round. ====Post UFC Championship==== Garbrandt made his return against Pedro Munhoz on March 2, 2019 at UFC 235. He lost the fight via knockout in the first round. Despite the loss, Garbrandt received his second Fight of the Night bonus award. Garbrandt was scheduled to face Raphael Assun\u00e7\u00e3o as the co- main event on March 28, 2020 at UFC on ESPN 8. However, Garbrandt pulled out of the fight due to kidney problems. Instead the pair fought each other on June 6, 2020 at UFC 250. He won the bout via second round knockout. This win earned him the Performance of the Night. On August 7, 2020, it was announced that Garbrandt intended to move down a division (from bantamweight to flyweight) and was scheduled to face Deiveson Figueiredo for the UFC flyweight championship on November 21, 2020, at UFC 255. However, it was reported on October 2, 2020 that Garbrandt had torn his bicep and was forced to pull out of the contest. ==Personal life== === The Pact === On May 8, 2018, Garbrandt's autobiography was published, titled The Pact. The book details the life of Cody Garbrandt, and explains his deep connection, and completed promise, with young Leukemia survivor Maddux Maple. The book also chronicles the story of Garbrandt's young life in the Appalachian region of Ohio and his early fight with drugs to the story of his reign as UFC Bantamweight Champion, and how he brought his friend Maddux Maple along with him for the whole journey to make good on their pact. === Family === During Garbrandt's run with the MMA promotion Pinnacle FC, he met and began dating Danny Pimsanguan. The couple eventually married in July 2017. In October, the couple announced they were expecting their first child. In March 2018, the couple announced the birth of their son, Kai Fisher Garbrandt. ==Championships and achievements== ===Mixed Martial Arts=== *Ultimate Fighting Championship **UFC Bantamweight Championship (One time) **Performance of the Night (Two times) **Fight of the Night (Two times) vs. Dominick Cruz and Pedro Munhoz *MMAJunkie.com **2020 June Knockout of the Month vs. Raphael Assun\u00e7\u00e3o *Pundit Arena **2017 Fight of the Year vs. T.J.
