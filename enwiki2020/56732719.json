    "text": "The Weraerai (Wirraayaraay) were an indigenous Australian people of the state of New South Wales. They are to be distinguished from the Ualarai. ==Name== The Weraerai ethnonym was form from their word for no, namely wirai/werai. ==Language== The Weraerai language, Wiraiari, is thought to belong to the Wiradjuri branch of the Wiradhuric languages with Robert M. W. Dixon stating that it may be a further dialect of the former. ==Country== Norman Tindale estimated their lands as extending over some , on the northern side of the Gwydir River from Moree to Bingara. It took in Yallaroi, and their northernmost extension ran to Warialda and Gilgil Creek, and from Inverell to north of Wallangra on the Macintyre River. Their western frontier was at Garah. ==Mythology and social rite of initiation== In one early report by the Reverend Greenway, the Weraerai were said to share much mythology with the Gamilaraay. Using European analogies, he described their supreme god as Baiame, creator of the murri (aboriginal people) who had an earthly regent called Turram\u016blan, whose name meant 'one-legged' since 'his locomotive instruments, or feet and legs, (were) in the form of an Indian yale, all on one side; hence his name, signifying 'one-legged'. His consort Muni Burribian was delegated with the task of initiating women into the domestic arts. Turram\u016blan's presence is summoned by the whirling of a bullroarer during the rites of initiation at a bora circle. > Soon the leaders appeared by a long train of aborigines in single file.
