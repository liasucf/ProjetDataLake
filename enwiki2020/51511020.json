It was produced from 1941 to 1944 by the Volkswagen plant, primarily for the Wehrmacht. The Wehrmacht classified the Kommandeurswagen as leichter gel\u00e4ndeg\u00e4ngiger PKW, 4-sitziger, 4-radgetriebener Gel\u00e4ndewagen Typ 87. (light offroad passenger car, four seats, all wheel drive offroad vehicle Type 87). The drivetrain and the engine are the same as in the Volkswagen Typ 166 Schwimmwagen. 564 units of the Kommandeurswagen were produced; in November 1946, the Volkswagen plant produced two more vehicles. No new parts were produced for them; instead, old depot parts were used. == Description == The Typ 87 is a 2-door offroad saloon. The visual appearance is similar to the KdF-Wagen, because the KdF-Wagen body was also used for the Typ 87. Due to the 5\u00bc-16 offroad tyres, the wings had to be increased in size with an additional metal strip next to the bonnet and boot. The running-board strips were also made wider. While the boot of the KdF-Wagen holds a spare wheel in front of the fuel tank, the Typ 87 has an additional 20 l fuel canister instead at the same place. The spare wheel is located on top of the 40 l fuel tank, which has a modified filler neck. Chassis and body are connected with screws. By default, the Kommandeurswagen has a sunroof. Like the VW Typ 166, the Typ 87 has a modified KdF-Wagen chassis. The backbone tube was increased in diameter to hold the additional cardan shaft for the front wheel drive. The steering knuckles were modified for the drive shaft. A worm and sector steering was used. The rear axle is equipped with reduction gears, both front and rear axle differentials are lockable. A single disc dry clutch transmits the torque from the engine to the manual four-speed gearbox which is equipped with an additional offroad gear. The offroad gear is activated with a lever, as well as the front wheel drive. With activated front wheel drive, the top speed is and the maximum slope climbing angle is 33.75\u00b0. The Typ 87 is powered by an air-cooled flat-four-cylinder-otto engine with a displacement of 1131 cm3 and a rated power of . Vehicles made for the German Africa Corps were often equipped with the tropic equipment. The tropic equipment protects the air filter, the carburettor and the electrics from dust. In addition to that, sand tyres are also a part of the tropic equipment. Those tyres are called Kronprinzr\u00e4der. == Technical Data == {|class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=\"2\"| Engine |- | Engine layout | align=center| Four-cylinder, flat-engine (Otto) |- | Cooling | align=center|Air-cooling with fan |- | Valvetrain | align=center|OHV |- | Fuel system | align=center|Carburettor Solex 26 VF3 |- | Firing order | align=center|1-4-3-2 |- |Bore \u00d7 Stroke | align=center|75 mm \u00d7 64 mm |- |Displacement | align=center|1131 cm3 |- |Rated power | align=center| at 3000 min\u22121 |- ! colspan=\"2\"| Drivetrain |- | Clutch | align=center| Single disc dry clutch Fichtel & Sachs K10 |- | Gearbox | align=center| Porsche 4-speed gearbox with additional offroad and reverse gear |- | Drive | align=center|Rear wheel drive with switchable front wheel drive and locking differentials |- ! colspan=\"2\"| Chassis |- | Frame | align=center|Backbone tube chassis |- |Front springs | align=center rowspan=\"2\"|Torsion bar |- |Rear springs |- |Steering | align=center|Worm and sector |- |Brake system | align=center|Drum brakes |- |Tyres | align=center|front and rear 5,25-16 or 200-16 |- ! colspan=\"2\"|Dimensions and weights |- |Dimensions (L \u00d7 W \u00d7 H) | align=center| \u00d7 \u00d7 |- |Ground clearance | align=center| |- |Wheelbase | align=center| |- | Track width | align=center|front: rear: |- | Turning radius | align=center| 5 m |- |Max. allowed weight | align=center| |- |Max. payload | align=center| |- ! colspan=\"2\"|Additional data |- |Fuel consumption | align=center|8.5 l/100 km |- |Oil consumption |align=center|0.12 l/100 km |- |Fuel tank | align=center| 40 l + 20 l canister |- |Top speed | align=center| |- | Battery | align=center|Lead-acid, 6 V, 75 Ah |- | Starter | align=center| Bosch EED 0,4/6 |- | Generator | align=center| Bosch REDK 130/6/2600 |- ! |- | Source | |} == References == Mayer, page 30 Mayer, page 31 Mayer, page 32 Mayer, page 33 Mayer, page 34 Mayer, page 47 == Bibliography == * Hans-Georg Mayer: Der VW-K\u00e4fer im Kriege und im milit\u00e4rischen Einsatz danach.
