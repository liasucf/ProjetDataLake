    "text": "St Mary's Church, Downe This is a list of cathedrals, churches and chapels in the London Borough of Bromley within the Greater London. The list focuses on the more permanent churches and buildings which identify themselves as places of Christian worship. The denominations appended are those by which they self- identify. ==History== London's churches and chapels are extraordinarily numerous and diverse. Anglican and nonconformist churches and chapels are most numerous, but there are also many Catholic churches as well as places of worship for non-Christian religions. Most of the Anglican churches lie within the Anglican dioceses of London to the north and Southwark to the south. For historical reasons, the Anglican churches in London north of the Thames but east of the River Lea fall within the Diocese of Chelmsford, and those in the London Boroughs of Bexley and Bromley fall within the Diocese of Rochester. As London expanded during the early 19th century, many new churches and chapels were built independently by the growing nonconformist urban population. ===Significance=== Although many churches and chapels were entirely or partly lost to 19th-century demolitions and to bombing in the Second World War, many historic, architecturally significant and religiously significant buildings remain. Churches in this list belong to various denominations, as indicated. ==List of churches== The borough has an estimated 135 churches for 326,900 inhabitants, a ratio of one to every 2,421 people. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
