    "text": "The 1998-2011 boundaries for Turtle Mountain highlighted in red Turtle Mountain was a provincial electoral district in the Canadian province of Manitoba. It was created with the westward expansion of the province's boundaries in 1881, eliminated by redistribution in 1968, and re-established in 1979, formally returned to the electoral map with the provincial election of 1981, was dissolved for the 2011 election and will return once again for the 2019 Manitoba general election. Turtle Mountain was located in the southwestern region of the province. It was bounded to the north by Ste. Rose, to the west by Minnedosa and Arthur-Virden, to the east by Pembina, Carman and Portage la Prairie, and south to the American state of North Dakota. The riding was primarily rural. Communities in the riding included Killarney, Carberry, Glenboro, Pilot Mound and MacGregor. The riding's population in 1996 was 18,569. In 1999, the average family income was $43,265, and the unemployment rate was 3.50%. Agriculture accounted for 37% of all industry in the riding, followed by health and social service work at 9%. Thirteen per cent of the riding's residents were German. Turtle Mountain was represented by the Progressive Conservative Party for most of its history, and was considered safe for that party. It was in Tory hands for all but six years after 1922 in its first incarnation, and was held by the Tories at all times in its second incarnation. The last MLA was Cliff Cullen, who was elected in a 2004 by- election. Following the 2008 electoral redistribution, the riding was dissolved into the new ridings of Agassiz, Midland, and Spruce Woods. This change took effect for the 2011 election. Cullen transferred to Spruce Woods. Following the 2018 redistribution, Turtle Mountain will be re-created out of Arthur-Virden, Spruce Woods and Midland and will first be contested in the 2019 Manitoba general election. The riding will contain the municipalities of Two Borders, Melita, Grassland, Brenda-Waskada, Deloraine-Winchester, Boissevain-Morton (previously in Arthur-Virden), Prairie Lakes, Killarney - Turtle Mountain, Argyle, Cartwright-Roblin (previously in Spruce Woods) and Lorne, Swan Lake 7, Louise and Pembina (previously in Midland). As of the 2016 Census, 8,294 (36%) people were in the Arthur-Virden portion of the riding, 7,215 (31%) were in the Spruce Woods portion and 7,653 (33%) were in the Midland portion, for a total population of 23,612.Statistics Canada, 2016 Canada Census The riding is named for Turtle Mountain Provincial Park.http://www.boundariescommission.mb.ca/wp-content/uploads/edbc-final- report-2018-en.pdf ==List of provincial representatives== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
