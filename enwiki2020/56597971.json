    "text": "The Copa Am\u00e9rica of Beach Soccer (named natively in Spanish as the Copa Am\u00e9rica de F\u00fatbol Playa) is a biennial international beach soccer tournament contested between the senior men's national teams of the 10 members of CONMEBOL. It is beach soccer's version of the better known Copa Am\u00e9rica in its parent sport, association football. Along with the longer running World Cup qualification tournament, it is one of the main two beach soccer championships disputed exclusively by South American national teams. The tournament is organised by the governing body for football in South America, CONMEBOL, who established the event in 2016 following their declaration of commitment a year prior, to develop beach soccer on the continent. Exhibition-style events also held under the Copa Am\u00e9rica title took place in 1994\u201399, 2003 and 2012\u201314, but this fully competitive incarnation of the Copa Am\u00e9rica is the first to be officially sanctioned and organised by CONMEBOL, who also organise the other official Copa Am\u00e9rica events in association football and futsal. Brazil are the current champions. ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width: 100%; text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=2 width=5%|Year !rowspan=2 width=14%|Location | width = 1% rowspan=10| !colspan=3|Final | width = 1% rowspan=4| !colspan=3|Third Place Play-off |- bgcolor=#EFEFEF !width=15%|Winners !width=8%|Score !width=15%|Runners-up !width=15%|Third Place !width=8%|Score !width=15%|Fourth Place |-bgcolor=#D0E7FF |align=\"center\"|2016 details | Santos, Brazil |'''''' |12\u20132 | | |7\u20136 | |- |align=\"center\"|2018 details | Asia District, Peru |'''''' |7\u20133 | | |7\u20134 | |-bgcolor=#D0E7FF |align=\"center\"|2020 | Rio de Janeiro, Brazil |colspan=10|Originally scheduled for 10\u201317 May.
