    "text": "Hodges Drive is a main west-east road in Joondalup, north of Perth, Western Australia. It begins in the suburb of Ocean Reef at a T-junction with Ocean Reef Road and runs through the residential areas in Ocean Reef, Connolly and Heathridge, before terminating at Joondalup Drive. The road continues from there as Grand Boulevard. Hodges Drive is a four lane dual-carriageway for most of its length, and changes to a two way single carriageway road west of Marmion Avenue. The northern part of the Mitchell Freeway terminated at Hodges Drive between 1999 and 2008, and the road provides freeway access for residents in the Joondalup City area. A project to duplicate Hodges Drive, turning it into a dual carriageway for its entire length, was expected to be completed by the end of June 2013. ==Major intersections== * Ocean Reef Road - Ocean Reef * Marmion Avenue (State Route 71) - Connolly, Heathridge, Currambine, Iluka, Beldon, Mullaloo * Mitchell Freeway (State Route 2) - Craigie, Woodvale, Kingsley, Padbury * Joondalup Drive (State Route 85) - Joondalup, Edgewater, Carramar, Tapping File:Hodges Drive (W from Joondalup Dr).ogv|Westbound from Joondalup Drive, crossing over Mitchell Freeway File:Hodges Drive (W to Marmion Ave).ogv|Westbound approach to Marmion Avenue ==See also== ==References== Category:Roads in Perth, Western Australia Category:Joondalup Category:Articles containing video clips ",
