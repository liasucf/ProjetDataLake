After doing well in the trial matches in 1931-32 he was selected to tour England with India's first Test touring team in 1932. However, he took only three wickets in nine matches, and did not play in the Test match. He took his best figures for a Muslims and Parsees team against the touring MCC at Karachi in 1926-27: 5 for 114 and 2 for 27. His highest score was 74, along with five wickets, to help the Maharaj Kumar of Vizianagram's XI win the final of the inaugural Moin-ud-Dowlah Gold Cup Tournament in 1930-31. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1898 births Category:1966 deaths Category:Indian cricketers Category:Muslims cricketers Category:Sindh cricketers ",
