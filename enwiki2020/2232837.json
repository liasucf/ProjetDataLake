() is a fjord in the Sunnm\u00f8re region of M\u00f8re og Romsdal county, Norway. It is located entirely in the Stranda Municipality. It is a -long branch off the Sunnylvsfjorden, which is a branch off the Storfjorden (Great Fjord). The small village of Geiranger is located at the end of the fjord where the Geirangelva river empties into it. ==The fjord== The Geiranger Fjord, a UNESCO World Heritage Site The fjord is one of Norway's most visited tourist sites. In 2005, it was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, jointly with the N\u00e6r\u00f8yfjorden. This status was challenged by the disputed plans to build power lines across the fjord. A car ferry, which doubles as a sightseeing trip, is operated by Fjord1 Nordvestlandske. It runs lengthwise along the fjord between the small towns of Geiranger and Hellesylt. The fjord is scheduled to require zero-emissions ships in 2026. Along the fjord's sides there lie a number of now-abandoned farms. Some restoration has been made by the Storfjordens venner association. The most commonly visited among these are Skagefl\u00e5, Knivsfl\u00e5, and Blomberg. Skagefl\u00e5 may also be reached on foot from Geiranger, while the others require a boat excursion. The fjord is also host to several impressive waterfalls such as Seven Sisters Falls. Magdalene Thoresen, Henrik Ibsen's mother-in-law, said of the area: > This fjord is surrounded by some of the steepest mountains on the entire > west coast. It is very narrow and has no habitable shore area, for the > precipitous heights rise in sheer and rugged strata almost straight out of > the water. Foaming waterfalls plunge into the fjord from jagged peaks. There > are, however, a few mountain farms here, and of these one or two have such > hazardous access, by paths that wind around steep precipices, and by bridges > that are fixed to the mountain with iron bolts and rings, that they bear > witness in a most striking way to the remarkable powers of invention which > the challenges of nature have developed in man.History about Bringe- > Ragnhild. ==Waterfalls== Seven Sisters (De syv s\u00f8strene) and the Suitor (Friaren) waterfalls. The two most notable waterfalls in the Geiranger Fjord are Seven Sisters Falls and the Suitor (Nynorsk Friaren). Both falls face one another across the fjord, and the Suitor is said to be trying to woo the sisters opposite. The Bridal Veil is another waterfall in the fjord, so named because it falls delicately over one rocky edge, and when seen backlit by the sun it has the appearance of a thin veil over the rocks. ==Rock slides== The Geiranger Fjord is under constant threat from the mountain \u00c5kerneset which is about to erode into the fjord. A collapse would produce a tsunami, hitting several nearby towns including Geiranger and Hellesylt in about ten minutes. == In popular culture == *The 2015 movie The Wave (B\u00f8lgen) is based on the premise of a rock slide from the mountain \u00c5kerneset inundating the town of Geiranger. *Frozen used the landscapes of the Geirangerfjord and N\u00e6r\u00f8yfjord as basis for the landscapes of Arendelle. == Gallery == GeirangerFjordNorwayFjord.jpg|A historical photograph of the fjord with Seven Sisters Falls Fiordo de Geiranger, Noruega, 2019-09-07, DD 109-116 PAN.jpg|Geiranger fjord from the water (panorama) Geirangerfjord sieben Schwestern.jpg|Seven Sisters Falls making its way to the Geiranger Fjord 2011-08-04 22.48.42 Geiranger fjord from climb parking lot (panorama 5x).png|Geiranger fjord from climb parking lot (panorama) 2011-08-05 13.58.46 Geiranger fjord from Dalsnibba (zoom out).jpg|Geiranger fjord from Dalsnibba (zoom out) 2011-08-05 13.44.10 Geiranger fjord from Dalsnibba.jpg|Geiranger fjord from Dalsnibba (zoom in) Fiordo de Geiranger, Noruega, 2019-09-07, DD 30-34 PAN.jpg|The sight-seeing boat making a trip through the fjord Fiordo de Geiranger, Noruega, 2019-09-07, DD 35.jpg|View from the water ==References== ==External links== * * Geiranger Tourist-Info * Destination Geirangerfjord - \u00c5lesund & Sunnm\u00f8re * Geirangerfjord - the official travel guide to Norway * Travel information Category:Stranda Category:Fjords of M\u00f8re og Romsdal Category:World Heritage Sites in Norway ",
