    "text": "There are currently five bridges over the Danube river in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. Four of them are currently used for traffic, while one of them is for pedestrians and trams. == Lafranconi Bridge == Lafranconi is the first bridge in Bratislava made of concrete. It is also a part of the highway. It was built within 1985 - 1991. The number of cars crossing the bridge daily is estimated to be around 41 000. The priority of the design was aimed to be clean, not interruptive to the surrounding nature by its shape, not blocking any view of the city by its body structure, while being in harmony with the already existing bridge at that time - SNP Bridge. The Lafranconi Bridge is 761 metres long. There is a four-lane roadway, together 30 metres wide. Lafranconi Bridge Underneath the roadway, there are also footbridges for pedestrians and bikers on both sides. Inside the bridge, there is a waterpipe and a gas pipeline going through.https://www.transport.sk/spravy/cestna- infrastruktura/5123-bratislava-sa-pysi-piatimi-mostami-cez- dunaj.htmlhttps://www.welcometobratislava.eu/bridges-of-bratislava/ Most lafranconi.jpg|Lafranconi Most Lafranconi2.JPG|Lafranconi === The name of the bridge === The original name was supposed to be Most ml\u00e1de\u017ee - Bridge of Youth, however it finally got named Lafranconi after the student dormitory Lafranconi, situated at the right bank of Danube river. == SNP Bridge == From 1993 to 2012 the bridge was named Nov\u00fd Most - New Bridge. It is made of steel, a fan-shaped design suspended bridge. It is the only bridge in Bratislava to have no single pillar inside the Danube River. It is the biggest bridge in Bratislava. In 2002 it was named a Century Building in Slovakia in the category Bridge Constructions. The SNP Bridge belongs to the association World Federation of Great Towers. Since May 2018 it is also a National Culture Heritage site.https://www.welcometobratislava.eu/bridges-of-bratislava/ The bridge was built within 1967 - 1972. For the sake of building this bridge, a few historic sites were destroyed - a part of the Bratislava Castle structures, historically important parts of Vydrica, Rybn\u00e9 N\u00e1mestie - Fish Square and Bratislava's Neolog moorish synagogue. This bridge however helped to speed up the traffic and also helped the development of Petr\u017ealka District. The length of this bridge is 430.8 metres. The height is 95 metres. The diameter of the dome is 32 metres. The bridge has two of the two-lane roadways, and has pedestrians and cyclist sections underneath on both sides. In the category of suspended bridges, it gained fourth place in 1972. However it is on top of the world's bridges with only one single pylon and only one single hanging plane.https://www.welcometobratislava.eu/bridges-of-bratislava/ Inside the bridge there is a waterpipe, the supplying Old Town and Petr\u017ealka districts.
