    "text": "\"Maximum Security\" was a comic book story line and company-wide crossover that ran through a three-issue, self-titled limited series and individual issues of the other titles published by Marvel Comics with a cover date of either December 2000 or January 2001. In it, a multitude of alien civilizations that have previously interacted with Earth join forces to prevent humans from interfering further with galactic affairs. To accomplish this, they designate Earth as a penal colony. The miniseries and its crossover in the pages of Avengers were written by Kurt Busiek. Marvel collected half of the story arc in trade paperback on November 24, 2010.Avengers / X-MEN: Maximum Security at Amazon.com, accessed January 11, 2011. ==Publication history== In December 2000, Marvel Comics published Maximum Security: Dangerous Planet, which recapped relevant events and set up the crossover's main plot. All three issues of Maximum Security were published in January 2001. Most other comics from the publisher that month tied into the event, if only marginally. While not carrying the \"Maximum Security\" banner, plotlines from the earlier miniseries Avengers Forever (1999) and Avengers Infinity (2000) were concluded in Maximum Security. Writer Kurt Busiek stated that he wrote the story out of 'self-defense', having been told that Marvel was looking for a big crossover story and that he either had to come up with one, or he'd be participating in someone else's. His original synopsis was for a story called 'Y2KANG' where when the clock ticked over at midnight of New Year's Eve 1999, it became 1900 again and all the Marvel characters would be turn-of-the-century versions of themselves. However, by the time Marvel stated this was the story they wanted to do, it couldn't be solicited until April 2000 and wouldn't have made any sense. Busiek's second suggestion was 'Maximum Security', the concept of which was influenced by Australian history and how the British used Australia as a place to dump convicts, too far away from Britain for them to escape and return. Busiek thought it would be fun if the galactic powers that be viewed Earth the same way, dumping their criminals here and not caring about what happened to the natives. Busiek needed someone to play the 'alien cop' and chose U.S. Agent, saying that he hadn't been used much lately and was inspired by the character. He was influenced by Tommy Lee Jones character from the movie The Fugitive because he was 'a tough, no nonsense Federal Agent who didn't care about your sob stories, just that if you broke the law you were going to jail', considering the characters personality to be 'very USAgent-y.'Interview with Kurt Busiek https://www.facebook.com/groups/505247186277499/search/?query=kurt%20busiek ==Plot== Thor, Tigra, Starfox, Quasar, Moondragon, Photon and the Jack of Hearts become the temporary Avengers Infinity squad when they travel into space and encounter a group of cosmic entities called the Infinites.
