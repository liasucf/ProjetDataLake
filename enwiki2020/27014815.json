    "text": "Habaswein () is a town in Kenya's Wajir County, which is almost exclusively inhabited by ethnic Somalis. According to the 2009 census, the town was the second most populous in the county of Wajir with a population of 21,890. The A13 highway from Isiolo to Mandera passes through Habaswein; it is located on the stretch from Modogashe to Wajir. The Town is much better than the county headquarters of Wajir and has better environment, reliable and clean water sources. It was fast rising before the County Government denied it resources and sidelined the development of the area. The First County Government of Wajir denied the city and its inhabitants their rights. It was discriminated against. The Habaswein hospital almost closed during this time with no drugs. A Pallasite stony-iron meteorite named Sericho was found near Habaswein in 2019. ==Etymology== The name Habeswein derives from the , meaning big dust. The town is right next to the plains of the seasonal Ewaso Nyiro River. During the dry spell and in the winter winds, large fumes of dust covers the town. This is due to the fact that there is few vegetation coverage in and around the town. The town lies on the border between Wajir South Constituency and Wajir West Constituency; the road passing through the town forms the border. It has lakes, seasonal rivers/streams and agricultural valleys. The lakes are: Lake Bor, Lake Bissike, Lake Bogol, Lake Duup, Waratiris (stream), Abakfin, Ibrahim Ure, Shuub waraba, Cinjir, Lake Dima, Qote, Shimbirey and Quarintil. ==References== Category:Populated places in Wajir County ",
