It is also referred to as the Senate of Japan, Genr\u014din being the word used to describe the Roman Senate, and other western legislatures named after it. The Freedom and People's Rights Movement and liberals among the Meiji oligarchy had withdrawn from the Meiji government over their efforts to establish a national assembly with increased representative democracy. The Osaka Conference of 1875 attempted to address this issue by the establishment of the Genr\u014din, a national assembly whose members (theoretically appointed directly by the Emperor) were drawn from the peerage, upper ranks of the bureaucracy and various scholars. The Genr\u014din was only quasi-legislative, in that it had the power to review proposed legislation and make recommendations, but did not have the power to actually initiate any legislation. As an assembly, it replaced the . In 1876, the Genr\u014din was given the task of drafting a constitution for Japan, which it completed in 1880, only to have the draft rejected by It\u014d Hirobumi and Iwakura Tomomi as being too liberal. The Genr\u014din was replaced by the Imperial Diet in 1890. The Genr\u014din should not be confused with the Genr\u014d, or elder statesmen. Most of the Genr\u014d were members of the Genr\u014din, but not all members of the Genr\u014din were Genr\u014d. ==References== * Banno, Junji.
