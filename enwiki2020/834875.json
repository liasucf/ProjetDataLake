    "text": "The Husson University is a private university based in Bangor, Maine. It offers undergraduate and graduate degrees and has a total enrollment of approximately 3,500 students, including 750 graduate students. Husson University is one of three universities in the Bangor area (the University of Maine at Augusta and the University of Maine are the others) and the only private university in the region. Husson also has campuses in Westbrook and Presque Isle, giving it the largest physical footprint of any private university in the state. On March 6, 2020 in an email to the University's Faculty, Robert Clark, President of Husson University wrote \"Husson University will transition our Southern Maine operations to our online division. This transition will include the sale of Husson\u2019s Southern Maine property located at 340 County Road in Westbrook, Maine. The University will suspend operations at our Westbrook Campus on May 15, 2020, at the end of the semester.\" ==History== Founded in 1898, Husson was originally named Shaw School of Business and was located on the second floor of a building in downtown Bangor. Enrollment was low until after World War II, when its reputation grew as a business school. In 1953 the Maine Legislature authorized the school, now known as Husson College, to grant Bachelor of Science degrees. It became a university in 2008.HUSSON: About, Fast Facts Today the University has four colleges, and two schools: the College of Business, the College of Health and Education, the College of Science and Humanities, the School of Pharmacy, and the New England School of Communications. The New England School of Communications, known by its abbreviation NESCom, was an independent school acquired by Husson in 1997, and was separately accredited and operated semi- autonomously with control over its own tuition, hiring, admissions, and graduation requirements until 2014. Since 2000, undergraduate enrollment has increased 5-10% with each incoming class. In response, the University continues to add a significant number of new faculty to its ranks. Today, students graduate having trained both in the specialties of their chosen fields and in how those fields fit into a broader cultural context. ==Accreditation== Husson is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education with specific programs accredited by the International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education (IACBE), the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE), the Commission on Accreditation in Physical Therapy Education (CAPTE), the Accreditation Council for Occupational Therapy Education (ACOTE), and the National Board of Certified Counselors (NBCC). ==Campus== The Husson University Campus in Bangor, includes the Newman Gymnasium, the Winkin Sports Complex, Robert O'Donnell Commons (the College of Health and Education is located here), Peabody Hall (including the Sawyer Library, the College of Business, and the Ross Furman Student Center), the Dickerman Dining Center (renovated in 2012), the Dyke Center for Family Business, the Wildey Communications Center (named for NESCOM founder George Wildey), and the Beardsley Meeting House (named for former Husson President and current Commissioner of the Department of Conservation William Beardsley) which houses the 500-seat Gracie Theatre, and Living Learning Center which houses upperclassmen in suites and holds offices and classrooms on the ground floor. There are four residence halls: Hart Hall, Bell Hall, Carlisle Hall, and the Living & Learning Center, a LEED Silver targeted student residence and academic building which opened in the fall of 2012. Two walking trails circle the outer perimeter and offer scenic walks through the Maine forest. In Presque Isle, Maine, the school is located on the campus of Northern Maine Community College. The school moved to its present location from a campus in Caribou, Maine. Husson also operates in Westbrook. ===Gracie Theatre=== The Gracie Theatre, located in the Beardsley Meeting House, is a 500-seat multipurpose venue. Opera singer Richard Troxell, comedian Bob Marley, and the Bangor Symphony Orchestra have all performed in the Gracie.
