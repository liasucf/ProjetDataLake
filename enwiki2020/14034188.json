    "text": "Filipe de Magalh\u00e3es (c. 1571-1652) was a Portuguese composer of sacred polyphony. ==Life== Filipe de Magalh\u00e3es was born in Azeit\u00e3o, Portugal, in 1571. He studied music at the Cathedral of \u00c9vora with Manuel Mendes where he was a colleague of the equally renowned polyphonists Duarte Lobo and Manuel Cardoso. He was apparently considered by his master Manuel Mendes as his favourite student; the latter left his own manuscripts to Magalh\u00e3es, in the hope that these would be eventually published. In 1589 Magalh\u00e3es replaced Manuel Mendes as mestre do Claustro da S\u00e9. Later, he went to Lisbon to become a member of the Capela Real (Royal Chapel's) choir and then mestre de Capela da Miseric\u00f3rdia. On the 27th of March 1623 he was appointed Mestre da Capela Real, a position he held until 1641. While at \u00c9vora, he was the teacher of Est\u00eav\u00e3o Lopes Morago, Est\u00eav\u00e3o de Brito and Manuel Correia, who carried on with the music school of the Cathedral of \u00c9vora in the 16th and 17th centuries. He died in Lisbon. ==Musical work== Magalh\u00e3es dedicated himself to the composition of sacred polyphonic works for the liturgy. Most of them were published in collections such as the Missarum Liber, which was dedicated to Philip II of Portugal, and the Cantica Beatissima Virgines, published in Lisbon in 1639. He also wrote a book of plainsong, Cantus Ecclesiasticus, which was published in five different editions (the first ones in Lisbon in 1614 and in Antwerp in 1642, and the last one in 1724). The catalogue of the Music Library of King John IV of Portugal also mentions one 8-voice Mass, 6-voice Lamentations for Maundy Thursday, one 7-voice Christmas villancico and five 5- and 6-voice motets. All these works are believed to have been lost during the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. ==Sources== *https://web.archive.org/web/20110825043418/http://projecto.evoradistritodigital.pt/noticias/noticia_2005.10.25_01/view?searchterm=xvi ==External links== * * Category:1570s births Category:1652 deaths Category:Portuguese classical composers Category:Portuguese Baroque composers Category:Renaissance composers Category:16th-century Portuguese people Category:17th-century Portuguese people Category:Mestres da Capela Real Category:People from Set\u00fabal District Category:17th-century classical composers Category:Portuguese male classical composers ",
