    "text": "Mompha langiella is a moth of the family Momphidae. It is found in most of Europe, except parts of the Balkan Peninsula and the Mediterranean islands. ==Description== The wingspan is . Adults are on wing from April to September. The larvae feed on Circaea \u00d7 intermedia, enchanter's nightshade (Circaea lutetiana), rosebay willowherb (Chamerion angustifolium), Epilobium collinum, great willowherb (Epilobium hirsutum), broad-leaved willowherb (Epilobium montanum) and hoary willowherb (Epilobium parviflorum). They mine the leaves of their host plant which starts as a full depth corridor. The frass is black and deposited in an irregular central line. Later, the mine has the form of a blotch with frass in irregular clouds. The blotch may be a continuation of the corridor, but may be found on a different leaf. There are often several mines in a single leaf. The mines are white at first but turn brown later. Pupation takes place outside of the mine. ==References== ==External links== * Mompha langiella on UKMoths A mined leaf of Circaea lutetiana Larva Category:Momphidae Category:Leaf miners Category:Moths described in 1796 Category:Moths of Europe Category:Taxa named by Jacob H\u00fcbner ",
