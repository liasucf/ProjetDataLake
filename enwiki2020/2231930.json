    "text": "The acentric factor is a conceptual number introduced by Kenneth Pitzer in 1955, proven to be very useful in the description of matter. It has become a standard for the phase characterization of single & pure components. The other state description parameters are molecular weight, critical temperature, critical pressure, and critical volume (or critical compressibility). The acentric factor is said to be a measure of the non-sphericity (centricity) of molecules. As it increases, the vapor curve is \"pulled\" down, resulting in higher boiling points. It is defined as: :\\omega = - \\log_{10} (p^{\\rm{sat}}_r) - 1, {\\rm \\ at \\ } T_r = 0.7. where T_r = \\frac{T}{T_c} is the reduced temperature, p^{\\rm{sat}}_r = \\frac{p^{\\rm{sat}}}{p_c} is the reduced saturation vapor pressure. For many monatomic fluids :p_r^{\\rm{sat}}{\\rm \\ at \\ } T_r = 0.7, is close to 0.1, therefore \\omega \\to 0. In many cases, T_r = 0.7 lies above the boiling temperature of liquids at atmosphere pressure. Values of can be determined for any fluid from accurate experimental vapor pressure data. Preferably, these data should first be regressed against a vapor pressure equation, like . (In this regression, a careful check for erroneous vapor pressure measurements must be made, preferably using a log(P) vs. 1/T graph, and any obviously incorrect or dubious values should be discarded. The regression should then be re-run with the remaining good values until a good fit is obtained.) Using the known critical temperature, Tc, vapor pressure at Tr=0.7 can then be used in the defining equation, above, to estimate acentric factor. The definition of gives essentially zero for the noble gases argon, krypton, and xenon. \\omega is very close to zero for other spherical molecules. Values of correspond to vapor pressures above the critical pressure, and are non-physical. By definition, a van der Waals fluid has a critical compressibility of 3/8 and an acentric factor of about \u22120.302024, indicating a small ultra-spherical molecule. A Redlich-Kwong fluid has a critical compressibility of 1/3 and an acentric factor of about 0.058280, close to nitrogen; without the temperature dependence of its attractive term, its acentric factor would be only -0.293572. ==Values of some common gases== {| class=\"wikitable\" | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Molecule | align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Acentric Factor |- | Acetone||0.304 |- | Acetylene||0.187 |- | Ammonia||0.253 |- | Argon||0.000 |- | Carbon Dioxide||0.228 |- | Decane||0.484 |- | Ethanol||0.644 |- | Helium||-0.390 |- | Hydrogen||-0.220 |- | Krypton||0.000 |- | Methanol||0.556 |- | Neon||0.000 |- | Nitrogen||0.040 |- | Nitrous Oxide||0.142 |- | Oxygen||0.022 |- | Xenon||0.000 |} ==See also== * Equation of state * Reduced pressure * Reduced temperature == References == Category:Gas laws ",
