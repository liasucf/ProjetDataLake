    "text": "The Silvanectes (or Sulbanectes) were a small Belgic tribe dwelling around present-day Senlis, Oise. == Name == === Attestations === They are mentioned as Ulmanectes by Pliny (1st c. AD),Pliny. Naturalis Historia, 4:106 as Soub\u00e1nektoi (\u03a3\u03bf\u03c5\u03b2\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9) by Ptolemy (2nd c. AD),Ptolemy. Ge\u014dgraphik\u1e15 Hyph\u1e17g\u0113sis, 2:9:6 and as Siluanectas in the Notitia Dignitatum (5th c. AD).Notitia Dignitatum. oc 42:42 The Silvanectes are also attested under the name Sulbanectes in an inscription, and their capital was mentioned as civitas Sulbanectium in 48 BC. === Etymology === The etymology of the name is unclear. It could be a Latinized form of Gaulish *Seluanecti (from Gaulish selu\u0101- 'possession, property' > 'herd'; compare with Old Irish selb 'property, possession', Welsh ar helw 'in possession of'), corrupted under the influence of Latin silva ('forest'). A comparison with Old Irish sulbair ('eloquent') has also been proposed. The city of Senlis, attested as civitas Silvanectum ca. 400 AD ('civitas of the Silvanectes', Sinleti in the 6th c., Senliz in 1211) is named after the Gallic tribe. == Geography == The Silvanectes dwelled southwest of the Suessionnes, near the Meldi and the Bellovaci. Their small territory, a depression surrounded by wooded heights, could be easily dominated by more powerful Bellovaci, to which they were probably tributary. == References == === Bibliography === * * * * Category:Gauls Category:Tribes of pre-Roman Gaul Category:Historical Celtic peoples Category:Belgae ",
