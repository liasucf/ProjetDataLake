    "text": "The Criminal is a 1960 British neo-noir crime film produced by Nat Cohen and directed by Joseph Losey, starring Stanley Baker, Sam Wanamaker, Gr\u00e9goire Aslan, and Margit Saad. Alun Owen wrote the screenplay, from a story by an uncredited Jimmy Sangster. Baker plays an ex-con who takes part in the robbery of a racetrack and is caught and sent back to prison. The film depicts a harsh and violent portrayal of prison life that led to the film being banned in several countries, including Finland. It was released in the United States as The Concrete Jungle. ==Cast== * Stanley Baker as Johnny Bannion * Sam Wanamaker as Mike Carter * Gr\u00e9goire Aslan as Frank Saffrion * Margit Saad as Suzanne * Jill Bennett as Maggie * Rupert Davies as Edwards * Laurence Naismith as Mr Town * John Van Eyssen as Formby * Noel Willman as Prison Governor * Derek Francis as Priest * Redmond Phillips as Prison Doctor * Kenneth J.

Which is what we did.\" He says the producers wanted a sequence where the criminals rob a race track but he felt that had been done in The Killing (1956) so he filmed it taking place off screen. ==Reception== According to Losey the film was a commercial success. He said the film was banned in Ireland because so many of the prisoners were Irish Catholics. The film was reportedly very successful in Paris. ==References== ==External links== * * * The Criminal at BFI Screenonline Category:1960 films Category:1960 crime drama films Category:British films Category:British black- and-white films Category:British crime drama films Category:British heist films Category:British prison films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Joseph Losey Category:Suicide in film Category:Films with screenplays by Jimmy Sangster Category:1960 drama films ",
