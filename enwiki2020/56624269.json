    "text": "The 2020 NFL Draft was the 85th annual meeting of National Football League (NFL) franchises to select newly eligible players for the 2020 NFL season. The first round was held on April 23, followed by the second and third rounds on April 24. The draft concluded with rounds 4\u20137 on April 25. The NFL originally planned to hold the event live in Paradise, Nevada, before all public events related to it were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, all team selections took place via videoconferencing, with league commissioner Roger Goodell broadcasting picks from his home. ==Format== The host city was chosen among finalists Denver, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Cleveland/Canton in May 2018 during the NFL Spring League Meeting, when Nashville was chosen to host the 2019 draft. However, the host city for 2020 was deferred. After Denver withdrew, citing scheduling conflicts, Las Vegas was chosen as the original host on December 12, 2018, coinciding with the Las Vegas Raiders' arrival in the city. Plans were announced for a main stage near the Caesars Forum convention center and a \"red carpet\" stage for arrivals on a floating platform in front of the Bellagio resort, with players being transported to and from the stage by boat. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the NFL announced on March 16 that it had canceled all public festivities associated with the event. Instead, the draft was held remotely, with team coaches and GMs convening via Microsoft Teams due to all team facilities also being closed. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced the picks for rounds 1\u20133 from the basement of his home in Bronxville, New York. During the draft, Goodell announced that Las Vegas would host the draft in 2022. ==Player selections== The following is the breakdown of the 255 players selected by position: * 39 Linebackers * 35 Wide receivers * 27 Cornerbacks * 21 Safeties * 20 Defensive tackles * 20 Offensive tackles * 18 Offensive guards * 18 Running backs * 17 Defensive ends * 13 Quarterbacks * 12 Tight ends * 9 Centers * 3 Placekickers * 2 Punters * 1 Long snapper {| border=0 cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"8\" |- | {|style=margin: 0.75em 0 0 0.5em;\" |- | style=\"background:#d9e9f9; border:1px solid #aaa; width:2em; text- align:center;\"| * | =compensatory selection || |} | cellspacing=\"2\"| |} ==Trades== In the explanations below, (PD) indicates trades completed prior to the start of the draft (i.e. Pre-Draft), while (D) denotes trades that took place during the 2020 draft.
