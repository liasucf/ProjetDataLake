The contestant will press the remote control in which the stage of the producer crew he/she did not choose will be lowered down with flames showing up (similar to what eliminated contestants faced after the One Minute Rap round) while the chosen Producer Crew will welcome the contestant and will go the waiting room with other contestants from the same crew. \\- Contestant CH did not appear starting from this round, and it is rumoured that he has voluntarily left the show, while to make the numbers even, contestant Jackal was eliminated due to him not being picked at all in an undisclosed scene of episode 4. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !40 Crew !BGM-v Crew |- |Kim Seung-min |Mac9 |- |Donutman |Mckdaddy |- |Layone |Veinifyl |- |Loxx Punkman |Bla$e Kid |- |Lil tachi |Seo Dong-hyun |- |MUSHVENOM |Ahn Byung-woong |- |Boo Hyun-seok |unofficialboyy |- |Bully |Untell |- |BRYN |EPTEND |- |Sway D |Young B |- |Slick O'Domar |Woodie Gochild |- |Siggy Feb |ZENE THE ZILLA |- |A-Chess |JJANGYOU |- |Young Blood X |CHOILB |- |O'day O$A |Chillin Homie |- |Owen Ovadoz |Kingchi Mane |- |Olltii |Punchnello |- |Yuja |Poy Muzeum |- |YunB |HunnyHanna |- |YUNHWAY |Heo Sung-hyun |- |KOR KASH |Dbo |- |TAKUWA |LO VOLF |- |Cox Billy |M1NU |- |DOGGYNOM |Naughty Mae |- |EK |OVDL |- |Leebido |X |- |YUNG SOG WAVE |YANU |- |} \\- Originally advanced to the next round but voluntarily left the show after his recent controversy (see controversy section).

When one of the crews has been flipped, he will select 1 contestant from that crew and that selected contestant will pick an opponent from the opposite crew to compete in the 1-on-1 crew rap battles. The paired contestants will choose a beat or song from the producer crews that they will perform in the producers crews' special stages. Unlike previous seasons, special guest judges will be joining the producer judges in determining the winner for this round: YDG (season 3 producer judge), Dynamic Duo (season 6 judges), Paloalto (season 4 and 7 judge), Nafla (season 7 champion), Rhythm Power (Hangzoo (season 4 contestant and season 6 champion), Geegooin (season 4 and 6 contestant) and Boi B (season 5 and 7 contestant), Basick (season 4 champion), TakeOne (season 1 contestant), Geeks' Lil Boi (season 4 contestant), Flowsik (season 5 contestant), pH-1 (season 7 contestant) and Crush. The winners of their respective match-ups will move on to the next round. If the match-up ends up in a tie of number of votes, a sudden death battle will be done. After the 1-on-1 battles, each crew would select 4 of their eliminated crew members to take part in the revival battle, and only 2 from each crew can progress to the next round. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" border=\"2\" |- ! colspan=\"3\" |1-on-1 battles |- !40 |vs. !BGM-v |- |style=\"background:aqua\"|A-Chess |vs. |style=\"background:lime\"|Veiniyfl |- |style=\"background:aqua\"|TAKUWA |vs. |style=\"background:red\"|Heo Sung-hyun |- |style=\"background:aqua\"|Olltii |vs. |style=\"background:lime\"|Untell |- |style=\"background:red\"|Slick O'Domar |vs. |style=\"background:aqua\"|Ahn Byung- woong |- |style=\"background:red\"|Sway D |vs. |style=\"background:aqua\"|ZENE THE ZILLA |- |style=\"background:red\"|Cox Billy (Later revealed as J'Kyun) |vs. |style=\"background:aqua\"|Mckdaddy |- |style=\"background:aqua\"|YUNHWAY |vs. |style=\"background:red\"|LO VOLF |- |style=\"background:red\"|Boo Hyun-seok |vs. |style=\"background:aqua\"|CHOILB (via Sudden Death) |- |style=\"background:red\"|KOR KASH |vs. |style=\"background:aqua\"|Woodie Gochild |- |style=\"background:aqua\"|YunB |vs. |style=\"background:red\"|Poy Muzeum |- |style=\"background:red\"|Leebido |vs. |style=\"background:aqua\"|OVDL |- |style=\"background:aqua\"|Donutman |vs. |style=\"background:red\"|Bla$e Kid |- |style=\"background:lime\"|Yuja |vs. |style=\"background:aqua\"|Seo Dong-hyun |- |style=\"background:red\"|Loxx Punkman |vs. |style=\"background:aqua\"|Dbo |- |style=\"background:red\"|Layone |vs. |style=\"background:aqua\"|JJANGYOU |- |style=\"background:aqua\"|MUSHVENOM |vs. |style=\"background:lime\"|Punchnello |- |style=\"background:lime\"|Lil tachi |vs. |style=\"background:aqua\"|EPTEND |- |style=\"background:lime\"|Kim Seung-min |vs. |style=\"background:aqua\"|YANU |- |style=\"background:lime\"|YUNG SOG WAVE |vs. |style=\"background:aqua\"|Young B |- |style=\"background:aqua\"|EK |vs. |style=\"background:red\"|Naughty Mae |- |style=\"background:aqua\"|Bully |vs. |style=\"background:red\"|X |- |style=\"background:aqua\"|M1NU |vs. |style=\"background:red\"|O'Day O$A |- |style=\"background:aqua\"|Owen Ovadoz |vs. |style=\"background:lime\"|Kingchi Mane |- |style=\"background:aqua\"|Young Blood X |vs. |style=\"background:red\"|unofficialboyy |- |style=\"background:aqua\"|BRYN |vs. |style=\"background:red\"|HunnyHanna |- |style=\"background:red\"|DOGGYNOM |vs. |style=\"background:aqua\"|Mac9 |- |style=\"background:red\"|Siggy Feb |vs. |style=\"background:aqua\"|Chillin Homie |- |} : Indicates the winning contestant. : Eliminated from the show. : Lost in the 1-on-1 round but chosen to participate in the Revival Round.

After the performances, the remaining 31 contestants (14 from 40 Crew, 17 from BGM-v Crew) will compete in the Producer Crew Battle. Before the Producer Crew Battle, both crews have to eliminate contestants until each crew has only 11 contestants remaining.

For the Producer Crew Battle, similar to last season, each group will take turns as they do freestyle/pre- rehearsed raps under certain beats. The winning crew will advance to the next round while the losing crew will have its producers choose 1 contestant to eliminate. In the case of a tie after two rounds, a third round will be held to determine the winning crew. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Crew !Producer Judge !Song(s) !Winning Producer Crew Performance |- |rowspan=\"4\"|40 Crew |Swings |\"Bulldozer\" |rowspan=\"8\"|40 Crew |- |Mad Clown |\"Lost Without You\", \"Stupid In Love\" (ft.

The producers from both crews play rock, paper, scissors to determine the crew that gets to choose their match-ups for the whole round. Before the battle, both producer crews will be outdoors for their crew bonding missions to win benefits for the battle, with guest host DinDin, and preparations for the battle. Each of the 100 members of the audience will vote for only 1 crew after each round. The losing crew will have its producers choose 1 contestant to eliminate.

With BGM-v Crew having 5 members left and 40 Crew having only 3 members left, 2 members from BGM-v Crew will battle against each other. The contestant will perform in a live audience either alone or with a special guest performer(s). Based on 2 rounds of audience voting (total in \u20a9), the winners of each matchup will advance to the next round. The final episode will consist of the semi-finals and the final round. It will be televised live in which the performers will perform alone or with their respective producers and/or with special guest performer(s). This year's final round marks the first time where two contestants from the same crew faced each other in this round. The contestant with the most number of combined votes from both the live audience and TV viewers will win this season. In addition, there will be special performances for both the semi-final and final rounds: the semi-final round will have the first ever Show Me The Money Teenage Cypher, and the finals will include special performances from other eliminated contestants from the show and/or special guest performers. ===Show Me The Challenge Tournament Open=== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !colspan=\"6\"|Show Me The Challenge: First Live Performances |- |# |40 Crew Rapper |vs. |# |BGM-v Crew Rapper |Total Live Audience Votes (in \u20a9) |- |3 |style=\"background:red\"|BRYN (ft.
