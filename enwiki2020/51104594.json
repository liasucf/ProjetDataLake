    "text": "Time for 2 is a 1962 album by Anita O'Day and Cal Tjader. ==Reception== Billboard magazine reviewed the album in their September 1, 1962 issue and wrote that \"Tjader kicks in with some strong instrumental choruses and his combo accompanies in high style whether playing straight or Latin time\". Richard S. Ginell reviewed the reissue of the album for Allmusic and wrote that \"O'Day sounds as if she is delighted with Tjader's polished Afro-Cuban grooves, gliding easily over the rhythms, toying with the tunes, transforming even a tune so locked into its trite time as \"Mr. Sandman\" into a stimulating excursion. Indeed, O'Day's freewheeling phrasing becomes downright sexy on \"That's Your Red Wagon\" and Dave Frishberg's delicious parody of a spoiled honeybunch, \"Peel Me a Grape.\"\" Ginell also praised producer Creed Taylor's \"...obsession with good engineering and tasteful applications of reverb\" which led to her voice sounding \"much fuller and more attractive in his productions than on her Norman Granz-produced albums\". == Track listing == # \"Thanks for the Memory\" (Ralph Rainger, Leo Robin) \u2013 2:45 # \"It Shouldn't Happen to a Dream\" (Duke Ellington, Don George, Johnny Hodges) \u2013 2:59 # \"Just in Time\" (Betty Comden, Adolph Green, Jule Styne) \u2013 2:47 # \"Under a Blanket of Blue\" (Jerry Livingston, Al J.
