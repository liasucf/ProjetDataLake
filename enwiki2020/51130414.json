The league competition was played amongst eight separate divisions, divided by FFA state and territory member federations. The divisions are ACT, NSW, Northern NSW, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia. The winners of each respective divisional league competed in a finals playoff tournament at season end, with Heidelberg United crowned as Champions, which gave them direct qualification for the 2018 FFA Cup Round of 32. ==League tables== ===ACT=== ====Finals==== ===NSW=== ====Finals==== ===Northern NSW=== ====Finals==== ===Queensland=== ====Finals==== ===South Australia=== ====Finals==== ===Tasmania=== ====Finals==== ===Victoria=== ====Finals==== ===Western Australia=== ====Finals==== ==Final Series== The winner of each league competition (top of the table) in the NPL competed in a single match knockout tournament to decide the National Premier Leagues Champion for 2017.
