In 2003, he ordered that the Euskaldunon Egunkaria newspaper be closed on grounds of accusations driven by a \"narrow and erroneous view according to which everything that has to do with the Basque language and with culture in that language is promoted and/or controlled by ETA\", as determined seven years after by a sentence of the Criminal Court of the Audiencia Nacional of Spain. ==Notes== Category:Living people Category:1958 births Category:Spanish judges ",
