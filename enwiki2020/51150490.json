    "text": "Kepler-84 is a Sun-like star 4700 light years from the Sun. Kepler-84 is a G-type star. The stellar radius measurement has a large uncertainty of 48% as in 2017, complicating the modelling of the star. The Kepler-84 star has two suspected stellar companions. Four red dwarfs are few arcseconds away and at least one is probably gravitationally bound to Kepler-84.. Another (which is a background star with a probability 0.5%) is an yellow star of mass 0.855 on projected separations of 0.18\u2033 or 0.26\u2033 (213.6 AU). ==Planetary system== Kepler-84 is orbited by five known planets, four small gas giants and a Super- Earth, discovered in 2014.openexoplanetcatalogue.com Kepler-84 To keep known planetary system stable, no additional giant planets can be located within 7.4 AU from the parent stars. ==References== 1589 Category:G-type main-sequence stars Category:Solar analogs Category:Planetary systems with five confirmed planets Category:Cygnus (constellation) J19530049+4029458 ",
