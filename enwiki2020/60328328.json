She worked with watercolor and oil paints, as well as producing lithographs. In 1938, she immigrated to Palestine. After resettling there, she served with the British Army and later settled in Haifa and married the painter Yehoshua Grossbard. In 1954, she studied at the atelier of Andr\u00e9 Lhote in Paris. She was a member of the Ein Hod artists' colony in Haifa and of the Artists and Sculptors Association in Israel. In 1966, \"Lines and Trees,\" a collection of her work, was published.
