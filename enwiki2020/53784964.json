She nicknamed herself the \"Melanin Goddess\" (alluding her dark black skin) to express pride in her appearance. ==Career== In 2016 she moved to New York City for college and was featured in a campaign for The Colored Girl Project, which led to her becoming popular on Instagram. After being part of this project, she went from 300 to 350,000 followers on Instagram in only days. In 2017 she appeared in an advertising campaign for French cosmetics brand Make Up For Ever. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1996 births Category:Senegalese female models Category:Living people Category:Senegalese expatriates in the United States ",
