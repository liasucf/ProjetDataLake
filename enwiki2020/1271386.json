    "text": "Sleeping With the Enemy is the second album of U.S. political rapper Paris. Released in 1992, it stimulated much controversy with the songs \"Bush Killa\" (a revenge fantasy about the assassination of then-President George H. W. Bush) and \"Coffee, Donuts & Death\" (a cop-killing tirade). It also featured a young DJ Shadow on production. Originally scheduled for a pre-presidential election release in 1992, the album was eventually released on Paris\u2019 own Scarface Records after Time Warner shareholders and media pressure prevented then-Warner Bros. Records subsidiary Tommy Boy Records from releasing the project. It was re-released in a limited release subtitled The Deluxe Edition; it was digitally enhanced, reworked, and contains alternate versions. The album sold over 480,000 == Track listing == # \"The Enema (Live At The White House)\" # \"Make Way for a Panther\" # \"Sleeping with the Enemy\" # \"House Niggas Bleed Too\" # \"Bush Killa\" # \"Coffee, Doughnuts, & Death\" # \"Thinka 'Bout It\" # \"Guerrillas in the Mist\" # \"The Days of Old\" # \"Long Hot Summer\" # \"Conspiracy of Silence\" feat.
