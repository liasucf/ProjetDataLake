    "text": "Minto is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Minto is located 38 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Campbelltown and is part of the Macarthur region. ==History== Minto was named in honour of the Earl of Minto, Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, who was Viceroy of India from 1807\u20131814. The name was originally given to the entire district stretching from just north of Appin up to what is now Denham Court.Minto History The area that constitutes the current suburb of Minto was originally home to the Tharawal people until the arrival of British settlers from the First Fleet. In 1811, Governor Lachlan Macquarie granted in the area to William Redfern, the colony's first surgeon. He in turn named it Campbellfield after Macquarie's wife Elizabeth whose maiden name was Campbell. Redfern used the property as a vineyard and sheep station. In 1810, Dr Robert Towson built his sandstock home, Varroville, in St Andrews Road, on land granted by Governor Macquarie. The house was subsequently owned by Charles Sturt and James Raymond, the first Postmaster General. In the 1820s, Colonel Parker built a Georgian bungalow called Epping Forest in Raby Road. A farm called Robin Hood Farm was built in Campbelltown Road circa 1830. These three properties are now listed on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/21 In 1874, a railway station was built in the area and named Campbellfield after the property but this led to confusion with nearby Campbelltown so in 1882, it was renamed Minto. Development of the area followed shortly after and by the 1950s it was a village of around 500 people. A large slice of land on the east side of Minto was sold to Housing Commission in 1969 to provide cheap housing. Shortly after a large industrial estate was also established in the area and Minto's transition from village to Sydney suburb was complete. == Heritage listings == Minto has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Lot 315 Ben Lomond Road: Stone Cottage, Minto == Transport == Minto railway station is serviced by the Airport & South Line on the Sydney Trains network.

Although it began as a boost to local business, it has more recently become dilapidated and untidy, and the management has taken no action to combat these problems. After being placed under pressure by A Current Affair and members of the community due to the rundown state of the mall, Minto Mall sold in late 2012. Since 2014, the former Minto Mall has fully reopened and refurbished as Minto Marketplace. It is populated by major retailers and franchises such as Woolworths, Kmart, Priceline, Lowes Menswear, Gloria Jeans, Michel's Patisserie, Donut King, Ocean Master, Millers and many more. ==References== ==External links== * [CC-By-SA] Category:Suburbs of Sydney Category:Rail yards in Australia Category:Populated places established in 1882 Category:1882 establishments in Australia Category:City of Campbelltown (New South Wales) ",
