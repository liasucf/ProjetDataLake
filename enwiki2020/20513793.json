Their debut release, \"Walking on a Dream\", appeared as a single on 30 August 2008 ahead of the album of same name on 3 October. Steele had assisted on tracks, \"With You Forever\" and \"Freedom\", for Pnau's self-titled album, which was issued in December 2007. As Empire of the Sun, the duo recorded material for Walking on a Dream, including the title track, at Soundworks Music Studio and Linear Recording in Sydney during various sessions throughout the latter part of that year. The track was co-written by Littlemore and Steele with Jonathan Sloan. Sloan also co-produced the album with the duo and Littlemore's bandmate, Peter Mayes of Pnau. Sam Littlemore (Nick's older brother) aka Sam La More remixed the track, which was made available as a free download on the album's official website until December 2008. The song uses an interpolation of Billy Ocean's \"Caribbean Queen\". Where Billy says \"And our hearts they beat as one\", Empire of the Sun's lyric is \"...When two people become one\". ==Chart performance== The song was in a Honda Civic commercial in the U.S. in 2016, more than seven years after its original release. This led the song to finally chart in the country, making it their first Alternative Songs hit there. On May 14, 2016, the re-released single reached number one on Billboard's Dance Club Songs chart, seven years after having peaked at number 18 in its first chart run.Dance Club Songs (May 14, 2016) from Billboard (May 3, 2016) ==Music video== Nick Littlemore raises a sphere to create a blue beam in the video for \"Walking on a Dream\".
