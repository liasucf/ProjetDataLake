    "text": "The Station Mall, located in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada, is the second largest shopping mall in Northern Ontario, trailing just behind the New Sudbury Centre in Greater Sudbury in area, while also lagging behind the Intercity Shopping Centre in Thunder Bay in number of stores. Station Mall has 97 stores and of retail space on one level. Built in 1973, the mall has since undergone two major expansions. Its major tenants include Galaxy Cinemas movie theatre complex. The mall is located on the waterfront in downtown Sault Ste. Marie, and is roughly five minutes away from the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge to the United States. The Sault Ste. Marie railway station is located in the mall's parking lot. ==History== Station Mall opened in October 1973 with 284,000 square feet of retail space and 70 tenants. It underwent two expansions in 16 years, in 1981 and 1989, adding more than 200,000 square feet of additional retail space. In 2000, the 52,000-square- foot Galaxy Entertainment Complex was opened on the waterfront side of the mall. The Complex includes a 12-screen, 2,400 seat movie theatre. The mall underwent a major renovation project, adding large format stores and revamping the interior. 2011 saw a number of smaller stores combined for a new Sport Chek location. The small former Zellers location reopened in 2012 as a smaller Walmart Supercentre. On November 25, 2013, Galaxy Cinemas downsized from 12 screens to 7 screens in order to make room for H&M.; In October 2017, Sears Canada permanently closed their Station Mall store, leaving Coles, Lakeshore Drug Mart, Laura Secord and the Vacation Station as the only remaining original tenants of the mall. In May 2019, Walmart announced that its store in the mall would close in June of that year. This left the mall without any major anchor stores. ==Anchor tenants== *Galaxy Cinema (32,000 sq ft) *Sport Chek (22,000 sq ft) *H&M; (18,000 sq ft) *Dollarama (11,000 sq ft) ==Former tenants== *A&A; Records *Bentley *Bulk Barn * Dalmys Canada Ltd. * DavidsTea (Tea store) * Dominion (supermarket) * Foot Locker * Freshly Squeezed * Garage (clothing retailer) * HMV Canada * Joey's Twisted Italian Grill & Pub * Kelly's Grocery *Leisure World *Regis Salon * San Francisco (gifts) * Sam the Record Man * Sears Canada * Swiss Chalet * Target Canada (planned but fell through, eventually opening as Walmart) * Teavana (Tea Store) * Walmart * Zellers == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Sault Ste.
