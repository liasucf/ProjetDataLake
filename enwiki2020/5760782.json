    "text": "\"Let 'Em In\" is a song by Wings from their 1976 album Wings at the Speed of Sound. It was written and sung by Paul McCartney and reached the top 3 in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. It was a No. 2 hit in the UK; in the U.S. it was a No. 3 pop hit and No. 1 easy listening hit. In Canada, the song was No. 3 for three weeks on the pop chart and No. 1 for three weeks on the MOR chart of RPM magazine. The single was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over one million copies. It can also be found on McCartney's 1987 compilation album, All the Best! A demo of the song, featuring Denny Laine on lead vocal, was included as a bonus track on the Archive Collection reissue of Wings at the Speed of Sound. == Content == The song starts with the sound of a vibraphone, chiming the first eight notes from the Westminster Quarters, before the rhythm begins. The lyric namechecks several famous people, between friends and relatives of McCartney who, without a justified reason, knock on the door or ring the bell of his house and he exclaims \"Let 'Em In\". Famous people as well as McCartney's paternal aunt Gin and his brother Michael, and Linda McCartney's brother John. Phil and Don Everly (known as the Everly Brothers) are named, along with Martin Luther. An uncle Ernie is also named; this being the character Ringo Starr sang in the London Symphony Orchestra's recording of the Who's rock opera, Tommy. \"Let 'Em In\" is also notable for the false fade out, which, however, becomes loud for the last two notes of the song. The song makes use of the piano, drums, brass, including a trombone solo, and wind instruments, featuring flutes, plus backup vocals from Linda and other members of Wings. ==Personnel== *Paul McCartney \u2013 vocals, piano, backing vocals *Jimmy McCulloch \u2013 bass *Denny Laine \u2013 backing vocals, military drums *Joe English \u2013 drums *Linda McCartney \u2013 backing vocals *Howie Casey, Thaddeus Richard, Steve Howard, Tony Dorsey \u2013 flutes, horns All personnel according to The Paul McCartney Project, a website consisting of songs with involvement by Paul. ==Release== The song was released worldwide as a 7\" single, except in France where it was released as 12\" single (the first-ever McCartney 12\") with both sides labelled \"Special Disco Mix\".

This version reached No. 91 on the US, Billboard Soul chart, and No. 26 on the UK charts. * \"Guess Who's Knockin'\", a song written by Prince and released by The New Power Generation on initial pressings of the Goldnigga album, references \"Let 'Em In\" without credit. Probably to avoid any legal difficulties the song was removed from subsequent pressings. ==See also== *List of number-one adult contemporary singles of 1976 (U.S.) ==References== ==External links== * Category:1976 songs Category:1976 singles Category:Billboard Adult Contemporary number-one singles Category:RPM Adult Contemporary number-one singles Category:Capitol Records singles Category:Music published by MPL Music Publishing Category:Paul McCartney songs Category:Songs written by Linda McCartney Category:Songs written by Paul McCartney Category:Song recordings produced by Paul McCartney Category:Billy Paul songs Category:Wings (band) songs ",
