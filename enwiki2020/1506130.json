    "text": "Eochu (or Eochaid), son of Ailill Finn, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland. He succeeded to the throne after his father was killed by Airgetmar and his ally Dui Ladrach. According to the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn, he was himself killed by Airgetmar and Dui.R. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, p. 261 Geoffrey Keating says he ruled for seven years, resisted Airgetmar and made peace with Dui, who killed him treacherously at a meeting, allowing Airgetmar to take the kingship.Geoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn 1.27 The Lebor Gab\u00e1la synchronises his reign with that of Artaxerxes II of Persia (404\u2013358 BC). The chronology of Keating's Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn dates his reign to 577\u2013570 BC, that of the Annals of the Four Masters to 785\u2013778 BC.Annals of the Four Masters M4415-4422 ==References== Category:Legendary High Kings of Ireland ",
