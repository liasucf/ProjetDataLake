Her parents separated when she was six months old, and thus, Jessica was raised by her single mother near Bad Nauheim, in the Wetteraukreis district of Hesse. After her parents' divorce, Wahls had little contact with her father, and her mother worked as a personal assistant to support the family. In 1999, Gabriele married Wahls' Barbadian stepfather Tosh. In 2000, Jessica broke off her training as a travel management assistant to join the girl group No Angels, the result of a German version of the international television show Popstars. Two successful years later, Jess became pregnant by boyfriend, choreographer and background dancer Sascha Dickreuter, and consequently she had to leave the band for her baby girl by the name of Cheyenne Jessica. In 2003, Wahls returned to the music business as a solo artist. Since then she has released four moderately successful singles in English and in German. Wahls has also worked as a host for several TV shows, most noticeably on the German quiz channel 9Live. Furthermore she can be seen as the spokeswomen for a number of local advertising campaigns. In January 2007, the No Angels's reunion was announced and Wahls went back to her roots to release their comeback single Goodbye to Yesterday and a new album. ==Discography== Wahls performing alongside Sandy M\u00f6lling in 2008 ===Singles=== ;As lead artist {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |+ List of singles, with selected chart positions and certifications ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"|GER ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"|AUT ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"|SWI |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Ten Steps Back\" | rowspan=\"1\"| 2003 | 41 || 54 || \u2014 |rowspan=\"4\"| non-album release |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Don't Get Me Started\" | rowspan=\"1\"| 2004 | 51 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Du bist wie ich\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2005 | 78 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Bedingungslos\" | 92 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- |} ;As featured artist {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"|GER ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"|AUT ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"|SWI |- |align=\"left\"| \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\" (with TV All Stars) | 2003 | 3 | 28 | 32 |align=\"left\"| Ultimate Christmas Album |- |} ==References== ==External links== * JessicaWahls.tv Official website Wahls, Jesscia Category:Living people Category:German female singers Category:English-language singers from Germany Category:German people of African-American descent Category:Musicians from Frankfurt Category:No Angels members Category:Television people from Frankfurt ",
