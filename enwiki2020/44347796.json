The objective behind this festival is not just to expand the children\u2019s film market or encourage makers to come forward but also to nurture talent from a very young age. If we can showcase the right content and create a conducive environment for children to pursue film making or allied creative careerpaths, I \u2018m sure we will get great talent emerging out of our country. Films, I believe is the most powerful medium and if used effectively we can entertain while addressing various pressing issues\u201d. == Workshop == NCFF will present itself as a carnival to woo young audiences and also lend itself as a learning platform through various workshops such as dance, music, magic act, animation and a special focused workshop on Chaplin based on the film \u201cBoot Cake\u201d.
