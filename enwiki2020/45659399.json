His principal activities now focus on investments associated with the Lowy family\u2019s private company, Lowy Family Group, as well as a number of philanthropic and community roles including as Chairman of the World Board of Trustees of Keren Heysod- United Israel Appeal and President of the Hakoah Club. During his career Lowy has served on numerous corporate and philanthropic boards including Westfield Corporation, Australian shopping centre company Scentre Group, as Chairman of Football Federation Australia and President of the board of Trustees of the Art Gallery of New South Wales. He is a former Chairman of the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute and is currently a director of foreign policy think tank, the Lowy Institute, as well as the Lowy Foundation and Lowy Medical Research Institute. Lowy is the third and youngest son of Frank Lowy, a co- founder of Westfield. The Lowy family is one of the most prominent business families in Australia with a reported net worth in excess of $8 billion in 2016. In late 2014, Steven Lowy\u2019s life was documented in a feature article in The AFR Magazine, \"The Son Rises: Steven Lowy ascends at Westfield\". In 2010 Lowy was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for service to business, philanthropy, the arts and medical research. ==Early life and education== Lowy was born to a Modern Orthodox Jewish family, in Sydney, the youngest son of Shirley and Frank Lowy, and educated at Sydney Grammar School and the University of New South Wales where he graduated as a Bachelor of Commerce (Honours). He was awarded the University Prize for his honours thesis and later co-authored a paper with Professor Mark Hirst published in the academic journal Accounting, Organizations and Society. He joined Westfield Holdings in 1987, was appointed a Director of Westfield Holdings in 1989 and a Managing Director in 1997. He has also been a Director of Westfield Management Limited, the manager of Australia\u2019s then leading retail property trust, Westfield Trust since 1988. Prior to joining Westfield Holdings in 1987 he worked in investment banking at First Boston Corporation in the US for two years. ==Westfield== Westfield was listed on the Sydney Stock Exchange in 1960 by Lowy\u2019s father, Frank and his partner John Saunders. The pair were newly arrived immigrants to Australia and had opened a small delicatessen shop in the western suburbs of Sydney. Their venture was a success and their ambition led to the expansion of their business to include the development of residential housing and larger shopping centres. The first Westfield centre was built in Blacktown in Sydney\u2019s western suburbs in 1959. This was shortly followed by a new centre in Hornsby in Sydney\u2019s north in 1961. The company flourished and expanded to other Australian cities and then the United States in the mid-1970s and to New Zealand in 1997 and the United Kingdom in 2000. At this point, Westfield had 86 centres in its global portfolio, with some 13,200 retailers and $24.1 billion in assets. In 2004, the various Westfield entities were merged to create Westfield Group to provide the scale and financial heft required to continue international expansion. This led to the creation of two landmark shopping centres in London (Westfield London at Shepherd\u2019s Bush in 2008) and Westfield Stratford City (on the site of the 2012 London Olympics) in 2011. In 2014 Westfield Group underwent another major corporate restructure in which its Australian and New Zealand operations merged with Westfield Retail Trust to create a new company, Scentre Group. At the same time, another new, separate company, Westfield Corporation, was created to own and manage the former Westfield Group\u2019s shopping centres in the US and UK. More recently, Westfield Corporation opened Westfield World Trade Center in New York on 16 August 2016. They have also advanced plans to build its first shopping centre in Europe, in Milan Italy. A feature of the company during this period was a marked shift towards high quality \"iconic\" or flagship malls showcasing the world\u2019s best retailers and luxury brands. Five-star service and upscale restaurants and entertainment were a critical element in this shift, as was its adoption of a more aggressive \"innovation\" strategy to use digital technology \"to better connect the retailer with the shopper\". Since the establishment of Westfield Labs based in San Francisco in 2012, several digital initiatives were piloted and implemented in several Westfield shopping centres around the world. Westfield Labs has been recognised by Fast Company magazine as one of the 50 most innovative companies in the world, and as one of the Top 10 retail companies for \"giving the mall a high-tech makeover\". Following the sale of Westfield Corporation to Unibail Rodamco in 2018 Westfield\u2019s former retail digital business was transferred to a new and separate entity OneMarket which was chaired by Steven Lowy AM. OneMarket was wound up in December 2019. ==Philanthropy and community activity== Lowy is currently chairman of the World Board of Trustees of Keren Heysod-United Israel Appeal and President of Hakoah Club Sydney. He is a former President of the board of Trustees of the Art Gallery of New South Wales (2006 \u2013 2013), Chairman of the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute (2008-2013), and is a director of the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based foreign policy think tank, and the Lowy Medical Research Institute, a private medical organisation. Steven was a member of the Prime Minister\u2019s Business-Government Advisory Group on National Security and has been the Presiding Officer of the NSW Police Force associate degree in Policing Practice Board of Management. Together with his father, Frank, and two brothers, David and Peter, he plays a key role in decisions about the Lowy family\u2019s philanthropic activities. In recent years, the family has supported the establishment of the Lowy Cancer Centre at the University of NSW, a new building (the Lowy Packer Building) to house the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute and the St Vincent's Centre for Applied Medical Research. The building was opened by Princess Mary of Denmark on 3 September 2008. In 2013 Frank Lowy revealed to a Philanthropy Australia audience that his family had donated more than $350 million to various causes during the previous decade. ==Football== Lowy is a passionate soccer fan and played the game competitively throughout his youth. He continued to compete in masters tournaments until injury ended his playing career in his early \u201850s. On 17 November 2015 he was elected as a director of Football Federation Australia (FFA) by nine state football federations and a representative of the 10 Hyundai A-League clubs which form Australia's national football competition. He was then elected Chairman by his fellow directors. under his leadership. FFA achieved its highest income and sponsorship on record and the Socceroos qualified for their fourth consecutive World Cup (one of only 12 teams to do so) and together with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, launched Australia's bid to host the 2023 Women's World Cup. Lowy's tenure as chairman ended in November 2018. ==Personal life== Lowy married Judy Levin in 1986. They have four children. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1962 births Category:Australian business executives Category:Australian Orthodox Jews Category:Australian people of Hungarian-Jewish descent Category:Australian people of Slovak-Jewish descent Category:Businesspeople from Sydney Category:Members of the Order of Australia ",
