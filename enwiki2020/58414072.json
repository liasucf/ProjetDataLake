During the year, a total of 151 tropical cyclones had formed this year to date. 102 tropical cyclones were named by either a Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) or a Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC). With 151 tropical cyclones, 2018 was the most active year on record. The most active basin in the year was the Western Pacific, which documented 28 named systems, while the Eastern Pacific, despite only amounting to 23 named systems, including an unnamed subtropical cyclone, was its basin's hyperactive and produced the highest Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), surpassing the previous record from 1992. Conversely, both the North Atlantic hurricane and North Indian Ocean cyclone seasons experienced the average number of cyclones reaching tropical storm intensity in recorded history, numbering 15 and 7, respectively. Activity across the southern hemisphere's three basins\u2014South-West Indian, Australian, and South Pacific\u2014was spread evenly, with each region recording seven named storms apiece. The costliest tropical cyclone of the year was Hurricane Michael in the Atlantic which struck Florida in October causing US$25.1 billion in damage. The deadliest tropical cyclone of the year was Tropical Storm Son-Tinh in the West Pacific which killed 170 people in Vietnam and Laos. ==Global atmospheric and hydrological conditions== ===Northern Atlantic Ocean=== In the North Atlantic Ocean, atmospheric and hydrological conditions were generally unfavorable for tropical cyclogenesis. In the tropical Atlantic, sea surface temperatures were cooler than average, characteristic of a negative phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Additionally, high quantities of Saharan dust along with stronger than average upper-level wind shear over the tropical Atlantic created an unfavorable atmospheric environment. Despite the unfavorable conditions present, activity in the tropical Atlantic was plentiful, with Hurricanes Beryl, Florence, Helene, Isaac, and Michael developing in the region. On the contrary, conditions in the subtropical Atlantic were more conducive to tropical cyclone formation, with sea surface temperatures being warmer than average. Six tropical cyclones: Beryl, Chris, Debby, Ernesto, Joyce and Leslie,https://www.nhc.noaa.gov developed or reformed in the subtropical Atlantic. ===Other areas=== ==Summary== ImageSize = width:1600

As the year opened a tropical depression that was being monitored by the JMA within the Western Pacific, while a weak tropical low existed within the Australian region to the south of Sumatra. During that day, the depression entered PAGASA's self- defined area of responsibility, where it was assigned the name Agaton.
