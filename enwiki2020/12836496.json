    "text": "\"Energy\" was the Slovenian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2001, sung by Nu\u0161a Derenda in English. Derenda appeared dressed in black and yellow leather. She was accompanied by two pianists dressed in red and black, who faced each other on stage. At the climax of the song, two male dancers came onto the stage and lifted Nusa Derenda into the air. During the final chorus, the men danced around the stage behind her. The song performed 17th on the night, following the United Kingdom's Lindsay Dracass with \"No Dream Impossible\" and preceding Poland's PIASEK with \"2 Long\". At the close of voting, it had received 70 points, placing seventh in a field of 23. It was succeeded as Slovene representative at the 2002 contest by Sestre with \"Samo ljubezen\". A Slovene version of the song was performed by Derenda at EMA, the Slovene selection for Eurovision, titled \"Ne, ni res\" (\"No, it's not true\"). *Lyrics at the Diggiloo Thrush {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\" |- !
