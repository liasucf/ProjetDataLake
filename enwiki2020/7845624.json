    "text": "Spectrum is the official publication of Adventist Forums and a non-official publication of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, published four times a year. It was established \"to encourage Seventh-day Adventist participation in the discussion of contemporary issues from a Christian viewpoint, to look without prejudice at all sides of a subject, to evaluate the merits of diverse views, and to foster intellectual and cultural growth.\" It presents a theological point of view which tends to be from the liberal progressive Adventist viewpoint. == History == Spectrum was founded in 1969. Molleurus Couperus, a physician in Loma Linda, California, was appointed the first editor. The magazine published the transcripts of some discussions from the 1919 Bible Conference in the 1970s. Editor Roy Branson later reflected that \"was the single most important issue\" of the journal.Cited in Michael W. Campbell, \"The 1919 Bible Conference and Its Significance for Seventh-day Adventist History and Theology\". PhD dissertation, Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary, Andrews University, 2008, p203 In 1998, Spectrum's offices moved from Takoma Park, Maryland, to Roseville, California. The organization also maintains an active website focused primarily on original news reporting. === Editors === * 1969\u20131975 Molleurus Couperushttp://www.andrews.edu/library/car/collection/C/Couperus,%20Molleurus%20Collection.pdf * 1975\u20131978 Roy Branson and Charles Scriven * 1978\u20131998 Roy Branson * 1998 \u2013 present, Bonnie Dwyer See also the \"Meeting the Team\" series of interviews, c. 2009.For instance Jared Wright\", and Jonathan Pichot, interviewed by Rachel Davies === Internet presence === Alisa Williams serves as managing editor of the Spectrum website.
