    "text": "The Way of Curve is a compilation album by Curve. The album consists of two discs: the first is basically a greatest hits disc, containing many of Curve's most famous and successful songs; the second contains rare tracks, including one ('In Disguise') that had never been released. The band invited fans to contribute their personal lists of tracks that should appear on the first disc and this was used to help decide the final listing. Those who contributed are name checked on the album sleeve. All tracks were remastered for the release, though some of the tracks (such as \"Die Like A Dog\") had errors. Only 10,000 copies of the album were made and it is now out-of-print, though it can be partially downloaded from iTunes or bought and fully downloaded on the band's official Bandcamp. As Curve disbanded shortly after the album's release, The Way of Curve effectively became their career retrospective.
