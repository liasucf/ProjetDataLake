It was last seen around 1550. It was endemic to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic. It was most likely flightless.Storrs L. Olson. (1975).

The first analysis of this species was given in 1963 by the British zoologist Philip Ashmole, who discovered, in the Dry Gut sediments east of Saint Helena, a left humerus which differed significantly from that of other Upupidae. The incomplete skeleton, which was found in 1975 by the palaeontologist Storrs L. Olson, consists of both coracoids and the left femur. ==References== Category:Birds of Saint Helena Island Category:Extinct flightless birds Category:Extinct birds of Atlantic islands Category:Bird extinctions since 1500 Saint Helena hoopoe Saint Helena hoopoe ",
