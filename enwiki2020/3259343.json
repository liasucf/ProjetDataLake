They are often used in guitar amplification and include versions of the popular 12AX7, EL84, EL34, and 6L6. Many of the vacuum-tube amplifiers in modern production are factory-fitted with Sovtek valves.Serinus, Jason Victor. Tube Supplies Under Siege in Stereophile, May 20, 2006. Originally, Sovtek guitar amplifier valves were claimed to have been descendants of earlier wartime Russian-made components and carried blast proof capabilities. This, however, was later dispelled as urban myth, attributed to a sales person who promoted early product at music industry trade shows worldwide. In the 1990s, Sovtek also manufactured tube amplifiers at factories in Saint Petersburg, Saratov, and Novosibirsk.http://www.kramerforum.com/george/amps.html Several models were offered for guitar and bass. Sovtek brand speaker cabinets fitted with US-made Eminence speakers were also offered. At the same time, Sovtek manufactured variants of several effects pedals already manufactured in New York City, USA by Electro-Harmonix, another company owned by Mike Matthews. Sovtek released versions of the Electro-Harmonix Big Muff and Small Stone pedals. Those pedals, along with the Bass Balls pedal, were later manufactured in both the US and Russia, under the Electro-Harmonix name; manufacturing in Russia was later discontinued. Sovtek was used only as a brand name for vacuum tubes distributed by the New Sensor Corporation. == References == == External links == * Sovtek catalog Category:Vacuum tubes Category:Guitar amplification tubes ",
