It opened to the public on June 4, 2016 as the first Infinity Coaster in the United States. ==History== The Monster was announced on Adventureland's Facebook page on July 8, 2015. It replaced the River Rapids Log Ride, a log flume which had to be removed due to its constant maintenance and the lack of extra parts due to the fact that the manufacturer only made two log flume attractions. The park was looking for a suitable replacement for the ride. ==Ride experience== The ride, located in the center of the park, can be distinguished by its bright green track. The Monster features a vertical lift hill and a first drop at a 101 degree angle. At the bottom of the hill the riders reach a top speed of . The next element is a large overbanked turn where riders are redirected into a hill and then navigate the twisted drop that goes directly into a Finnish loop, after which riders go into a dive loop that will take riders into an air time hill then an Immelmann loop. The car then goes into its last curve, another dive loop, and its final inversion, a corkscrew. == Characteristics == The ride in total has of track, five inversions and takes roughly 2 minutes to complete. It is the park's newest coaster in nearly twenty years and cost $9 million.
