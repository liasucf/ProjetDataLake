    "text": "\"Nestor's cup\" from Mycenae The Cup of Nestor or dove cup is a gold goblet discovered in 1876 by Heinrich Schliemann in Shaft IV of Grave Circle A, Mycenae. The cup has two handles, each decorated with a golden bird, which Schliemann observed was reminiscent of the cup of Nestor described in the Iliad. The birds have since been identified by Spiros Marinatos as falcons, rather than the doves which are on the Iliadic cup. J.T. Hooker suggests that the cup is an adaptation of a Cretan design made by a craftsman on the Greek mainland. ==References== ==Works cited== * * * Category:Archaeological artifacts Category:Iron Age Greek art Category:Mycenaean Greece Category:Mycenae Category:Mycenaean art Category:National Archaeological Museum, Athens Category:Ancient Messenia Category:Individual ancient Greek vases Category:Archaeological discoveries in Greece Category:Ancient Greek metalwork Category:Gold objects ",
