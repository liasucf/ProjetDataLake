His brother Alberico married Ippolita Borromeo, sister of Carlo Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan. In 1584 Belgioioso went to the Low Countries to join the Army of Flanders with the express purpose of fighting against the enemies of the Catholic Faith. He briefly served Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, but then returned to Flanders. In 1598 he was appointed commissioner general of cavalry, and in 1601 he was named a councillor of war by Archduke Albert.Nicola Raponi, Barbiano di Belgioioso, Giovan Giacomo, in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani vol. 6 (1964) In 1597 he married a Flemish lady, Maria de Sensielles, who died without issue in 1602. In 1603 he remarried, to Anna Pottiers. Together they had a daughter, Maria, who in 1625 entered the Carmelite convent in Valenciennes. In 1603 Rudolf II employed Belgioioso as captain general of imperial troops in Hungary. He was so shaken by the death of his brother Francesco in 1605 (killed in a quarrel with another imperial commander, Hermann Christof von Russwurm) that he eventually resolved to retire from active service. Belgioioso spent his final years at Chokier Castle, near Li\u00e8ge. He died on 18 October 1626 and was buried in the Carmelite church in Li\u00e8ge. ==References== Category:1626 deaths Category:1565 births Category:Military personnel of the Eighty Years' War Category:People of the Long Turkish War ",
