    "text": "Pascal Arimont (born 25 September 1974) is a Belgian Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Christian Social Party, which sits in the EPP Group, as the single MEP from the German-speaking electoral college of Belgium. Arimont was born in Malmedy and grew up in Born (municipality of Amel) in the German-speaking Community of Belgium. From 1998 to 2002, Arimont was parliamentary assistant to MEP Mathieu Grosch. In 2014, Grosch, who was the single German-speaking MEP since 1994, decided not to stand for re-election, and Arimont was the CSP's candidate in the 2014 European Parliament elections. In the European Parliament, he is member of the Committee on Regional Development (REGI), of the delegation for relations with the countries of Central America and of the delegation to the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly. From 2006 until 2009, he was provincial councillor of Li\u00e8ge (and thus advisory member of the Parliament of the German-speaking Community). From 2009 until 2014 he was (full) member of that Parliament, where he was parliamentary group leader for the CSP. ==External links== * Personal website ==References== Category:1974 births Category:Christlich Soziale Partei (Belgium) MEPs Category:German-speaking Community of Belgium Category:Living people Category:MEPs for Belgium 2014\u20132019 Category:MEPs for Belgium 2019\u20132024 Category:People from Malmedy ",
