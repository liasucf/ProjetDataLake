The company released Mirantis Cloud Platform, which combines OpenStack with Kubernetes and follows a build-operate-transfer delivery model in April 2017. Mirantis Cloud Platform utilizes a continuous integration / continuous delivery toolchain, known as DriveTrain, to perform continuous incremental updates and eliminate the need for major upgrades of the platform. Mirantis announced Mirantis Cloud Platform Containers-as-a-Service, which enables users to provision Kubernetes clusters across multiple clouds on private infrastructure and/or public clouds including Amazon Web Services, in September 2017. With the addition of Containers-as-a-Service, Mirantis Cloud Platform supports hybrid clouds, with DriveTrain providing \u201cconsistent tooling for managing the lifecycle of OpenStack, Kubernetes on-premises and on AWS.\" As Mirantis continues to shift from an exclusive OpenStack focus to the continuous integration and continuous delivery of Kubernetes and other combinations of open source cloud software, this tooling forms the basis of the company's vision of a \u201ccloud-native continuous delivery\u201d platform for multi-cloud solutions. Mirantis launched Mirantis Application Platform, a continuous delivery platform for Kubernetes, in April 2018. Mirantis' edge computing platform, launched in October 2018, is based on Kubernetes and targeted towards telecommunications providers. In May 2019, the company announced its \"Bring Your Own Distro\" initiative, which offers enterprise support for multiple Kubernetes distributions, targeting organizations that have already deployed Kubernetes in production, including many who have been \"extending Kubernetes in a way that makes it challenging for IT operations teams to support.\" In November 2019, the company acquired the Docker Enterprise business, known for kick-starting the software container movement, to support Mirantis' vision of providing a \"cloud native stack, powered by Kubernetes, delivered as a service.\" In February 2020, Mirantis announced that it brought onboard a team of Kubernetes experts from Kontena, a Finnish company that developed the Pharos distribution of Kubernetes. In September 2020, Mirantis announced the release of Docker Enterprise Container Cloud, which provides multi-cloud and multi-cluster management capabilities across public and private clouds. ===OpenStack, Kubernetes and other community involvement=== Mirantis founders, Alex Freedland (CEO) and Boris Renski (CMO) have served on the OpenStack Foundation Board\"OpenStack: Board of Directors\" and Boris Renski was most recently re-elected in January 2018.\"OpenStack: 2016 Board Election\" Mirantis has been a major contributor of code to OpenStack, ranking as the #3 contributor of all time by both commits and lines of code.
