    "text": "The \"Himno Nacional de El Salvador\" () is the national anthem of El Salvador. == History == Abridged version played before a soccer game at RFK Stadium in 2011 MIDI version Abridged sub-90 second version featuring only the chorus and first verse for occasions requiring brevity, such as soccer games. The lyrics were written by General Juan Jos\u00e9 Ca\u00f1as in 1856, with music composed by the Italian Juan Aberle in 1879. It was adopted on September 15, 1879, and officially approved by the regime on December 11, 1953. Although there are three verses with the chorus interspersed throughout, only a single rendition of the chorus and first verse are commonly sung at many events, as a full performance can take more than four minutes to complete. The composition has been likened to \"William Tell Overture\" by critics. == Regulation == All radio and television stations must air the national anthem in accordance to the law and should be played during \"Startup\" and \"Closedown\" of every stations. == Lyrics == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Spanish lyrics !English translation |- |CORO : \ud834\udd06 Saludemos la patria orgullosos :de hijos suyos podernos llamar :y juremos la vida animosos, :sin descanso a su bien consagrar. \ud834\udd07 : \ud834\udd06 Consagrar, consagrar. \ud834\udd07 PRIMERA ESTROFA :De la paz en la dicha suprema, :Siempre noble so\u00f1\u00f3 El Salvador; :Fue obtenerla su eterno problema, :Conservarla es su gloria mayor. :Y con fe inquebrantable el camino :Del progreso se afana en seguir :Por llenar su grandioso destino, :Conquistarse un feliz porvenir. :Le protege una f\u00e9rrea barrera :Contra el choque de ruin deslealtad, :Desde el d\u00eda que en su alta bandera :Con su sangre escribi\u00f3: \u00a1LIBERTAD! : \ud834\udd06 Escribi\u00f3: \u00a1LIBERTAD! \ud834\udd07 CORO SEGUNDA ESTROFA :Libertad es su dogma, es su gu\u00eda :Que mil veces logr\u00f3 defender; :Y otras tantas, de audaz tiran\u00eda :Rechazar el odioso poder. :Dolorosa y sangrienta es su historia, :Pero excelsa y brillante a la vez; :Manantial de leg\u00edtima gloria, :Gran lecci\u00f3n de espartana altivez. :No desmaya en su innata bravura, :En cada hombre hay un h\u00e9roe inmortal :Que sabr\u00e1 mantenerse a la altura :De su antiguo valor proverbial. : \ud834\udd06 Valor proverbial. \ud834\udd07 CORO TERCERA ESTROFA :Todos son abnegados, y fieles :Al prestigio del b\u00e9lico ardor :Con que siempre segaron laureles :De la patria salvando el honor. :Respetar los derechos extra\u00f1os :Y apoyarse en la recta raz\u00f3n :Es para ella, sin torpes ama\u00f1os :Su invariable, m\u00e1s firme ambici\u00f3n. :Y en seguir esta l\u00ednea se aferra :Dedicando su esfuerzo tenaz, :En hacer cruda guerra a la guerra: :Su ventura se encuentra en la paz. : \ud834\udd06 Se encuentra en la paz. \ud834\udd07 CORO |CHORUS : \ud834\udd06 Let us salute the Fatherland, :Proud to be called its children, :And let us spiritedly swear our lives :To consecrate its good without rest! \ud834\udd07 : \ud834\udd06 Consecrate, consecrate! \ud834\udd07 FIRST VERSE :Of the peace in the supreme happiness :Ever noble El Salvador dreamed :To achieve this has been Her eternal proposition, :To keep it, Her greatest glory. :And with unwavering faith, the path of progress :She strives to follow, to follow :To fulfil Her greatest destiny :And conquer a happy future. :A stern barrier protects Her :Against the clash of vile disloyalty, :Ever since the day when Her soaring Flag, :Wrote \"LIBERTY!\" with Its blood. : \ud834\udd06 Wrote: LIBERTY! \ud834\udd07 CHORUS SECOND VERSE :Freedom is Her dogma and Her guide; :A thousand times She has managed to defend it, :And as many times She repelled :The hateful power of atrocious tyranny. :bloody and sad her story is, :Yet at the same time sublime and brilliant, :A source of legitimate glory :And a great lesson in spartan pride. :Her innate bravery does not waver: :In every man there is an immortal hero :Who will know how to keep himself up to :The proverbial value of old. : \ud834\udd06 Proverbial value. \ud834\udd07 CHORUS THIRD VERSE :All are devoted and faithful :To the tradition of warlike bravery :With which they have always reaped fame :By saving the Motherland's honour. :To respect the rights of others :And base Her actions on right and justice :Is for Her, without infamous trickery, :The constant and most firm ambition. :And in following this line She persists, :Dedicating her tenacious efforts :In waging hard war to war; :Her fortune is found in peace. : \ud834\udd06 Is found in peace. \ud834\udd07 CHORUS |} == References == == External links == * Television sign off by TCS El Salvador Category:Spanish- language songs Category:National symbols of El Salvador Category:Salvadoran songs Category:National anthems Category:National anthem compositions in D major Category:National anthem compositions in A major ",
