He made one appearance for the club, deputising for the absent William Longair in the 1\u20131 draw with Sheffield United at Turf Moor on 16 January 1897.Simpson (2007), p. 65 After failing to break into the first team, Almond joined Southern League club Swindon Town later the same month. He made his debut for Swindon in the 1\u20131 draw with Gravesend United on 30 January, and went on to play seven more matches during the remainder of the season.
