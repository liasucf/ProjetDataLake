In 1959, the Fund moved from New York City to Santa Barbara, California, and changed its name to the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions (CSDI). ==Background== With the growth of McCarthyism and the Second Red Scare, the subject of communism in America began to loom large in the public consciousness. ==History== In 1951, Robert M. Hutchins became the president of the Fund for the Republic, a non-profit organization whose basic objectives were to research and analyze civil liberties and civil rights. In 1954, Wilbur Hugh Ferry became Fund vice president, responsible for administration and public relations, and moved with the Fund to Santa Barbara 1959. In August 1953, Clifford P. Case resigned from the House to become president of the Ford Foundation's Fund for the Republic. He served in that position until March 1954. Walter Millis, former editorial and staff writer for the New York Herald Tribune (1924\u20131954), became a staff member of the Fund for the Republic (1954\u20131968). Bethuel M. Webster served as legal counsel to the Fund and represented the Fund in hearings before the notorious Un-American Activities Committee of the House of Representatives (HUAC). During this period he also defended William Remington, an economist and alleged Communist accused of espionage. Political scientist Clinton Rossiter of Cornell University directed the Fund for the Republic, which aimed to publish a full- scale history of American communism. It engaged David A. Shannon of the University of Wisconsin to write the history of the Communist Party USA during the post-war period. In 1952, it engaged Theodore Draper to write a monograph on the party's early years. Draper had already been thinking of writing a \"traditional\" history of the Party, based upon documentary sources and meeting scholarly standards. In 1954, Millis became the director of the Fund's study of demilitarization. Robert W. Iversen wrote a book for the fund called Communism and the Schools, published in 1959. Other fellows and grant recipients include Rev. Glenn E. Smiley et al. for Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story (1957),Aydin, Andrew. \"The comic book that changed the world: Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story's vital role in the Civil Rights Movement,\" Creative Loafing (Aug. 1, 2013).
