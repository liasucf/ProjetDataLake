    "text": "Bad Rats: The Rats' Revenge is a puzzle video game developed and published by Brazilianhttp://www.invent4.com/about.htm studio Invent4 Entertainment. It was released for Microsoft Windows on 20 July 2009. In May 2010, the game was acquired by Strategy First. A sequel, Bad Rats Show, was released exactly seven years later, on 20 July 2016. == Development == The game's developer, Augusto Bulow, said the game was intended to be humorous and added \"I feel happy with all the people that love (and hate) Bad Rats series.\" Bad Rats was accepted on to Steam prior to the Greenlight program. Bulow stated that he did not need to ask the community to vote for the game, and that they submitted it to Steam and it was accepted. == Reception == The inventory in Bad Rats, located in front of the puzzle. It holds objects and rats available to use in the puzzle given Bad Rats did not receive any critical reviews aggregated on Metacritic, and, according to Kotaku, is a \"putridly awkward\", \"nearly universally reviled\" game. IGN commented: \"It sucks, a lot. It is very bad.\" However, its appearance on the Steam marketplace in 2009, at a time when that platform was relatively tightly curated for quality, caused it to stand out as an oddity. It attracted a community of followers still active in 2015, six years after its release. Bad Rats received a majority of positive user reviews, possibly beginning the trend of users jokingly giving over-the-top positive reviews to bad games, and became a popular gift to troll other players with. Rock, Paper, Shotgun described it as \"the gaming equivalent of neckties with kooky prints or fart-scented soap\". == Legacy == A sequel, Bad Rats Show, was released on 20 July 2016. Bulow said that there was a sequel planned from the start. == References == == External links == * Category:2009 video games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games Category:Video games developed in Brazil Category:Strategy First games Category:Single-player video games Category:Fictional mice and rats ",
