    "text": "Adults in the Room () is a 2019 French-Greek film directed by Costa-Gavras. It is based on the book Adults in the Room: My Battle with Europe's Deep Establishment by Yanis Varoufakis about the 2015 Greek bailout. It is Gavras' first feature film that was shot in Greece. ==Plot== In 2015, following Syriza's victory in the 2015 Greek legislative election, Greek Minister of Finance Y\u00e1nis Varouf\u00e1kis is tasked by Prime Minister Al\u00e9xis Ts\u00edpras to negotiate a new deal on the memorandum of understanding signed by previous government with the Troika in order to avoid facing another inevitable debt crisis in the country months later. However, throughout successive meetings of the Eurogroup, Varouf\u00e1kis's proposals are only met with flat refusals from the Troika. With constant threats from the European institution of an eviction of Greece from the Eurozone if their demands are not met, Greek PM Al\u00e9xis Ts\u00edpras is forced to sign the MoU, going against the 62% of the population that rejected the bailouts by voting \"No\" in the 2015 Greek bailout referendum. Y\u00e1nis Varouf\u00e1kis then resign five months after taking office. ==Release== The film was selected to play out of competition at the 76th Venice International Film Festival. ==Reception== Jessica Kiang of Variety wrote, \"Far too many adults, in far too many rooms, have far too many repetitive conversations about the arcane ins-and-outs of EU policymaking in Costa-Gavras\u2019 maddeningly unfocused 'Adults in the Room.'\" Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \"For those interested in how the EU sausage is made \u2014 a process that Costa-Gavras mines both for its theatricality and seeming inanity \u2014 the film can be a gripping piece of infotainment, even if it runs long at 124 minutes. Others may shy away from so many administrative details, but they will be missing out on a movie that tries to cut through all the red tape and explore the human travails behind the protocols.\" ==References== * Giuseppe Leone, \"Yanis Varoufakis, Adulti nella stanza (ma non troppo)\", in \"Pomezia-Notizie\", Roma,agosto 2020, pp. 8\u201310. ==External links== * Category:2019 films Category:2019 biographical drama films Category:Films about the European Union Category:Films based on non-fiction books Category:Films directed by Costa Gavras Category:Films set in the Great Recession Category:Films set in 2015 Category:Films set in Athens Category:Films set in Berlin Category:Films set in Brussels Category:Films set in Frankfurt Category:Films set in Greece Category:Films set in London Category:Films set in Paris Category:Films set in Riga Category:Films shot in Paris Category:Films shot in Latvia Category:Films shot in Brussels Category:Films shot in Germany Category:Films shot in London Category:Films shot in Greece Category:Films shot in Berlin Category:French films Category:French biographical films Category:French biographical drama films Category:French drama films Category:Greek films Category:Greek biographical films Category:Greek drama films Category:2019 drama films ",
