After visiting with friends and relatives, they settled in Elkhart, Indiana in 1872. Enock Hill attended grammar schools in Elkhart as well as high school at the age of 15. It was once explained by Mrs. E.H. Turnock Jr., the origin of the spelling of Enock with a \u201ck\u201d rather than the common spelling with an \u201ch\u201d, she said, \u201cI have been told, that the London family had a son Enoch who died in infancy, but the parents like the name, and named their next son Enock, to distinguish him in family records. Enock was mostly known as E. Hill but his brothers called him \u2018Nock\u2019.\u201d E. Hill Turnock spent his early years in Elkhart, Indiana where he accepted employment with the Lakeshore railroad. ==Early career== Here he worked his way up to head pattern maker. His inclinations and his early talents indicated his career for him when a young man.

Afterwards, he established his own firm in Chicago until 1907, when he returned to Elkhart, Indiana. ==Influences== *W.L.B. Jenney *Henry Hobson Richardson *Louis Sullivan *Daniel H. Burnham These architects were among the most influential American architects in the later 19th and early 20th centuries. ==Later years== When Enock Hill Turnock returned to Elkhart he opened his own architectural firm where he designed many finer buildings which included homes, factories, and public buildings. Some of these buildings included the Elkhart City Hall, Elkhart General Hospital, Elkhart High School, the Elkhart Masonic Temple, Elkhart Public Library, a Presbyterian Church, Christian Science Church, the YWCA building, and the Water Company building. Turnock's other structures include the A.R. Beardsley Mausoleum in the Grace Lawn cemetery, the Rice Cemetery office, and many residential homes located throughout the city of Elkhart. On the other hand, the most recognized and famous home built in Elkhart is the Ruthmere, which was originally built for Mr. and Mrs. A.R. Beardsley.
