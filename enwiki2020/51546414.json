    "text": "Friederun K\u00f6hnen (born 22 September 1942) is a semi-retired television-chef and food-entrepreneuse, originally from Saxony, but based in North Rhine- Westphalia. In 2007 she handed over to her son, Volker K\u00f6hnen, responsibility for the daily running of the family business (known in recent decades as \"The Food Professionals K\u00f6hnen AG\") she had built up. By this time she was responsible for more than 100,000 published recipes. Since 1965 she has significantly influenced both home cooking and commercial food production in her native Germany. ==Life== The youngest of four children, Friederun K\u00f6hnen was born in Dresden during the war. When she was 23, with startup capital of 600 Marks, she launched herself as a freelance experimental chef. Working from improvised premises in the cellar of her parents' home, she quickly made an impression on the German food industry with her innovative ideas. Early on she successfully approached the owners of the M\u00fcller's M\u00fchle food conglomerate, a major producer of dried peas, beans and other pulses, with a proposal that many customers would prefer to buy these products in cans/tins, in order to avoid having to soak the contents overnight before they could be used for cooking. The idea caught on with consumers, and the resulting canned products can be seen as Germany's original \"ready meals\" (\"Fertiggerichte\"). The business launch coincided with wider changes in the food industry. A breakthrough came when K\u00f6hnen addressed the issues arising from the appearance in homes, during the 1960s and 1970s, of domestic freezers. Another branch of her entrepreneurial zeal ripe for expansion involved the recent arrival of supermarkets in West Germany. Many products which till that point had been sold fresh now needed to be packaged, and K\u00f6hnen was able to supply recipes and pictures of prepared dishes that could be printed on the packaging. In this way she was able to introduce consumers to new recipe ideas. In a contract with the Galbani company, at that time little known outside Italy, she was able to introduce consumers to hitherto unknown culinary ingredients such as Mozzarella, Mascarpone and Rucola. She was one of those who revealed Tiramisu to sweet toothed West Germans. K\u00f6hnen also popularised little known Asiatic ingredients such as Tofu and Soy sauce, including them in her recipes which by this time were appearing in her own cookery books. In 1984 the private television company RTL was launched and K\u00f6hnen applied to supply a cookery show. Her proposal was that the show should be financed by producers of the items it featured, using what became known as product placement. The broadcaster accepted the initiative and K\u00f6hnen presented her own daily ten minute cookery show, working alongside the moderator Horst Tempel. \"Komm doch mal in die K\u00fcche\" (\"Come into the Kitchen\") ran for four years, attracting audiences of several million, which commentators infer was far more than the RTL could have dreamed of so early in the channel's own life. K\u00f6hnen was not new to television at this point. Back in the 1970s she had presented a \"television cookery column\" for WDR's Hier und Heute (Here and Today) magazine programme. Over the years the experimental kitchen evolved to become \"The Food Professionals K\u00f6hnen AG\", based in Sprockh\u00f6vel, and today employing approximately 50 people with annual turnover around 3.7 Million Euros. In 2010 Volker K\u00f6hnen, the son of the founder (and a qualified photographer and ships' mechanic) took over at the top of the executive board, having already served as chief executive since 2007. Friederun K\u00f6hnen switched to the supervisory board. The business model embraces marketing campaigns, the development of new recipes and other food industry innovations. They also publish cookery books and produce product photographs in their own studios. Recent projects include the development of new product ideas such as a Currywurst (sausage) suitable for the Microwave. and a Schnitzel suitable for the Toaster. ==References== Category:Businesspeople from Dresden Category:Businesspeople in the food industry Category:German company founders Category:German television chefs Category:German food writers Category:People from Sprockh\u00f6vel Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:Women chefs Category:German chefs ",
