    "text": "The front cover of an Irish passport showing the name of the state in its two official languages. According to the Constitution of Ireland, the names of the Irish state are 'Ireland' (in English) and '\u00c9ire' (in Irish). From 1922 to 1937, its legal name was 'the Irish Free State'. The state has jurisdiction over almost five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The rest of the island is Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom. Consequently, other formal and informal names have been (and are) used when it is necessary to distinguish between the territory of the state and the island as a whole. In 1948 it adopted the term Republic of Ireland as the 'official description of the state', without changing the constitutional names. The terms Republic of Ireland (ROI), the Republic, the 26 counties or the South are the alternative names most often encountered. The term \"Southern Ireland\", although only having legal basis from 1920 to 1922, is still seen occasionally. Until the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, British government and media declined to use the name 'Ireland', preferring 'Eire' (without accent) until 1949 and 'Republic of Ireland' thereafter. ==Constitutional name== Article 4 of the Constitution of Ireland, adopted in 1937, provides that \"[t]he name of the State is \u00c9ire, or, in the English language, Ireland\".The wording of Article 4 has been criticised. Early criticisms are discussed elsewhere in this article More recently, in its report, the Constitution Review Group () in 1996 stated that Article 4 was unnecessarily complicated and should be amended to read \"The name of the State is Ireland\" with an equivalent change in the Irish text. Hence, the Irish state has two official names, \u00c9ire (in Irish) and Ireland (in English). For official purposes, the Irish government uses the name \u00c9ire in documents written in Irish, while using Ireland where the language of the documents is English, including in international treaties and other legal documents. The name of the state is reflected in its institutions and public offices. For example, there is a President of Ireland and a Constitution of Ireland. The name Ireland is also used in the state's diplomatic relations with foreign nations and at meetings of the United Nations,United Nations Member States, http://www.un.org/en/members/ European Union,European Union Member States, http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member- countries/index_en.htm Council of Europe,Council of Europe Member States, http://www.coe.int/en/web/portal/country-profiles International Monetary Fund,IMF Countries, http://www.imf.org/external/country/index.htm#I and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.OECD Countries, http://www.oecd.org/#countriesList The Constitution gives the Irish language formal precedence over English, and a reflection of this is that \u00c9ire is the only name of the Irish state to feature on a range of national symbols including the Seal of the President, postage stamps and Irish euro coins. In 1981 the Department of Posts and Telegraphs recommended the inclusion of the word \"Ireland\" along with \"\u00c9ire\" on stamps but the Department of the Taoiseach vetoed the idea on the basis it could cause \"constitutional and political repercussions\" and that \"the change could be unwelcome\", as the name \"Ireland\" was considered by Unionists in Northern Ireland to refer to all 32 counties of Ireland. The spelling \"Eire\", with an E rather than an \u00c9, is not correct Irish orthography despite being preferred for many years by British government and media. ==Legal description== An envelope from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, stating \"No Postage Stamp necessary if posted in Republic of Ireland\". Since 1949 the Republic of Ireland Act has provided that the Republic of Ireland (or Poblacht na h\u00c9ireann in Irish) is the legal description for the state.The Republic of Ireland Act, 1948 (Commencement) Order, 1949 (S.I. No. 27/1949) appointed 18 April 1949 (Easter Monday, the thirty third anniversary of the Irish Easter Rising) as the day the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 would come into force. However, Ireland remains the constitutional name of the state. The constitutional name Ireland is normally used. However, the legal description Republic of Ireland is sometimes used when disambiguation is desired between the state and the island of Ireland. In colloquial use this is often shortened to 'the Republic'. This distinction between description and name was and remains important because the Act was not a constitutional amendment and did not change the name of the state. If it had purported to do so, it would have been unconstitutional. The distinction between a description and a name has sometimes caused confusion. The Taoiseach, John A. Costello introduced the legislation with an explanation of the difference in the following way:Seanad \u00c9ireann \u2013 Volume 36\u201315 December 1948, The Republic of Ireland Bill, 1948\u2014Committee and Final Stages. Many republics reference that in their names, including the \"French Republic\" and the \"Italian Republic\" but others, such as Hungary and Ukraine do not. ==European Union== The state joined the European Economic Community (now the European Union) in 1973. Its accession treaty was drawn up in all of the EU's then-official treaty languages (including English and Irish) and, as such, the Irish state joined under both of its names, \u00c9ire and Ireland. On 1 January 2007, Irish became an official working language of the EU.See: Council Regulation (EC) No 920/2005. Until then, Irish was a treaty language, official to the extent that the EU's founding treaties were (in addition to the other languages of the EU) drawn up in Irish and equally authentic in that language. Irish had not been an official EU working language. This did not change the name of the Irish state in EU law. However, it has meant for example that at official meetings of the EU Council of Ministers, nameplates for the Irish state now read as \u00c9ire \u2013 Ireland, whereas previously they would simply have read as Ireland. The Inter Institutional Style Guide of The Office for Official Publications of the European Communities sets out how the names of the Member states of the European Union must always be written and abbreviated in EU publications. Concerning Ireland, it states that its official names are \u00c9ire and Ireland; its official name in English is Ireland; its country code is IE; and its former abbreviation was IRL. It also adds the following guidance: \"NB: Do not use 'Republic of Ireland' nor 'Irish Republic'.\"Clause 7.1.1 of the Inter Institutional Style Guide . ==Historical names== ===Ancient=== The Annals of the Four Masters describe how Ireland was referred to in ancient times * During the time of the Partholonians, Nemedians, Fomorians, and Firbolg, the island was given a number of names: ** Inis Ealga signifying the noble or excellent island. The Latin translation was Insula Nobilis ** Fiodh- Inis signifying the Woody island. In Latin this was Insula nemorosa ** Crioch Fuinidh signifying the Final or remote country. In Latin as Terra finalia. * Inisf\u00e1il meaning the Island of Destiny, and Inisfalia or Insula Fatalis in Latin. This was the name used by the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann and from this 'F\u00e1l' became an ancient name for Ireland. In this respect, therefore, Lia F\u00e1il, the Stone of Destiny, came to mean 'Stone of Ireland'. Inisfail appears as a synonym for Erin in some Irish romantic and nationalist poetry in English in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; Aubrey Thomas de Vere's 1863 poem Inisfail is an example. * \u00c9riu (from which derived \u00c9ire), Banba and F\u00f3dla were names given by the Dananns from three of their queens. * Ierne refers to Ireland by various ancient Greek writers and many scholars have the opinion that in the poem when the Argonauts passes Neson Iernida, that is, the Island Iernis, they are referring to the island of Ireland, thus referring to Ireland longer ago than 1000 BC. * Insula Sacra or the \"Sacred Isle\" was how several Roman writers referred to the island on account of its being a celebrated seat of Druidism. * Ogygia meaning the most ancient land is a name used by Plutarch in the first century which may refer to Ireland. * Hibernia is first used to refer to Ireland by Julius Caesar in his account of Britain, and became a common term used by the Romans. They also used a number of other terms, namely Juverna, Juvernia, Ouvernia, Ibernia, Ierna, Vernia. Ptolemy also refers to it as Iouernia or Ivernia. * Scotia or the land of the Scots is a term used by various Roman and other Latin writers, who referred to Irish raiders as Scoti. Some of the earliest mentions are in the 5th century, St. Patrick calls the Irish \"Scoti\", and in the 6th century, St. Isidore bishop of Seville and Gildas the British historian both refer to Ireland as Scotia. It was a term that exclusively referred to Ireland up until the eleventh century when modern Scotland was first referred to as Scotia. But even up until the sixteenth century, many Latin writers continued to refer to Ireland as Scotia. From the twelfth to the sixteenth century, various scholars used to distinguish between Ireland and Scotland by using Scotia Vetus or Scotia Major meaning Old Scotia or the Greater Scotia for Ireland, and Scotia Minor or Lesser Scotia for Scotland. * Insula Sanctorum or the Island of the Saints and Insula Doctorum or the Island of the Learned are names used by various Latin writers; hence the modern-day quasi-poetic description of the island as the \"Island of Saints and Scholars\". ===Pre-1919=== Following the Norman invasion, Ireland was known as Dominus Hiberniae, the Lordship of Ireland from 1171 to 1541, and the Kingdom of Ireland from 1541 to 1800. From 1801 to 1922 it was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. ===Irish Republic (1919\u201322)=== Easter Proclamation of 1916 declared the establishment of the Irish Republic. The rebel state retained this name until 1922. In English, the revolutionary state proclaimed in 1916 and ratified in 1919Parliament in Ireland, the First D\u00e1ilOireachtas.ie was known as the Irish Republic or, occasionally, the Republic of Ireland. Two different Irish language names were used: Poblacht na h\u00c9ireann and Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann, based on two competing Irish translations of the word republic: Poblacht and Saorst\u00e1t. Poblacht was a direct translation coming from the Irish pobal, cognate with the Latin populus. Saorst\u00e1t, on the other hand, was a compound of the words: saor (meaning \"free\") and st\u00e1t (\"state\"). The term Poblacht na h\u00c9ireann is the one used in the Easter Proclamation of 1916. However the Declaration of Independence and other documents adopted in 1919 eschew this title in favour of Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann. A slight variant of this title, Saorst\u00e1t na h\u00c9ireann, was also sometimes used in later days as was the Latin Respublica Hibernica.The Republic: The Fight For Irish Independence by Charles TownshendPolitics in the Republic of Ireland by John Coakley & Michael Gallagher (For an explanation continuing usage of the term Irish Republic in the United Kingdom, see Name dispute with the UK (below). Some republicans also continue to use the term because they refuse to recognise the Anglo-Irish Treaty \u2013 see below). ===Southern Ireland (1921\u201322)=== Southern Ireland () was the official name given to an autonomous Home Rule region (or constituent country) of the United Kingdom. It was established under the Government of Ireland Act 1920 on 3 May 1921.3 May 1921 (SR&O; 1921, No. 533). It covered the same territory as the present day Irish state.See: Government of Ireland Act 1920 However, political turmoil and the ongoing War of Independence meant that it never fully functioned as envisaged. Southern Ireland was superseded in law on 6 December 1922 by the establishment of the Irish Free State.Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922. The term Southern Ireland does not have any official status today.John Furlong (2006). Ireland \u2013 the Name of the State. Legal Information Management, 6, pp 297\u2013301. Cambridge University Press. However, it is sometimes used colloquially particularly in the United Kingdom. ===Irish Free State (1922\u201337)=== During the negotiations on secession leading to the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Irish politicians wanted the state to be a republic, and its name to be the Republic of Ireland or the Irish Republic. However the British government refused to contemplate a republic because this would have entailed the Irish state severing the link with the British crown and ceasing to be a part of the British Empire. Instead, the parties agreed the state would be a self- governing Dominion within the British Commonwealth of Nations. The self- proclaimed Irish Republic had used Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann as its Irish name, and \"Irish Free State\" was derived by literal translation of Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann back into English. Article One of the treaty stated:Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann) Act, 1922 The May 1922 draft of the Constitution of the Irish Free State used only Irish forms of many names and titles, but on British insistence these were replaced with English equivalents; one exception was that references to \"Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann\" were amended to \"the Irish Free State (Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann)\". After the establishment of the Free State the Irish government often used the name Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann in documents in English as well as Irish; an exception was that postage stamps of the period used \u00c9ire. Because the Irish Free State was not a republic, since 1922 the word saorst\u00e1t has fallen out of use in Irish as a translation of republic. When the legal description of the state was declared to be the Republic of Ireland in 1949, its official Irish description became not Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann but Poblacht na h\u00c9ireann. It appears that the \"Irish Free State\" name was not generally popular, The Times reporting on the Irish general election in 1932:The Times, 8 February 1932 ===\u00c9ire (Irish language name since 1937)=== As mentioned above, Article 4 of the Constitution of Ireland, gives the state its two official names, \u00c9ire in Irish and Ireland in English. Each name is a direct translation of the other. From 1937, the name \u00c9ire was often used even in the English language. In May 1937, when the President of the Executive Council, \u00c9amon de Valera presented the first draft of the Constitution to the parliamentary committee on the Constitution, Article 4 simply provided: \"The name of the State is \u00c9ire\". There was no reference to Ireland at all. Opposition politicians immediately proposed that the word Ireland be substituted for the word \u00c9ire throughout the English text. They argued that Ireland was the name known by every European country; that the name should not be surrendered; that the name Ireland might instead be adopted by Northern Ireland; and that the choice of \u00c9ire might damage the status of the state internationally by drawing a \"distinction between the state...and what has been known for centuries as Ireland\".D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann \u2013 Volume 67 \u2013 25 May 1937, Bunreacht na h\u00c9ireann (Dr\u00e9acht)\u2014Coiste Responding, de Valera stressed that the Irish text of the constitution was to be the foundation text. In light of this, he said the name \u00c9ire was more logical and that it would mean an Irish name would become accepted even in the English language.D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann \u2013 Volume 67 \u2013 25 May 1937, Bunreacht na h\u00c9ireann (Dr\u00e9acht)\u2014Coiste : 'The President: ... I should prefer to keep the name as \"Eire\" because the whole thing is more logical but, if anybody wants to translate that in the English text as \"Ireland,\" I have no objection. I am anxious, however, that the Irish term should be used on the same basis as we use \"Taoiseach.\" Elsewhere, it is suggested that that should be \"Prime Minister.\" The term \"Ceann Comhairle\" has now come to be used instead of \"Speaker.\" It has come gradually into our speech and the acceptance of Irish words for our own institutions is desirable. This is one of those matters in which I should have imagined I would come in for considerable criticism from the opposite benches if I put in the word \"Ireland\" instead of \"Eire.\" ... There are two things that can be said in favour of using the word Eire. The first is that it keeps the logic of the whole system much more clear and definite. The second is that we are doing something beyond what we have done before, that is, getting Irish names accepted even in English when we speak English here.'On a later occasion de Valera was also to say that the name \u00c9ire would have helped to avoid confusion between the names of the island and the state. Although, clearly, where the Irish language was the medium of communication, the position would be the same (as \u00c9ire is both the name of the state and the island in the Irish language). He considered that issue in the D\u00e1il (D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann \u2013 Volume 67 \u2013 25 May 1937, Bunreacht na h\u00c9ireann (Dr\u00e9acht)\u2014Coiste ): 'The President: There is, for instance, the territorial area which is called Eire in Irish, and there is the State. It is easy to distinguish between the two territories if you say St\u00e1t na hEireann or Oile\u00e1n na hEireann.' (Note: \"St\u00e1t na h\u00c9ireann\" is Irish for \"State of Ireland\" and \"Oile\u00e1n na h\u00c9ireann\" is Irish for \"Island of Ireland\".) However, he said he had \"no strong views\" and he agreed \"that in the English translation the name of the state [would be] Ireland\". When de Valera subsequently tabled an amendment to give effect to this concession, he proposed Article 4's current wording: \"The name of the State is \u00c9ire, or, in the English language, Ireland.\" In doing so, he remarked that as \"the Irish text is the fundamental text [it is as well] that \u00c9ire is used here and there.\" With almost no debate, the wording was agreed to and subsequently became the law of the land.D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann \u2013 Volume 68 \u2013 9 June 1937 Committee on Finance. \u2013 Recommittal. To the proposed wording, an opposition politician had responded that it was \"rather a cumbersome name for the State\". To this, de Valera replied, that \"it was a very short name. There is the equivalent in the English language.\" There was no further debate. The name Ireland was substituted for \u00c9ire in a number of places throughout the English text of the Constitution although the name \u00c9ire remained in the highly rhetorical preamble but nowhere else in the English text. The latter reference was probably also motivated by de Valera's wish to emphasise the pre-eminence of the Irish text, as well as by his previously stated view that such use of Irish words in English was \"desirable\" (\"D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann \u2013 Volume 67 \u2013 25 May 1937, Bunreacht na h\u00c9ireann (Dr\u00e9acht)\u2014Coiste ). It is sometimes said that de Valera wished to reserve the names Republic of Ireland or Irish Republic for the day when a united Ireland might be achieved. These names were not discussed in the parliamentary debates on the Constitution. However, the reason which de Valera gave in the debates for omitting any reference to the word republic throughout the constitution was that he thought the constitution would gain broader support if it did not refer to a republic.Seanad \u00c9ireann \u2013 Volume 36\u201315 December 1948, The Republic of Ireland Bill, 1948\u2014Committee and Final Stages . It is highly likely that practical considerations such as the possible ramifications of automatic exclusion from the British Commonwealth were also among his considerations. After the adoption of the Constitution, de Valera's government generally encouraged use of the name \u00c9ire (rather than Ireland) but not always. His government also appreciated the significance of the name Ireland. So for example, when the Irish ambassador in Berlin, Charles Bewley sought instructions concerning the new name of the State, he was advised by Joseph P. Walshe, for decades the top civil servant in the Irish Department of External Affairs that:Catriona Crowe; Ronan Fanning; Dermot Keogh; Eunan O'Halpin; and Michael Kennedy: Documents on Irish Foreign Policy: 1937\u20131939 Vol. 5 Ireland uses \u00c9ire as the country name on its current postage stamps. Thus, while sometimes encouraging the use of the name \u00c9ire even in English, de Valera's government insisted at other times on the use of the name Ireland. The United Kingdom disputed Irish adoption of the name \"Ireland\" (below). De Valera's decision to generally use the name \u00c9ire was sometimes severely criticised as a poor choice of name. Some argued that it was confusing.D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann \u2013 Volume 96 \u2013 11 April 1945 \u2013 Ceisteanna\u2014Questions Mr Cogan TD to the Taoiseach Others said the name \u00c9ire might strengthen the claim of the government of Northern Ireland to the ancient name of Ulster for their state.Seanad \u00c9ireann Debates- Volume 25 \u2013 14 May 1941. Senator Michael Hayes: Indeed shortly before the Second World War, the Northern Ireland government attempted to adopt the name Ulster but were rebutted by London. However, the name \u00c9ire (generally appearing as Eire in English) quickly became widely accepted in English. Nevertheless, this only fuelled more criticism of the name, as once free in the English language, it evolved \u2013 leading to what opposition politicians stated were \"sneering titles such as Eirish\".D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann \u2013 Volume 96 \u2013 11 April 1945 -Ceisteanna\u2014Questions These criticisms were aired at length in the Oireachtas when the Republic of Ireland Act was being debated. De Valera's use of the name \u00c9ire as well as the wording of Article 4 were sharply criticised. The Taoiseach of the day, John A. Costello said \"that tremendous confusion ha[d] been caused by the use of that word \u00c9ire in Article 4. By a misuse by malicious people of that word, \u00c9ire, they have identified it with the Twenty-Six Counties and not with the State that was set up under this Constitution of 1937.\"D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann \u2013 Volume 113 \u2013 24 November 1948 The Republic of Ireland Bill, 1948\u2014Second Stage. Costello also added that in \"documents of a legal character, such as, for instance, policies of insurance, there is always difficulty in putting in what word one wants to describe the State referred to. [The new description of the State, the Republic of Ireland will provide] a solution for these difficulties, and those malicious newspapers who want to refer in derogatory tones to this country as \u00c9ire and who have coined these contemptuous adjectives about it, such as \"Eireannish\" and \"Eirish\", and all the rest of it.\" In a similar vein Costello also remarked that those \"who may be disposed to jeer at our State, as they have done before in connection with the word \"\u00c9ire\", will look at this [Republic of Ireland Act] and see that in the English text\u2014which is the only one they can understand\u2014... the description of the State is \"the Republic of Ireland\"...I want to stop any further nonsense.\" Costello also criticised de Valera for using the term the \"\u00c9ire Republic..., a term of decision and scorn\". Despite these criticisms, de Valera initially called for the proposed Irish description of the state, Poblacht na h-\u00c9ireann to also be inserted into the English text of the Act in the same way both the Irish and English names of the state are used in Article 4.D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann \u2013 Volume 113 \u2013 26 November 1948 The Republic of Ireland Bill (Resumed). However, de Valera subsequently retreated from this position and in what may be seen as an implicit acceptance of the criticisms made of the wording of Article 4 itself, de Valera accepted that it was better not to also use the Irish description in the English text.In the same D\u00e1il debate, de Valera explained that a reason to use the Irish language description in the English text \"would be if one wanted to bring in the use of the name Poblacht na h\u00c9ireann into ordinary speech, as the words \"Taoiseach\", \"Oireachtas\", \"D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann\" have been brought into ordinary speech. Although I would like to see as many Irish words as possible come into the institutions of our State, I came to the conclusion that the Taoiseach is taking a better view. I think it is better for us in this case not to bring the Irish word into the English text; it is better to keep the English appellation, the English description, in the English text for some of the reasons the Taoiseach has mentioned.\" Despite not changing the name, when the Republic of Ireland Act was passed, the name \u00c9ire quickly fell into disuse (except in the Irish language). However the name continues to linger on, particularly in the United Kingdom. The Constitution review group's 1967 report discusses Article 4: Historically, \"Eire\" was commonly used as a state- name by a variety of organisations. For example, in 1938, the \"Irish Amateur Athletic Union\" (IAAU) changed its name to \"Amateur Athletic Union of Eire\" (AAUE) and affiliated to the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) under the country name \"Eire\". In 1967, the AAUE merged with most of the rival NACA to form Bord L\u00fathchleas na h\u00c9ireann (BL\u00c9). BL\u00c9 requested the IAAF to change the country's name to \"Ireland\". This finally happened in 1981. ==Abbreviations== Under the International Organization for Standardization's ISO 3166 standard, the two-letter code for Ireland is \"IE\" while the three- letter code is \"IRL\". The \"IE\" code is the basis for the choice of \".ie\" for Irish internet addresses.Section 31 of the Electronic Commerce Act, 2000 The IRL code features on Irish driving licences, passports and is most visible on contemporary Irish EU style vehicle registration plates.Regulation 11 of the Vehicle Registration and Taxation (Amendment) Regulations, 1999 (S.I. 432 of 1999). Under the Convention on International Civil Aviation Irish registered aircraft carry the nationality mark \"EI\",Regulation 11 of the Irish Aviation Authority (Nationality and Registration of Aircraft) Order, 2005 (S.I. 634 of 2005) although this abbreviation has nothing to do with the state's name. For example, the ICAO also gives \"EG\" and \"EH\" as the abbreviations for Belgium and the Netherlands. ==Alternative names== A variety of alternative names are also used for the Irish state. Sometimes alternative names are chosen because the name \"Ireland\" could be confused with the name of the island the state shares with Northern Ireland. Other times alternative names are chosen for political reasons. \"Republic of Ireland\", the \"description\" of the state according to the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, is often used. In sport, the national football team plays as the \"Republic of Ireland\". This is because the Irish national football team was organised by the Irish Football Association, from 1882 to 1950. A new organisation, the Football Association of the Irish Free State was formed after partition to organize a new team to represent the newly formed Irish Free State. Over time the Irish Football Association came to be the body for organising association football in Northern Ireland only. However, both association football federations continued to field a team called \"Ireland\". Despite protests from both organisations, in 1953 FIFA decreed that neither team could be referred to as Ireland in competitions which both teams were eligible to enter. The two teams now play under the names \"Republic of Ireland\" and \"Northern Ireland\". \"Irish Republic\" is commonly used as a name for the state in Britain but disliked in the Republic, where \"Irish Republic\" refers to the revolutionary state of the First D\u00e1il in 1919. The initialism \"ROI\", for \"Republic of Ireland\", is also often used outside official circles. Shorter colloquial names include \"the Republic\" or \"the South\". Irish republicans, and other opponents of Partition, often refer to the state as the \"Twenty-Six Counties\" or \"26 Counties\" (with Northern Ireland as the \"Six Counties\" or \"6 Counties\") and sometimes as the \"Free State\" (a reference to the pre-1937 state). Speaking in the D\u00e1il on 13 April 2000, Sinn F\u00e9in's Caoimhgh\u00edn \u00d3 Caol\u00e1in explained it as follows: \"Southern Irish Commonwealth\" and \"Southern Irish Republic\" were names suggested by the British publication, The Spectator, in 1921.The Spectator, Volume 127, F.C. Westley, 1922, pages 224-225 These suggestions never became widely used but are noteworthy for showing how fluid names for the territory were at the time. ==Distinguishing the state from the island== Where \"Ireland\" would be ambiguous, the current convention in Irish government usage is \"island of Ireland\" for the island and \"the state\" for the state. In the decades prior to the change to Articles 2 and 3, the forms \"Ireland (32 counties)\" and \"Ireland (26 counties)\" had some official use. Goods originating in Northern Ireland can be sold in the Republic as \"Irish\" or \"made in Ireland\", which some consumers find confusing or misleading. The private National Dairy Council introduced a \"Farmed in the Republic of Ireland\" logo in 2009, whereas Bord Bia, the statutory food labelling authority, has distinct \"Ireland\", \"Northern Ireland\", and \"Ireland & Northern Ireland\" logos; the \"Ireland\" logos incorporate an Irish tricolour as well as text.There is a separate debate about whether the flag relates only to the 26-county state or also to the entire island. The private Guaranteed Irish logo is mostly used by firms in the Republic, but there is one in Northern Ireland. ==Name dispute with the UK== This section concerns a protracted dispute which existed between the Irish and British governments over the official names of their respective states: Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Following the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 the dispute ended and each government now accepts the official name of the other state. ===\"Eire\" and \"\u00c9ire\" v Ireland=== In 1937 the Irish Free State Government arranged for a plebiscite to approve a new Irish Constitution. Articles 2 and 3 of the new Constitution expressed a territorial claim to the \"whole island of Ireland\" and thus an irredentist claim to the territory of Northern Ireland. In addition, Article 4 provided that \"the name of the state is \u00c9ire, or, in the English language, Ireland\". This too was seen by the British Government as another anti-partitionist attempt to lay claim to the whole of the island.Undoubtedly, the Irish government's desire to unite the territory of the island influenced its choice of the name Ireland for the state. A letter as early as 12 March 1932 from Joe Walshe to President de Valera is indicative of this. In it Walshe states: \"I believe that you can achieve the Unity of this country within seven years and that we can have our complete independence without calling this country by any particular const[itutional] name. \"Ireland\" shall be our name, and our international position will let the world know that we are independent\" in Ferriter, Diarmaid, Judging Dev, Royal Irish Academy 2007 In the run up to the adoption of the new Irish Constitution which took effect on 29 December 1937, the British Cabinet considered how to respond as regards the new name. A report to Cabinet by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs reported thatI.S.C. (32) 129;CABINET. Irish Situation Committee. RELATIONS WITH THE IRISH FREE STATE. GENERAL CONSTITUTIONAL POSITION. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs \"[De Valera] feels strongly that the title Irish Free State was one of the things imposed on the Irish by the British in 1921\". The same report recommended that the UK Government use \"always the Irish term 'Eire' when referring to the State, and ourselves avoiding the use of the term 'Ireland,' except to describe the whole island as a geographical entity\". It so happened that the Constitution would come into force when the Westminster Parliament was adjourned over the Christmas. Accordingly, the preferred course of the Prime Minister making a statement on the matter in Parliament was ruled out. Ultimately, in response to the new constitution and in consultation with all the Governments of the British Commonwealth except the Irish Government, the British government published a communiqu\u00e9 on 30 December 1937, the day after the Constitution took effect. In the communiqu\u00e9, the British government recognised that the new constitution gave the Irish state two names Ireland or \u00c9ire. It also implicitly recognised that the two names had an identical meaning, by declaring:The Manchester Guardian, 30 December 1937 Britain accepts new name for the Free State. Full text of British Government's communiqu\u00e9 cited in Clifford, Angela, The Constitutional History of Eire/Ireland, Athol Books, Belfast, 1985, p153. The British government finessed Article 4 and ignored Articles 2 and 3: if the Irish constitution said the name of the state in the national language was \u00c9ire, then that (written as \"Eire\") was what the British government would call it.Note: Under the Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938 the name Eire, without the correct s\u00edne fada (accent) over the first E, was used. This practice of omitting the s\u00edne fada over the E was consistently adopted by the UK government and some Commonwealth countries. By doing so, it avoided any need to call the Irish state, in the English language, Ireland.Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan, State of the Union: Unionism and the Alternatives in the United Kingdom, 2001: 173, 181. The change of name effected by the 1937 constitution (but not the other constitutional changes), was given effect in United Kingdom law in the Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938. Under Section 1 of that Act, it was declared that (for the purposes of United Kingdom legislation) the territory \"which was ... known as Irish Free State shall be styled as ... Eire\".Oliver, JDB, What's in a Name, in Tiley, John, Studies in the History of Tax Law, The Chartered Institute of Taxation, 2003. The British approach of calling the state Eire was greatly assisted by the general preference of \u00c9amon de Valera, the leader of the Irish government at the time, that the state be known as \u00c9ire, even in English. This is seen in the English-language preamble of the Constitution. However, the Irish government, even when led by de Valera, also appreciated the significance of the name Ireland and insisted on that name in some fora. For example, in 1938 Irish representatives in the Commonwealth countries gave their official titles as High Commissioner for Ireland and the League of Nations was informed that Ireland was the correct English name for the country.On Thursday 2 December 1937, the Irish Free State Government sent a Note to the League of Nations stating that the Free State would be officially known as Ireland on and after 29 December 1937, when the new constitution became law reported The Argus \u2013 Australia \u2013 \"NAME OF FREE STATE TO BE CHANGED TO IRELAND\" on 3 December 1937 A unique modus vivendi was adopted by the two States when they concluded a bilateral agreement on air services in 1946. That agreement was styled as an \"Agreement between the United Kingdom and Ireland (Eire)\". A parliamentary question as to why the term \"Ireland (Eire)\" was used rather than simply \"Eire\" was put in the British House of Commons. A parliamentary secretary for the Government, Ivor Thomas, explained the position as follows: The practice in other Commonwealth countries varied: At the outset at least, it appears South Africa and Canada used the name Ireland while New Zealand favoured Eire.A consideration given by the Canadians was \"that any Canadian Government communication would normally be in English rather than in Gaelic, and that the use of the Gaelic word \"Eire\" in such a communication might therefore be inappropriate (just as it would scarcely be considered appropriate, in a communication written in English which mentioned the Government of Egypt, to speak of it as the Government of Misr, unless the Egyptian Government specially requested that the Egyptian form of the country's name should be used)\": Circular dated 1 April 1949 from the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs to Heads of Post Abroad (Circular Document No.B38, 836. DEA/7545\u2011B\u201140) In 1947, the United Kingdom Home Office went further by issuing instructions to United Kingdom government departments to use Eire. Nevertheless, over time the name \u00c9ire fell increasingly out of use by both the Irish government (except in the Irish language) and internationally, in particular after the passing of the Republic of Ireland Act. ===Republic of Ireland v Ireland=== On 18 April 1949, the Republic of Ireland Act, 1948 (No. 22 of 1948), came into operation, removing the last functions of the king. Section two of the Act states, \"It is hereby declared that the description of the State shall be the Republic of Ireland.\" The following note of what Prime Minister Clement Attlee said at a British Cabinet meeting on 12 January 1949 illustrates some of the considerations the British government had to consider following this declaration:C.M. 1(49) \u2013 Meeting held on 12 January 1949. C.M. 1(49). Ultimately, the British responded by passing the Ireland Act 1949 which provided that: It was the culmination of careful consideration by the Prime Minister Attlee. He put it that \"a refusal to use the title 'Republic of Ireland' in any circumstances would involve [the UK] in continuing friction with the Eire Government: it would perpetuate the \"inconveniences and indignities\" which we now experience as a result of our present policy of insisting on the title 'Eire' as against Dublin's preference for 'Ireland.'\"Memorandum by the Prime Minister, C.P. (49) 47, 4 March 1949; Catalogue Reference:CAB/129/33 Hence, the Ireland Act formally provided the name Republic of Ireland for use instead of the name Eire in British law. Later the name Eire was abolished entirely in British law under the Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1981.Austen Morgan, The Belfast Agreement, 2000, p99. This has meant that the Republic of Ireland is the only name for the Irish state officially provided for in domestic UK law. Notwithstanding the Ireland Act, the British government would often continue to refer to the Irish state by other names such as the Irish Republic or Southern Ireland.Immigration and Nationality Directorate, UK Government Website, EEA Nationals . A good example of this was in the Treaty of London, 1949.Another example is some domestic UK legislation including \"The Irish Republic (Termination of 1927 Agreement) Order 1987.\" The UK government had been centrally involved in preparing the treaty which was signed in London and established the Council of Europe. The treaty consistently describes the Irish state as the Irish Republic. Opposition leader, \u00c9amon de Valera, queried this. The Minister for External Affairs, Sean MacBride, responded that he agreed \"that the description is not possibly as accurate as we would have liked it to be\".Council of Europe\u2014Motion Resumed.Wednesday, 13 July 1949. Yet he also said that the term Irish Republic was used in the treaty \"in a general sense in the way the country is described; French Republic, Irish Republic, Italian Republic, Kingdom of the Netherlands and so on.\"Committee on Finance. \u2013 Vote 3\u2014Department of the Taoiseach (Resumed). Thursday, 21 July 1949. However, leading opposition politician, Frank Aiken, was not satisfied with this response. Speaking in the D\u00e1il, Aiken cited article 26 of the treaty where \"the names of the countries are given as \"Belgium\", \"Denmark\" and \"France\", not \"Republic of France\" or \"French Republic\"\" noting that \"one would expect that the next thing one would find would be \"Ireland\", but instead we have \"Belgium, Denmark, France, Irish Republic, Italy, Luxembourg\" and so on. Aiken remarked that some British MPs wanted \"to popularise the name Irish Republic\". He asked the Taoiseach, John Costello to clear up \"what exactly is the name of this State going to be in international documents, international agreements and matters of that kind.\" Aiken expressed the view that \"We want to keep up the name given in the Constitution, \"Ireland\", in order to show that our claim is to the whole island of Ireland and in international documents, in my opinion, the State should be alluded to as \"Ireland\" or the \"Republic of Ireland\".\" The following month the Minister for External Affairs clarified at the Council of Europe that Ireland was how the state should be described. This was reported on in The Times on 8 August 1949 in the following terms:The Times, 8 August 1949 \u2013 Statement by European Movement (made on 7 August 1949)John Davies, The Correct Name for Ireland . [See Text of Treaty of London, 1949 at Wikisource; the UK government was the depository for the Treaty.] Therefore, even with the UK's Ireland Act and its provision of Republic of Ireland as a UK \"name\" for the Irish state, a dispute over the names of their respective states was to continue between the UK and Irish governments. For the Irish, Republic of Ireland was still not the name of the state, merely its description. For a brief period from the coming into effect of the Republic of Ireland Act until the second half of 1950 the Irish Government was inconsistent in the way it described itself and the state: At times it described itself internationally as the Government of the Republic of Ireland;Irish Treaty Series for 1949 and 1950 At other times it continued to insist that the name of the Irish state was Ireland. From the second half of 1950, the Irish government reverted to consistently styling itself the Government of Ireland. The Irish state joined the United Nations in 1955 as Ireland over protests concerning its name by the United Kingdom. Similarly, the United Kingdom protested when the Irish state was admitted to the European Economic Community in 1973 as Ireland. Australia also for several years following the declaration of a republic refused to exchange ambassadors with Dublin on the basis of the name \"Ireland\" rather than \"Republic of Ireland\", on the basis that this would have involved recognition of a territorial claim to part of His/Her Majesty's dominions.Patrick O'Farrell, Irish-Australian diplomatic relations, Quadrant, XXXIV (1980), p. 12 A legacy of this dispute was the designation of the Irish legation in London as the \"Irish Embassy\", rather than the title \"Embassy of Ireland\" preferred by Dublin.Donal Lowry, The captive dominion: imperial realities behind Irish diplomacy, 1922\u201349, Irish Historical Studies, XXXVI, 142 (2008), pp. 220\u201321 A further Commonwealth anomaly was the title of the monarch in Canada. In 1950, following the declaration of a republic the Irish and Canadian High Commissioners were replaced by Ambassadors/Ministers Plenipotentiary, accredited on the basis of the sovereign's title in Canada still encompassing the whole of Ireland. Even in 1952, following the accession of Elizabeth II, and prior to the revised definition of the royal title in 1953, Canada's preferred format was: Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas.Rinfret, Thibaudeau (6 February 1952), Notice and Proclamations , in Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Documents on Canadian External Relations, 14-1, Ottawa: Queen's Printer for Canada. Retrieved 8 October 2009. For its part, the Irish government also disputed the right of the British state to call itself the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Irish government objected to the words \"and Northern Ireland\" in the name of the British state. The name also ran against the Irish state's territorial claim to Northern Ireland. The dispute over the names of their respective states was most apparent when the two states concluded bilateral treaties. For example, when the Anglo-Irish Agreement was made in 1985 between the two states, the British text of the agreement gave it the formal title \"Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Ireland\" whereas the Irish government's text of the very same agreement gave it the formal title \"Agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom\".; It is standard practice in the titles of international agreements between two contracting states for each state to put itself first in its own version (held by the other contracting state). The Government Information Bureau in 1953 issued a directive, noting that Article 4 of the 1937 Constitution gave the name as \"\u00c9ire\" or, in the English language, \"Ireland\"; they noted that whenever the name of the state was mentioned in an English language document, Ireland should be used and that \"Care should be taken\", the directive stated, \"to avoid the use of the expression Republic of Ireland or Irish Republic in such a context or in such a manner as might suggest that it is a geographical term applicable to the area of the Twenty\u2010Six counties.\" According to Mary Daly, this directive remained in use for a number of years. A copy was sent to Bord F\u00e1ilte (the Irish tourist board) in 1959, reminding them not to use the title \"the Republic of Ireland\" on their promotional literature. In 1963, under the auspices of the Council of Europe, to revise geography textbooks, the Irish Department of Education issued guidelines to delegates on politically correct geographic terminology: \"British Isles\" and \"United Kingdom\" were deemed objectionable and that delegates insist on \"Ireland\" and \"Great Britain.\" The term \"Republic of Ireland\" should be avoided but that delegates were no longer to insist on \"the Six Counties\" in place of \"Northern Ireland\" in an attempt to improve relations with Northern Ireland. In February 1964, the Irish government indicated its wish to appoint an ambassador to Canberra. The one issue, however, that blocked the exchange of ambassadors had been the insistence of Australia that the letters carried by the Irish ambassador should have the royal title as \"Elizabeth the Second, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Australia and Her Other Realms and Territories, Queen.\" This was, according to Daly, despite the fact that the Australian Royal Style and Titles Act did not mention Northern Ireland, referring only to \"the United Kingdom, Australia\" etc. However, that November when Eoin MacWhite presented his credentials as Irish ambassador to Australia, a circular was issued to all Australian government departments indicating to them to use the word \"Ireland\" rather than \"the Irish Republic\". The UK was by the mid-1960s the only country not to refer to the state as Ireland. In 1985 the British command papers described the Anglo-Irish Agreement as an \"Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Ireland\", with the Irish official papers described it as an \"Agreement Between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United Kingdom\". The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office referred to Ireland as the \"Republic of Ireland\" \u2013 however since 2000 it has referred to the State as \"Ireland.\" The credentials presented by the British ambassador, Stewart Eldon, in 2003, were addressed to the President of Ireland. ===Republic of Ireland v Irish Republic=== When the Republic of Ireland Act was enacted, the United Kingdom cabinet debated whether it should use the new name in preference to \"Eire\". Having said that it was minded to do so and invited comment, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland (Sir Basil Brooke, Ulster Unionist) objected in the strongest possible terms, saying that the new description \"was intended to repeat Eire's claim to jurisdiction over the whole island.\" Attlee partly accepted this argument, saying that the [UK] bill should formally recognise the title 'Republic of Ireland' but that the description \"The Irish Republic\" would be employed in all official usage. Indeed, despite the Belfast Agreement, almost all British publications still follow this style (see below). ===In the Irish courts=== The name of the state\u2014both in English and in Irish\u2014was considered in one case in the Irish courts. In the 1989 Supreme Court case of Ellis v O'Dea, the court objected to the issuing of extradition warrants (in English) by the United Kingdom courts naming the state as \u00c9ire and not Ireland. Judge Brian Walsh said that while the courts of other countries were at liberty to issue such warrants in the Irish language, if they used the English language they had to refer to the state as Ireland. Walsh and Judge Niall McCarthy expressed the view that where extradition warrants did not use the correct name of the state it was the duty of the courts and of the Garda\u00ed to return such warrants for rectification. Both judges also noted that the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 did not change the name of the state as prescribed in the Constitution.Casey, James, Constitutional Law in Ireland, , pp. 30\u201331 The following is an extract from Walsh's judgement: ===Good Friday Agreement=== The dispute between the UK and Irish governments over the names of their respective states now appears to have been resolved. The Ireland Act 1949 has not been formally repealed by the UK but has been in effect overridden. This resolution took place when the Good Friday Agreement (or Belfast Agreement) was concluded in 1998. That Agreement concerned a wide range of constitutional and other matters regarding Northern Ireland. Notably, as part of it, the Irish state dropped its legal claim to the territory of Northern Ireland. In the title of the Agreement, the two governments used their respective domestic law names, the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Ireland. Some Unionist members of the British parliament objected strenuously to the use of the term the Government of Ireland. They proposed that the practice of referring to the Irish government as the Government of the Republic of Ireland should be continued. Their objections were not accepted. Responding for the British government in the House of Lords, Lord Dubs explained that the new practice of referring to the Irish state by the name Ireland:Hansard, House of Lords, 19 October 1998 This policy has been respected by both governments since the Belfast Agreement. A House of Lords debate, ten years later in May 2008, on Regulations governing political donations by Irish citizens and bodies to political parties in Northern Ireland, is a good example of this. During the debate Lord Rooker, a Government minister, said that the Regulations would: \"acknowledge the special place that the island of Ireland and the Republic of Ireland occupy in the political life of Northern Ireland\". Responding, Lord Glentoran suggested that Lord Rooker in fact \"meant to say that [the draft Regulations recognise] the special place that Ireland occupies in the political life of Northern Ireland.\" Agreeing with Lord Glentoran's observation, Lord Rooker responded: So far there has been no domestic British legislation explicitly providing that Ireland may be used as a name for the Irish state for the purposes of domestic British law. While the UK's Ireland Act provides for use of the name Republic of Ireland in domestic British law, that legislation is permissive rather than mandatory so it does not mean Ireland cannot be used instead. However, some legal commentators have speculated that it may be necessary for the British government to introduce legislation to also explicitly provide for use of the name Ireland for the Irish state because under domestic British law the name Ireland might be interpreted as referring to the whole island of Ireland. There is no requirement to amend domestic Irish legislation. Nevertheless, there are now a growing number of UK statutes and regulations that refer to the Irish state as simply Ireland and make no reference to the Republic of Ireland. One example is the Disqualifications Act 2000 which refers, inter alia, to the \"legislature of Ireland\", the \"House of Representatives of Ireland\" and the \"Senate of Ireland\". The Loans to Ireland Act 2010 refers to the state as simply \"Ireland\". The Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use uses simply Ireland for the country name.Country names: The Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British official use https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/country- namesCountry Names The Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use Similarly, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office do not use the term Republic of Ireland but rather apply the term Ireland when advising potential British Nationals choosing to live in Ireland.British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, GOV.UK, https://www.gov.uk/living-in-ireland In contrast, the Qualified Lawyers Transfer Regulations 1990 referred to barristers and solicitors qualified \"in Ireland\" and made no reference to the \"Republic of Ireland\"Qualified Lawyers Transfer Regulations 1990 (as amended) . but when these regulations were replaced by the Qualified Lawyers Transfer Regulations 2009, the Regulations were amended to refer to the Republic of Ireland and not Ireland. However, in her letter to President of the European Council Donald Tusk invoking Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union to give effect to Brexit, Prime Minister Theresa May used the term Republic of Ireland: ===British media usage=== The names attributed to the state by the British media are sometimes the subject of discussion in the state. The style guides of British news sources adopt differing policies for referring to the state (though notably all deprecate 'Eire' even though it was often used even in the late 20th century): ;The Times: \"Ireland: the two parts should be called the Republic of Ireland or the Irish Republic (avoid Eire except in direct quotes or historical context), and Northern Ireland or Ulster.\" ;The Guardian: \"Ireland, Irish Republic. not Eire or \"Southern Ireland\"\" ;The Daily Telegraph: \"Ireland includes Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Irish Government means the one in Dublin. Use Irish Republic or the Republic according to context, but not Eire.\" ;The Economist: \"Ireland is simply Ireland. Although it is a republic, it is not the Republic of Ireland. Neither is it, in English, Eire.\" ;BBC Radio: \"Ireland is an island, comprising Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.\" ;BBC News style guide: We should make clear within the first four pars that we are talking about the country rather than the island, so should use Republic of Ireland or the Irish Republic. Subsequent references can talk about Ireland, the Republic of Ireland or the Republic. Also, in headlines it is acceptable to use Ireland, but again the summary should emphasise that we are referring to the country. However, when writing stories that cover both parts (e.g.: The numbers of songbirds are declining throughout Ireland) we should try to make clear that we are talking about the island as a whole. Do not use either Eire or Southern Ireland. ==See also== *History of the Republic of Ireland *Politics of the Republic of Ireland *Alternative names for Northern Ireland *Hibernia *\u00c9riu ==Notes== ==References== Category:Politics of the Republic of Ireland Category:History of the Republic of Ireland Ireland Category:Terminology of the British Isles Irish state Category:Names for Ireland ",
