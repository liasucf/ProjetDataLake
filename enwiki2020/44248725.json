As the President of Shalom Jerusalem Foundation, he campaigns for expanding Jewish access to the Temple Mount. He was a member of the Knesset for Likud, having taken the place of former Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon in May 2016 until April 2019. Glick is the leader of HaLiba, a coalition of groups dedicated to \"reaching complete and comprehensive freedom and civil rights for Jews on the Temple Mount\". Glick was awarded the 2015 Moskowitz Prize for Zionism for being \"Active for human rights and religious freedom on Jerusalem's Temple Mount\".Interview with Vice News, vice.com; accessed 25 October 2015. He also has been referred as a \"right-wing\" Israeli activist. On 29 October 2014, Glick survived an assassination attempt by Mutaz Hijazi, a member of Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine. == Early life and education== Yehudah Glick was born on 20 November 1965 in the United States to American parents, Brenda and Shimon Glick. His father, a physician and professor specializing in endocrinology research and medical ethics, made aliyah with his family from the United States in 1974, and helped found Ben Gurion University's school of medicine. Glick served in the IDF between 1986\u20131989, as part of the hesder yeshiva that he attended. Glick initially served in the Armored Corps, and later in the Intelligence Corps. He completed a combat medics course, and served as a combat medic and regional defence soldier during reserve duty. Glick holds a Bachelor of Education in Bible Studies from Jerusalem College of Technology, and an MA in Jewish History from Touro College. He is also a licensed tour-guide for the Ministry of Tourism. ===Early career=== In 1996, Glick began working in the Ministry of Immigrant Absorption, filling several positions, including spokesperson for Minister Yuli Edelstein, director of the Public Diplomacy Department in the Ministry, Director of the Jewish Identity Unit, and Director of the Ashkelon and South Israel region. In 2005, after 10 years of work in the Ministry, Glick resigned in protest of the Gaza Disengagement Plan. After leaving his position in the Ministry of Immigration and Absorption, Glick took a greater leading role in the Temple Movement, becoming the executive director of the Temple Institute in 2005, which is a state-funded organization that supports the building of the Third Temple on the Temple Mount. After leaving the Temple Institute in 2009, Glick founded a series of organizations that promote and popularize the Temple Movement through liberal discourse, including the Temple Mount Heritage Foundation in 2009, and The Liba Initiative for Jewish Freedom on the Temple Mount, Human Rights on Temple Mount and currently chairs the Shalom Jerusalem Foundation since 2019. ==Activism== Glick advocates opening the Temple Mount on an equal footing to prayer by Muslims, Jews, Christians, and others. He has been called \"a symbol of the struggle for Jewish prayer on the Temple Mount\". And has been described as representing the recent shift in the demand for Jewish prayer to be permitted on the Temple Mount on an equal footing with Muslim prayer from the fringe to the mainstream of Israeli society. Glick has spoken about his vision of a utopian Temple Mount. It would include a \"House of prayer for all Nations\", with the Dome of the Rock standing alongside a rebuilt Jewish sacrificial altar. On March 26, 2018, two sacrificial lambs were slaughtered by priests near the Temple Mount in a ceremony attended by the subject, senior National Religious rabbis Dov Lior, Yisrael Ariel, and hundreds of citizens.Sheham, Udi. (26 March 2018). \"Activists carry out Passover ritual sacrifice at the foot of the Temple Mount\". JP website Retrieved 26 March 2018. Haaretz journalist Nir Hasson credits Glick as having put the Israeli left on the defensive by \"uncover(ing) the absurdity created at the Temple Mount\" by a status quo that, by permitting Muslim prayer, while prohibiting Jewish prayer, \"discriminates against people because of their religion\". Glick has led groups of Jews to walk the Temple Mount, and has been repeatedly arrested while praying, walking, and filming videos on the Temple Mount. On 10 October 2013, Glick began a hunger strike protesting a police ban forbidding him to ascend to the Temple Mount. After 12 days, the police relented, agreeing to permit him to enter the site on the same terms as other Jewish visitors, that is, only to visit, not to pray. An Israeli court awarded damages to Glick for two wrongful arrests that took place as he attempted to film officials denying entry to the Temple Mount to Jews dressed in visibly religious clothing. Glick was arrested in August 2014 for allegedly pushing a member of the Muslim women's guard at the Temple Mount, and was charged in mid-October for causing the woman to fall and break her arm. Glick's attorney said that there \"was no direct evidence that Glick had assaulted\" the woman. A condition of Glick's release on bail was to ban him from entering the area during the legal proceedings. The Israeli police argued in the court in December, in relation to the appeal of the ban, that \"allowing Glick on the site posed a threat to public order\". He sued in response to sue the Israeli police over his ban from the site, and was later awarded NIS 650,000 in damages and legal costs due to his ban.Court rules state must compensate Temple Mount activist, haaretz.com; accessed 25 October 2015.

On 4 June 2015, a Jerusalem district court banned Glick from entering Temple Mount, overturning a lower court decision. The judge ruled that Glick's presence was inflammatory, and that, \"there is a risk of violence breaking out if the respondent returns to the compound before the end of legal proceedings in his case\". On 25 February 2016, the police dropped their charges against Glick.Police Drop Indictment Against Temple Mount Activist Yehudah Glick, haaretz.com; accessed 25 February 2016. American political commentator Bernie Quigley has likened Glick to Gandhi, \"earthy, wise, thoughtful, non-violent, and compassionate\". He has stated that the Muslim leadership's persistence in refusing to open up the Temple Mount to all monotheisms will bring about 'a very dangerous ... to a great threat to the world and to the peace of the world'.Larry Derfner, 'The Fraud that is the Temple Mount Movement', +972 magazine, 31 October 2014; \"Following the murder attempt on Glick, the claim is being made \u2013 and getting a more sympathetic hearing than usual (here and here) \u2013 that he and his colleagues have been leading a \"civil rights\" movement for Jews\". Shany Littman, writing for Haaretz, describes him giving talks at a meeting in an Orthodox Jerusalem neighborhood where Meir Kahane's poster features, together with activists like Hillel Weiss, head of Lishkat Hagazit, which is dedicated to appointing a king of Israel, wiping out the seed of Amalek, and building the Temple; and Einat Ziv and Yehudit Dasberg from the Women's Forum for the Temple.Shany Littman, \"Following the dream of a Third Temple in Jerusalem\", Haaretz, 4 October 2012. Now a member of the 20th Knesset, Glick is continuing his Temple Mount activism campaign, but has been barred from visiting the Temple Mount itself several times over the years due to the potentially incendiary nature of his activism campaigns. ==Assassination attempt== On 29 October 2014, Glick gave a speech at the Menachem Begin Heritage Center in Jerusalem. According to eye- witness Shay Malka (Parliamentary Assistant of MK Moshe Feiglin), a man on a motorcycle who spoke with a \"thick Arab accent\" approached Glick as he loaded equipment into the back of his car after speaking at a conference, and asked if he was Yehudah Glick, before shooting him in the chest 4 times and speeding off.

The time has come for the international community to condemn him for such actions.\" Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said, \"This shows that Abu Mazen is a partner, a partner for terror, a partner for terrorists, a partner for murders.
