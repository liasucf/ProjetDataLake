    "text": "The Chiefdom of Ameca () is the name given to a pre-Columbian state that encompassed the Valley of Ameca in central Jalisco, Mexico. The word Ameca is of Cazcan origin and means \"above the water\". ==History== Xoxouhqui Tequani (meaning \"brave lion\") was a feared indigenous chief from a far, unspecified coastal region who settled the area with his people circa 1325. He is attributed as the founder of the Chiefdom of Ameca and its dynasty which spanned five generations. Xoxouhqui Tequani never became a vassal of his powerful comrade Caltzoncin, chief of P\u00e1tzcuaro, because of his bravery and expert warfare. Xoxouhqui Tequani's sons, grandsons, great-grandsons, and great-great grandsons succeeded him as chiefs of Ameca, until 1522. Huitzil, Xoxouhqui Tequani's descendant, was the last of the chiefs of Ameca. His great-grandson, don Mart\u00edn Cort\u00e9s, became governor of Ameca during the late 16th century. ==Conquest== The seat of Amecatl was discovered by Juan de A\u00f1esta in 1522 who arrived barefoot and alone with a sword in his hand. The residents of Amecatl surrendered peacefully to the conquistador because they thought he was the son of the sun, as their ancestors had predicted that he would come to conquer and that all would be subject to him and pay tribute. Until 1529, Fray Antonio de Cu\u00e9lla along with other missionaries and Spaniards settled in the town of Amecatl and built an adobe chapel, royal house, plaza, jail, hotel, and houses in what is now central Ameca, Jalisco. Though the population of Ameca spoke the Cazcan and Totonac languages,Peter Gerhard, Guide to the Historical Geography of New Spain (Cambridge: University Press, 1972) p. 58-59 they generally used Nahuatl (mexicano). ==Gastronomy== Maize, which was either boiled or roasted, was the staple food of the Amecans; it was the main ingredient for their cuisine which included tamales (tamalli) and atole (cacalotl or izquitl). Their diet also included pumpkins, beans, chili peppers, and chives. They hunted deer, rabbits, fowl, small dogs (chichitones), snakes, mice, badgers, and big cats; the game meat was cooked in holes with many pebbles. Pulque, an intoxicating milk-like drink from the maguey plant, was a popular beverage. They gathered red and yellow plums, mezquites, zapotes, guam\u00fachiles, avocados, guavas, and bananas. ==References== ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== *Health during the Conquest-period *Historical description of the region Category:States and territories established in 1325 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1524 Category:History of Mexico Category:Former countries in North America Category:Former chiefdoms in North America ",
