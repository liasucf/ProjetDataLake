By beating Preston North End at Stamford Bridge, Town won the FA Cup and reaped the rewards from the townspeople at St. George's Square on their return. ==Squad at the start of the season== ==Review== Following the disappointing showing in Town's 1st season in the top-flight, Town were hoping for better fortunes in their second season, but Town made the same number of points that they did the previous season, but they did finish three places higher than the previous season. However, the season is fondly remembered by Town fans for their success in the FA Cup. After needing replays to beat Burnley, Brighton & Hove Albion and Blackburn Rovers, they dispatched Millwall in the fourth round and easily disposing of Notts County at Turf Moor in the semis and reached their second final in three years. They played Preston North End in the final, just two days after beating them 6-0 in the league. Billy Smith (who along with Ernie Islip had scored a hat-trick in the 6-0 win) scored the winning penalty and Town won the cup for their first and only time. ==Squad at the end of the season== ==Results== === Division One=== {| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center; font-size:smaller;\" |- style=\"background:#f0f6ff;\" !Date !Opponents !Home/ Away !Result F - A !Scorers !Attendance !Position |- bgcolor=\"#ffdddd\" |27 August 1921 |Newcastle United |H |1 - 2 |Swann |25,000 |17th |- bgcolor=\"#ffffdd\" |29 August 1921 |Sheffield United |A |1 - 1 |Islip |22,500 |17th |- bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" |3 September 1921 |Newcastle United |A |2 - 1 |Jones, Wilson |50,000 |11th |- bgcolor=\"#ffffdd\" |6 September 1921 |Sheffield United |H |1 - 1 |Islip |19,000 |12th |- bgcolor=\"#ffffdd\" |10 September 1921 |Sunderland |A |2 - 2 |Stephenson, Richardson |30,000 |11th |- bgcolor=\"#ffdddd\" |17 September 1921 |Sunderland |H |1 - 2 |Swann |19,000 |18th |- bgcolor=\"#ffdddd\" |24 September 1921 |Bolton Wanderers |A |1 - 3 |Johnston |30,500 |18th |- bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\" |1 October 1921 |Bolton Wanderers |H |3 - 0 |Islip, Swann, B.
