    "text": "The Canon EOS 90D is a digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera announced by Canon on August 28, 2019. It has a body-only MSRP of US$1199, which is the same as the Canon EOS 80D, which it replaces. The camera is one of Canon's higher end APS-C cameras and is referred to as an enthusiast model. The 90D has a new 32.5MP image sensor compared to the older 24.2MP sensor of the previous 80D model. == New features compared to the 80D == Compared to the EOS 80D, several modifications were made, including: * New 32.5-megapixel dual- pixel CMOS sensor * DIGIC 8 (DIGIC 6 on the 80D) * New 220,000 pixel RGB+IR metering sensor to aid the AF system * 4K (2160p) at 30 fps video recording capability * 1080p at 120/60/50 fps video recording capability * AF joystick on rear to aid autofocus point selection * Clean HDMI output with 4K capability * New spot AF function in addition to the single point AF * 10fps viewfinder shooting vs 7fps on 80D * Supports UHS-II data transfer bus (the first Canon DSLR to support this protocol; the previously introduced EOS R and EOS RP and concurrently introduced EOS M6 Mark II) However, unlike its predecessor, the 90D was introduced without the ability to record 24p video at any resolution. In late October 2019, Canon added the ability to record at 24 fps in either 4K or 1080p in a firmware update. == References == 80D Category:Cameras introduced in 2016 Category:Live-preview digital cameras ",
