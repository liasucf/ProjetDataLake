Al SharptonCaron, Matt. \"Bishop Talbert Swan receiving National Action Network honor\", wwlp.com, April 27, 2017 and the NAACP James F. Hennessey Award for his work in civil rights advocacy.McGlaughlin, Susan. \"Greater Springfield NAACP President Talbert Swan receives award at 96th annual NAACP dinner held at Chez Josef\", Springfield Republican, May 15, 2014 Defeating his rival by a three-to-one margin in the 2011 election for president of the Greater Springfield NAACP, Swan's election reportedly created anticipation of a resurgence of social activism in the region.Turner, Maureen. \"A New Pulpit\", Valley Advocate, July 28, 2011 The Valley Advocate noted that this led to a revitalization of the organization and its voice on critical community issues. Swan outlined the priorities of the branch as taking a renewed focus on education, health, economic empowerment, political action and social justice advocacy.Rizzuto, Robert. \"Springfield NAACP President Talbert W. Swan II outlines priorities\", Springfield Republican, September 24, 2011 ===Police reform=== Swan, a longtime advocate for police reform, first came to national attention in the wake of receiving a harassing telephone call from Joseph Bradley, a Springfield, MA police officer. Bradley made the call from the Public Safety office of Western New England University and mocked the burning of black churches in the south. The call was made July 2, 1996, the day Swan was hosting a service to raise funds to assist southern churches that had been burned.Mcauliffe, Michael. \"Blacks called to action on church fires\", Springfield Union News, July 3, 1996, B4. After confirming that the racist call was made by Bradley, Springfield Deputy Chief of Police Daniel Spellacy apologized to Swan, his congregation, and the African American community, and Mayor Michael Albano vowed that the city would not tolerate such racist acts.Mcauliffe, Michael and Malley, Carol. \"White officer linked to call: City's police apologize to blacks,\" Springfield Union News, July 6, 1996 A1. Mayor Albano said that the call to Swan \"borders on crisis\" and announced the formation of a community coalition to deal with racial tensions.Stephenson, D.L. \"Racial crisis possible says Albano\", Springfield Union News, July 22, 1996, B1. Although District Attorney William M. Bennett did not charge Bradley with a crime stating that it did not appear that a state law was broken,Mcauliffe, Michael. \"DA says call didn't break any state law,\" Springfield Union News, July 12, 1996, B1. Bradley was fired by the Springfield Police Commission.Hunger, Kate. \"Springfield dismisses officer for prank call to a black minister,\" Boston Globe, July 17, 1996. In the wake of the Bradley's firing, Swan received another harassing call from George Eckmalian, a sergeant in the Army National Guard. Eckmalian, calling from an American Legion Post, said he spoke for the 'White Aryan Race'Gilbert, Camilla. \"Race Matters,\" Emerge Magazine, November 1996. and threatened to burn Swan's church down if he refused to drop the charges against Officer Bradley.Goonan, Peter. \"Legion head appalled at racist call,\" Springfield Union News, July 18, 1996. Eckmalian was charged with a civil rights violation and was sentenced to probation and community service.\"National Guardsman pleads guilty to racist call,\" Nashua Telegraph, November 28, 1996, p 30. Under an agreement with prosecutors, Eckmalian was also ordered to undergo sensitivity training in race relations and to continue alcohol treatment.\"Man sentenced for racist threat\", Boston Globe, November 27, 1996, B3. Deeming it the \"House of Hate,\" the Boston Globe did an expos\u00e9 on the Springfield Police Department stating that \"its menacing tone has resonated with people of all races.\" In the front-page article, featuring Swan pictured at his church and detailing the racist telephone calls to Swan by Officer Bradley and Eckmalian, Swan contends that swift action in response the calls he received were only due to his high profile and the media response. He opined that appropriate action on minority complaints was not characteristic of the department.MacQuarrie, Brian. \"Racism's Cutting Edge\", The Boston Globe, August 1, 1996, Front Page. Responding to the dismissal of assault charges against white police officer, Jeffrey Asher, who was caught on video kicking a handcuffed Roy Parker in the head, Swan organized a rally attracting hundreds, that was held across from Springfield City Hall.\"Police treatment of blacks focus of rally in wake of taped incident,\" Nashua Telegraph, June 28, 1997, p3. Citing the reluctance of those in leadership to condemn Asher's actions because of Parker's prior criminal history, Swan condemned the silence of elected officials and clergy. He noted that \"an open condemnation of this incident is long overdue\" and that \"the silence of those in leadership is shameful.\"Kelly, Ray. \"Ministers decrying 'silence'\", Springfield Union News, April 12, 1997, Front Page. Asher was eventually arraigned on assault charges,Flynn, Jack. \"Officer arraigned in assault case\", Springfield Union News, B1. but was eventually cleared of the criminal charges. The Police Commission suspended him for one year and ordered him to undergo \"sensitivity training.\" Asher's suspension was reduced to six months by a labor arbitrator, with Asher receiving $20,000 in back pay.Turner, Maureen. \"Asher Conviction Offers a \"Glimmer of Hope\", Valley Advocate, May 5, 2012 More than a decade later, Asher was again caught on video repeatedly beating subdued suspect Melvin Jones with a flashlight.Johnson, Patrick. \"Videotape of white police officer beating black suspect prompts clergy to call for Springfield Police Department to restore confidence\", Springfield Republican, January 8, 2010 After the conviction of Asher on assault charges, Swan urged Hampden District Court Judge Maureen Walsh to take into consideration Asher's troubled history and its effect on the public. Swan was the recipient of a racist fax by Springfield Police, a charge denied by the department. Swan reported that he received a fax laced with racial slurs and a warning to \"leave our Police Department alone.\" In spite of the denial from the department, the telephone number displayed on the fax was that of a police department fax machine.\"Springfield Police Get their fax straight\", Fitchburg Sentinel And Enterprise, July 20, 2000, p 15. The Springfield police launched an investigation into Swan, accusing him of sending the faxes to himself. District Attorney William Bennett met with Swan and asked to issue an apology to the Police Department. Swan refused and viewed the actions of the department as the latest in a series of harassing acts dating back to the racist telephone call received from Officer Joseph Bradley.Turner, Maureen. \"Getting the Fax Straight,\" The Valley Advocate, August 24, 2000, 4. Noting that Swan had made enemies \"both among the old guard in the black community and among whites who don't appreciate his efforts to shake up a system that works pretty well for them,\" Valley Advocate Editor Tom Vannah opined that the rumors regarding the fax incident, although unproven, may have been \"damaging enough to undercut the work\" Swan's tried to do.Turner, Maureen and Vannah, Tom. \"26 Pols You Should Know: A roster of the rogues, the righteous and the rabble rousers who shape Valley politics\", Valley Advocate, September 14\u201320, 2000. Swan sought an independent investigation into the controversial 2011 shooting of 18-year-old Tahiem Goffe by a Springfield policeman, which was investigated by the Springfield police and ruled justified by the local district attorney.Sullivan, Jack. \"Clearing the cops: Do district attorneys rubber-stamp police use of deadly force?\", Commonwealth Magazine, January 15, 2014 Swan urged District Attorney Mark G. Mastroianni called to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the incident, \"to ensure that proper police procedures were employed and that the investigation will not be compromised.\"Turner, Maureen. \"Investigating the Springfield Police Department\", January 15, 2012 Swan argued the need for independent investigators in any cases involving a shooting by a police office. He noted that historically, the office of District Attorney has not been an effective instrument for insuring transparency.Turner, Maureen. \"Investigating the Springfield Police Department,\" Valley Advocate, January 19, 2012. Swan has called for police accountability and the implementation of civilian police oversight. Calling police departments where civilian review boards only serve in an advisory capacity \"a joke,\" Swan has urged for boards with statutory authority.Epp, Henry. \"NAACP's Talbert Swan: Springfield Police Review Board 'Is A Joke'\", New England Public Radio, December 11, 2014 He has called for cruiser cameras and recorders to provide additional accountability.\"Should Police Cruisers Have Cameras?\", Valley Advocate, February 27, 2014 Swan was critical of an arbitration ruling in 2014 that continued to block the use of body cameras in certain Massachusetts cities. Noting that video cameras in cruisers promote officer safety and public accountability, Swan said those cities were \"a little behind the times in terms of the advancement of this technology.\"Lucas, Dave. \"Should Body Cameras Be Required For Police Officers?\", WAMC Northeast Public Radio, December 5, 2014 Swan weighed in on several high-profile cases involving police shootings. After George Zimmerman was acquitted of the murder of 17 year old Trayvon Martin Swan helped to organize the 'Justice for Trayvon Martin' rally, part of a 100-city vigil that was held across the country.Zeitlin, Hugh. \"Western MA residents hold rally for Trayvon Martin\", Western Mass News, July 20, 2013 Swan met with Massachusetts legislators to rally opposition to 'Stand Your Ground' legislation in the House of Representatives. Stand Your Ground was used as Zimmerman's defense in the killing of Trayvon Martin. Swan noted that we \"should be encouraging non-violence and the de-escalation of conflicts when a safe retreat can be made.\"Turner, Maureen. \"Standing Against 'Stand Your Ground',\" Valley Advocate, May 19, 2012. The legislation was not passed. After a partial mistrial was declared in a Florida murder case for the shooting death of teenager Jordan Davis Swan noted that it marked another example of failed justice involving a young black victim.Goonan, Peter. \"Michael Dunn Florida murder case: Local NAACP President Talbert Swan II decries justice system following mistrial\", Springfield Republican, January 14, 2014. Swan is a police chaplain for the Springfield Police Department. In 2005 he organized the Rev. Theodore N. Brown Anti Gang Initiative. The effort was named in honor of Rev. Theodore Brown, a school counselor who was murdered by 17 year old Corey Ramos.Stacom, Don. \"Schools Move to Add Security\", Hartford Courant, December 7, 2001. In honor of Brown, Swan wrote a book, Addressing Violence in Springfield Schools: We Cannot Allow the Death of Rev. Theodore N. Brown to be in Vain. The book presents Swan's analysis on school violence and several models of education.Dobbs, G. Michael. \"Brown Remembered in Book\", The Reminder, January 8, 2003. The anti-gang program trained street workers who frequented gang 'hot spots' trying to break through to young men and women involved in gangs, drugs, and violence or being drawn into such activity.Lowney, Mary Ellen. \"Activists target gang 'hot spots'\", Springfield Republican, May 20, 2005, A1. Swan has worked with police departments and coordinated meetings at his church with witnesses to crimes in efforts to foster regular communication with law enforcement.Banks, Adele M. \"Police Chief To Black Churches: 'We Can't Do This Without You Guys'\", Huffington Post, January 11, 2015. Swan was appointed by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey to her Advisory Council on Racial Justice and Equity and by Springfield City Council President Orlando Ramos to the Committee on Police and Community Relations.Goonan, Peter. \"Springfield City Council names committee to explore improvements in police-community relations\", Springfield Republican, February 16, 2007 ===Voting rights=== Bishop Swan was the lead plaintiff in a 1996 federal lawsuit against the city of Springfield, MA seeking to declare the at large representation system unconstitutional on the grounds that it diluted the votes of African Americans, Latinos, and other communities of color. The lawsuit sought to change the all at-large election of the city council to one including ward representatives. It also sought an injunction against the current voting scheme.Spencer, Buffy. \"At-large elections challenged,\" Springfield Union News, January 14, 1997, B1 Referring to Springfield's at-large city council as a \"bastion of privilege that systematically excludes residents from Springfield's poor and non-white neighborhoods,\" the Boston Globe brought national attention to Swan's efforts to replace the voting system in a featured article picturing Swan in front of his church.Emery, Theo. \"Turf battle: Springfield groups launch fight for at- large council seats,\" Boston Globe, August 10, 1997 A successful signature drive placed the question for ward representation on the November 1997 ballot. On election day, 58 percent of the voters were in favor of the question, which called for eight ward seats and three at-large seats.Goonan, Peter. \"Plaintiffs offer to withdraw ward suit,\" Springfield Union News, November 18, 1997, A1 Although the ballot question received a majority vote, it fell short by 15,000 votes of the required number to become law. Swan, on behalf of the plaintiffs, offered to drop the lawsuit if city councilors agree to honor the will of the electorate and implement the ward system. In January 1998 Mayor Michael Albano again filed legislation with the city council to change to a ward system but it twice rejected the proposal.Turner, Maureen. \"Vote of No Confidence\", Valley Advocate, January 29, 1998 Swan then contacted the U.S. Department of Justice who assigned an investigator to consider if voting rights laws were being violated.Turner, Maureen. \"A Small Step Uphill: Feds agree to examine whether Springfield election rules unfairly hinder minorities\", Valley Advocate, December 24, 1998. Swan also requested assistance from the department in the federal lawsuit, alleging that the at- large system \"was adopted and is being maintained purposefully to dilute, minimize and cancel out the voting strengths of blacks and Latinos.\" Eventually, Mayor Charles V. Ryan and City Councilor Jose Tosado proposed a home-rule amendment that would expand the council to thirteen members including eight ward and five at large seats. The home-rule petition was adopted by the City Council 7\u20132, and was later passed by the State Senate and House and signed by the Governor. On election day, November 6, 2007, city residents voted 72% in favor of changing the all at large election of the City Council and School Committee to one including ward representation.Rivais, Larry. \"Ward representation brings change to voting in Springfield municipal election\", Springfield Republican, August 9, 2009 On November 3, 2009, Springfield held its first ward elections in 50 years. In October 2011, Bishop Swan joined with the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights, the ACLU and City Councilor Zaida Luna to send an urgent request to the US Department of Justice for intervention in the City of Springfield regarding widespread voter rights violations. The group cited multiple incidents and areas of noncompliance with the Federal Voting Rights Act and the Department of Justice's 2006 settlement order with the City of Springfield. Teams from the US Department of Justice and the US Attorney General's office arrived in Springfield on November 8, 2011. ===Unresolved murders of black women=== Bishop Swan challenged the Mayor and police department regarding the murders of four black women in the Western Massachusetts region. Media reports of the victims disparaged them as drug users and police seemed to have no leads regarding their assailants. Swan and other activists accused the police department of not pursuing their cases as vigorously as other victims because they were poor and black. Under pressure from the community, Mayor Michael Albano authorized unlimited funds for overtime for police to solve the murders.Spencer, Buffy and Flynn, Jack. \"Mayor vows help in probe of slayings\", Springfield Republican, February 14, 1998 Swan organized an effort to erect a stone monument honoring the life of the four victims and other women of color whose murders were unsolved. After receiving approval from the Springfield, MA Parks Department, Swan was told that he would need to receive approval from the Springfield, MA Historical Society to erect the monument in the triangle of Mason Square, an historically African American neighborhood where most of the victims lived, The Historical Society required Swan to get approval from the four surrounding neighborhood councils. Failing to get the approval of one of the councils, Swan's request was denied.Spencer, Buffy. \"Dispute flares over victims monument\", Springfield Republican, February 17, 2017 Swan persisted regarding the placement of the monument and challenging the city regarding their investigation of the murders.Appleton, John. \"Memorial to slain women debated,\" Springfield Republican, May 3, 1999 Mayor Albano, using executive authority, allowed the monument to be erected outside the Springfield District Court and Alfred Gaynor was eventually arrested, convicted, and sentenced to four consecutive life sentences.Johnson, Patrick. \"Grand jury indicts serial killer Alfred Gaynor for 4 additional murders\", Springfield Republican, October 21, 2010 ===Political activity=== In 2006, Swan was one of several clergy that endorsed Deval Patrick for Governor of Massachusetts. After his victory as the first African-American governor in the history of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Patrick selected Swan as one of the speakers at the Interfaith Prayer Service preceding his Inaugural.Paulson, Michael. \"Religious leaders embrace Patrick\", The Boston Globe, December 30, 2006, A1 Metro.

Deval Patrick about casinos, police brutality\", Springfield Republican, April 8, 2010 Swan was again selected to speak during the Interfaith Prayer Service preceding Patrick's second Inaugural.

Scott Brown agrees to meet with Springfield NAACP leader Talbert Swan after initially saying no,\" Springfield Republican, January 27, 2012 In August 2012, Swan met with Elizabeth Warren in a closed session with other clergy hosted at his church. Swan noted that clergy had a responsibility to meet with candidates to \"ascertain their veracity, political competence, ability to effectively manage crises and inspire confidence through outstanding leadership and their ability to produce tangible results that serve the needs of our constituents.\"Rizzuto, Robert. \"Elizabeth Warren to meet with Rev. Talbert Swan in Springfield, visit Westfield, Pittsfield during two-day campaign swing in Western Massachusetts\", Springfield Republican, August 4, 2012 Taking issue with her opponent Scott Brown's heavy focus on calling her Native American heritage into question, Swan supported Warren.Levenson, Michael. \"Black clergy in Boston endorse Warren\", Boston Globe Swan's meeting with Warren also garnered support for her by other prominent clergy.Rizzuto, Robert. \"Elizabeth Warren gets endorsement from Archbishop Timothy Paul Baymon following meeting with black clergy in Springfield\", Springfield Republican, August 6, 2012 Upon U.S. Senator John Kerry's confirmation as Secretary of State under the administration of President Barack Obama, Ed Markey sought Swan's support in his bid to win the vacated senate seat. Swan organized a meeting between Markey and area clergy and noted that the meeting was \"substantive and informative.\"Rizzuto, Robert. \"Rep. Ed Markey's Senate campaign gets consideration from Rev. Talbert Swan, black clergy in Springfield\", Springfield Republican, February 19, 2013 Swan played a similar role in vetting the positions of candidates for Hampden County District Attorney andBarry Stephanie. \"Hampden district attorney candidates field questions at NAACP forum in Springfield\", Springfield Republican, June 26, 2014 Hampden County Sheriff.Young, Shannon. \"Hampden County sheriff candidates talk hiring practices, need for change in NAACP- sponsored debate\", Springfield Republican, June 28, 2016 During the 2016 presidential election, Swan reportedly joined more than two dozen national black leaders in challenging Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's stance on issues related to so-called \"religious freedom.\"Young, Shannon. \"Bishop Talbert Swan, black leaders take aim at Hillary Clinton's 'religious freedom' stance\", Springfield Republican, November 1, 2016 ===Same-sex marriage=== Swan made national headlines in 2003 by taking issue with the comparison of the fight to legalize same-sex marriage with the civil rights struggle.Lindsay, Jay. \"Black conservatives oppose gay marriage Reject parallels with civil rights movement\", Boston Globe, November 29, 2003 He is the editor of the controversial book Closing the Closet: Testimonies of Deliverance from Homosexuality, a book that details the testimonies of 23 individuals, including Darryl L. Foster and Alan Chambers, former president of Exodus International, claiming to no longer be homosexual as a result of their religious experience. Gay activist Wayne Besen criticized the book and accused Swan of taking material from his booklet, Finally Free, stating, \"I am horrified that this book pilfered 'Finally Free' and twisted the original idea to support ex-gay propaganda.\" Swan, responding to Besen's criticism, noted \"First, I never even heard of his work 'Finally Free' until I read his obviously angry critique of 'Closing the Closet', therefore, how could I have 'pilfered and twisted' something I have never read nor ever knew existed?\" According to Sam Brownback, former U.S. Senator and Governor of Kansas, Swan is among a growing number of African American leaders speaking out and \"working to prevent promoters of same-sex marriage from hijacking the civil rights movement.\"Brownback, Sam. From Power to Purpose: A Remarkable Journey of Faith and Compassion, Nashville: Thomas Nelson, 2007, 85. Peter Sprigg, author and Senior Fellow for Policy Studies at the Family Research Council quoted Swan as stating that homosexuals will never face the kind of profiling African Americans face.Sprigg, Peter. Outrage: How Gay Activists and Liberal Judges are Trashing Democracy to Redefine Marriage, Washington, DC: Regnery Publishing, 2004, 53. Swan has opposed the comparison between the civil rights movement and the fight to legalize same-sex marriage noting that blacks were lynched, denied property rights, and declared inhuman.Lindsay, Jay. \"Black conservatives oppose gay marriage Reject parallels with civil rights movement\", The Boston Globe, November 29, 2003.
