It would run into financial difficulties in the 1990s and he would sell it to Alan Stockmeister, a Jackson native who own owned many local area businesses, including the local newspaper. Stockmeister would rename the precious metals refinery, Ohio Precious Metals. Stockmeister said success would not be defined in terms of dollars and profits, but in terms of creating jobs for the Appalachia Ohio region. In April of 2012 Ohio Precious Metals LLC (\"OPM\") entered into an agreement with NTR Metals to acquire the assets and use of the name NTR Metals.
