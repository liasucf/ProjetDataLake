Rajkumar (Dinesh), who is in love with his colleague Kavya (Nivetha Pethuraj), is reluctant to marry her, owing to her superior economic background, so much so that he delays talks of marriage. This causes a strain in their relationship, and they ultimately break up with Kavya agreeing to marry a guy of her father's choice. Lakshmi (Miya) is visited by several suitors, and every one of them is rejected by her father (Nagineedu), whose greediness makes him wait every time for a suitor who is per the family's status. One guy, Mukundan (Abhinav), likes her, but his family rejects her due to her family's low status. In spite of that, Mukundan convinces Lakshmi to come to his place to get married. She does so, but in the bus stand, Mukundan's family spots both of them and drags Mukundan back home, not before insulting Lakshmi. With a heavy heart, she boards a bus to return to her place. Susheela's (Riythvika) family has been trying to get her married for the past few years, but none of them seems interested in her citing looks, job, and so on. This makes her quite an introvert, and the only person who understands her is her colleague Sathish (Ramesh Thilak). Bhaskar (Lingesh) agrees to marry Susheela but gets cold feet and ends up canceling the marriage, insulting Susheela every time she demands an explanation. Finally, Susheela's brother Raghavendran (Karunakaran) convinces Bhaskar to agree to marry Susheela, but she rejected the marriage because she is now in love with Sathish. Kavya's wedding is fixed with the guy, but on the day before her marriage, Raj, who travels along with Shoulder (Bala Saravanan) in a car to the venue, avoids crashing into Lakshmi (who is on her return journey to her place and alights the bus to have coffee) and diverts the car because of which another relative of Kavya's fiancee (who travels in the same road in another car) to ram on the road and die instantly. Due to this, Kavya is labeled as bad luck, and her marriage is called off. Raj arrives on time at the venue, but before that, her parents ask to call Raj but she refuses saying that she wished to marry Raj with the intention of love ad she doesn't want to marry him as an option. So Kavya chooses Sathish (one of her relatives) as her partner and marries to him. In the end, we see Raj getting engaged to Lakshmi after a year. ==Cast== * Dinesh as Rajkumar * Miya as Lakshmi * Nivetha Pethuraj as Kavya * Abhinav as Mukundan * Riythvika as Susheela * Lingesh as Bhaskar * Karunakaran as Raghavendran * Ramesh Thilak as Sathish * Bala Saravanan as Shoulder * Nagineedu as Lakshmi's father * Charle as Benjamin * Usha Elizabeth as Raghavendran and Susheela's mother * Vishalini as Lakshmi's sister * Swaminathan * E.
