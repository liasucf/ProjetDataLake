Originally construction had begun at Jack Lake, near the Bedford Rifle Range. Although surrounded by forest and far more isolated than the current site, affluent Bedford residents balked at the plan. In response, construction was halted and the province announced in October 1999 that the new site in Burnside had been chosen.\"Burnside Chosen for Jail, Hospital.\" Department of Justice.
