    "text": "Nuevo is a 2002 album by the Kronos Quartet composed entirely of music of Mexican origin. It was inspired by a number of visits made to Mexico by the quartet's violinist and founder, David Harrington, from 1995. The album was produced by Gustavo Santaolalla, David Harrington, and Judith Sherman, and co- produced by An\u00edbal Kerpel. It was released on CD by Elektra Records, and was nominated for a 2003 Latin Grammy award for \"Best Classical Album\" and a 2003 Grammy award for \"Best Classical Crossover Album\". The quartet performed the album live during 2002. == Carlos Garcia == A number of guest musicians feature, including Carlos Garcia, a one-armed street performer originally from Michoac\u00e1n, who makes music by blowing on the side of an ivy leaf, whom Harrington chanced upon in 1995 while Garcia was busking at the Z\u00f3calo in Mexico City. Harrington later found a CD, , which included a recording of Garcia, made on a sidewalk, performing the love song \"\". Kronos purchased the rights to reuse it from its Mexican record company, and overdubbed strings. They also played live accompaniment to the recording of Garcia in their 2002 concerts. In late 2002, it emerged that Garcia had not received his share of the payment made to the record company for the right to use the recording, and the quartet arranged a collection in his benefit. Garcia did not hear the finished recording until December 2002. == Remixes == The album's opening track, \"\", was remixed, separately, by Plankton Man, Murcof (aka \"Terrestre\") and Bostich, each members of the Nortec Collective. Plankton Man's dance mix was used to close the album. Four versions were issued as an EP: # (Bostich/Nortec Collective) - 4:48 # (Plankton Man Dance Mix) - 4:59 # (Terrestre) - 5:14 # (Plankton Man 6/8) - 5:03 == Tracklist == The album has 14 tracks: # (The Man from Sinaloa) - composed by Severiano Brise\u00f1o, arranged by Osvaldo Golijov # (It Was Easy for Me) (featuring Luanne Warner) - composed by Agust\u00edn Lara, arranged by Osvaldo Golijov # Mini Skirt - composed by Juan Garc\u00eda Esquivel, arranged by Osvaldo Golijov # (Crying) (featuring Alejandro Flores and Efr\u00e9n Vargas) - Traditional (Son Huasteco), arranged by Osvaldo Golijov # (Perfidy) (featuring Carlos Garcia) - composed by Alberto Dom\u00ednguez, arranged by Stephen Prutsman # (featuring Tambuco Percussion Ensemble) - composed by Silvestre Revueltas, arranged by Stephen Prutsman # K\u2019in Sventa Ch\u2019ul Me\u2019tik Kwadulupe (Festival for the Holy Mother Guadalupe) (featuring Luanne Warner, Rominko Patixtan Patixtan, Pegro Lunes Tak\u2019il Bek\u2019et, Carmen Gomez Oso, Xun Perez Hol Cotom, and Rominko Mendez Xik) - composed by Osvaldo Golijov # (featuring Luis Conte) - composed by Margarita Lecuona, arranged by Osvaldo Golijov # (Four Cornfields) - composed by Belisario Garc\u00eda de Jes\u00fas and Jos\u00e9 Elizondo, arranged by Stephen Prutsman # (featuring Gustavo Santaolalla) - medley of songs composed by Ludwig van Beethoven (\"Turkish March\", on which the theme tune of the Mexican comedy program El Chavo del Ocho was based), El Chapul\u00edn Colorado, and Roberto G\u00f3mez Bola\u00f1os, arranged by Ricardo Gallardo # (featuring Ariel Guzik) - composed by Ariel Guzik, arranged by Kronos Quartet # - composed by Chalino S\u00e1nchez, arranged by Osvaldo Golijov # 12/12 (featuring Caf\u00e9 Tacuba - composed by Caf\u00e9 Tacuba, arranged by Osvaldo Golijov # (Dance Mix) - Remix by Plankton Man == Musicians == The Kronos Quartet's line-up at the time was: * David Harrington - violin * John Sherba - violin * Hank Dutt - viola * Jennifer Culp - cello === Guest musicians === Other performers on the album include: * Luanne Warner, marimba * Alejandro Flores, vocals, violin * Efr\u00e9n Vargas, vocals * Carlos Garcia, musical leaf * Tambuco Percussion Ensemble **Ricardo Gallardo **Alfredo Bringas **Cl\u00e1udia Oliveira **Ra\u00fal Tud\u00f3n * Rominko Patixtan Patixtan, arpa * Pegro Lunes Tak\u2019il Bek\u2019et, vob * Carmen Gomez Oso, vocals * Xun Perez Hol Cotom, vocals * Rominko Mendez Xik, vocals * Luis Conte, percussion * Ariel Guzik, plasmaht * Gustavo Santaolalla, toys, percussion * Caf\u00e9 Tacuba ** Ritacantalagua, electric guitar **Emmanuel, programming, keyboards, jarana **Quique, jarana, concha, programming **Joselo, electric guitar **Alejandro Flores, violin, requinto == References == == External links == * * NPR interview by John Ydstie, with David Harrington and Gustavo Santaolalla Category:Kronos Quartet albums Category:2002 albums Category:Mexican music ",
