    "text": "The British space rock group Hawkwind have been active since 1969, but their earliest video release is Night Of The Hawk from their Earth Ritual Tour recorded at Ipswich on 9 March 1984. Since then, there have been numerous video releases covering the evolution of the band; some are professional broadcast shoots, others commercial, and a few are amateur. There have also been some live video shoots of the band during the 1970s, although none have seen a commercial release. These include an early 12 April 1970 The Roundhouse, London performance and a Hawklords performance at Brunel University, Uxbridge on 24 November 1978. The Hawkestra event, a reunion featuring appearances from all past and present members on 21 October 2000 at the Brixton Academy, was professionally filmed but disputes between band members would indicate any forthcoming release unlikely.The Saga of Hawkwind, Chapter 30: The Great Hawkestra Disaster \u2014 Carol Clerk ==Promotional== ===Space Ritual=== *Tracks: \"Silver Machine\"; \"Urban Guerilla\" *Personnel: Robert Calvert \u2013 Vocals; Dave Brock \u2013 Guitar, Vocals; Lemmy \u2013 Bass, Vocals; Nik Turner \u2013 Flute, Saxophone; Del Dettmar \u2013 Electronics; Dik Mik \u2013 Electronics; Simon King \u2013 Drums; Stacia \u2013 Dancing *Recorded: Dunstable Civic Hall, 7 July 1972; Empire Pool, Wembley, 27 May 1973 *Released: June 2007, EMI Remasters [2CD+DVD] *Notes: \"Silver Machine\" recorded for the BBC television programme Top of the Pops.
