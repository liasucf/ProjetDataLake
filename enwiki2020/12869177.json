    "text": "Sport Lisboa e Benfica, commonly known as Benfica, is a professional basketball team based in Lisbon, Portugal, who play in the Liga Portuguesa de Basquetebol (LPB). In June 2007, the club decided to leave the professional top league, then known as LCB, and join the Proliga, a league organized by the Portuguese Basketball Federation. From 2008 onwards, they returned to the LPB after the federation took over the realms of the competition. Founded in 1927, Benfica is the most successful Portuguese club, having the record for most championships, cups, league cups, super cups, and other national competitions, with a total of 80 domestic titles. It is also the Portuguese team that advanced the furthest in the European top club championship, now known as the EuroLeague. Some of their most memorable moments were European victories against clubs that have won the Euroleague, such as Virtus Bologna, Real Madrid, Cant\u00f9, Cibona, Joventut Badalona, Panathinaikos, Partizan, CSKA Moscow or Varese. Despite basketball not being nearly as popular as football among the Portuguese population, Benfica has a major rivalry with FC Porto in this sport, rivalry which was interrupted from 2012 to 2015. Along with its several junior teams that play in their respective top division championships, Benfica also has a developmental basketball team, Benfica B, that plays in the Proliga, the second highest tier in Portugal after the LPB, in which the main team competes. ==History== ===Early years=== Created on 20 March 1927, the basketball team followed the steps of many other sports that were supported by the club, achieving great success almost immediately. The team established itself as a main contender by the 1940s and during the whole 1960s gained the status of championship favourite and was already the club with the most titles won. By this time the club had won eight national championships and eight cups. This dominating spell decreased the following decade until the early 1980s. In this time-span Benfica could only win two championships, in the 1969\u201370 and the 1974\u201375 season, but won four national cups, the second most prestigious Portuguese tournament, in 1969\u201370, 1971\u201372, 1972\u201373 and 1973\u201374. After these years, Benfica again dominated the national scene. ===Golden years=== The most successful period of the club was between 1985 and 1995. In eleven seasons, the team won ten national titles, seven of which in a row, five national cups, five league cups and six super cups, achieving the best season ever by a Portuguese basketball team in 1994\u201395 winning the Portuguese League, Portuguese League Cup, Portuguese Super Cup, Portuguese Basketball Cup and finishing the European Champions' Cup in the Top 16. One of the highlight from that European Champions' Cup season was a 22-point victory (102\u201380) against CSKA Moscow in Lisbon on 12 January 1995. Benfica also made successful international campaigns in the other seasons considering the budget the team had compared with other European big teams. Some of the most successful of those campaigns include the 1993\u201394, when Benfica was close to reach the Top 8, and for a third season in a row Benfica managed to reach the Top 16 again in the European Champions' Cup, in 1995\u201396, grabbing a win against Panathinaikos, the eventual champions. ===Decline in the late 1990s=== This period was followed by a dark era in which Benfica was internally overshadowed by Ovarense, Portugal Telecom and FC Porto. Even though this period is considered to be a dark one, Benfica did manage to reach the LPB final once as well as winning Super Cups and finishing runners-up in the national cup and in the league cup. Also noteworthy is an away win against Real Madrid, in the 1996\u201397 EuroCup, the same season the Spaniards won the competition. The team finally decided to withdraw from the top tier and applied for the second league, the Proliga, which was the highest division run by the Federa\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa de Basquetebol. However the first division was folded and the LPB (league) was again being overviewed by the national federation. This allowed the team to make a comeback to the main league. ===Revival in the late 2000s=== After more than a decade without any titles and in the same season Benfica had made a return to the first league, the 2008\u201309 season, the team won the Portuguese League, with a perfect score of 100% wins during the regular season, becoming the second team in the world to do so, after Maccabi Tel Aviv in the 1970s, and thrashing Ovarense 4\u20130 in the best-of-four game final. Benfica won the championship again the following season with a 91% winning record in the regular stage and a 4\u20131 final against Porto. The recent success brought the team to participate in the EuroChallenge, thus marking the end of a mid-term long hiatus from Portuguese clubs in European basketball competitions. The following year, Benfica won the League Cup and the Super Cup but did not renew the championship as it lost 4\u20133 in the final to Porto. ===Recent years=== In the next season Benfica regained the title of Portuguese champion after defeating Porto in their home court Drag\u00e3o Caixa (53\u201356) in the last best-of-five series game following a 2\u20132 playoff tie. Benfica retained the title the following season, having only lost two games, one in the regular season, and the other in the play-off final, which they won 3\u20131 against Acad\u00e9mica de Coimbra, both defeats coming only in overtime. Overall Benfica won every title except the Cup, losing against Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es in the final, amassing only three losses in the entire season in all competitions. On 23 May 2014, Benfica defeated Vit\u00f3ria de Guimar\u00e3es (3\u20130) and conquered its 25th champions title (third consecutive), completing the domestic treble of League, Portuguese Cup and Hugo dos Santos Cup. In this season they won a total of 4 titles (including the 2013 Super Cup). In the 2014\u201315 season, Benfica returned to the European competitions, playing in EuroChallenge where they finished in third place of Group E. At domestic level, Benfica won all the five competitions. Starting the 2015\u201316 season, they won their fifth and fourth consecutive Ant\u00f3nio Pratas Trophy, setting a club record of ten consecutive Portuguese trophies won. They achieved the domestic treble of League Cup, Portuguese Cup, and league title the next season. ===Results in international competition=== Note: Benfica score is always listed first. {|
