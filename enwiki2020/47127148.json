    "text": "Citizens of Earth is a role-playing video game developed by Eden Industries and published by Atlus for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Wii U, and the Nintendo 3DS. Players take control of the newly elected Vice President of Planet Earth, who must save the Earth by recruiting citizens to fight for him. == Gameplay == Citizens of Earth has been described as \"a giant spoof on EarthBound\" in which \"you must collect your constituents like Pok\u00e9mon\". In it, you take the role of the newly elected Vice President of Earth, who begins his first day in office facing protestors, a missing President, and a suspicious coffee shop. As the game progresses, characters are added to the party, each with a unique title and personality, like Hippie Guy and Programmer. Enemies are strewn about the overworld map, and should the Vice President get too close, a separate battle screen will open up. He doesn't do any fighting himself, but instead gives commands to his party of up to three characters. == Reception == Meghan Sullivan of IGN gave the game a 6.5/10, saying \"It charmed me with its blend of old-school RPG and contemporary satire, but nearly lost my vote with its sluggish pacing, irritatingly high enemy encounter rate, and crashes\". == External links == * == References == Category:2015 video games Category:Atlus games Category:Unsuccessful Kickstarter campaigns Category:Nintendo 3DS games Category:Nintendo 3DS eShop games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Vita games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Wii U games Category:Wii U eShop games Category:Windows games ",
