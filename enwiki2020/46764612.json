This painting by Hooch was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1908, who wrote; \"254. THE CARD-PLAYERS. Sm. 48. ; de G. 41.Comparative table of catalog entries between John Smith's first Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Hooch and Hofstede de Groot's first list of Hooch paintings published in Oud Holland In the right-hand corner of a room with a wooden ceiling and a tiled floor a young lady and a gentleman are playing cards at a table, while two other gentlemen look on. The lady, seated on the right, is about to play a card from her hand. On her right stands a cavalier, holding a pipe in his right hand ; he wears a plumed hat and a doublet of light grey with pink ribbons ; a grey cloak hangs upon a peg to the right. To the right of the lady sits another cavalier with cards in his hand, who glances up at the gentleman. A third young man, bareheaded and seen in full light, sits, with his back half-turned to the spectator, at the right-hand front corner of the table, drinking a glass of wine ; he wears a black velvet jacket, yellow stockings, and high-heeled shoes. By the wall to the right is a couch with red velvet cushions. The room is flooded with light from a large window, divided into four compartments, behind the group. To the left an open door looks into a courtyard, through which a servant-girl comes with a jug and some pipes. Behind her is a house with a passage leading into a garden. This is one of the finest of the master's works. \" The extraordinary luminous effect which pervades this picture renders it the admiration of every beholder. It is painted with singular mastery of hand, and exhibits throughout a consummate knowledge of the principles of art \" (Sm.). Signed and dated 1658 ; canvas, 30 inches by 25 1/2 inches.
