    "text": "Jean Eustache (; 30 November 1938 - 5 November 1981) was a French filmmaker. During his short career, he completed numerous short films, in addition to a pair of highly regarded features, of which the first, The Mother and the Whore, is considered a key work of post-Nouvelle Vague French cinema.The Way We Are, by Jonathan Rosenbaum In his obituary for Eustache, the critic Serge Daney wrote: > In the thread of the desolate 70s, his films succeeded one another, always > unforeseen, without a system, without a gap: film-rivers, short films, TV > programs, hyperreal fiction. Each film went to the end of its material, from > real to fictional sorrow. It was impossible for him to go against it, to > calculate, to take cultural success into account, impossible for this > theoretician of seduction to seduce an audience. Jim Jarmusch dedicated his 2005 film Broken Flowers to Eustache. ==Biography== Eustache was born in Pessac, Gironde, France into a working class family. Relatively little information exists about Eustache\u2019s life prior to the time he became a member of the Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma coterie in the late fifties, though it is known that he was largely self-educated and worked in the railroad service prior to becoming a filmmaker.Dryden Theatre: The Rediscovery of Jean Eustache Information suggests that the mystery surrounding his youth was intentional, with sources stating that \"during his lifetime Eustache published little information about his early years, indicating that he felt no nostalgia for an unhappy childhood.\"John Wakeman World Film Directors, Vol. 2 Though not a member of the Nouvelle vague, Eustache maintained ties to it, appearing as an actor in Jean-Luc Godard's Week EndIMDB Jean Eustache and editing Luc Moullet's Une aventure de Billy le Kid, which starred Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud (the lead in Eustache's The Mother and the Whore). After becoming a filmmaker, Eustache maintained close ties to his friends and relatives in Pessac.La Peine Perdue de Jean Eustache, directed by Angel Diaz In 1981, he was partially immobilized in an auto accident. He killed himself by gunshotFilm Reference in his Paris apartment, a few weeks before his 43rd birthday. Eustache had a son, Boris Eustache (b. 1960), who worked on his father's second feature and appears as an actor in Eustache's short film Les Photos d'Alix. == Work == Eustache was quoted as saying, \"The films I made are as autobiographical as fiction can be\".Tisch Film Review -- Coming Soon To This Screen: Rare And Important French Films Because of his reluctance to discuss his personal life, it is assumed that his body of work was largely autobiographical. Besides his fictional shorts and features, Eustache made numerous documentaries, many of them very personal, including several shot in his hometown of Pessac and a feature-length interview with his grandmother. Eustache directed two narrative features. The Mother and the Whore (La maman et la putain), the first, is a 217-minute rumination on love, relationships, men and women. The film's central three-way romance plot focuses on Alexandre (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud), his girlfriend Marie (Bernadette Lafont) and the nurse he meets and falls in love with, Veronika (Fran\u00e7oise Lebrun). Writing in Time Out New York, Andrew Johnston described his experience in viewing the film in 1999: Eustache's second feature, My Little Loves (Mes petites amoureuses, 1974), was intentionally different from his debut. Shot in color by cinematographer Nestor Almendros (as opposed to The Mother and the Whore's grainy black-and-white), the film also features significantly less dialogue and focuses on teenage characters in a rural setting. The film was entered into the 9th Moscow International Film Festival. Eustache appeared as an actor in The American Friend (1977). === Remakes and serial works === Eustache admired the documentary qualities of early actuality films, and frequently cited the Lumiere Brothers as influences. He made two films about a religious parade in Pessac, both titled La Rosi\u00e8re de Pessac, in 1968 and 1979, and remade his short Une sale histoire twice. Regarding the tendency to re-examine in Eustache's work, the American film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote: \"An obsessive-compulsive filmmaker and clearly a tormented one who wound up dying by his own hand, Eustache was clearly experimenting with his variations as well as goading viewers into examining their own reactions to them\".Notes on JonathanRosenbaum.net: Notes on Reading, Watching, Looking, and Listening ==Filmography== ===Features=== *1973 La Maman et la putain (220 minutes) *1974 Mes petites amoureuses (120 minutes) ===Shorts and other work=== *1961 La soir\u00e9e (unfinished) *1963 Les Mauvaises Fr\u00e9quentations (42 minutes), aka Du c\u00f4t\u00e9 de Robinson & Bad Company *1966 Le P\u00e8re No\u00ebl a les yeux bleus (47 minutes) *1968 La Rosi\u00e8re de Pessac (65 minutes) *1969 Sur Le dernier des hommes de Murnau (26 minutes) (TV movie) *1969 A propos de La petite marchande d'allumettes de Jean Renoir (26 minutes) (TV movie) *1970 Le Cochon (65 minutes), directed with Jean-Michel Barjol *1971 Num\u00e9ro z\u00e9ro (110 minutes) *1977 Une sale histoire (50 minutes) *1979 La Rosi\u00e8re de Pessac (67 minutes) *1980 Les Photos d'Alix (18 minutes) *1980 Le Jardin des d\u00e9lices de J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bosch (34 minutes) *1980 Offre d'emploi (18 minutes) ==References== == External links == * * Biography on newwavefilm.com * Desire & Despair: The Cinema of Jean Eustache by Jared Rapfogel * He stands alone: Sight & Sound online feature on Eustache's career * The Thread - obituary Category:1938 births Category:1981 deaths Category:French film directors Category:Film directors who committed suicide Category:Male suicides Category:Suicides in France ",
