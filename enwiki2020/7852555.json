It is a wild wind in Assam, that marks the incoming monsoon season, as it is accompanied with heavy showers and strong wind causing widespread damage. ==Legend== Legend compares it to a young, married woman who in a hurry to fly back to her maternal place destroys literally everything on her path; Bordoisila comes to Assam. The word \"Bordoisila\" is derived from the Bodo word \"Bardoisikla\". Bardoisikhla breaks down to \"Bar-\" meaning wind, \"-doi-\" means water and \"-sikhla\" means girl in Bodo language. It represents the mythological Goddess of Nature, and it marks the beginning of the festival month of Bwishagu (Spring season). Bardwisikhla is also a dance-form popularly known as Bagurumba. \"......nalbirinar paah, brahmaputrot halise jalise, boga koi bogoli nil aakaxot urise, aahise bohagi tai maa'kor ghoroloi bordoisila hoi...........\" As the folk song says \"bohag\", the spring season comes to her mothers place, Assam disguised as Bordoisila. So it may be \"... gathering of cloud like a big kite...\" since \"-doi-\" also means curd and resembles cloud. And also may be \"...a big kite running...\" as \"-doi-\" can also be related with the word 'doura' which means running. ==Onset of spring== Whatever the meaning be, Bordoisila brings in with it \"Bohag\", the spring season of merriment and celebration, making the entire state dress up its newest green and flavor. The blooming \"kopow\" (orchid) flowers and the shrill calls of the cuckoo makes people of Assam; Axomiya dance with the rhythms of 'dhol', 'pepa', 'gogona'......... creating waves of \"Bihu\" from Sadiya in the east to Dhubri in far west. ==References== Category:Culture of Assam ",
