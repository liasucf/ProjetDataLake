As Elena Grishina, the noted Soviet fencer, recalls: In 1990, she won the \"Russian Cup,\" an international tournament in foil fencing for women held in Moscow, where the highest award was reserved for the foil fencer who did not lose a single bout. A year later, she again won the same cup. Seven weeks before the Olympics in Barcelona, Anja gave birth to her son Lauren. She followed her husband Merten Mauritz to Austria and changed her name to Fichtel-Mauritz. She still represented Germany at the team Olympics and took second place behind the Italian team. The Russians met Fichtel in Moscow in 1993. At the \u201cRussian Cup\u201d, she lost to Diane Byakendy and took second place. In March 1997, she announced her retirement, and in October of the same year she gave birth to her second baby, and in 2007 her third child was born. Her elder son Lauren has also taken up fencing. == Palmar\u00e8s == :Image:Med 1.png 1985 Junior World Fencing Championships, foil, individual and team :Image:Med 1.png 1986 World Fencing Championships, foil, individual :Image:Med 1.png 1988 Junior World Fencing Championships, foil, individual :Image:Med 1.png 1988 Olympic Games, foil, individual and team :Image:Med 2.png 1989 World Fencing Championships, foil, individual :Image:Med 1.png 1989 World Fencing Championships, foil, team :Image:Med 1.png 1990 World Fencing Championships, foil, individual :Image:Med 2.png 1992 Olympic Games, foil, team :Image:Med 1.png 1993 World Fencing Championships, foil, team ==References== ==External links== * \"For Future of Fencing\" International Charity Fund website (original source of this article) * Palmar\u00e8s of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale d'Escrime Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:People from Tauberbischofsheim Category:German female fencers Category:Olympic fencers of West Germany Category:Olympic fencers of Germany Category:Olympic gold medalists for West Germany Category:Olympic silver medalists for Germany Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Germany Category:Fencers at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Fencers at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Fencers at the 1996 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic medalists in fencing Category:Medalists at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1996 Summer Olympics ",
