    "text": "In mathematics, an induced character is the character of the representation V of a finite group G induced from a representation W of a subgroup H \u2264 G. More generally, there is also a notion of induction \\operatorname{Ind}(f) of a class function f on H given by the formula :\\operatorname{Ind}(f)(s) = \\frac{1}{|H|} \\sum_{t \\in G,\\ t^{-1} st \\in H} f(t^{-1} st). If f is a character of the representation W of H, then this formula for \\operatorname{Ind}(f) calculates the character of the induced representation V of G.. Translated from the second French edition by Leonard L. Scott. The basic result on induced characters is Brauer's theorem on induced characters. It states that every irreducible character on G is a linear combination with integer coefficients of characters induced from elementary subgroups. == References == Category:Group theory ",
