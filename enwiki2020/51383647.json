    "text": "Andreas Oswald (also: Johann Andreas Uswalt or U\u00dfwaldt, baptised 9 December 1634, Weimar - 1665, Eisenach) was a German organist and composer of the baroque period. == Life == Born in Weimar, Andreas Oswald was the son of Andreas Oswald Sr., who was the court organist there. In 1643, it is presumed that he moved to Eisenach where his father had gained the position of town organist. At the age of 15, Andreas Jr. was hired as court organist in Weimar, the position which his father had once held. Thus, he was one of Johann Sebastian Bach's predecessors. After the court orchestra was disbanded in 1662, forced to seek employment elsewhere, Oswald obtained the position as town organist in Eisenach, succeeding his father who had recently died. Although employed as an organist, he obtained a reputation in Eisenach as a virtuoso performer on the violin and other instruments. He remained in Eisenach until his death in 1665, aged 30. He was succeeded by Johann Christoph Bach, the uncle of Johann Sebastian Bach.Michael Fuerst: CD booklet Andreas Oswald: Sonaten, Chelycus-Ensemble, Organumm Classics 261036, 2006 We owe the survival of all but one of Oswald's surviving works to the efforts of Jakob Ludwig, who in 1662, compiled the Partiturbuch Ludwig, a manuscript of 100 instrumental works as a birthday gift to his employer Duke August II of Braunschweig-Wolfenb\u00fcttel. With seventeen pieces included in the manuscript, he is the most represented composer in the collection.Michael Fuerst: The Partiturbuch Ludwig: An Introduction and Thematic Catalogue . In: The Viola da Gamba Society Journal. Vol. 4, 2010, S. 74-102 (PDF; 6,9 MB) His Aria Variata included in Partiturbuch Ludwig, based on a song-like melody, can be counted among the significant German Trio Sonatas of the period.Comments from Michael Fuerst in the CD booklet Andreas Oswald: Sonaten, Chelycus-Ensemble, Organum Classics 261036, 2006 == Works == * Sonata for 3 violins and continuo, manuscript in the D\u00fcben collection of Uppsala University Library.Digital copy at the website of Uppsala Universitet.
