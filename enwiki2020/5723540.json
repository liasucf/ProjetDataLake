Gall Jr.; February 12, 1902 \u2013 February 5, 1987) was an American stage performer, producer, and a film actor who in the silent and sound eras was cast in no less than 89 motion pictures. ==Biography== William Collier (nicknamed \"Buster\") was born in New York City. When his parents divorced, his mother, the actress Paula Marr, remarried the actor William Collier Sr. who adopted Charles (the two did share a resemblance) and gave the boy the new name William Collier Jr. Collier's acting experience in childhood, having first appeared on stage at age seven, helped him get his first movie role at age 14 in The Bugle Call (1916). He later became a popular leading man in the 1920s and successfully made the transition from silent into sound film. Nevertheless, he retired from acting in 1935, and in 1937 traveled to England to work as a movie producer. He returned to the United States in the late 1940s and began producing drama series for television. In February 1960, in recognition of his contributions to the entertainment industry, Collier received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Collier & Catherine Calvert in The Heart of Maryland (1921) Collier died in San Francisco on February 5, 1987, just a week before his 85th birthday. ==Selected filmography as an actor== * The Bugle Call (1916) - Billy Andrews * Never Again (1916, Short) * Back Stage (1919, Short) - Minor Role (uncredited) * The Servant Question (1920) - Jack Merrick * The Soul of Youth (1920) - Dick Armstrong * Everybody's Sweetheart (1920) - John * The Heart of Maryland (1921) - Lloyd Calvert * The Girl from Porcupine (1921) - Jim McTvish * At the Stage Door (1921) - Arthur Bates * Cardigan (1922) - Michael Cardigan * The Good Provider (1922) - Izzy Binswanger * The Secrets of Paris (1922) - Fran\u00e7ois * Enemies of Women (1923) - Gaston * Sinner or Saint (1923) - Young Artist * Loyal Lives (1923) - Terrence * The Age of Desire (1923) - Ranny - Age 21 * Pleasure Mad (1923) - Howard Benton * Leave It to Gerry (1924) - Dan Forbes * Fools Highway (1924) - Max Davidson * The Sea Hawk (1924) - Marsak * Wine of Youth (1924) - Max Cooper * The Mine with the Iron Door (1924) - Chico * Great Diamond Mystery (1924) - Perry Standish * The Lighthouse by the Sea (1924) - Bob Dorn * The Devil's Cargo (1925) - John Joyce * The Reckless Sex (1925) - Juan * Eve's Secret (1925) - Pierre * The Verdict (1925) - Jimmy Mason * Playing with Souls (1925) - Matthew Dale Jr. * The Wanderer (1925) - Jether * The Lucky Lady (1926) - Clarke * The Rainmaker (1926) - Bobby Robertson * The Lady of the Harem (1926) - Rafi * God Gave Me Twenty Cents (1926) - Barney Tapman * Just Another Blonde (1926) - Scotty * The Broken Gate (1927) - Don Lane * Backstage (1927) - Owen Mackay * Convoy (1927) - John Dodge * The Sunset Derby (1927) - Jimmy Burke * Dearie (1927) - Stephen Darling * Stranded (1927) - Johnny Nash * The Desired Woman (1927) - Lieutenant Larry Trent * The College Widow (1927) - Billy Bolton * So This Is Love?
