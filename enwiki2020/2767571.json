    "text": "Ben Vorlich (Scottish Gaelic: Beinn Mh\u00f9rlaig) is a mountain located in the southern part of the Highlands of Scotland. Due to its prominence when seen from the lower ground of the Central Belt, Ben Vorlich is one of the most commonly seen of Munros, Scotland's peaks of 3000ft height or above. It lies in an area of land bounded to the north by Loch Earn, and to the west by Loch Lubnaig. The town of Callander lies to the south. Ben Vorlich is most frequently climbed from Ardvorlich to the north. A path leads up Glen Vorlich, and then heads for the mountain's northern ridge. The summit lies 4 km from Ardvorlich. Many walkers then continue on to the neighbouring hill, St\u00f9c a' Chroin, by way of Ben Vorlich's south west ridge. Return to Ardvorlich can be made without re-ascending Ben Vorlich, as a path leads from the bealach between the two hills round Ben Vorlich's northwestern slope to meet the main ascent path. Other possible routes from the southern side allow one to ascend Ben Vorlich by way of its southeastern ridge. This can be accessed either from Glen Artney to the southeast or Callander to the south. ==References== ==External links== *Ben Vorlich Routes from Lochearn Routes and images on Ben Vorlich *Computer generated summit panoramas NorthSouth index St\u00f9c a' Chroin and Ben Vorlich from Newburgh, Fife Category:Mountains and hills of the Southern Highlands Category:Marilyns of Scotland Category:Munros Category:Mountains and hills of Stirling (council area) Category:Mountains and hills of Perth and Kinross ",
