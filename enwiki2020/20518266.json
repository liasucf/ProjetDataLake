Released theatrically on May 9, 1955, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal International. ==Plot== Professor Dingledong the taxidermist school instructor is about to teach his students \"how to stuff a woodpecker\". For this purpose, he goes to a jail-like room with cells holding various animals, and from one of these cells, he picks Woody. Escaping the nutty taxidermist's clutches, Woody is pursued by the school guard dog, Strongnose the bloodhound. Throughout the cartoon, the bloodhound attempts to capture Woody, but with no success. The chase leads through a hollow log, a railroad tunnel, an alley, a door factory and an ice machine. Finally, he returns the taxidermy school, where the instructor threatens to stuff the bloodhound for his failure. Woody intervenes, and he and Strongnose team up and lock up the professor, with plans to stuff him. ==Notes== *Private Eye Pooch marks the first appearance of Woody's recurring opponent Professor Dingledong, voiced by Dal McKennon. ==References== *Cooke, Jon, Komorowski, Thad, Shakarian, Pietro, and Tatay, Jack. \"1955\".
