    "text": "The \u00c9ridan is a two-stage French sounding rocket, which resulted from the use of the Stromboli engine of the Dragon and/or Dauphin as first and second stage. It belonged thereby to a family of solid-propellant rockets from the Belier (rocket), the Centaure (rocket), to the Dragon, the Dauphin and the Eridan. As the most powerful version of this series it could lift payloads from 100 to 420 kg to heights of 200 to a maximum of 460 km. Its climbing time is between 230 and 350 seconds.Les d\u00e9buts de la recherche spatiale fran\u00e7aise 2846082154 IFHE,, Institut fran\u00e7ais d'histoire de l'espace - 2007 Int\u00e9ress\u00e9s, ils demand\u00e8rent au CNES d'envisager s\u00e9rieusement un projet d'astronomie spatiale d'envergure qui serait r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par quelque soixante fus\u00e9es-sondes \u00c9ridan (ou de la classe \u00c9ridan). The main launch site was Kourou, but the first start on 26 September 1968 from this site failed. Twelve additional launches took the rocket to altitudes of 196 \u2013 420 km between 12 April 1969 and 14 November 1979. Two copies were launched in January and February 1975 off the Kerguelen Islands. ==References== *http://fuseurop.univ- perp.fr/sudav_e.htm ==Other links== * Eridanos Category:1974 in spaceflight Category:Sounding rockets of France ",
