    "text": "Samut Songkhram ( (Pronunciation)) is the capital of Samut Songkhram Province. == Etymology == The word \"samut\" originates from the Sanskrit word \"samudra\" meaning \"ocean\", and the word \"songkhram\" from the Sanskrit \"sangrama\" meaning \"war\". Hence the name of the province literally means \"war ocean\". ==Geography== Samut Songkhram is at the mouth of the Mae Klong River to the Gulf of Thailand. By means of canals (khlong) the water of the river is spread through the province for irrigation. At the coast are many evaporation ponds for producing sea salt. ==History== In the Ayutthaya period the area of Samut Songkhram was known as Suan Nok (Thai \u0e2a\u0e27\u0e19\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e01, \"outer garden\") and was administrated by Ratchaburi. During the reign of King Taksin it became a province. It was the birthplace of Queen Amarindra of King Rama I, who also initiated the name Suan Nok. The birthplace of King Rama II in Amphawa District is now a memorial park. ==Notable people== Muay Thai fighter Apidej Sit-Hirun. ==References== ==External links== * ==Gallery== Category:Populated places in Samut Songkhram Province ",
