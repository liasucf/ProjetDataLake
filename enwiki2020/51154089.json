    "text": "Blackrod was, from 1872 to 1974, a local government district centred on the village of Blackrod in the administrative county of Lancashire, England. ==History== Blackrod was a township and chapelry in the civil and ecclesiastical parish of Bolton le Moors in the Salford Hundred of Lancashire. The township became part of the Wigan Poor Law Union on 1 February 1837 which took responsibility for funding the Poor Law within that Union area. In 1866, Blackrod was given the status of a civil parish. A resolution for the adoption of the Local Government Act 1858 was passed on 9 May 1872 by the owners and ratepayers of the township of Blackrod, and a local board was created to provide for the water supply and drainage of the township. After the Public Health Act 1875 was passed by Parliament in that year, Blackrod Local Board assumed extra duties as an urban sanitary district, although the Local Board's title did not change. Following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1894, Blackrod Local Board was transformed into an elected urban district council of nine members. Blackrod Urban District Council had three electoral wards: Central, North, and South, each represented by three councillors. Under the Local Government Act 1972, Blackrod Urban District was abolished on 1 April 1974 and its former area became a successor parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Bolton in Greater Manchester. ==Demography== ==Lists of office holders== ===Chairmen of Blackrod Local Board=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 95%;\" |- !colspan=\"5\"|Chairmen of Blackrod Local Board |- !colspan=2|Name !!Party !!Tenure !!class=unsortable|Notes |- | style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF\" | | || \u2014 || || He was later Medical Officer of Health for Blackrod Local Board. |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Conservative || || He was a member the first Board of Governors of Rivington and Blackrod Grammar School in 1875. |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Conservative || || Last Chairman of Blackrod Local Board. |-class=\"sortbottom\" | colspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" class=unsortable | Source(s): |} ===Chairmen of Blackrod Urban District Council=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 95%;\" |- !colspan=\"5\"|Chairmen of Blackrod Urban District Council |- !colspan=2|Name !!Party !!Tenure !!class=unsortable|Notes |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Conservative || || First Chairman of Blackrod Urban District Council. |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Liberal || || Previously Chairman of Westhoughton Local Board: 1893-94. |- | style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF\" | | || \u2014 || || Also was Vicar of St Katharine's Church, Blackrod: 1900\u20131911. |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Liberal || || 1st term. |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Labour || || |- | style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF\" | | || \u2014 || || |- | style=\"background- color: \" | | || Conservative || || |- | style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF\" | | || \u2014 || || |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Independent || || 1st term. |- | style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF\" | | || \u2014 || || |- | style=\"background- color:#FFFFFF\" | | || \u2014 || || |- | style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF\" | | || \u2014 || || |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Liberal || || 2nd term. |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Independent || || 2nd term. |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Labour || || 1st term. |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Independent || || |- | style=\"background- color: \" | | || Independent || || 1st term. |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Labour || || 1st term. |- | style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF\" | | || \u2014 || || |- | style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF\" | | || \u2014 || || |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Liberal || || 3rd term. |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Labour || || 2nd term. |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Independent || || 3rd term. |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Conservative || || 2nd term. |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Labour || || 2nd term. |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Conservative || || 1st term. |- | style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF\" | | || \u2014 || || 1st term. |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Labour || || 3rd term. |- | style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF\" | | || \u2014 || || |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Conservative || || 3rd term. |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Labour || || 3rd term. |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Conservative || || 1st term. |- | style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF\" | | || \u2014 || || 2nd term. |- | style=\"background-color: \" | | || Labour || || 4th term.
