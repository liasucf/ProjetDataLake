    "text": "Ultrademon, aka Lily aka Lilium Kobayashi, Seapunk originator and creator within the broader Seapunk community, is credited with developing the genre with its first record label and pushing it into the mainstream. Drawing upon influences from advertising, demonology, and post-apocalyptic landscapes, Ultrademons contributions to Seapunk would define the genre and later be seen once more within the evolution of the genre in the form of Vaporwave. Her music has been described as \"hyperreal\" and seems to be a progenitor of electronic music in the 2010s. Ultrademon gained significant notoriety with the rapid rise and fall of Seapunk as a genre, with a significant peak in the genre's interest arriving with Rihanna's usage of Seapunk aesthetics on her SNL performance in 2012. Shortly after Ultrademon would become the poster-girl of the Seapunk genre, being featured in numerous publications, including the New York Times \"The Little Mermaid goes Punk\", and similar to Grunge music, breaching the mainstream in music with the underground. Ultrademon would continue to push the Seapunk brand and evolve the genre musically. Following the increase in popularity in Seapunk culture in 2012, Ultrademon released her first album (titled Seapunk) via Aphex Twin's Rephlex Records. Ultrademon would continue to see additional mainstream success and through this branding of Seapunk of a genre, can be seen as a significant individual in helping to breach internet micro-genres into the mainstream eye. Ultrademon reacted to her fame in a more complex manner, and in an interview with Vice magazine in the early 2010s, sees the success of her genre as beneficial to those originally within the genre, but feels that the genre has lost its roots and has little to do with what it once represented To quote Ultrademon from an interview in Thump, on her music and the genre's origins: ==Discography== *Shift 002 (2012): Midnight Shift Records *Step into Liquid (2012): Fire for Effect Records, Rephlex *Seapunk (2013): Fire for Effect Records, Rephlex Records *The .Xvx Files Ep (2014): Hyperbolloid *Voidic Charms (2014): Coral Records Internazionale *Pirate Utopias (2014): Faded Audio *Durian Rider (2015): Coral Records Internazionale *Chamber Music (2019): Soft Architecture https://softarchitecture.bandcamp.com/album/chamber-music ==References== Category:Living people Category:Musical groups from Kansas Category:Vaporwave Category:American electronic musicians Category:American experimental musicians Category:Industrial musicians Category:American keyboardists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
