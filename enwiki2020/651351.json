Further, Ramsey's elder son, John Andrew, and elder daughter, Melinda, told interviewers that their father had always been a loving and gentle parent. Linda Arndt, the detective first assigned to the case, stated in a deposition that she believed John Ramsey was responsible for the murder. ===Letter from the District Attorney=== On July 9, 2008, the Boulder County District Attorney's office announced that, as a result of newly developed DNA sampling and testing techniques known as Touch DNA analysis, the Ramsey family members were no longer considered suspects in the case.
