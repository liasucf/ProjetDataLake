After idol, DeAraugo signed to Sony BMG and released her debut single, \"Maybe Tonight\", in November 2005. The single debuted and peaked at Number 1 on the ARIA Charts and was certified platinum. Her debut album, A Place I've Never Been, was released in December 2005 and was also certified platinum. DeAraugo later became a member of the multi-platinum selling girl group, Young Divas, which disbanded in 2008. ==Australian Idol== A former swimming teacher, DeAraugo had auditioned for Australian Idol, in both the first season and in the second season, both times failing to make it past the auditions. After this she travelled from Bendigo, Victoria to the Gold Coast, Queensland for singing lessons with Venetta Fields, finally moving to Queensland where she auditioned for the third season of Idol in 2005. On 14 November 2005, DeAraugo beat Lee Harding to ensure her place in the grand final. Her father, a businessman and car dealer in her home town of Bendigo, orchestrated a publicity campaign with \"Vote for Kate\" stickers and buttons appearing all over central Victoria. DeAraugo's co-finalist was Emily Williams, making this the first all-female final since the show began in 2003. Williams was generally considered the favourite but on 21 November 2005, DeAraugo was crowned as the third Australian Idol with a vote that is still the closest in the show's history. She defeated Williams by only 2%. She was the only Australian Idol winner not to have earned a single touchdown from former judge Mark Holden throughout the course of the show. She was also never placed in any week's bottom group. *Brisbane Auditions: \"Young Hearts Run Free\" by Kym Mazelle (Advanced) *Theatre Round Day Two: \"Finally\" by CeCe Peniston (Advanced) *Top 30 (Group 2): \"For Once in My Life\" by Stevie Wonder (Advanced) *Top 13 Australian Made: \"Please Don't Ask Me\" by John Farnham (Safe) *Top 11 '60s Hits: \"Rescue Me\" by Fontella Bass (Safe) *Top 10 Supergroups: \"I Want It All\" by Queen (Safe) *Top 9 Idols' Choice: \"Not That Kind\" by Anastacia (Safe) *Top 8 Big Band Hits: \"Cry Me a River\" by Patti Austin (Safe) *Top 7 '80s Hits: \"Ain't Nobody\" by Chaka Khan (Safe) *Top 6 Up Close & Personal: \"Ironic\" by Alanis Morissette (Safe) *Top 6 Motown Hits: \"I Wish\" by Stevie Wonder (Safe) *Top 5 '70s Hits: \"Lady Marmalade\" by Patti Labelle (Safe) *Top 4 Elvis Hits: \"The Impossible Dream\" by Elvis Presley (Safe) *Top 4 Elvis Hits: \"Burning Love\" by Elvis Presley (Safe) *Top 3 #1 Hits: \"Heaven\" by Bryan Adams (Safe) *Top 3 #1 Hits: \"Like a Prayer\" by Madonna (Safe) *Top 2 Idols' Choice: \"Shackles (Praise You)\" by Mary Mary (Winner) *Top 2 Idols' Choice: \"How Could an Angel Break My Heart\" by Toni Braxton(Winner) *Top 2 Winner's Single: \"Maybe Tonight\" by the Australian Idol 2005 (Winner) *Grand Final Performance: \"The Impossible Dream\" by Elvis Presley - Declared 3rd Australian Idol ==Music career== ===2005\u20132006: A Place I've Never Been=== As the winner of Australian Idol in 2005, DeAraugo was sent to the studio to work on her debut album which took six days to record.\"And on the sixth day, she recorded\".

To promote the tour the four released a cover of a Donna Summer hit classic, \"This Time I Know It's for Real\", under the name of Young Divas. The single was released on 6 May 2006 and debuting at number seven and peaking at number two. It went platinum and was the Top 30 charts for 24 weeks. Originally a music video was not to be included but, after much demand and the popularity of the single, a music video was released. The group appeared on television shows such as Sunrise and the Australian version of Dancing with the Stars to also promote the single and tour. The Young Divas' tour was very popular and more shows had to be added than originally planned. As the single and tour had been so popular the Young Divas recorded an album of remakes of classics. Young Divas, their self-titled debut album, was released on 18 November 2006 and debuted at number four on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart. Their second single, \"Happenin' All over Again\" (a cover of Lonnie Gordon's disco classic), peaked at number nine. The group members stated many times that they would also keep their solo careers and DeAraugo announced in Australian magazine Woman's Day that she was currently working on her second solo album. DeAraugo and her fellow Divas then recorded a song called \"2000 Miles\" for the compilation album Home: Songs of Hope & Journey by various Australian artists to raise funds and bring attention to beyondblue, an Australian initiative against depression. For this campaign DeAraugo gained honorary membership of The Coterie in the 2007 membership list. On 22 June 2007 it was announced that Ricki-Lee Coulter had decided to leave the group in order to focus on her solo career following rumours of infighting. DeAraugo and the other two remaining group members stated that they would carry on with their plan to record a second album, which they hoped to release in November of the same year. ===2007\u20132008: New Attitude and group disbandment=== On 26 September 2007, DeAraugo appeared alongside the group members on the top 12 night of the fifth season of Australian Idol. It was during this performance that season four runner-up, Jessica Mauboy, was revealed as the new Young Diva, replacing Ricki-Lee Coulter. The group performed \"When You Believe\" which was originally sung by Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston for the fortieth anniversary of Channel 7's Telethon Western Australia. On 9 October they appeared on an Australian Idol special named Doing It For the Kids and revealed that the name of their second album would be New Attitude. On 22 October they appeared on Australian Idol season five for a third time when they performed their new single, \"Turn Me Loose\", along with New Zealand rapper Savage who is featured on the track. The single was officially released on 17 November 2007 and peaked at number 15 on the ARIA singles chart. The Divas' second album followed on 26 November, peaked at number 10 and was certified gold for sales of 35,000 copies. On the season five finale of Australian Idol, when Natalie Gauci was declared the winner, the group performed their single \"Turn Me Loose\" for a second time with Savage. On 28 March 2008, after three months of apparent inactivity, the Young Divas' record label, Sony BMG, announced in The Daily Telegraph that due to the under performance of \"Turn Me Loose\" no second single would be released from New Attitude. However, it was also stated that the group were not being dropped from the record label's artists. After months of speculation it was officially announced on 24 August 2008 that founding Young Divas member Paulini and new member Jessica Mauboy had both decided to leave the group in order to concentrate on their solo careers. The move meant that DeAraugo and Emily Williams became the only remaining members of the Young Divas, though their manager David Champion stressed that the group's career was not over and a third line-up would appear after a hiatus. This was proven to be wrong when both Williams & DeAraugo resumed their solo careers in 2009. ===2008\u2013present: second studio album and Excess Baggage=== DeAraugo spent the remainder of 2008 writing and recording material for her second solo album, following her 2005 debut A Place I've Never Been. Since the Young Divas disbanded, DeAraugo has been performing in clubs across Australia. She hoped to release her second studio album in August 2010 saying, \"Basically the album will be about what I have been through in the past few years.

In April 2015, DeAraugo announced that a new single called \"Shut Your Mouth\" would be released on 1 May that year. The track was co-written by DNA Songs and deals with an emergence from a dark period in her life. \"There was a bit of anger and resentment in the mood,\" Kate says of the recording process, \"But above all, it's about empowerment.\" ==Personal life== During and since Australian Idol, DeAraugo has had a very public battle with her weight. After one particular Idol performance, judge Kyle Sandilands controversially said that he thought she had \"tuckshop lady arms\", a comment that generated support for DeAraugo as the public thought that she had been publicly humiliated by Sandilands. In early January 2008, it was revealed that DeAraugo had signed an endorsement deal with weight-loss giant Jenny Craig. She became the star of the company's \"Get Real\" national program, stating that her aim was to achieve and manage her own goal weight and help promote healthiness among Australia's younger generation. On 11 August, DeAraugo appeared on radio show 2Day FM and announced that she had been forced to withdraw from her endorsement deal with Jenny Craig due to health problems. She stated that she had discovered she was lactose intolerant and was therefore unable to keep to the required diet.
