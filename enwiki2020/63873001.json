    "text": "Soccer on CBS Sports is a number of television programs that have aired Association football matches in the United States on CBS, CBS Sports Network, and CBS All Access. These matches are from International, European, and American competitions. ==History== ===North American Soccer League=== In 1967, two professional soccer leagues started in the United States: the FIFA- sanctioned United Soccer Association, which consisted of entire European and South American teams brought to the US and given local names, and the unsanctioned National Professional Soccer League. The National Professional Soccer League had a national television contract in the U.S. with the CBS television network (which signed a two-year contract to broadcast a game every Sunday afternoon live and in color). The NPSL kicked off on Sunday, April 16 with a full slate of five matches. However, the ratings for matches were unacceptable even by weekend daytime standards and the arrangement was terminated. Bill MacPhail, head of CBS Sports, attributed NASL's lack of TV appeal to empty stadiums with few fans, and to undistinguished foreign players who were unfamiliar to American soccer fans.Sports Illustrated, Soccer Is Getting A Toehold, August 30, 1976, http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1091476/index.htm The leagues merged in 1968 to form the North American Soccer League (NASL). It has been suggested that the timing of the merge was related to the huge amount of attention given throughout the English-speaking world to the victory by England in the 1966 FIFA World Cup and the resulting documentary film, Goal. While the USSF and FIFA refused to recognize the NPSL, the television contract with CBS guaranteed some element of financial stability. In 1974, although the Los Angeles Aztecs had a league-best record and points total, and rightly should have hosted the championship final, CBS intervened and strongly influenced the NASL's decision to play the match in Miami. CBS was under contract to air the game live and was unwilling to black-out the large Southern California viewing audience. At the time it was the standard in many US-based sports for the host market not to broadcast games locally unless they were sold out. At the time, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum had a capacity of 94,500 and, even in a best-case scenario, an Aztecs sell-out was unlikely. Moreover, in an effort by CBS to capture more viewers during the peak East Coast time slot, a Los Angeles-hosted game would have begun at 12:30 (PDT) local time. The league recognized that both these factors would be detrimental to ticket sales and agreed to moved the game to the Miami Orange Bowl with a 3:30 (EDT) local start. CBS had also stepped in the previous week and forced the Toros to play their semi-final match at the much-smaller Tamiami Stadium in Tamiami Park. This was done so that if Miami did win, CBS's production crews would have a full week for set-up in the Orange Bowl stadium.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2206&dat;=19740814&id;=UDw0AAAAIBAJ&sjid;=yesFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=4148,1615343&hl;=en ===1974 FIFA World Cup=== By 1970, the NASL was struggling, and had lost its TV contract with CBS. As a result, they didn't provide any network TV coverage of the 1970 World Cup. 1974's coverage contained week-old filmed highlights on CBS Sports Spectacular. For the Final, CBS used BBC's feed with announcer David Coleman. ===Major Indoor Soccer League=== The MISL made inroads on national television in 1982\u201383. While the spring would see the end of the league's two-year deal with the USA Network, CBS would broadcast a playoff game live from Cleveland on May 7 that drew an estimated four million viewers. One game during the 1983\u201384 season was televised on CBS (Game 3 of the championship series on June 2) as well. 1984\u201385 would be the final year the MISL would have games aired on network television, CBS broadcast Game 4 of the championship series live on May 25. ===NCAA Men's Soccer Championship=== By 1990, CBS would televise the final of the NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Tournament between UCLA Bruins and Rutgers Scarlet Knights. Mike Joy (play-by- play), Seamus Malin (analysis), and Jim Gray provided commentary. ===UEFA club competitions=== Originally the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and UEFA Super Cup would've aired on CBS Sports networks starting from 2021\u201322 seasons. But due to Turner Sports has decided to resign after airing most matches at the round of 16 in 2019\u201320 season, CBS advanced and extended the competitions rights for one and half (one for UEFA Super Cup) seasons earlier starting from the quarter finals in 2019\u201320 season (including the remaining round of 16 matches). ===National Women's Soccer League=== On March 11, 2020, the NWSL announced that it has entered into a three-year media agreement with CBS Sports and the video game-oriented streaming service Twitch. For the 2020 NWSL season, CBS Sports will broadcast 87 matches (including the playoffs) split between CBS, CBS Sports Network, and CBS All Access in Canada and the United States, with the exact distribution among the channels subject to change, while Twitch will stream an additional 24 matches for free. Twitch will also become the NWSL's international media rights holder and stream all matches outside Canada and the United States for free. ==References== ==External links== * Category:CBS Sports Category:CBS Sports Spectacular Category:CBS original programming Category:CBS Sports Network original programming CBS Sports Category:American live television series CBS CBS Sports ",
