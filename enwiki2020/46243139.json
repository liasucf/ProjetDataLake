It was released by Some Bizzare in October 1993. ==Background== According to the writer and poet Jeremy Reed in his biography of Almond, The Last Star, \"Almond largely at his own expense worked on the songs between 1986 and 1989 at Milo Studios\". The album is considered the companion piece to Jacques and in a similar vein contains cover versions of French songs that have been had their lyrics translated into English by Paul Buck. The album contains liner notes by Buck explaining the origins of the songs and the reasons for their inclusion. ==Critical reception== Absinthe received generally favourable reviews from critics. Ned Raggett states in his Allmusic review that Absinthe is \"In the end, more of a curiosity than Jacques, but an enjoyable one.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Martin Watkins \u2013 Piano * Annie Hogan \u2013 Piano * Martin McCarrick \u2013 Cello, Accordion and Piano * Steven Humphreys \u2013 Drums and Percussion * Audrey Riley \u2013 Cello * Bill McGee \u2013 Double Bass * Enrico Tomasso \u2013 Trumpet * Nigel Thomas \u2013 Trombone * John de Aquiar \u2013 Guitar and programming * Charles Gray \u2013 Guitar * Jacquezs Quezin \u2013 Violin * Gini Ball \u2013 Violin * Hirt Aust \u2013 Drums * Michel Grunberger \u2013 Brass * Joel Mahaut \u2013 Brass * Guy Carpentier \u2013 Accordion * Charles Gray \u2013 Production * Martin Watkins \u2013 Mixing * Paul Buck \u2013 all translations * Marc Almond \u2013 Production and arrangements * Barnard Natier \u2013 Engineering ==References== Category:1993 albums Category:Marc Almond albums Category:Covers albums Category:Some Bizzare Records albums Category:Electronic albums by English artists ",
