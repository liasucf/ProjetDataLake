From 1926 he exhibited his work at the Salon des Tuileries and in 1927 the financier Octave Homberg commissioned Saupique to decorate the hall of his office in Paris' rue Pasquier. Saupique took two years to complete four large allegories L'Afrique noire\", L'Indochine, L'Afrique du Nord, et Les Antilles\", each 21 metres high. These are held in a private collection. Saupique also created several reliefs for the front of the rue Pasquier building and seven of these are still in place.
