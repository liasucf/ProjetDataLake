Her music combines elements of spoken word and folk. ==Biography== Evalyn Parry is the daughter of David Parry, an English-born Canadian singer and theatrical director who died in 1995, and performer and author Caroline Balderston Parry. Her brother Richard Parry performs with the bands Bell Orchestre and Arcade Fire. She is married to Canadian writer Suzanne Robertson. She is a Quaker. ==Theatre== Parry is a theatre creator, actor, director, collaborator and educator. She is the artistic director of Buddies in Bad Times Theatre in Toronto.

Her most recent collaborative work, Kiinalik These Sharp Tools, premiered at Buddies in 2017 and was presented at the Edinburgh International Festival in 2019 and Cervantino Festival, Mexico, in 2019, as well as Toronto's Luminato Festival and Vancouver's PuSh Festival . Parry's acclaimed show SPIN, which features a bicycle played as a musical instrument (played by percussionist Brad Hart), charts the feminist history of the bicycle, and tells the story of Annie Londonderry, first woman to ride around the world on a bike in 1895. SPIN has toured festivals and theatres all over North America. Parry is part of the collaborative theatre company Independent Aunties with Anna Chatterton and Karin Randoja, who most recently wrote and performed Gertrude and Alice, about the love and lives of Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas, which premiered at Buddies in Bad Times in 2016 and was published by Playwrights Canada Press in 2018. Gertrude and Alice was a shortlisted finalist for the Governor General's Award for English-language drama at the 2018 Governor General's Awards.\"The finalists for the 2018 Governor General's Literary Award for drama\". CBC Books, October 3, 2018. Before becoming artistic director at Buddies in Bad Times Theatre, Parry was the director of the Young Creators Unit at Buddies in Bad Times from 2007 to 2015.

She was appointed artistic director of Buddies in Bad Times in 2015, succeeding Brendan Healy.\"Buddies names evalyn parry as new artistic director\". Daily Xtra, July 23, 2015. == Music == Steeped in the folk tradition but born to innovate, Parry's genre-blurring work is inspired by intersections of social activism, history and autobiography, exploring themes that range from 19th century cycling heroines to bottled water, from queer identity to the quest for the Northwest Passage. Her unique combination of music and spoken word has been presented at folk festivals, theatres and campuses internationally; she has released five CDs of original music (with Borealis Records and her own Outspoke Productions). Parry performs solo and with a band. She is the recipient of the Colleen Peterson Songwriting Award (2003) and the Beth Ferguson Award for Upcoming Songwriter (Ottawa, 2001).
