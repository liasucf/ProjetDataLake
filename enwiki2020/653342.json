    "text": "C\u00ed (pronounced ; ) is a type of lyric poetry in the tradition of Classical Chinese poetry. C\u00ed use a set of poetic meters derived from a base set of certain patterns, in fixed-rhythm, fixed-tone, and variable line-length formal types, or model examples. The rhythmic and tonal pattern of the ci are based upon certain, definitive musical song tunes. They are also known as Changduanju (\u9577\u77ed\u53e5 / \u957f\u77ed\u53e5, \"lines of irregular lengths\") and Shiyu (\u8a69\u9918 / \u8bd7\u9980, \"the poetry is besides Shi\"). Typically, the number of characters in each line and the arrangement of tones were determined by one of around 800 set patterns, each associated with a particular title, called c\u00edp\u00e1i (\u8a5e\u724c). Originally, they were written to be sung to a tune of that title, with a set rhythm, rhyme, and tempo. Therefore, the title may have nothing to do with its content. Indeed, several ci often shared the same title. The titles did not refer to the content, but rather their shared rhythmic and tonal patterns. Some c\u00ed would have a \"subtitle\" or a commentary, sometimes as long as a paragraph, indicating the content. Sometimes, for the sake of clarity, a c\u00ed is listed under its title, followed by its first line. C\u00ed most often express feelings of desire, often in an adopted persona, but the greatest exponents of the form (such as Chen Weisong \u9648\u7ef4\u5d27 and Su Shi \u82cf\u8f7c) used it to address a wide range of topics. ==History== Although the oldest surviving textual examples of c\u00ed are from 8th century CE Dunhuang manuscripts,Frankel, 216 beginning in the poetry of the Liang Dynasty, the ci followed the tradition of the Shi Jing and the yuefu: they were lyrics which developed from anonymous popular songs into a sophisticated literary genre. In the case of the c\u00ed form some of its fixed- rhythm patterns have influenced poetry in Central Asia. The form was further developed in the Tang Dynasty. Although the contributions of Li Bai (701 \u2013 762) are fraught with historical doubt, certainly the Tang poet Wen Tingyun (812\u2013870) was a great master of the ci, writing it in its distinct and mature form.Davis, lxvii One of the more notable practitioners and developers of this form was Li Yu of the Southern Tang Dynasty during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. However, the ci form of Classical Chinese poetry is especially associated with the poetry of the Song Dynasty, during which it was indeed a popular poetic form. A revival of the c\u00ed poetry form occurred during the end of the Ming Dynasty and the beginning of the Qing Dynasty which was characterized by an exploration of the emotions connected with romantic love together with its secularization, often in a context of a brief poetic story narrative within a c\u00ed poem or a linked group of c\u00ed poems in an application of the chuanqi form of short story tales to poetry.Zhang, 76-80 ==Classification== === Song === In Song Dynasty, two main categories of c\u00ed employed were xi\u01ceol\u00ecng \u5c0f\u4ee4 (the original form since Pre-Song) and m\u00e0nc\u00ed \u6162\u8a5e (starting after Liu Yong), depending on the song being either short and in fast tempo or long and in slow tempo. Mostly xi\u01ceol\u00ecng were written in Pre-Song era. === Ming, Qing === Later in Ming Dynasty and Qing Dynasties, the c\u00ed, or rather the c\u00edp\u00e1i, became classified for the number of characters it dictates. It is called # xi\u01ceol\u00ecng \u5c0f\u4ee4 if it's no more than 58 characters, # zh\u014dngdi\u00e0o \u4e2d\u8abf for 59\u201390, and # ch\u00e1ngdi\u00e0o \u9577\u8abf for over 90. If the ci appears in one stanza, it's called d\u0101ndi\u00e0o (\u55ae\u8abf). The largest majority is shu\u0101ngdi\u00e0o \u96d9\u8abf with two stanzas or qu\u00e8 \u95cb in identical or nearly identical patterns. There also are rare cases of s\u0101ndi\u00e9 \u4e09\u758a and s\u00ecdi\u00e9 \u56db\u758a, for three and four q\u00fc\u00e8, respectively. In terms of style, c\u00ed can also be classified as either w\u01cenyu\u0113 \u5a49\u7d04 (grace) or h\u00e1of\u00e0ng \u8c6a\u653e (bold). == Formation == According to Chinese Pronunciation, \"Mandarin is said to have four main tones and one neutral tone (or, as some say, five tones). Each tone has a distinctive pitch contour which can be graphed using the Chinese 5-level system.\" The Wikipedia page on Old Chinese phonology states that \"The four tones of Middle Chinese were first described by Shen Yue around AD 500. They were the \"level\" (\u5e73 p\u00edng), \"rising\" (\u4e0a sh\u01ceng), \"departing\" (\u53bb q\u00f9), and \"entering\" (\u5165 r\u00f9) tones.\" The level is classified in \u5e73 ping; and the rising, departing and entering are classified in \u4ec4 ze. So, in any Cipai, the formation of Ci, each Chinese character in Ci will be required in detailed tones with \u5e73 or \u4ec4. ==Cipai== Cipai, also called Cige and Cidiao, is the name of various formations of Ci. Most c\u00edp\u00e1i consist of three characters. The literal meaning of a c\u00edp\u00e1i can be rather obscure, making it difficult to translate. Some are taken straight from earlier poems, and some are clearly of Non-Han origin\u2014mostly songs introduced from Central Asia. Some c\u00edp\u00e1i have alternative names, usually taken from a famous piece of that very c\u00edp\u00e1i. There also are variants of certain c\u00edp\u00e1i, indicated by a prefix or a suffix. The formations of Ci are complicated, in different names of Cipai, the number of characters, syntactical structure, tones and rhyme are also different. ==Example== For example, choosing the Cipai, Jiang Chengzi or \"Riverside City\" (\u6c5f\u57ce\u5b50), the tones requirement of each characters in this Cipai is following: \u4ec4\u5e73\u5e73\u4ec4\u4ec4\u5e73\u5e73\u3002\u4ec4\u5e73\u5e73\uff0c\u4ec4\u5e73\u5e73\u3002\u4ec4\u4ec4\u5e73\u5e73\uff0c\u4ec4\u4ec4\u4ec4\u5e73\u5e73\u3002\u4ec4\u4ec4\u5e73\u5e73\u5e73\u4ec4\u4ec4\uff0c\u5e73\u4ec4\u4ec4\uff0c\u4ec4\u5e73\u5e73\u3002 \u5e73\u5e73\u4ec4\u4ec4\u4ec4\u5e73\u5e73\u3002\u4ec4\u5e73\u5e73\uff0c\u4ec4\u5e73\u5e73\u3002\u4ec4\u4ec4\u5e73\u5e73\uff0c\u4ec4\u4ec4\u4ec4\u5e73\u5e73\u3002\u4ec4\u4ec4\u5e73\u5e73\u5e73\u4ec4\u4ec4\uff0c\u5e73\u4ec4\u4ec4\uff0c\u4ec4\u5e73\u5e73\u3002 The following content is a c\u00ed poetry of \u6c5f\u57ce\u5b50. \u5341\u5e74\u751f\u6b7b\u4e24\u832b\u832b\uff0c\u4e0d\u601d\u91cf\uff0c\u81ea\u96be\u5fd8\u3002\u5343\u91cc\u5b64\u575f\uff0c\u65e0\u5904\u8bdd\u51c4\u51c9\u3002\u7eb5\u4f7f\u76f8\u9022\u5e94\u4e0d\u8bc6\uff0c\u5c18\u6ee1\u9762\uff0c\u9b13\u5982\u971c\u3002 \u591c\u6765\u5e7d\u68a6\u5ffd\u8fd8\u4e61\uff0c\u5c0f\u8f69\u7a97\uff0c\u6b63\u68b3\u5986\u3002\u76f8\u987e\u65e0\u8a00\uff0c\u60df\u6709\u6cea\u5343\u884c\u3002\u6599\u5f97\u5e74\u5e74\u80a0\u65ad\u5904\uff0c\u660e\u6708\u591c\uff0c\u77ed\u677e\u5188\u3002 General translation: :For ten years the living and death are both boundless./ Don't need to think intentionally,/ which is hard to forget./With your grave thousands miles away,/ where can I confide my loneliness?/ Even if we met, could you recognize me,/ dust all over my face/ temples have looked like frost?/ :Last night in dream I returned hometown./ By the window,/ you were combing your hair./ We looked at each other silently,/ with only endless tears./ There's a place which every year will be my misery,/ in moonlight,/ the cemetery hill with short pines./ :\u2014\u2014Su Shi, \u8607\u8efe,\u300a\u6c5f\u57ce\u5b50\u00b7\u5341\u5e74\u751f\u6b7b\u5169\u832b\u832b\u300b In the title of this c\u00ed, \"Riverside City\" is the name of c\u00edp\u00e1i. Su Shi got married when he was 19, his wife 16. His wife died when she was only 27. Because of his government duties, Su Shi had moved to many different places in China, all far away from his hometown. One night in early 1075, about 10 years after her death, Su Shi dreamed of his wife, then composed this famous c\u00ed. ==Famous c\u00ed poets== ;Tang Dynasty & Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms * Wen Tingyun (812\u2013870) * Wei Zhuang (836\u2013910) * Li Cunxu (885\u2013926) * Gu Xiong (fl. 928) * Lu Qianyi (fl. 931) * Yan Xuan (fl. 932) * Mao Xizhen (fl. 947) * Xue Zhaoyun (10th century) * Sun Guangxian (d. 968) * Li Yu (937\u2013978) ;Song Dynasty * Liu Yong (987\u20131053) * Ouyang Xiu (1007\u20131072) * Su Shi (1037\u20131101) * Song Ci (1186-1249) * Huang Tingjian (1045\u20131105) * Qin Guan (1049\u20131100) * Zhou Bangyan (1056\u20131121) * Li Qingzhao (1081\u20131149?) * Lu You (1125\u20131209) * Xin Qiji (1140\u20131207) * Jiang Kui (1155\u20131221) *Wang Yisun (1240?\u20131290?) ;Post-Song * Gao Bing (1350\u20131423) * Qian Qianyi (1582\u20131664) * Wu Weiye (1609\u20131671) * Gong Dingzi (1615\u20131673) * Chen Weisong (\u9648\u7ef4\u5d27 1626\u20131682) * Zhu Yizun (1629\u20131709) * Nalan Xingde (1655\u20131685) * Mao Zedong (1893\u20131976) ==See also== *Classical Chinese poetry forms *Dan dan you qing *Shui diao ge tou *Song poetry == Further reading == * Kang-i Sun Chang.
