    "text": "An interactive storybook (or CD-ROM storybook) is a children's story packaged with animated graphics, sound or other interactive elements (e.g., word pronunciation). Such stories are usually published as software on CD-ROMs. This software is targeted at young readers (usually kindergarten to second grade) for educational purposes. ==Examples== *Disney's Animated Storybook *Europress Bookshelf *Living Books *Magic Tales *Playtoons *Reader Rabbit's Reading Development Library ==Pitfalls== There are studies indicating that some students will simply \"cruise through\" a story, either just playing with the graphics or not trying to read it themselves.Lefever-Davis, Shirley, and Cathy Pearman. \"Early readers and electronic texts: CD-ROM storybook features that influence reading behaviors.\" _The Reading Teacher_ 58.5 (Feb 2005): 446-9. ==References== Category:Children's literature Category:Children's educational video games ",
