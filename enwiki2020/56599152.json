    "text": "Kylie Presents Golden was a promotional tour by Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue, in support of her fourteenth studio album, Golden (2018). The tour comprised five shows in Europe and one show in North America. ==Background== Minogue performing during her concert in New York City In contrast to Minogue's previous tours (with the exception of the Anti Tour), the singer conducted the tour as a short strip of concerts in small venues, performing to reduced crowds and in an intimate setting. Speaking on the tour, Minogue stated: > \"I'm so excited to perform songs from my new album Golden in these iconic > European clubs. Each of these venues is very special and--just as I found > making the new album in Nashville to be so energising--these shows will be > new, intimate and fun. I just can\u2019t wait to bring these new songs to life > and of course, throw in a few surprises for my fans.\" In July 2018, Minogue announced an additional thirteen European concerts, which were planned to be a part of the promotional tour. These shows were scheduled to take place in November, consisting of her and her band \"sharing the new album\" with \"a few surprises\". However, in late September, Minogue announced that these dates would instead be part of the Golden Tour. ==Setlist== The following setlist was obtained from the concert held on 13 March 2018, at Caf\u00e9 de Paris in London, England.
