    "text": "Se\u00e1n McCague served as the 33rd president of the Gaelic Athletic Association (2000\u20132003). McCague was born in Scotstown, County Monaghan and became the first Monaghan man to hold that office. As President he will be mostly remembered for the removal of Rule 21 in November 2001. Rule 21 banned members of the British security forces (who were an unwelcome force for most GAA fans) from playing Gaelic games. The rule was abolished despite the opposition of five of the six northern counties (Antrim, Armagh, Derry, Fermanagh and Tyrone). At the annual 2001 GAA Congress McCague convinced Taoiseach Bertie Ahern to pledge \u20ac76 million towards the redevelopment of Croke Park. This amount was later reduced to \u20ac38 million. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:GAA people from County Monaghan Category:Presidents of the Gaelic Athletic Association ",
