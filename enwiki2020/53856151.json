    "text": "The 1859 Welsh revival was a Christian revival in Wales. It was led by two ministers: Humphrey Jones and David Morgan. The revival had its roots in the 1857\u201359 revival in the United States. Jones, a Methodist minister, had experienced the revival in New York. On his return to Tre'r Dd\u00f4l, he recruited Morgan, a Presbyterian, to the cause. It is estimated that the revival produced 100,000 converts. Some writers, such as Martyn Lloyd-Jones, also view the revival as connected to the revival in Ulster during the same year. ==References== Revival Welsh revival Category:Christian revivals Category:History of Christianity in Wales ",
