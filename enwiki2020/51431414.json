    "text": "Sonola is the debut studio album by Australian rock band The Black Sorrows. The album was released in June 1984 and consisted of cover versions of soul and R&B; songs. ==Background== In 1983, following the disbanding of Jo Jo Zep, Joe Camilleri gathered together a group of musician friends and dubbed them The Black Sorrows. The band began playing mostly covers of R&B;, zydeco, soul and blues music 'for the fun of it'. Camilleri says; \"I remember playing birthday parties and weddings, just so I could get enough money to make a record. We made Sonola for $1300. I just wanted to have some sort of documentation that we existed. We did the artwork and screen-printed the covers. We\u2019d put the covers on the line, one side only, waiting for them to dry, so we could do the other side. They\u2019re the things you cherish, waiting for the record to be pressed and then having a lounge-room full of records and freaking out because you want to get rid of them.\" == Track listing == ; CD track listing ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1984) ! scope=\"col\"| Rank |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Kent Music Report | 50 |- |} == Personnel == * Bass guitar \u2013 Wayne Duncan * Clarinet, saxophone \u2013 Paul Williamson * Cover \u2013 Neil Curtis * Drums \u2013 Gary Young * Guitar \u2013 Jeff Burstin * Guitar, harmony vocals \u2013 Wayne Burt * Piano accordion \u2013 George Butrumlis * Producer, saxophone, vocals \u2013 Joey Vincent * Recorded by Ross Cockle * Remastered by Joe Camilleri * Violin \u2013 Steve McTaggart ==References== ==External links== * \"Sonola\" at discogs.com Category:1984 debut albums Category:The Black Sorrows albums Category:Albums produced by Joe Camilleri ",
