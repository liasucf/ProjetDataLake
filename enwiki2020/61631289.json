    "text": "The 1982\u201383 NCAA Division II men's ice hockey season began in November 1981 and concluded on March 20 of the following year. This was the 19th season of second-tier college ice hockey. After the 1981\u201382 season the majority of teams that registered as NAIA programs switched to NCAA. This meant that the representation at the Division II championship, specifically from western schools, was more equitable than in years past. ==Regular season== ===Season tournaments=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
