    "text": "Marburg railway line near Perry\u2019s Knob, circa 1915 The Marburg Branch Railway is a branch line of the Main Line railway (from Brisbane to Toowoomba) in Queensland, Australia. It branches near Rosewood, which is about 20 kilometres west of Ipswich. Previously known as Rosewood Gate, a railway gatekeeper was appointed to Rosewood in 1866. A waiting room and stationmaster\u2019s house were built in 1875 and a station office built in 1880 was replaced with the current building in 1918. Agricultural land to the north of Rosewood was not directly serviced by the Brisbane Valley railway line and, in December 1909, parliament approved the construction of a branch line to run about 15 kilometres to Marburg. The Marburg locality was originally known as First Plain, then as Frederick after the name of an early settler, and lastly as Marburg after a Prussian town of the same name. During World War I the town was known as Townshend but the Marburg name was reinstated in 1920. The line opened on 18 December 1911 after passing through North Rosewood, Perry\u2019s Knob, Cabanda (), Kunkala (), Tallegalla and Birru. A daily service to Ipswich departed Marburg each morning and returned in the evening. It was a two-hour journey by rail and over time the faster road trip prevailed. Coal mines in the region kept the line viable until they progressively closed. The branch closed in stages \u2013 from Marburg to Birru in 1964, to Kunkala in 1970, Cabanda in 1973 and to Perry\u2019s Knob in 1979. The Australian Railway Historical Society now uses a section of the line to operate steam locomotive rides. It has a display at Kunkala station. ==See also== *Rail transport in Queensland == References == *\"Heritage Trails of the Great South East\" QEPA September 2000 *\"Triumph of Narrow Gauge: A History of Queensland Railways\" by John Kerr 1990 Boolarong Press, Brisbane ==External links== * 1925 map of the Queensland railway system Category:Closed railway lines in Queensland Category:South East Queensland Category:Railway lines opened in 1911 Category:Railway lines closed in 1964 Category:Railway lines closed in 1979 Category:1911 establishments in Australia Category:1979 disestablishments in Australia ",
