    "text": "Yalyalup is a suburb of the Western Australian city of Busselton. At the 2016 census, it had a population of 2,486. The word \"Yalyalup\" means \"place of many holes\" in the local Noongar dialect, being a reduplication of \"yal\", the Wardandi word for \"large hole\", plus the -up suffix, meaning \"place of\". After European settlement the area began to be used for timber-milling; the local mill was reworked using state-of-the-art technology in 1963 and finally closed in 1979. The area has also been used for farming, with the Mullgarnup Aboriginal Mission operating on a farm site for about ten years from 1887, and a state school being open from 1910 to 1921. There are two major estates in the suburb: Provence Estate, built by Satterley property Group and established in 2008, and Via Vasse Private Estate by DJ MacCormick Property Group. The suburb also contains Georgiana Molloy Anglican School, Busselton Margaret River Airport, and Busselton Cemetery. ==References== Category:Suburbs of Busselton ",
