A total of 66 T-1 planes were built.Simpson 2001, p.246 It was retired in March 2006. ==Design and development== After World War II, Japanese aircraft industry was banned from research as well as the destruction of materials and equipment related to aircraft. In 1952, a partial ban on aircraft research was lifted, making it possible to develop Japan's own domestic jet aircraft. In the spring of 1954, the Defense Agency's plan to develop and domesticate a training jet aircraft emerged, which later lead to the development of the T-1 training plane. The T-1 was the first indigenously designed Japanese jet aircraft to be developed since World War II. It was Japan's first mass-produced jet and the first aircraft to apply a swept wing. The development of a domestic jet engine was not completed in time, so the T-1A was powered by the British-designed Bristol Siddeley Orpheus turbojetFUJI T-1 at faqs.org and made its first flight on May 17, 1960. The T1-B was powered by the Ishikawajima-Harima J3 turbojet and 20 were produced between June 1962 and June 1963. Fuji was the successor to the Nakajima Aircraft Company (famous for building several aircraft such as Nakajima Ki-43 and Nakajima Ki-84 during WW2). The first aircraft of Fuji's own design was the T-1 jet trainer.Archives at Flightglobal.com More than 200 T-1s were to be produced, but with the introduction of the Lockheed F-104J/DJ fighters, the education system changed and the Lockheed T-33A, which was in large numbers, took on the same role, and only 66 T-1s were introduced. With the entry into service of its successor, the Kawasaki T-4, flight training with the T-1 was completed in December 2000. Last T-1 was retired on March 3, 2006. ==Variants== Komaki Air Base Data from: Simpson 2001, p. 246 ;T1F1: powered by a Nippon J3 engine. ;T1F2: Two prototypes, powered by Bristol BOr.1 Orpheus engines. ;T1F3: Initial designation for the production T-1A, powered by Bristol BOr.4 Orpheus engines. ;T-1A: Powered by a 17.79 kN (4,000 lbf) Bristol Siddeley Orpheus Mk 805 turbojet engine.
