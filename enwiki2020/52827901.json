Built in 1910, the Town lattice truss is the only surviving covered bridge in Troy from the historic period of covered bridge construction. It also exhibits some distinctive variations in construction from more typical Town lattices. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. ==Description and history== The River Road Covered Bridge is located in a rural area of central Troy, near the eastern end of Veilleux Road. It spans the Missisquoi in a roughly east\u2013west orientation, resting on abutments of stone and concrete. It is a single-span Town lattice truss, long and wide, with a roadway width of (one lane). It is covered by a metal roof, and its exterior is clad in vertical board siding, which extends around to the insides of the portals. The siding does not rise all the way to the roof, leaving an open strip between them. Unlike most Town lattice trusses, this one has three chords instead of four, and its joints are fastened with single pegs instead of doubled one. with The bridge was built in 1910; its builder is unknown. It is the only covered bridge in Troy. In addition to its unusual truss construction, the bridge also has an unusually broad roof, and has exterior timber buttressing not usually found on covered bridges. ==See also== * * * * * List of covered bridges in Vermont * National Register of Historic Places listings in Orleans County, Vermont * List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont ==References== Category:Covered bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont Category:National Register of Historic Places in Orleans County, Vermont Category:Bridges in Orleans County, Vermont Category:Road bridges in Vermont Category:Buildings and structures in Troy, Vermont Category:Wooden bridges in Vermont Category:Lattice truss bridges in the United States ",
