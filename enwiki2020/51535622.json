    "text": "Jeannette Unite (born 20 January 1964) is a South African artist who has mined for her paint box by collecting oxides, metal salts and residues from mines, heritage and industrial sites, to develop paint, pastel and glass recipes for her large scale artworks that reflect on the mining and industrial sites where humanity's contemporary world is manufactured. Her industrial-scale mining Headgear drawings and \"TERRA\" paintings were exhibited at Museum Ostwall, Dortmund, Germany in the reconstructed building on the site of mining headquarters for the Ruhr Valley in commemoration of the final year of underground coal mining in Germany. Through 2014 and 2015 her research on Earth's stratigraphy with Department of Earth Sciences, Oxford University and Oxford University Museum, developed into a body of work exhibited at the Centre for Contemporary Art and the Natural World (CCANW),http://www.ccanw.co.uk/complicit-geographies.htm Exeter University, Devon, between October 2015 and February 2016. This travelling exhibition also formed part of the United Nations' Year of Soil and the British Geological Society's Year of Mud. == Research == Unite's works reference mining heritage sourced from archives and museums. This includes early geological historical maps and texts that were created during the British Industrial Revolution to guide mining the coal that fueled the engines that drove modernity. Photographs from Unite's travels and images duplicated from mining museums and archives are as precious a resource to Unite as the site-specific sands and slimes pond tailings from the mines and industrial detritus, and are loaded with meaning that she mixes into her paints and pastels. Unite has exhibited in the German, Beijing, Lyon, and Tashkent International Art Biennales. Her art is represented in art museums spanning five continents, as well as within the halls of the world's largest law firm, Clifford Chance.

From 1987 to 1997 she taught printmaking and general art at Frank Joubert Art Centre, as well as teaching adult education drawing lessons & painting courses. During this time, she spent four years in correspondence with UNISA and provided art training to teachers in Nyanga, a local township area. From 2011-2016 she taught the Workshops in Materiality course at Michaelis School of Fine Art, a series of workshops centered around communicating her own unique style of paint preparation and utilization to students. In 2014 she completed her MFA (Masters in Fine Arts) at Michaelis, receiving a distinction. ==Selected exhibitions== 2017 MEASURING MODERNITY, Borderline Art Space, Iasi, Romania COMPLICIT GEOGRAPHIES, Eclectica Contemporary, Cape Town 2016 35th International Geology Congress, Invited Earth mining artist, CTICC TERRA, Museum Am Ostwall, Dortmund, Germany Mining Our Heritage | Bergbau Unser Erbe \u2013 Germany Preview, Abalone Hermanus Fynarts In Plain Sight: Social Life in South Africa and Romania before and after 1989, Aparte Gallery of George Enescu Uni of Arts, Iasi & Borderline Art Space, Iasi, Romania Out of the Fire, Into the Light, Dr Ingram Anderson, Glass exhibition, AVA, Pretoria STRATA two-woman show with Isabel Mertz at ISart, Franscchhoek Colori sotto il Visuvio (The Colours of Vesuvius), Il ramo d'oro Centre of Arts and Culture, Naples, Italy 2015 Bi-Centenary William 'Strata' Smith, Innovation Centre, University of Exeter PREVIEW Bi-Centenary William 'Strata' Smith, Jo'burg Art Fair Fringe curated by Carol Brown, Mboneng, Johannesburg LAW & ORE, Youngblood Foundation Gallery, Cape Town Between Democracies curated By Judy Peter, Karen von Vey & Richard Gregor, Constitution Hill, Johannesburg Fear & Loss in the Industrial Karoo, Curator Katie Du Toit, Oliewenhuis, Bloemfontein | Pretoria Art Museum | Graaff-Rennet Blowing in the Wind, curator Carol Brown, KZNSA Gallery, Durban and University of the Orange Free State, Art Museum.
