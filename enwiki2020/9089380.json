The site's consensus reads: \"La Cage aux Folles is a fine French-Italian farce with flamboyant, charming characters and deep laughs\". Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that \"the comic turns in the plot are achieved with such clockwork timing that sometimes we're laughing at what's funny and sometimes we're just laughing at the movie's sheer comic invention. This is a great time at the movies.\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote in a negative review that the film \"is naughty in the way of comedies that pretend to be sophisticated but actually serve to reinforce the most popular conventions and most witless stereotypes.\"Canby, Vincent (May 13, 1979). \"Film: 'Cage aux Folles,' Farce in a French Club\". The New York Times. 41. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \"For me, 'La Cage aux Folles' was over soon after it began. It's all so predictable. This could have been a Luci & Desi comedy routine. The film's only distinctive quality is the skill of its veteran actors in working with tired material.\"Siskel, Gene (July 19, 1979). \"Acting helps, but 'La Cage' material seems tired\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 5. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called the film \"a frequently hilarious French variation on Norman, Is That You? and has the same broad humor and appeal but has been put over with considerably more aplomb.\"Thomas, Kevin (July 18, 1979). \"A French Variation on 'Norman'\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 13. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post panned the film for \"stale, excruciating sex jokes\" and direction that \"has evidently failed to devise a playing rhythm to compensate for whatever farcical tempo the material enjoyed on the stage.\"Arnold, Gary (July 18, 1979). \"Feeble Farce\". The Washington Post. E6. David McGillivray of The Monthly Film Bulletin described the film as \"a crude amalgam of Norman, Is That You? and John Bowen's play Trevor ... All shrieks, mincing and limp wrists, La Cage aux folles also looks positively antiquated beside the sophisticated gay comedy of such as Craig Russell.\" ==Awards and honors== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Retrieved 7 September 2020. ===Adam and Yves=== La Cage aux Folles caught the attention of television producer Danny Arnold, who in 1979 pitched the concept of a weekly series about a gay couple similar to the one in the film to ABC. His planned title was Adam and Yves, a play on both Adam and Eve and a slogan used by some anti-gay groups. After months in development, Arnold realized that the concept was unsustainable as a weekly series, which led to the show getting dropped.Tropiano, p. 252 ==References== ==Literature== * ==External links== * * * *La Cage aux Folles: Folles Family Values an essay by David Ehrenstein at the Criterion Collection Category:1978 films Category:French films Category:Italian films Category:French-language films Category:Italian- language films Category:1978 LGBT-related films Category:1970s sex comedy films Category:French LGBT-related films Category:French sex comedy films Category:Italian sex comedy films Category:Italian LGBT-related films Category:Homophobia in fiction Category:Films about anti-LGBT sentiment Category:Best Foreign Language Film Golden Globe winners Category:Commedia all'italiana Category:Cross-dressing in film Category:Films scored by Ennio Morricone Category:French films based on plays Category:Films directed by \u00c9douard Molinaro Category:Films featuring a Best Actor C\u00e9sar Award-winning performance Category:Films shot in Saint-Tropez Category:Gay-related films Category:LGBT-related sex comedy films Category:1978 comedy films Category:Drag (clothing)-related films ",
