He finished twelfth in heat one of the 5000 metres and so failed to qualify for the next round, and he completed the marathon in 74th place. At the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, he took part in the marathon but did not finish. Mambosasa was the Malawian flag carrier in the opening ceremony at these games. In the men's 5000 metres event at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Mambosasa set the current Malawian national record for the men's 3000 metres with a time of 8:25.3. ==References== Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Malawian male long- distance runners Category:Olympic athletes of Malawi Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1984 Summer Olympics Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1988 Summer Olympics Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for Malawi Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1986 Commonwealth Games Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1990 Commonwealth Games ",
