She is eleventh in line to the throne of Monaco. Her maternal grandparents were Rainier III, Prince of Monaco, and American actress Grace Kelly. She is named after her maternal great-grandmother, Princess Charlotte, Duchess of Valentinois. She was christened on 20 September 1986. Her godparents are Albina du Boisrouvray and Stefano Casiraghi's brother-in-law, Massimo Bianchi. ==Early life== Charlotte and her two brothers, Andrea and Pierre, were born in the Mediterranean Principality of Monaco, ruled by their maternal grandfather, Prince Rainier III. When she was four years old, her father was killed in a boating accident. After his death, Princess Caroline moved the family to the Midi village of Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence in France, with the intention of minimising their exposure to the press.Heyman, J (2 July 2001) \"Lives in the fast lane.\" US Weekly. Issue 33. One of her first acts of public life was to become a delegate from Monaco to the Club des Habits Rouges, which is similar to The Pony Club in the UK. At the same time, her grandfather Rainier III, Prince of Monaco designated her patron of the Public Safety Division in Monaco. In January 1999, Charlotte gained a stepfather and two stepbrothers, (Prince Ernst of Hanover and Prince Christian of Hanover), when her mother married Ernst August, Prince of Hanover. Six months later, Casiraghi's half-sister, Princess Alexandra of Hanover, was born at a clinic in Voecklabruck, Austria. Casiraghi is godmother to her sister. The family then moved to the Parisian suburb of Fontainebleau. From 2001 through 2004, as a member of Marcel Rozier's Team Marionnaud, Casiraghi participated in a number of Junior and Amateur class show jumping competitions. She was trained successively by both of Rozier's sons, first Philippe and then Thierry Rozier. ==Education== From the ages of two to six, Casiraghi attended Les Dames de Saint Maur, which is part of the Catholic schools of Fran\u00e7ois d'Assisi Nicolas Barr\u00e9 in Monaco. At the age of six, she moved on to the \u00c9cole de la R\u00e9publique (state school system) in Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence. From 2000 to 2004 she attended the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ois-Couperin, Fontainebleau. She obtained an \"excellent\" (in French: tr\u00e8s bien, the highest possible) mark on her baccalaureate exam in July 2004. After passing her bac, she enrolled in the hypokh\u00e2gne and kh\u00e2gne course at the Lyc\u00e9e F\u00e9nelon, in St-Germain-des-Pr\u00e8s, Paris, in the hope of entering the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (Paris). She took the written entrance exam for ENS in June 2006, but failed to make the list of candidates eligible to proceed to the oral exam. In 2007, Casiraghi earned a License of Philosophy (B.A.) from the University of Paris IV: Paris-Sorbonne; Casiraghi completed two internships, firstly with the publishing house of Robert Laffont in Paris, and then later from October 2007 with the Sunday magazine supplement of The Independent newspaper of London.Amapane, Antonella.

Her mother is among the many honorary members of the group, which is really a think tank on philosophy. They discuss contemporary issues and new publications in the field of philosophy. The writings and the life of Anne Dufourmantelle made a strong impact on Casiraghi, who wrote in particular about Dufourmantelle's book D\u00e9fense du Secret in an article for Lib\u00e9ration. Casiraghi and Dufourmantelle, who died in 2017, were friends, sharing, by the admission of Casiraghi herself, a passion for not only philosophy but for horses.

In March 2018, Casiraghi and Maggiori published their Kindle book, through \u00c9ditions du Seuil. The title is Archipel des Passions (Archipelago of the Passions). It is a series of dialogues between the professor and the student about the various passions (i.e. arrogance, joy, cruelty, love) and their affects. It is also \"an essay on the passion of thought.\" The book is dedicated to her father and the passions explored amount to about forty. It \"reads like a treatise of the passions.\" ===Equestrian=== In June 2009, Casiraghi, accompanied by her uncle Albert II, Prince of Monaco, appeared on the French television programme Stade 2 to speak about her recent enrollment in the Global Champions Tour.

I haven't been as conscious as I should have been.\" The debut issue of Ever Manifesto was distributed free at the 10 Corso Como boutique during Milan Fashion Week and again at Colette in Paris during Paris Fashion Week. Casiraghi explained that the magazine will not have a predetermined publication schedule. \"We want to publish when we have something to say or people to support,\" she said. \"It will be short and meaningful so that people will read it.\" The day after the publication of her La Stampa interview, 22 September, Casiraghi joined her partners, Niedzielski and Guttman, at the gallery of Michelangelo Pistoletto, in the town of Biella, in the Italian region of Piedmont.
