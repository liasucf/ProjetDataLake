In his Substack-published \"Consumer Guide\" column, Robert Christgau said, \"It's a woman's voice with a brawny, low-pitched masculinity to it, articulated with no show of care and every well-chosen word distinct. The hook-free beats are as utilitarian and accomplished as vocals that always take the rhymes where they want to go\". ==Track listing== Credits adapted from Tidal and Respect. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 debut albums Category:Albums produced by Zaytoven Category:Albums produced by Frank Dukes ",
