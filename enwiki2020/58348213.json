    "text": "The eleventh series of Dancing on Ice began airing on 6 January 2019 on ITV. Filming took place in the purpose-built studio at Bovingdon Airfield, which was set up for series ten when the show was revived in 2018. An announcement was made on 11 March 2018, during the series ten finale, that the show had been recommissioned for another series. Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby once again hosted the show; Christopher Dean, Jayne Torvill, Ashley Banjo and Jason Gardiner all returned as judges; and former judge Karen Barber returned as head coach, a role that she last held in 2012 for series seven. Professional skater Daniel Whiston, who has partnered with a celebrity skater in every series since 2006, did not take part in the competition in 2019 but instead took on the role of Associate Creative Director. Jordan Banjo, who was a host in the backstage rink in 2018, was not able to return to the show due to scheduling conflicts; series ten contestant Kem Cetinay joined the show in the role of digital host, as Banjo's replacement. Sam Matterface returned as a commentator for series eleven. The competition was won by James Jordan and his professional partner Alexandra Schauman, making it a first win for Schauman who has appeared in the show since 2010 (with the exception of 2013 and 2018). This was also Jason Gardiner\u2019s last series on The Ice Panel with John Barrowman later announced as his replacement. ==Couples== On 1 October 2018, Gemma Collins and Richard Blackwood were announced as the first two celebrities for series eleven. More celebrities were revealed in the following days, and the line-up was concluded on 5 October. On 29 October, it was revealed that eight of the professional skaters from series ten would return: Matt Evers, Sylvain Longchambon, Brianne Delcourt, Mark Hanretty, reigning champion Vanessa Bauer, Alex Murphy, Brandee Malto and Hamish Gaman. Two of the professional skaters who last took part in series nine in 2014, Alexandra Schauman and \u0141ukasz R\u00f3\u017cycki, were to rejoin the show alongside new professionals Carlotta Edwards and Alexander Demetriou, who would be making their Dancing on Ice debuts. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin: auto; text-align:center; font-size:95%;\" |- !
