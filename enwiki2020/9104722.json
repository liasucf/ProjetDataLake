    "text": "Paul Jasper is an American former race car driver born in Dayton, Ohio. He was the 1996 Rookie of the Year and finished 3rd overall in points as a Toyota Atlantic driver. In 1997 he signed to drive in CART for Dale Coyne Racing, driving the #34 Lola Ford-Cosworth. Coming off of a championship '96 season the '97 Lola was a very uncompetitive and flawed chassis. This resulted in bad timing for Jasper. He attempted six race, but failed to qualify for two, resulting in four race starts. Jasper's best finish was an 18th place in his final start, the Miller 200 at The Milwaukee Mile. ==External links== *CART statistics at ChampCarStats.com Category:1974 births Category:Atlantic Championship drivers Category:Champ Car drivers Category:Indy Lights drivers Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Dayton, Ohio Category:Racing drivers from Ohio ",
