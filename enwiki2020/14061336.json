    "text": "Ezrin also known as cytovillin or villin-2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the EZR gene. == Structure == The N-terminus of ezrin contains a FERM domain which is further subdivided into three subdomains. The C-terminus contain an ERM domain. == Function == The cytoplasmic peripheral protein encoded by this gene can be phosphorylated by protein-tyrosine kinase in microvilli and is a member of the ERM protein family. This protein serves as a linker between plasma membrane and actin cytoskeleton. It plays a key role in cell surface structure adhesion, migration, and organization. The N-terminal domain (also called FERM domain) binds sodium-hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor (NHERF) protein (involving long-range allostery). This binding can happen only when ezrin is in its active state. The activation of ezrin occurs in synergism of the two factors: 1) binding of the N-terminal domain to phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bis-phosphate (PIP2) and 2) phosphorylation of threonine T567 in the C-terminal domain. Binding to actin filaments (via C-terminal) and to membrane proteins (via N-terminal) stabilizes the protein's conformation in its active mode. The membrane proteins like CD44 and ICAM-2 are indirect binding partners of ezrin, while EBP50 (ERM binding protein 50) can associate with ezrin directly. == Interactions == VIL2 has been shown to interact with: * CD43, * FASLG, * ICAM-1, * ICAM2, * ICAM3, * Merlin, * MSN, * PIK3R1, * PALLD * S100P, * SDC2, * SLC9A3R1, * SLC9A3R2, and * VCAM-1. == References == == Further reading == * ",
