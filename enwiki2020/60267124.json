    "text": "Pope Eugene III Divina dispensatione is the name for two papal bulls issued by Pope Eugene III. The first was issued on 5 October 1146 to the clergy of Italy, urging Italians to join the Second Crusade.Giles Constable, 'The Second Crusade as seen by Contemporaries', Traditio Vol. 9 (1953), p. 255. The second was issued on 11 April 1147 at Troyes and called for the Wendish Crusade against the pagan Slavs.Pegatha Taylor, 'Moral Agency in Crusade and Colonization: Anselm of Havelberg and the Wendish Crusade of 1147', The International History Review Vol. 22, No. 4 (Dec., 2000), p. 772. In the second bull Eugene declared: > Certain of you, however, (are) desirous of participating in so holy a work > and reward and plan to go against the Slavs and other pagans living towards > the North and to subject them, with the Lord's assistance, to the Christian > religion. We give heed to the devotion of these men, and to all those who > have not accepted the cross for going to Jerusalem and who have decided to > go against the Slavs and to remain in the spirit of devotion on that > expedition, as it is prescribed, we grant that same remission of sin...and > the same temporal privileges as to the crusaders to Jerusalem. ==Notes== Category:12th-century papal bulls Category:Documents of Pope Eugene III Category:Wendish Crusade ",
