It commemorates the origins of the city, recalling the move of the city from the Hill of Mary Magdalene to the fertile coastal plain in 1251. This festival lasts for 9 days. It starts on the third Saturday of Lent and it was declared an Event of International Tourist Interest in 2010. == Historical background == == History of the festival == == The semana festera == Typical ribbon used as a symbol of the Festivity === Dates of the festival === * 2015: from 7 to 15 March.

Armengot (using Gauss's law), as follows: 03/03/1945, 03/23/1946, 03/08/1947, 02/28/1948, 03/19/1949, 03/11/1950, 02/24/1951, 03/15/1952, 03/07/1953, 03/27/1954, 03/12/1955, 03/03/1956, 03/23/1957, 03/08/1958, 02/28/1959, 03/19/1960, 03/04/1961, 03/24/1962, 03/16/1963, 02/29/1964, 03/20/1965, 03/12/1966, 02/25/1967, 03/16/1968, 03/08/1969, 02/28/1970, 03/13/1971, 03/04/1972, 03/24/1973, 03/16/1974, 03/01/1975, 03/20/1976, 03/12/1977, 02/25/1978, 03/17/1979, 03/08/1980, 03/28/1981, 03/13/1982, 03/05/1983, 03/24/1984, 03/09/1985, 03/01/1986, 03/21/1987, 03/05/1988, 02/25/1989, 03/17/1990, 03/02/1991, 03/21/1992, 03/13/1993, 03/05/1994, 03/18/1995, 03/09/1996, 03/01/1997, 03/14/1998, 03/06/1999, 03/25/2000, 03/17/2001, 03/02/2002, 03/22/2003, 03/13/2004, 02/26/2005, 03/18/2006, 03/10/2007, 02/23/2008, 03/14/2009, 03/06/2010, 03/26/2011, 03/10/2012, 03/02/2013, 03/22/2014, 03/07/2015, 02/27/2016, 03/18/2017, 03/03/2018, 03/23/2019, 03/14/2020, 03/06/2021, 03/19/2022, 03/11/2023, 03/02/2024, 03/22/2025, 03/07/2026, 02/27/2027, 03/18/2028, 03/03/2029, 03/23/2030, 03/15/2031, 02/28/2032, 03/19/2033, 03/11/2034, 02/24/2035, 03/15/2036, 03/07/2037, 03/27/2038, 03/12/2039, 03/03/2040, 03/23/2041, 03/08/2042, 02/28/2043, 03/19/2044, 03/11/2045, 02/24/2046, 03/16/2047, 03/07/2048, 03/27/2049, 03/12/2050. It should be highlighted that, since the first celebration of the Magdalena Festival in 1945, the year with the earliest date of the festivities was in 2008, from 23 February to 2 March; whilst the celebration which began on the latest date was in 1981, from 28 March to 5 April.A\u00f1o de celebraci\u00f3n de las Fiestas de la Magdalena desde 1945 In both 1948 and 2032, the most important day of the festival, the Sunday of the Magdalena Festival (third Sunday of Lent and first Sunday of the week of celebrations), is 29 February; the coincidence of the events on 29 February in each respective century. === Saturday: De la festa, la vespra === ==== Official announcement of the festival==== The festivities begin at 12:00 noon, when commemorative fireworks are set off; the number of fireworks reflects the number of years that have passed since the celebration of the festival. This is followed by a masclet\u00e0, a very loud coordinated firecracker display, which is prepared by the winners of the previous year's pyrotechnic competition and takes place in Plaza del Primer Mol\u00ed; it lasts between 10 and 15 minutes. ==== Official opening parade ==== A traditional, vernacular parade reflecting the mythology, history, customs and folklore of Castell\u00f3n. This parade starts at 4:00 p.m. and lasts for approximately 4 hours, passing through central and northern parts of the city. The following sections can be distinguished: * Mythology of Castell\u00f3n. The Colla del Rei Barbut performs the mythology of Castell\u00f3n. * History of Castell\u00f3n. Participants dress up as members of groups of people that left their mark on Castell\u00f3n: the Moors (Asociaci\u00f3n cultural Moros d\u00b4Alqueria), the Christians (Cavallers de la Conquesta y Templarios), the Jews (Asociaci\u00f3n Cultural Aljama) and the pirates (Colla Bacalao). * Towns of the province. Most of the towns of the province take part at this point of the parade. * City of Castell\u00f3n. This section focuses on the folklore and customs of the city; the marjaleria, the plain, the mountains and the city. Some parts of this section makes reference to elements of the festival itself: ** Pikes of the city: Two castelloneros holding long stick decorated with red and yellow carnations and Castell\u00f3n's coat of arms. ** Sector commissions. Each of the 19 major gaiata sector commissions (groups organising a gaiata display) takes part in this part of the procession. Each commission is made up of a standard bearer, the \"ladies and their gentlemen\" and of the \"maid of honour\", on the arm of the first vicepresident, of the respective gaiata sector commission. ** The Virgin's basket: a large basket containing red and yellow carnations held by the presidents of the gaiatas, who present them to the Blessed Virgin Mary during the offering. ** Bugles of the city: four musicians riding on horseback before the town crier, playing the City March. ** Local festival opening speech: the most important element of the procession; the town crier sings the verses written for this event by Bernat Artola. After they have been sung before the gallery of dignitaries, the festival begins. ** A Carriage with the maids of honour, the ladies of the city and the queen of the festival: two oxen-drawn carriages, linked together, on which the maids of honour of each of the gaiatas, the ladies of the city, and the queen of the festival sit. ** The Castell\u00f3n music band closes the procession. After the opening speech (preg\u00f3) ends, the Enfarol\u00e0 del Campanar begins. It is a display which consists of illuminating el Fadr\u00ed, the tower in the centre of Castell\u00f3n, with a pyrotechnic display. === Sunday: \"Magdalena festa plena\" === The most important day of the Magdalena Festival. ==== Pilgrimage of the canes ==== Mary Magdalene Chapel The day starts with the ringing of the \"Vicent\" bell at 5:30 am. As mentioned in the last part of the preg\u00f3 (an announcement made by a town crier), the bell's chime means \"Ja el d\u00eda es arribat de la nostra Magdalena\" (\"The day of our Magdalena celebration has come\"). At 8:00 am, the pilgrimage starts from the Plaza Mayor (Castell\u00f3n) (Main Square). Although its official starting point is the Plaza Mayor, most pilgrims start from Plaza Mar\u00eda Agustina (Mar\u00eda Agustina Square, which is a typical meeting place and through which the main route passes. From there, the pilgrimage goes through several streets of the north side of the city and it continues, along rural paths, until it reaches the Mary Magdalene chapel. Halfway there, one of the compulsory stops (according to tradition) is Sant Roc de Canet, where people have a mid-morning snack, for example the typical \"figa i doset\", and where pilgrims say a prayer. After this long walk, people arrive at the Mary Magdelene Chapel. A masclet\u00e1 (a series of pyrotechnic explosions) is set off to announce the arrival of the pilgrims, who are handed \"rotllos\" (ring-shaped pretzels). Then, there is a service in the chapel, after which everyone tries a little of an enormous paella. ====La torn\u00e0 de la romeria (the return from the pilgrimage) and the Procession of Penitents==== The so-called torn\u00e0 de la romer\u00eda had disappeared for some years, but it was recently started again by the Colla El Pixav\u00ed. It begins at 3:45 pm at the Mary Magdalene Chapel and stops at every chapel and religious building on the way. The arrival at the Basilica of Our Lady of Lled\u00f3 is especially emotional, as this is the place where some people pray and where pilgrims sing the Hail Mary. It is also the place where the dignitaries going to the Mary Magdalene Chapel and the pilgrims coming back from it meet. At 7:00 pm the pilgrims arrive back in the city, preceded by the carros (motor-driven house-like constructions on wheels) which participate in the pilgrimage. They are followed by little traditional gaiatas, els Cavallers and the dignitaries, who walk in procession as far as the Plaza Mayor. Next comes the \"Penitents' Procession\", which is traditionally the first procession of Holy Week in Spain. ==== Gaiatas Parade ==== The Gaiatas Parade is part of la torn\u00e0 de la romer\u00eda. It allows the townspeople to show off the nineteen different gaiatas of the city (one per district), accompanied by the members of the respective sector commission. In addition, two more gaiatas are shown: one sponsored by a well-known savings bank that maintains the tradition of les xiquetes del meneo, and the other the gaiata of the city, which represents the whole city and was the one chosen as the best gaiata in the previous year's gaiata competition. The Gaiata Parade passes through the city with the festival queens and their corresponding courts of honour, as well as a representation of the City Council and of the 'Corporaci\u00f3 Municipal de Festes', the 'Junta de Festes de Castell\u00f3' and the Banda Municipal de Castell\u00f3. The only music which can be played at the parade is the classic Rotllo i Canya. It starts after la torn\u00e0 de la romeria. The members of the \"commission\" of gaiata infantil are followed by the members of the commission in charge of the main gaiata in the procession. One of the traditions of this act is les voltetes (the queen dances around her canya). People ask members of the commissions, only girls, to do the volteta so that they show their dresses. === Monday === Day of the Local Festival. ==== Parade of Festooned Carriages and Children\u2019s Parade ==== *With the participation of children, ancient scenes from Castell\u00f3n are reenacted, and there is an exhibition for children. ==== Lighting up of Gaiates ==== * All gaiatas are lit up at the same time for the public to admire them, and there is a competition in which the winner is the gaiata that receives the highest valuation from the jury. Later, every gaiata returns to its own district and presides over the events organized by every commission. A main walk takes place through the Parque Ribalta. But exceptionally, in 2009 and 2010, it took place along the Av. Rey Don Jaime due to roadworks. But, since 2012, it has also taken place in the Av. Rey Don Jaime. === During the whole week === During the week, a multitude of celebrations are held, the most important of which appear in the following list: * Masclet\u00e1, at 2:00 pm in Plaza del Primer Mol\u00ed. * Pyrotechnics Display, which starts about 11:00 pm at the area of Pau Gumbau, in the northeast of the city. * Bullfighting at the bullring of Castell\u00f3n. * The Nit M\u00e0gica (the Magic Night): a fire display performed by the Xarxa Teatre company.

From Monday to Saturday, around midnight. === The last Saturday === The Offering of Flowers to the patron of the city, the Our Lady of Lled\u00f3. One of the most emotive acts of this festival is performed by the men of the Gaiata 1, who make a floral tapestry with the flowers that have been brought by the people who have visited their basilica. The route to be taken is the following: Plaza Mayor, Calle Mayor, Plaza Maria Agustina, Avenida de la Mare de D\u00e9u del Lled\u00f3 and Paseo de Lled\u00f3, where we finally find the Basilica. === The last Saturday: Magdalena V\u00edtol! === The final day of the Magdalena Festival. ==== The Grand Finale Fireworks ==== A pyrotechnic event running through the main streets of the center of Castell\u00f3n takes place. The most daring run in front of the fireworks. ==== Magdalena V\u00edtol! ==== At the end of the pyrotechnic traca, in the Plaza Mayor, the queens of the festival shout from the balcony of the townhall: Magdalena and the crowd answers from below: V\u00edtol!, ending the festival for one year and beginning the next year's Magdalena Festival. == Elements of the festival == === Gaiatas === Gaiata of the city 2012, winner of the Gaiata's Contest of 2011 for the 15th Gaiata The gaiatas are the festive monuments of the Magdalena Festival. Antonio Pascual Felip, a member of the First Central Board of Celebration, defined the gaiata as \"a burst of light, with no fire or smoke\". The gaiatas are monuments that are usually bout 19 feet high and resemble the lanterns that the inhabitants of Castell\u00f3n used to find their way through the marshy ground at night. Also, the term gaiata refers to each of the 19 districts or neighbourhoods into which the city of Castell\u00f3n is divided for the festival: * Gaiata 1: Brancal de la Ciutat () * Gaiata 2: Fadrell ( y ) * Gaiata 3: Porta del Sol * Gaiata 4: L'Armelar () * Gaiata 5: Hort dels Corders * Gaiata 6: Farola - Ravalet * Gaiata 7: Cor de la ciutat * Gaiata 8: Portal de l'Om() * Gaiata 9: L'Espartera () * Gaiata 10: El Toll * Gaiata 11: Forn del Pl\u00e0 * Gaiata 12: El Grau * Gaiata 13: Sensal * Gaiata 14: Castalia * Gaiata 15: Sequiol () * Gaiata 16: Rafalafena * Gaiata 17: Tir de Colom () * Gaiata 18: Cr\u00e8mor * Gaiata 19: La Cultural During the festival, each district exhibits its gaiata in its central square. === Organizing bodies === * Federaci\u00f3 Municipal de Festes Junta de Festes de Castell\u00f3. * Federaci\u00f3 Gestora de Gaiates. === Collas === Ceramic Gaiata In 2010, a cultural association named \"Colla L'Esvar\u00f3\" with over 20 members, was the first colla to produce a seven feet tall gaiata. As noted in the local newspaper Peri\u00f3dico Mediterraneo on March 5, 2010 , this gaiata was conceived by Carlos Ben\u00edtez Barbero, a student of the course \"Arts Decoratives del M\u00f3n de la Festa de Castell\u00f3\" and at \"l'Escola d'art i Superior de Disseny de Castell\u00f3\" (a higher education college of art and design in Castell\u00f3n). In 2011, Carlos Ben\u00edtez Barbero and Javier Granell Vives also created the first ceramic gaiata, a thirteen feet tall construction entirely covered by trencadis (a type of mosaic created from broken tile shards), faux stained glass and over 300 LED lights. Further information about this can be found in both newspapers El Mundo and Levante published on April 3, 2011. == Traditions == == Symbols of the festival == == See also == * :es:Bandera de Castell\u00f3n de la Plana * :es:Castillo de Fadrell * Magdalena chapel * :es:Grao de Castell\u00f3n * Fiestas del Grao de Castell\u00f3n == References == == External links == * Junta de Fiestas de Castell\u00f3n * Magdalena.pdf Information leaflet about the Magdalena Festival on the official tourism web site of the Valencian community.
