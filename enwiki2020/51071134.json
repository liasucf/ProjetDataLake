They are composed of several clans and their ancient economic activities include fishing (owunaabi) in Lake Victoria and other rivers, crop farming (owulimi), and animal farming (owutuki). They were recognised in the 1995 Ugandan Constitution as one of the 56 identified tribes of Uganda. At the time of the 2014 Census, 99,884 respondents identified as Bagwe. The Bagwe speak Lugwe. == References == Category:Ethnic groups in Uganda ",
