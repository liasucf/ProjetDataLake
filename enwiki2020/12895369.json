    "text": "Various WWF Hasbro action figures from the early nineties The WWE Hasbro Action Figure line was an action figure toyline based on the Superstars of the WWE, produced by the toy company Hasbro from 1990 to 1994. The toys were made of plastic, with many featuring a signature action move based on their real life counterpart. Benefiting for being introduced during a sports entertainment boom period, these figures were among the most popular sports entertainment action figures of their time, and have since become collectors items. In good condition, an unopened figure can be viewed as being valued from anywhere between $20 to $1\u20132 thousand. This is a result of the production of variant figures produced in smaller numbers and limited time mailaway promotions. Much of the collection has been released on foreign (usually French or Spanish) cards, and are of far less value than cards that are all in English writing, due to their abundance. For example, a 1992 Ultimate Warrior Mint on an American Card can fetch upwards of $250\u2013$300 US, while exactly the same figure on a French card may get around $50\u2013$70 However, a very limited number of Hasbro action figures were released on a dual card (mainly being US/French) these figures have been seen to fetch in the region of $1000 per figure. Dusty Rhodes, Brutus Beefcake, Rick Rude, Roddy Piper, Mr. Perfect, Hulk Hogan, Macho King, Koko B. Ware and The Rockers are known examples. ==Complete collection== ===Series 1 - 1990=== (Series 1 through 6 were released on neon blue cards) \"http://wwfhasbrofigures.info\" * Hulk Hogan with Gorilla Press Slam!

In an ad promoting a Toys R Us and WWE partnership in the March 1991 WWE Magazine, tag team sets of Demolition, the Bushwhackers, the Rockers, and Rhythm and Blues appeared. The Rhythm and Blues set was never released, however both the Honky Tonk Man and Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine did see singles action figures released. Honky Tonk Man, as he appeared in the ad, was released in Series 2, however Valentine's figure in the advertisement appeared in his Rhythm and Blues attire, black hair, white jacket with black musical notes on it, white boots, and black trunks, whereas the figure released of Valentine in Series 3 was in his most regular singles attire of blond hair, black trunks and yellow boots. Fueling further collector speculation is the fact that on the back of some early foreign card figures, Rhythm and Blues was listed as an available tag team set. The exact reason this figure went unreleased is unknown, but it is assumed that it was due to the tag team breaking up a few months before the ad was printed. The Rhythm and Blues Greg Valentine was a hot topic among WWE Hasbro collectors because it was one of the few prototypes that had not turned up in a private collection. The figure has since been found and auctioned off via eBay for $13,400. Collector Matt Cera purchased the figure, after being sent a text message by WWE wrestler Zack Ryder, who initially had the highest bid on the figure and has since spent a total of $15,000 getting the figure insured and appraised. The figure is said to have been found in the attic of a former Hasbro employee. Valentine himself has increased speculation on the whereabouts of the figure, giving conflicting reports as to where the prototype(s) may be in various interviews. Other unreleased prototypes that have appeared in print include Brutus \"The Barber\" Beefcake in red and yellow attire meant to replicate his Mega Maniacs attire from WrestleMania IX to be in the Purple Carded set. He is believed to have been replaced by a Tatanka re-release from Series 6 due to his departure from the company. Shawn Michaels' Yellow Carded figure appeared in both print ads and on card backings using the spring-loaded armed feature found on the Virgil, Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts, El Matador, Hulk Hogan # 4, Papa Shango, Ted DiBiase # 3 and Billy Gunn but was changed to his released form. Randy Savage from Series 1 appeared in the 1991 J.C. Penney catalog in green trunks as part of an offer selling a ring and both Hulk Hogan and Savage action figures. Savage was sent out in his regularly released orange trunks. Both Shawn Michaels and Razor Ramon figures resembling those released on both Yellow and Blue cards have appeared in an unreleased print ad promoting the figures as mail-aways as a reward for collecting Hasbro points found on the back of the WWE Hasbro cards. Hasbro had plans to release an Ultimate Warrior figure with chest beating action. It is not known exactly why this figure wasn't made. Speculation is that it was never finished because Warrior had already left WWE or because Hasbro was unable to perfect the chest beating action. A prototype image of this figure can be found online. The figure has the same head as Warrior #2 and the body used is the same body used for the Demolition Smash figure. The figure was to use a new set of arms in order to have the figure beat its chest Hasbro had plans to release a Tugboat figure. The plan for this figure can be found online. The figure was cancelled because Tugboat turned heel and switched his name to Typhoon. The Tugboat figure's head and body would have been similar to the Typhoon figure but would have featured his Tugboat attire. There were plans for a Jim the Anvil Neidhart figure in Hart Foundation attire with the same head sculpt as the Anvil that was released. These plans can be found online as well. It is believed that this figure would've been released in a 2 pack along with Bret Hart (same figure as his first Hasbro release) and would've been in the same series as the Nasty Boys and the Legion of Doom. The Hart Foundation set was cancelled because the team broke up and Bret started a singles career. In 1993, Hasbro developed concept art for a series of 12 inch tall WWE figures, that would've included removable fabric clothing, similar to their popular G.I. Joe: Hall of Fame series, even sharing the body molds with the G.I. Joe figures. To date, the only concept art that has surfaced form this line is of Randy Savage. There were plans for another mail away series in 1994. The figures planned were Shawn Michaels and Razor Ramon. It believed that they wouldn't have been new molds but re-releases with possibly different colored outfits. Before the WWE canceled their deal with Hasbro there were plans for a series 12 on orange cards. There have even been prototype pictures online of the heads and artist sketches for this series. According to the sketches found, the series was to include: Lex Luger (in USA gear), Mo and Mabel from Men on a Mission, Jeff Jarrett, Bastion Booger (which would have reused the body of Earthquake), a repaint of the first Doink, and Diesel. ==Modifications from prototypes== * Series 1 saw only one change in the line when compared to the press photo shots of the prototypes; Hulk Hogan's shirt features a different font than the one that appeared on the final product. * Series 2 featured the unreleased Greg Valentine as well as a minor adjustment to Dusty Rhodes' expression. * Series 3 featured the Ultimate Warrior with yellow and white face paint on the prototype instead of yellow, purple, and white as he was released and the Texas Tornado with red and white tassels on the prototype instead of all red like how his figure was released. * Series 4's only change was Bret Hart's figure, who went from having silver and pink shades to only pink. * Series 5's Mountie prototype had a red cattle prod instead of the released black cattle prod and added Virgil's name to his trunks. * Series 6's Berzerker originally came with no cloak and a 2x4 accessory and Tatanka originally had blue script on his legs * Series 7 featured Kamala with a moon on his stomach as a pre-production variant but not in the promotional photo. The only changes made from the promotional photo were that of Owen Hart's final baggy pants and Shawn Michaels was changed from his original action of that of the Jake Roberts, Hulk Hogan # 4, Virgil, Papa Shango, El Matador, Ted DiBiase # 3 and Billy Gunn figures to Conceited Crush! action and a plastic gold chain was added to Razor Ramon when released (who also had no stubble). * Series 8 featured Bret Hart with Black elbow pads and Black stars on his boots and back of the trunks as a pre-production variant. Otherwise no major changes from the prototype images. * Series 9 featured changes to three figures. The original Rick Steiner prototype featured two differently designed boots, the original Doink the Clown design featured green pants with red stars, and Brutus \"The Barber\" Beefcake was originally slated to be in the line, but was replaced by a re-release of Series 6's Tatanka. * Series 10 saw no major changes from the prototype images. * Series 11 saw no major changes from the prototype images. Popular belief holds that a Dusty Rhodes figure has yellow boots as a variant. While these figures have been photographed, debate continues on whether they are the product of sun damage. ==Commonly-traded error cards and variants== Series 3's Sgt. Slaughter is a popular variant, offering a variant that features no name listed on the front of the card. This variant is very rare and is believed to have seen limited release in the Tri-State Region. Some of the more common error cards include \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper on a Series 2 Ultimate Warrior card, Billy Gunn on a Bart Gunn card, Bart Gunn on a Billy Gunn card, Giant Gonzalez on a Samu card, and Series 1 Ted DiBiase on a Rick Rude card. Other rare error cards include Bret Hart 1 carding with The Undertaker 1 Figure. ==Mattel's WWE retro figures== In 2016, Mattel announced that they would be releasing their own line of \"throwback\" WWE action figures, similar to the iconic style and packaging of the WWF Hasbro series. Mattel's new line of action figures were released exclusively to Walmart stores in the U.S. Mattel's WWE latest collectibles are deemed \"retro\" by the company because they are packaged in the same fashion as action figures made in the 1990s. === Series 1 - 2017 === * John Cena with \"Attitude Adjustment!\" * Roman Reigns with \"Super Punch!\" * The Undertaker with \"The Tombstone!\" * Brock Lesnar with \"F5 Action!\" * Kevin Owens with \"Pop-up Powerbomb!\" * Ultimate Warrior with \"Gorilla Press Slam!\" === Series 2 - 2017 === * The Rock with \"Rock Bottom!\" * Triple H with \"Pedigree!\" * Stone Cold Steve Austin with \"Stone Cold Stunner!\" * Kane with \"Tombstone!\" * Mankind with \"Mandible Claw!\" * Sting with \"Stinger Splash!\" === Series 3 - 2017 === * Seth Rollins with \"Pedigree!\" * Bill Goldberg with \"Spear!\" * Dean Ambrose with \"Dirty Deeds!\" * AJ Styles with \"The Phenomenal Forearm!\" === Series 4 - 2018 === * Ric Flair with \"Chop Down!\" * Finn Balor with \u201cCoup de Grace!\u201d * Sami Zayn with \"Helluvah Kick!\" * Kevin Owens with \"Pop-up Powerbomb!\" === Series 5 - 2018 === * Big E with \"The Big Ending!\" * Kofi Kingston with \"It's Trouble in Paradise!\" * Xavier Woods with \"The Honor Roll!\" * Macho Man Randy Savage with \"Macho Man Elbow!\" === Series 6 - 2018 === * Bray Wyatt with \u201cSister Abigail!\u201d * Daniel Bryan with \u201cRunning Knee!\u201d * Shinsuke Nakamura with \u201cKinshasa!\u201d * Sting (red and black makeup) with \u201cStinger Splash!\u201d === Series 7 - 2019 === * Chris Jericho with \u201cCodebreaker!\u201d * Kurt Angle with \u201cAngle Slam!\u201d * Shawn Michaels with \u201cSweet Chin Music!\u201d * Sheamus with \u201cBrogue Kick!\u201d === Series 8 - 2019 === * Braun Strowman with \u201cPowerslam!\u201d * Iron Sheik with \u201cGutwrench Suplex!\u201d * Jeff Hardy with \u201cPoetry in Motion\u201d * Zack Ryder with \u201cFistpump!\u201d === Series 9 - 2019 === * Goldust with \u201cCurtain Call!\u201d * Macho Man Randy Savage with \u201cFlying Elbow Drop!\u201d * Randy Orton with \u201cRKO!\u201d * Samoa Joe with \u201cSenton Splash!\u201d === Series 10 - 2019 === * Diesel with \u201cJackknife Powerbomb!\u201d * Elias with \u201cGuitar Smash!\u201d * Junkyard Dog with \u201cThump Powerslam\u201d * Matt Hardy with \u201cFlying Leg Drop!\u201d ==See also== *WCW Galoob Action Figures *Wrestling Superstars *WWE action figures *WWE Legends action figures (Mattel) ==References== ==External links== Category:WWE Category:1994 disestablishments in the United States Category:Products introduced in 1990 Category:Hasbro products Category:Action figures ",
