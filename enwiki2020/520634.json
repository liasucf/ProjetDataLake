    "text": "Crotales (), sometimes called antique cymbals, are percussion instruments consisting of small, tuned bronze or brass disks. Each is about in diameter with a flat top surface and a nipple on the base. They are commonly played by being struck with hard mallets. However, they may also be played by striking two disks together in the same manner as finger cymbals, or by bowing. Their sound is rather like a small tuned bell, only with a much brighter sound, and a much longer resonance. Like tuned finger cymbals, crotales are thicker and larger; they also have slight grooves in them. The name comes from the Greek crotalon, for a castanet or rattle. Modern crotales are arranged chromatically and have a range of up to two octaves. They are typically available in sets (commonly one octave) but may also be purchased individually. Crotales are treated as transposing instruments; music for crotales is written two octaves lower than the sounding pitch, to minimize ledger lines. Crotal bells are a type of small bell, mostly medieval. A different form of crotal is found in Prehistoric Ireland. The National Museum of Ireland and British Museum have several examples on display dating from the late Bronze Age () which were found in the Dowris Hoard, alongside various brass wind instruments. These are bronze cylinders in the rough shape of a bull's testicle, with a piece of baked clay or a pebble inside. It is presumed they functioned as a type of rattle. The hoard had 48 of them in total, in two sizes. Only two other examples are known, both Irish.Wallace, Patrick F., O'Floinn, Raghnall eds. Treasures of the National Museum of Ireland: Irish Antiquities, 2002, Gill & Macmillan, Dublin, Crotales, C6\u2013C8 range (by maker Paiste). == Uses == One of the earliest uses of crotales in the orchestral repertoire is Hector Berlioz's Rom\u00e9o et Juliette (1839). Other classical pieces featuring crotales include Claude Debussy's Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune and Maurice Ravel's own orchestration of his Alborada del gracioso.Karl Peinkofer and Fritz Tannigel, Handbook of Percussion Instruments, (Mainz, Germany: Schott, 1976), 61. The contemporary American composer John Adams also uses them in many of his more colourful orchestral pieces such as Short Ride in a Fast Machine.May, Thomas (ed.). The John Adams Reader: Essential Writings on an American Composer. Pompton Plains, N.J.: Amadeus, 2006. p. 108 Progressive rock drummer Neil Peart of Rush used crotales as part of his basic drum kit for several years and featured them in the introduction to YYZ. Progressive rock drummer Alan White of Yes uses crotales in the middle instrumental section of \"Awaken\" from Going for the One. Rock drummer and soundtrack composer Stewart Copeland featured crotales frequently in the music to the PlayStation One platforming- game Spyro the Dragon. Progressive rock/metal drummer Gavin Harrison uses ice bells as unpitched crotales on tour with Porcupine Tree. Experimental percussionist Eli Keszler uses dampened crotales in his music. == References == ==External links== *proper pronunciation of \"crotales\" Category:Cymbals Category:Pitched percussion Category:Keyboard percussion Category:Orchestral percussion Category:Early musical instruments Category:Plaque percussion idiophones Category:Drum kit components ",
