Lakshmi Mathur, an aspiring Jodhpur based Dream girl visits Mumbai to fulfil her dreams and falls in love with Sareen family's younger unmarried son Samar. Samar's cunning and ambitious elder sister-in-law Ayesha Roy is overprotective of her power and title, wanting to be irreplaceable and India's only Dream girl. However, Lakshmi has a talent and spark like her to become a Dream girl. Lakshmi tries to prove her skills, angering Ayesha, who finds out that Samar and Lakshmi love each other. Lakshmi passes all the challenges threw by Ayesha, making her insecure. Ayesha misleads her brother Karan (who has feelings for Lakshmi) that Lakshmi loves him. Eventually, Ayesha transfers all property rights of Navarang to her name and succeeds. Lakshmi and Samar get married. The property is set on fire; Samar, his elder brother Manav (Ayesha's husband) and Karan are send to extinguish the fire. Samar and Manav supposedly die due to a car crash. Samar's body is recovered; Manav's body isn't found. The Sareens find out Ayesha 'dark secret' who in fact is her twin sister, Aarti. They use Aarti (Aarti willingly helps) to fight back against Ayesha for their studio (Navarang). Aarti impersonates Ayesha and tells all the investors that she will pay all their money along with interest to them. There is a new entry in the show, Raghu. The story progresses and shows Ayesha trying to impress Raghu (Similar to season 1 where a poor character named Lakshmi (Played by Shraddha Arya) dreams of marrying a rich and wealthy businessman named Arjun Agnihotri (Played by Sudeep Sahir)). Aarti tries to get Navrang back to its former glory. Ayesha marries Raghu by deceiving everyone, pretending to be Aarti as Aarti and Raghu fall in love after many meetings where Raghu thinks that Aarti is Ayesha and then he finds out that it is Aarti instead. Aarti's face is burned and no one can tell which one is Ayesha or Aarti. Aarti is planning to take revenge on Ayesha. Ayesha has always caused Aarti pain and harm, yet Aarti kept forgiving her. Now, Aarti has a new face (Megha Gupta) and she appears as a strong character and fights against Aarti (who in real is Ayesha) to reveal her truth to everyone. After a few upturns and twists, Ayesha's truth is revealed to everyone by Aarti as 'Shikha' and Raghu (who helped Aarti with her face transplant and advice).But, Ayesha cunningly starts pretending as if she has lost her 4-5 year's memory and as a result, the police can not arrest her until her recovery. So, she is allowed to stay in the Sareen House till she remembers everything. In the meanwhile, Aarti and Raghu get married and soon have a girl child. Ayesha has her own intentions and as she gets the opportunity, she steals Aarti and Raghu's daughter and escapes with the child, leaving her career, stardom and dreamgirl title (which were by then ruined due to her evilness) for one single motive-to make the baby girl her own daughter and, to train the child, as the next DREAMGIRL. ==Cast== ===Main=== * Nikita Dutta as Lakshmi Samar Sareen (n\u00e9e Mathur) (2015-2016) - Samar's widow, Karan's love interest and Rishi Mathur's daughter * Shraddha Arya as Ayesha Manav Sareen/Ayesha Raghav Rastogi (n\u00e9e Roy) (2015-2016) - Karan's elder sister, Aarti's twin sister, Manav's widow and Raghu's first/ex-wife ** Shraddha Arya as Aarti Roy (Before Plastic Surgery) (2015) - Ayesha's twin sister and Karan's elder sister * Megha Gupta as Aarti Raghav Rastogi (n\u00e9e Roy) (After Plastic Surgery) (2015-2016) - Karan's elder sister, Ayesha's twin sister and Raghu's second wife * Sudeep Sahir as Raghav \"Raghu\" Rastogi (2015-2016) - Ayesha's second/ex-husband and Aarti's husband * Mohsin Khan as Samar Sareen (2015) - Manav's younger brother and Lakshmi's husband * Khalid Siddiqui as Manav Sareen (2015) - Samar's elder brother and Ayesha's first husband ===Recurring=== * Kunal Verma as Karan Roy (2015-2016) - Ayesha and Aarti's younger brother * Alina Kumar as Tanya (2015-2016) * Purvi Mundada as Richa (2016) * Virendra Singh as Rishi Mathur (2015) - Lakshmi's father * Aparna Kumar as Nandini Thakur (2015) * Chaitanya Choudhury as Abhimanyu (2015) * Rukhsar Rehman as Amrita (2015) * Geeta Tyagi as Shanti Mathur/Bua Ji (2015-2016) - Lakshmi's aunt and Rishi Mathur's sister ==Production and casting== The series is set in Jodhpur and Mumbai.Nikita Dutta turns 'dabbawali' on 'Dream Girl' set - Entertainment The show is produced by Shashi Mittal and Sumeet Mittal under their own Shashi-Sumeet Productions.\u092c\u0921\u093c\u0947 \u092a\u0930\u0926\u0947 \u0938\u0947 \u091b\u094b\u091f\u0947 \u092a\u0930\u0926\u0947 \u0924\u0915 \u091f\u0940\u0935\u0940 \u092a\u0930 \u0928\u091c\u093c\u0930 \u0906\u090f\u0917\u0940 '\u0921\u094d\u0930\u0940\u092e\u0917\u0930\u094d\u0932' _ Life Ok's new show Dream Girl - Hindi Filmibeat Shraddha Arya and Nikita Dutta play the female leads while Mohsin Khan plays the male lead role of Samar.'Dream Girl' co-stars Nikita Dutta and Shraddha Arya not getting along - Entertainment ==References== ==External links== * Category:2015 Indian television series debuts Category:Life OK original programming Category:Shashi Sumeet Productions series ",
