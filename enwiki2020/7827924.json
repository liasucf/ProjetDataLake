    "text": "Hsien Wu (; 24 November 1893 \u2013 8 August 1959) was a Chinese biochemist and geneticist. He was the first to propose that protein denaturation was a purely conformational change, i.e., corresponded to protein unfolding and not to some chemical alteration of the protein. Preliminary reports were presented before the XIIIth International Congress of Physiology at Boston (19\u201324 August 1929) and in the October 1929 issue of the American Journal of Physiology. This crucial idea was popularized later by Linus Pauling and Alfred Mirsky. Wu was born in Fuzhou, Fujian, China. He studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (undergraduate), and then trained at Harvard University (graduate) under Otto Folin, developing the first assay for blood sugar (Folin-Wu method). Wu then returned to China to a position at Peking Union Medical College, becoming head of the biochemistry department in 1924. At the end of that year, he married his research assistant Daisy Yen and would continue collaborating with her until his death in 1959. Wu left China in 1947 to reside in the United States. Wu's son, Ray J. Wu, became the Liberty Hyde Bailey Professor of Molecular Genetics and Biology at Cornell University, and was active in studying transgenic plants, particularly rice. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * Category:1893 births Category:1959 deaths Category:American biochemists Category:American geneticists Category:American people of Fuzhou descent Category:American scientists of Chinese descent Category:Biologists from Fujian Category:Chemists from Fujian Category:Chinese biochemists Category:Chinese Civil War refugees Category:Chinese emigrants to the United States Category:Chinese geneticists Category:Educators from Fujian Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category:Members of Academia Sinica Category:Peking Union Medical College faculty Category:People from Fuzhou Category:Republic of China people born during Qing Category:University of Alabama faculty ",
