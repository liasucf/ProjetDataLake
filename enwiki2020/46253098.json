    "text": "The 2014\u201315 FA Vase Final was the 41st final of the Football Association's cup competition for teams at levels 9-11 of the English football league system. The match was contested between North Shields, of the Northern League Division 1 (level 9), and Glossop North End, of the North West Counties League Premier Division (level 9). North Shields won the final 2-1 after extra time. ==Route to the Final== With a maximum of 9 rounds needed to reach the Final, North Shields played in every round. They played five away ties and three home ties plus the semi-final round, winning each round without need of a replay. Glossop on the other hand only played in seven of the rounds, receiving a bye into the First Round Proper. They were drawn with four away ties and two home ties, although both later rounds required a replay to decide the winner. This was North Shields' first visit to Wembley since 1969 when they won the FA Amateur Cup final. In comparison, Glossop were visiting the home of football for the second time in six years, having lost the 2009 FA Vase Final to another Northern League team, Whitley Bay. ==Build up== After a meeting at Wembley Stadium the week after the semi-finals, where both teams met with The Football Association to decide the choice of dressing rooms, the kit selections and TV rights, tickets for the final were released on sale on 1 April 2015, with Glossop and North Shields expecting to sell thousands of tickets compared with an average home crowds of 340 and 322 respectively. In the week before the final, Glossop trained at Everton's Finch Farm on the Sunday and at Arsenal's Training Centre on the Friday before the final. Glossop set up a club shop in their town to sell Wembley merchandise. ==Match== ===Details=== {| width=92% |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK ||1 ||Greg Hall |- |DF ||2 ||Michael Bowler |- |DF ||3 ||Matt Russell |- |DF ||4 ||Kelvin Lugsden |- |DF ||5 ||Dave Young (c) |- |MF ||6 ||Martin Parker |- |MF ||7 ||Lee Blackshaw || || |- |MF ||18||Sam Hare || || |- |FW ||9 ||Tom Bailey |- |MF ||10||Kieran Lugsden |- |MF ||11||Eddie Moran || || |- |colspan=3|Substitutes: |- | ||12||Daniel White || || |- | ||14||Ben Richardson |- | ||15||Sam Hind || || |- | ||16||Sam Grimshaw || || |- | ||17||Richard Gresty |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=4|Chris Willcock |} | |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=center |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK ||19||Christopher Bannon |- |DF ||22||Stuart Donnison |- |DF ||3 ||John Grey |- |DF ||5 ||John Parker |- |DF ||6 ||Kevin Hughes (c) |- |MF ||4 ||Michael McKeown |- |MF ||10||Ben Richardson || |- |MF ||7 ||Denver Morris |- |FW ||11||Dean Holmes || || |- |FW ||17||James Luccock || || |- |MF ||19||Gareth Bainbridge || || |- |colspan=3|Substitutes: |- | ||2 ||Curtis Coppen |- | ||8 ||Kieran Wrightson || || |- | ||12||Marc Lancaster |- | ||14||Adam Forster || || |- | ||20||Ryan Carr || || |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=4|Graham Fenton |} |} {| width=82% style=\"font-size:90%\" |width=50% valign=top| Man of the match *Denver Morris Match officials *Assistant referees: **Wade Norcott (Essex FA) **Daniel Cook (Hampshire FA) *Fourth official: Chris Kavanagh (Manchester FA) |width=50% valign=top| Match rules *90 minutes. *30 minutes of extra-time if necessary. *Penalty shoot-out if scores still level. *Five named substitutes. *Maximum of three substitutions. |} ==References== Category:FA Vase Finals FA Vase Final FA Vase Final Category:Events at Wembley Stadium FA Vase Final ",
