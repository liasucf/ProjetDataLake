Douglas A-26 Invader as flown by the 424th During the Korean War, Tactical Air Command (TAC) trained aircrews at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. The three squadrons of the 4400th Combat Crew Training Group performing this mission were Air National Guard (ANG) units that had been called up for the war. At the start of 1953, these squadrons were returned to state control and the 424d Bombardment Squadron took over the mission, personnel, and equipment of the 122d Bombardment Squadron of the Louisiana ANG.See Mueller, p. 315 In January 1954, the group mission shifted to tactical bombardment and it was redesignated the 4400th Bombardment Group. As the group began to anticipate the transition to Martin B-57 Canberra aircraft, TAC decided to replace the Table of Distribution 4400th group and its squadrons with the regular 345th Bombardment Group, which took over their mission in July 1954.See Maurer, Combat Units, pp. 225\u2013226 The squadron was activated in 1958 at Lincoln Air Force Base, Nebraska. The squadron also began sending its aircraft to AMARC at Davis\u2013Monthan in late 1961, and the squadron went non-operational. It was inactivated on 1 January 1962. ==Lineage== * Constituted as the 35th Reconnaissance Squadron, (Heavy) on 28 January 1942 : Activated on 15 April 1942 : Redesignated 424th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) on 22 April 1942 : Redesignated 424th Bombardment Squadron, Heavy in 1944 : Inactivated on 26 December 1945 * Redesignated 424th Bombardment Squadron, Light on 15 November 1952 : Activated on 1 January 1953 : Inactivated on 19 July 1954 * Redesignated 424th Bombardment Squadron, Medium on 11 August 1958 : Activated on 1 September 1958 : Discontinued and inactivated on 1 January 1962 ===Assignments=== * 307th Bombardment Group, 15 April 1942 \u2013 26 December 1945 * 4430th Air Base Wing (attached to 4400th Combat Crew Training Group), 1 January 1953 * 4400th Combat Crew Training Group (later Bombardment Group), 1 May 1953 \u2013 19 July 1954 * 307th Bombardment Wing, 1 September 1958 \u2013 1 January 1962. ===Stations=== * Geiger Field, Washington, 15 April 1942 * Ephrata Army Air Base, Washington, 26 May 1942 * Sioux City Army Air Base, Iowa, 29 September 1942 \u2013 20 October 1942 * Dillingham Airfield, Hawaii Territory, 2 November 1942 : Operated from Henderson Field, Midway Atoll, 22 December 1942 \u2013 24 December 1942 : Operated from Funafuti Airfield, Nanumea, Gilbert Islands, 20 January-c. 1 February 1943 : Operated from Luganville Airfield, Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, c. 6 February 1943 \u2013 c. 18 March 1943 * Koli Airfield, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, 18 March 1943 : Operated from Munda Airfield, New Georgia, Solomon Islands, 28 January 1944 \u2013 15 February 1944 * Momote Airfield, Los Negros, Admiralty Islands, 13 May 1944 * Wakde Airfield, Netherlands East Indies, 22 August 1944 : Operated from: Kornasoren (Yebrurro) Airfield, Noemfoor, Schouten Islands, 26 September 1944 \u2013 c. 8 November 1944 * Wama Airfield, Morotai, Netherlands East Indies, 10 November 1944 * Clark Field, Luzon, Philippines, 5 September 1945 \u2013 7 December 1945 * Camp Stoneman, California, 26 December 1945 * Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, 1 January 1953 \u2013 19 July 1954 * Lincoln Air Force Base, Nebraska, 1 September 1958 \u2013 1 January 1962. ===Aircraft=== * Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, 1942 * Consolidated B-24 Liberator, 1942\u20131945 * Douglas B-26 Invader, 1953\u20131954 * Boeing B-47 Stratojet, 1958\u20131961. ==See also== ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== * * * ==External links== Category:Military units and formations established in 1940 Category:Bombardment squadrons of the United States Air Force Category:Bombardment squadrons of the United States Army Air Forces ",
