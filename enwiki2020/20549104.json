He is currently the leader of the opposition SPD party bloc in the Hessian state parliament. He lost his bid for the office of Minister-President of Hesse in the January 2009 Hessian state election, where he had challenged incumbent Roland Koch (CDU). Sch\u00e4fer-G\u00fcmbel has been deputy leader of the SPD since December 2013. He is one of three ad interim successors of former SPD leader Andrea Nahles in the transition phase until a new leader will be voted in later in 2019. ==Life== Sch\u00e4fer-G\u00fcmbel was born to a West German soldier stationed in the far south of Bavaria in Oberstdorf.

He became a local adviser to the SPD, a party which he had joined at the age of 17, and was also a local delegate of the SPD in the local government (Kreistag) in Gie\u00dfen. He quickly moved up the ranks in the Hessian SPD party machine, and was a candidate on the SPD party list during the 2003 Landtag election. He gained a seat in 2003, and has been a member of the Hessian Landtag ever since. He was re-elected in the 2008 Landtag election and in the 2009 special election; however he was elected as part of the party list and not on a direct mandate, as he lost his local race to the CDU candidate. In late 2008, following a political crisis and Andrea Ypsilanti's resignation, Sch\u00e4fer-G\u00fcmbel became the SPD's party leader in Hesse and the SPD candidate for minister-president of Hesse. However, the SPD fared poorly in the subsequent 2009 special election, which allowed the CDU's Roland Koch to remain in office.
