From 1935 to 1956, the two teams both competed in the Missouri Valley Conference. In those 22 seasons, the conference champion would be won by either Oklahoma State or Tulsa 16 times.\"Missouri Valley Conference Champions\" They played each other annually from 1926 to 1965. Then played again regularly from 1981 to 2000. The two universities are approximately 70 miles apart via the Cimarron Turnpike. The Bank of Oklahoma began a sponsorship deal in 2017 with Oklahoma State and Tulsa to name the series the Bank of Oklahoma Turnpike Classic. The next scheduled game between Oklahoma State and Tulsa is scheduled for September 11, 2021 in Stillwater, as part of annual home-and-home series that extends through 2031 with a hiatus in 2022 and 2023.https://fbschedules.com/ncaa/oklahoma-state/ ==Quotes on the series== Oklahoma State head coach Jimmy Johnson said in 1982: \"OU and OSU, that's a rivalry, but not OSU and Tulsa.\" In contrast, Tulsa head coach John Cooper said about the Oklahoma State\u2013Tulsa series: \"It's a natural rivalry, and I don't think you can underestimate the importance of that.\" In 2008, The Oklahoman sportswriter Berry Tramel wrote that this series \"should be played regularly\" because Tulsa had improved over the decade. However, Tramel changed his opinion in 2017: \"OSU-Tulsa has faded away. . . . Conference realignment and economic realities have made it more difficult for age-old rivals to schedule, especially when they end up on different competitive planes.\" ==Notable games== ===1945=== Oklahoma A&M; 12 \u2013 Tulsa 6 Oklahoma A&M; entered week 6 undefeated (5\u20130) ranked #11 and hosted a Tulsa team who had dropped to #19 after their first loss to Indiana the previous week.

The Golden Hurricane scored a field goal on their first drive to take an early lead, but were unable to contain the Cowboys' potent offense and quickly fell behind for good. The team was further hindered by the loss of G.J. Kinne near the end of the first quarter, forcing them to rely heavily on the run for the remainder of the game. ==Accomplishments by the two rivals== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style= | Accomplishments ! style= | Oklahoma State ! style= | Tulsa |- | National titles | 1 | 0 |- | Conference titles | 10 | 35 |- |- | Bowl appearances | 30 | 21 |- | CFP appearances | 0 | 0 |- | Postseason bowl record | 19-11 | 10-11 |- | Consensus All-Americans | 19 | 2 |- | Heisman Trophies | 1 | 0 |- | All- time program record | 567-520-41 | 489-457-18 |- | All-time win percentage | | |- |} == Game results == == See also == * List of NCAA college football rivalry games ==References== Category:College football rivalries in the United States Category:Oklahoma State Cowboys football Category:Tulsa Golden Hurricane football Category:1914 establishments in Oklahoma ",
