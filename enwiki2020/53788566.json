    "text": "The 2015 NECBL season was the 22nd season of the New England Collegiate Baseball League, a wood bat collegiate summer baseball league. The same twelve 2014 teams returned for the 2015 season, as the divisional alignment remained the same. The Vermont Mountaineers repeated as regular season champions in the Northern Division, while the Newport Gulls edged the Mystic Schooners by a game to claim the Southern Division. The Mountaineers would top the North Adams SteepleCats in the Divisional Finals round of the postseason to advance to the NECBL Championship Series. There they met Mystic, which stunned the reigning champion Gulls by sweeping them in the South Divisional Finals. Vermont rallied after losing Game 1 of the best-of-three Championship Series, and it took a squeeze play in the top of the 10th inning to score the deciding run for the Mountaineers, who won the franchise's third championship and first since 2007. == Regular season standings == === Northern Division === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Team !Wins !Losses !PCT !GB |- |Vermont Mountaineers |25 |16 |.610 | - |- |Sanford Mainers |23 |18 |.561 | 2 |- |North Adams SteepleCats |21 |21 |.500 | 4.5 |- |Laconia Muskrats |21 |21 |.500 | 4.5 |- |Valley Blue Sox |19 |23 |.452 | 6.5 |- |Keene Swamp Bats |13 |29 |.310 |12.5 |} === Southern Division === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Team !Wins !Losses !PCT !GB |- |Newport Gulls |27 |15 |.643 | - |- |Mystic Schooners |26 |16 |.619 | 1 |- |New Bedford Bay Sox |22 |20 |.524 | 5 |- |Ocean State Waves |21 |21 |.500 | 6 |- |Plymouth Pilgrims |20 |22 |.476 | 7 |- |Danbury Westerners |13 |29 |.310 |14 |} ==References== Category:New England Collegiate Baseball League Category:2015 in baseball Category:2015 in American sports ",
