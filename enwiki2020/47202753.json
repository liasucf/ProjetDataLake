It stars Jake McDorman as Brian Finch, who discovers the power of a mysterious nootropic drug by the name of NZT-48. This drug unlocks the full potential of the human brain and gives its user enhanced mental faculties. It is a spin-off to the film of the same name, which in turn was based on the 2001 novel The Dark Fields, and takes place four years after the events of the movie. The series was ordered by CBS on May 8, 2015. On October 23, 2015, CBS picked up Limitless for a full season of 22 episodes.

With the mysterious US Senator Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) providing him with an immunity shot to counteract NZT's deadly side effects, Brian uses his enhanced abilities to help FBI agent Rebecca Harris (Jennifer Carpenter).
