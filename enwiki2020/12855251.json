    "text": "Tanygnathus is a genus of parrots in the Psittaculini tribe, of the superfamily of Psittacoidea (true parrots). Its species are native to Southeast Asia and Melanesia. ==Taxonomy== The genus Tanygnathus was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Wagler in 1832. The type species was subsequently designated as the great-billed parrot (Tanygnathus megalorynchos) by the English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1840. The name Tanygnathus combines the Ancient Greek words tanu\u014d \"to stretch out\" and gnathos \"jaw\". The genus contains four species: * Great-billed parrot, Tanygnathus megalorynchos * Blue-naped parrot, Tanygnathus lucionensis * Blue- backed parrot, Tanygnathus sumatranus * Black-lored parrot, Tanygnathus gramineus Genetic analysis has supported reclassifying all 4 species under Psittacula, making Tanygnathus a synonym of the former genus. ==References== Category:Psittaculini Category:Bird genera ",
