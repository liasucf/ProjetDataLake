Archived from the original on December 15, 2005. Retrieved June 29, 2013. is a fictional character from Capcom's Mega Man video game series. Proto Man first appeared in the 1990 video game Mega Man 3, and was known as Break Man (though Proto Man's in-game appearance differs slightly from Break Man's). At the end of Mega Man 3, Dr. Light reveals that Break Man's actual name is Proto Man, and that he is Mega Man's older brother. == Appearances == ===Video games=== Proto Man is the early prototype of Mega Man that made his first appearance in NES game Mega Man 3 (1990) and is found in the Magnet Man, Hard Man, Shadow Man and Gemini Man levels. He has a grey and red uniform and a yellow scarf. He wears a red helmet with a silvery decoration and a dark visor which hides his eyes. He always appears after his distinctive whistle. At the end of Mega Man 2: The Power Fighters, it is revealed by Dr. Light that Proto Man's body has a fatal defect in its energy system, and as a result is in great pain and has a more limited lifespan. In Mega Man Powered Up, Proto Man reveals in a dialog with the Yellow Devil that his reactor is already unstable, which due to being a Nuclear reactor, could result in disaster with \"one big shock\". In the various Mega Man manga, Proto Man has appeared in casual clothing, usually standing atop a building wearing a trenchcoat, sunglasses, slacks, and black shoes. His scarf is tucked into the trenchcoat, but still noticeable. He can be unlocked as a playable character in Mega Man Powered Up, the PlayStation Portable remake of the first Mega Man game, as well as in Mega Man 9 as part of that game's extra downloadable content in the original release or in the Legacy Collection 2 release of Mega Man 9 by either completing the game or by using the secret code at the Mega Man 9 title screen.Mega Man Legacy Collection 2 is available now! -Capcom Unity He is also a playable character in Mega Man 10. ===Other appearances=== In the Ruby-Spears Mega Man cartoon, Proto Man, having been reprogrammed by Dr. Wily, is villainous and serves as Dr. Wily's main henchman alongside Cut Man and Guts Man in the cartoon series, having similar capabilities as Mega Man and identical to his appearance in the games except the fact that he lacks his shield. He is obsessed with destroying Mega Man and sometimes gets in the way of Wily's plots by going out of his way to do so. In Dead Rising 2: Off the Record the player can unlock a Proto Man costume, which can be used by the main character Frank West. Proto Man also appeared in Mega Mans comics published by Archie Comics. Another spin-off of the series, Mega Man Battle Network, features ProtoMan.EXE as a friend and rival of the protagonist, MegaMan.EXE. In this series, the characters are computer programs called \"NetNavi\" rather than robots and exist only in the digital world, although connections to the real world exist and progress through the series. Each person has his or her own NetNavi, and are known as \"operators\". MegaMan.EXE's operator is Lan, the series protagonist along with MegaMan, while ProtoMan.EXE's operator is Chaud, Lan's rival and a master operator, working with law enforcement. Proto Man also features as a central character in the works of the band the Protomen, namely in their retelling of the Mega Man series as a dystopian rock opera. Proto Man makes a cameo in Nova's ending in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 as a member of the new \"Mega Nova Corps.\" In Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, Proto Man's armor and helmet (through paid DLC) can be worn by Mii fighters. He also appears as a collectible trophy in the Wii U version. In the following game, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, Proto Man appears alongside Bass in Mega Man's updated Final Smash. On September 4, 2019, it was confirmed on Nintendo's official YouTube Channel that the Proto Man costume for the Mii Fighters would be returning in Ultimate as DLC and was released later that day.Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Mii Fighter Costumes #3 - Nintendo Switch He is a playable character in the fan-made Mega Man 2.5D. ==Reception== Proto Man's character was generally received with positive critical response by publications for video games. IGN's Colin Moriarty said Proto Man is \"the biggest addition\" to Mega Man 10, adding \"playing as Proto Man adds more depth to the game, and gives you a reason to play through again once you've beaten Mega Man 10.\" Complex ranked eight a Proto Man action figure on its list of \"The 50 Coolest Video Game Action Figures and Statues\". GamesRadar listed him and Mega Man as having one of the best brotherly rivalries in gaming, commenting that he is \"quite the anti-hero\" and \"the cool cat of the two.\" The same site also said \"Everyone loves Mega Man, but some fans prefer the bad boy style of his rival/ally Proto Man\", and listed Proto Man as one of the 30 best Capcom characters of the last 30 years, adding \"It's hard to say who\u2019s the better robot slayer, but Proto Man\u2019s scarf and shield at least make him the more fashionable of the two.\" ==References== == External links == * Category:Male characters in video games Category:Mega Man characters Category:Robot characters in video games Category:Robot superheroes Category:Video game characters introduced in 1990 Category:Video game characters who can teleport Category:Video game bosses Category:Video game sidekicks ",
