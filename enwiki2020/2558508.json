    "text": "Hwaseong Fortress. Jeongjo of Joseon (28 October 1752 \u2013 18 August 1800) was the 22nd ruler of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea (r. 1776\u20131800). He made various attempts to reform and improve the nation of Korea. He was preceded by his grandfather King Yeongjo (r. 1724\u20131776) and succeeded by his son King Sunjo (r. 1800\u20131834). Some say Jeongjo is one of the most successful and visionary rulers of the Joseon Dynasty ushering it into a Golden Age. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Born as Yi San (\u674e\u7958), he was the son of Crown Prince Sado (who was put to death by his own father, King Yeongjo) and Lady Hyegyeong (who wrote an autobiography, The Memoirs of Lady Hyegyeong detailing her life as the ill-fated Crown Princess of Korea). His elder brother Crown Prince Uiso died in infancy. His mother Lady Hyegyeong's collection of memoirs serves as a significant source of historical information on the political happenings during the reigns of King Yeongjo (her father-in-law), King Jeongjo (her son), and King Sunjo (her grandson). In 1762, his father, Crown Prince Sado, was executed by King Yeongjo (Crown Prince Sado's father and Prince Yi San's grandfather) after long conflicts and Sado's years of mental illness. Crown Prince Sado opposed the ruling party Noron party. Eight years later Yi San asked to visit Sado's living quarter but his Grandfather King Yeongjo refused. So he refused to attend Crown Prince Sado's funeral. On February 21, 1764, Yi San became the adoptive son of Crown Prince Hyojang and Princess Consort Hyosun by the order of King Yeongjo.\uc778\uc815\uc804 \uc6d4\ub300\uc5d0\uc11c \uce5c\ud788 \ud5a5\uc744 \uc804\ud558\ub2e4. \uc721\uc0c1\uad81\uc5d0 \ubc30\uc54c\ud558\uace0 \ucc3d\uc758\uad81\uc5d0 \ub4e4\ub974\ub2e4 Crown Prince Hyojang was the elder half-brother of his father, Crown Prince Sado. Crown Prince Hyojang though, had died during his childhood. King Yeongjo made Yi San a part of Hyojang's family because he was concerned that Yi San, who was Sado's son and successor, would be opposed. The Noron faction protested Yi San's legitimacy as the royal successor under the claim that Yi San was the 'Son of a prisoner' or 'Son of a psycho' and thus ineligible to succeed the throne. This was a major source of vexation for King Yeongjo for an extended period. After 1762 to 1777, some members of Noron attempted to deport Jeongjo for his relation to Crown Prince Sado and open the path of succession for his half-brothers Prince Eunjeon, Prince Euneon and, Prince Eunshin. His grand uncle Hong In-han and Chung Hu-kyom, adopted son of Princess Hwa wan, were amongst them. When he was the Crown Prince, King Jeongjo met Hong Guk-yeongDigital Korean studies (Korean site) http://www.koreandb.net/koreanking/html/person/pki60022.htm (\ud64d\uad6d\uc601, \u6d2a\u570b\u69ae), a controversial politician who first strongly supported Jeongjo's accession and toiled to improve the king's power, but ended up being expelled because of his desire for power. Another helper was Kim Jong-su(\uae40\uc885\uc218, \u91d1\u937e\u79c0), in spite of being a member of Noron. In 1775, one year before King Yeongjo's death, King Yeongjo was appointed regent for him. However, King Yeongjo did not give him any military power. Jeongjo spent much of his reign trying to clear his father's name. He also moved the court to the city of Suwon to be closer to his father's grave. He built Hwaseong Fortress to guard the tomb. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. ===Accession=== The era before his rule was in disorder as his father was killed by royal decree of his own father, King Jeongjo's grandfather. King Yeongjo's ultimate decision to execute Crown Prince Sado was greatly influenced by other politicians who were against the Crown Prince. After King Yeongjo's death and on the day that Jeongjo became the King of Joseon, he sat on his throne in the throne room and looked at everyone and said, \"I am the son of the late Crown Prince Sado...\"\"\uacfc\uc778\uc740 \uc0ac\ub3c4\uc138\uc790\uc758 \uc544\ub4e4\uc774\ub2e4\" Ohmynews 2006.10.13. This was a bold statement that sent shivers down the spines of all the politicians who were complicit in his father's death. During his accession, he also issued a royal decree that his mother, Lady Hyegyeong, be a Dowager Queen since his father, her husband, was supposed to be the King before him. Thus, she became the Queen Dowager, the widow of Crown Prince Sado. From then on, King Jeongjo experienced many turbulent periods, but overcame them with the aid of Hong Guk-yeong, Kim Chong-su. In 1776, Hong Sang-beom, Hong Kye-neung and other some member of Noron was attempted of a military coup d'\u00e9tat and kill him, but their plans was exposed early. Some assassins were secretly in royal palace but Jeongjo repulsed assassins and personally arrested a suspect. Jeongjo executed Hong Sang-beom, Hong Kye- neung, other some member of Norons, but put to death Prince Eunjeon, Hong In- han, and Chung Hu-kyom. In 1785 he erected Changyongyeong (\uc7a5\uc6a9\uc601, \u58ef\u52c7\u71df), this is the King's royal bodyguards. Before In 1782, Jeongjo selected by competitive examination some officers, who were then organized into the unit of Changyongyeong. Before this time was the Naekeunwe, royal bodyguards of Joseon dynasties created by Taejong of Joseon in 1407. But Jeongjo mistrusted the Naekeumwi, so he personally created Changyonegyeong. ===Renaissance=== King Jeongjo led the new renaissance of the Joseon Dynasty, but was initially stopped by continuing the policy of Yeongjo's Tangpyeong rule. He tried to control the politics of the whole nation to advance and further national progress. He made various reforms throughout his reign, notably establishing Kyujanggak (\uaddc\uc7a5\uac01), a royal library. The primary purpose of Kyujanggak was to improve the cultural and political stance of Joseon and to recruit gifted officers to help run the nation. Jeongjo also spearheaded bold new social initiatives, including opening government positions to those who were previously barred because of their social status. He had some knowledge of humanities and philosophy, Neo-Confucianism. One of the King's gentlemen, Kim Jong-su, imprinted onto the king and in tandem became a great father and a great teacher for him. He studied for a long time and read various books. Jeongjo had the support of the many Silhak scholars who supported Jeongjo's regal power, including Scholars Jeong Yak-yong, Pak Ji-won, Pak Je-ga and Yu Deuk-gong. His reign also saw the further growth and development of Joseon's popular culture. Jeongjo was resolutely selected for member of Soron and Namin party, reason selection background was checks and balances, strengthening of royal authority. He was opposed to new fashions in the composition style of Korean writing and personally taught composition to some intellectuals and bureaucrats called Munchebanjong(\ubb38\uccb4\ubc18\uc815 \u6587\u9ad4\u53cd\u6b63). ===Death=== In his final years, Jeongjo arranged for the marriage of his second son and successor Sunjo of Joseon to Lady Kim of the Andong clan, daughter of Kim Cho-sun, but did not live to see his son's marriage. In 1800, Jeongjo died suddenly under uncertain circumstances at the age of 47, without seeing much of his life's work come to fruition under his son, Sunjo.National Heritage \u2013 Hwaseong There are many books regarding the mystery behind his death, and speculation as to the cause of his death continues even today. He is buried with his wife, Queen Hyoui, at the royal tomb of Geolleung (\uac74\ub989, \u5065\u9675) in the city of Hwaseong. == Family == *Father: King Jangjo of Joseon (13 February 1735 \u2013 12 July 1762) (\uc870\uc120 \uc7a5\uc870)He is given the posthumous title, \"Jangjo\" (\uc7a5\uc870) **Grandfather : King Yeongjo of Joseon (31 October 1694 \u2013 22 April 1776) (\uc870\uc120 \uc601\uc870) **Grandmother : Royal Noble Consort Yeong of the Jeonui Lee clan (15 August 1696 \u2013 23 August 1764) (\uc601\ube48 \uc774\uc528) *Mother: Queen Heongyeong of the Pungsan Hong clan (6 August 1735 \u2013 13 January 1816) (\ud5cc\uacbd\uc655\ud6c4 \ud64d\uc528)Daughter of Hong Bong-han (\ud64d\ubd09\ud55c) and Lady Yi of the Hansun Yi clanQueen Heongyeong is also called \"Lady Hyegyeong\" (\ud61c\uacbd\uad81) **Grandfather : Hong Bong-Han (1713 \u2013 1778) (\ud64d\ubd09\ud55c) **Grandmother : Lady Lee of the Hansan Lee clan (1713 \u2013 1755) (\ud55c\uc0b0 \uc774\uc528) *Consorts and their Respective Issue(s): # Queen Hyoui of the Cheongpung Kim clan (5 January 1754 \u2013 10 April 1821) (\ud6a8\uc758\uc655\ud6c4 \uae40\uc528)Daughter of Kim Si-muk (\uae40\uc2dc\ubb35) and Lady Hong of the Namyang Hong clan # Royal Noble Consort Ui of the Changnyeong Seong clan (6 August 1753 \u2013 4 November 1786) (\uc758\ube48 \uc131\uc528)Daughter of Seong Yun-u (\uc131\uc724\uc6b0) and Lady Im.
