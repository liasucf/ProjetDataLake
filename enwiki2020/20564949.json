    "text": "The Australian National University Union Incorporated (ANU Union), established in 1965, is an inactive not-for-profit association that previously operated commercial premises at The Australian National University. It is not to be confused with the Australian National University Student Association, which despite its name, is recognised as the University's Students' Union. == History == The Union was set up in 1965 to provide a meeting place for students, graduates and staff. The original charter indicated that the Union would be an incorporated body based on \u201csound business principles\u201d. The Union evolved from the Student\u2019s Association. It concentrated on small scale activities such as debates, films, music, food and even art exhibitions. In 1965 the Union was established in what is now the Pauline Griffin Building and in 1973 it moved to the former Union Building in Union Court. Due to the redevelopment of Union Court, the Union vacated its premises in 2017. In March of 2019, the Union reopened in a new location at 3 Rimmer St ACTON.https://anuobserver.org/2019/03/25/anu-union-precinct-to-open-on- thursday/ == Membership == All students of the University are automatically ANU Union members. Membership is also open to ANU staff and graduates.http://www.anu.edu.au/sas/handbook/2009/2009HB.pdf == Purpose == The objects of the Union are: # to provide a recognised meeting place and social centre for its members; # to promote the intellectual, social and general welfare of the University community, and # actively to encourage and support all ANU clubs and societies which include members of the Union. ==Union Business Operations== The ANU Union now sports a bar, several food outlets, two beer gardens and a refectory. It provides discount food and drink to students as well as an affordable function space. ==Board of directors== The Union Board is the governing body of the ANU Union.
