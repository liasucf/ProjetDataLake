    "text": "Michelle, also known as MJ, is a fictional character portrayed by Zendaya in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film franchise, an original character within the media franchise that pays homage to Mary Jane \"MJ\" Watson, a common love interest of Spider-Man in comic books and various media. Depicted as a smart, snarky supporting character and classmate of Peter Parker in Spider- Man: Homecoming and serves as the main romantic interest for the titular superhero in Spider-Man: Far From Home, an unique aspect for original characters within the MCU franchise and upon Spider-Man feature films preceding it. Initially Zendaya's role was the subject of controversy due to the belief that an African American had been cast to portray Mary Jane Watson, though her portrayal of a revealed new character received favorable reviews after release as a strong female supporting cast member in a feminism perspective later on, additionally receiving the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the second film. == Creation and concept == According to Spider-Man: Homecoming co-screenwriter John Francis Daley, MJ was intended as a reinvention of Mary Jane Watson. While her nickname reveal was an homage to the supporting character within the comic books and other Spider- Man media, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige confirmed she is an original Marvel Cinematic Universe character. Feige added: \"Peter\u2019s had a lot of friends over the years in the comics, and a lot of schoolmates and characters he\u2019s interacted with. It wasn\u2019t just Mary Jane Watson; it wasn\u2019t just Gwen Stacy; it wasn\u2019t just Harry Osborn. So we were very interested in the other characters, and that\u2019s where Liz came from and that\u2019s where the version of the character Michelle came from.\" Jon Watts, director of Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home, likened the character to Ally Sheedy's Allison Reynolds from The Breakfast Club (1985) and Linda Cardellini's Lindsay Weir from Freaks and Geeks (1999\u20132000). ===Etymology=== Dave McNary, writing for Variety, used the surname \"Jones\" for the character in an article about Spider-Man: Homecoming. Secondary sources subsequently commonly list her surname as \"Jones\". In Spider-Man: Far From Home, a view of the character's passport shows only the name Michelle. == Portrayal and characterization == Zendaya portrays the character within the MCU. MJ is portrayed by actress Zendaya within the Marvel Cinematic Universe as a student at Midtown School of Science and Technology as one of Peter Parker's classmates best friends, and years after Liz Toomes leaves Peter, she and Peter start a romantic relationship. MJ is snarky and coy, but also kind and friendly. She often acts as the voice of reason, and she provides the troubled Peter with much-needed comfort and advice. Her character is depicted as a brainy girl and a bookworm; Zendaya described her character \"as a \"very dry, awkward, intellectual\" and that because of her character's brilliance she has more of an introverted personality which makes her come off as weird to other people not like that. Unlike previous supporting females within Spider-Man films, such as Mary Jane Watson from Spider-Man (2002), Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007) and Gwen Stacy from The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014), she does not start off as a romantic interest, nor is she depicted as a damsel in distress. Instead the character Liz Toomes was created initially for the role of romantic interest to start off with until the sequel. It has also been noted that, as of the release of Spider-Man: Far From Home, MJ has not been kidnapped by the antagonist of a film, unlike Mary Jane in each of the three Sam Raimi films and Gwen in Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man 2. == Role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe== Michelle, commonly known as MJ, is a student at Midtown School of Science and Technology who initially enjoys mocking all of her fellow students there, including Peter Parker. Despite keeping her distance socially, MJ is eventually given the opportunity to take over from the departing Liz Toomes as captain of the Academic Decathlon Team, and begins to open up more with her fellow teammates, which include Ned Leeds and Parker. MJ, like Parker, is a victim of the Snap by Thanos in 2018, but along with all other victims, is resurrected in the Blip five years later. Her affections are sought out by Parker and Brad Davis during Midtown Tech's trip to Europe. When she deduces Parker's identity as Spider-Man, MJ helps discover Mysterio's fraudulence, by exposing him as the one who staged the Elemental crisis. Shortly after their trip to Europe, MJ and Parker begin dating. After their first date, MJ is horrified when TheDailyBugle.net's J. Jonah Jameson releases a doctored video of Mysterio and Spider-Man, claiming that Spider-Man is responsible for the casualties of the Battle of London while exposing Parker as Spider-Man. === Filmography === * Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) * Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019) * , Tom Holland has confirmed that Zendaya will reprise her role in the third Spider-Man: Home-titled film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. ===Other appearances=== MJ also appears in the Spider-Man: Far From Home Prelude comics released by Marvel Comics. The comic strips serve as a retelling of Spider-Man: Homecoming. == Reception == ===Casting controversy=== According to news media, after the announcement of Zendaya being cast, there was much controversy and speculation sparked on the fact that Zendaya, an African American actress, would be portraying Mary Jane Watson. Media even came out on the defense of the issue, along with another Marvel Cinematic Universe director James Gunn in social media. Zendaya responded to the rumors of her character as Mary Jane by The Hollywood Reporter in an interview saying : > Whenever we were on set, one of us gets some random character name [on the > call sheet]. [Bloggers were] like, \"Oh they must be so and so.\" And we just > crack up about it, because it's like, 'Whatever you want to think. You'll > find out.' It's funny to watch the guessing game. But of course there's > going to be outrage over that because for some reason some people just > aren't ready. I'm like, \"I don't know what America you live in, but from > what I see when I walk outside my streets of New York right now, I see lots > of diversity and I see the real world and it's beautiful, and that's what > should be reflected and that's what is reflected so you're just going to > have to get over it.\" She also confirmed that despite the confusion, she is \"100% Michelle\" and not Mary Jane as many have speculated. ===Portrayal reaction === The character of MJ had a positive reception in Homecoming by film critics, with Zendaya referred to as a \"scene stealer\" in her first major film role, despite her limited screen-time. Caitlin Busch of Inverse felt thankful that the character was not Mary Jane Watson and opined that the original character works better for the film. The character has also received positive feedback from a feminist perspective, especially in Spider-Man: Far From Home. Karen Han of Polygon felt that the character was a positive representation of strong female characters while additionally Vanity Fair noted how MJ was not portrayed as a warrior like Hayley Atwell's Peggy Carter, Lupita Nyong'o's Nakia or Evangeline Lilly's Hope van Dyne but also not a damsel and declared her as the \"MJ we need and both deserve\". Her personality was reminiscent to as Daria Morgendorffer in Daria to some reporters. Rachel Leishman of The Mary Sue described the MCU version of MJ as extremely important in Peter Parker's life. ===Awards=== Zendaya has won the 45th Saturn Awards for Best Supporting Actress for portraying the character in 2018 through 2019. == See also == * Characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe == References == 50px The plot description and characterization were adapted from Michelle at Marvel Cinematic Universe Wiki, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 (Unported) (CC-BY-SA 3.0) license. ==External links== * Michelle at Marvel Cinematic Universe Wiki * Category:Spider-Man (2017 film series) Category:Spider-Man film characters Category:Marvel Cinematic Universe original characters Category:Fictional characters displaced in time Category:Film characters introduced in 2017 Category:Fictional characters from New York City Category:Fictional victims of genocide Category:Female characters in film Category:Teenage characters in film ",
