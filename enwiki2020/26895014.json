    "text": "Craig Shutt is an American freelance writer and editor, best known as the author of Baby Boomer Comics, a collection of his \u201cAsk Mr. Silver Age\u201d column about 1960s comics for the Comics Buyer\u2019s Guide monthly magazine, which ceased publication in 2013. He also moderates the Mr. Silver Age message board at the Comics Roundtable at captaincomics.ning.com. ==Writing career== Shut became a freelance writer in 1992, and began writing humorous articles about comics for the Comics Buyer's Guide (CBG) with issue #955 (March 6, 1992). The articles focused on comics published during the years 1956-1970, known as the Silver Age of comic books. His column began in CBG #1020 (June 4, 1993) and became monthly in CBG #1476 (March 1, 2002). It ran in every issue until the last issue of CBG, #1699 (March 2013). His annual column on the \u201cMopee Awards\u201d highlights Silver Age comics with illogical plots or events. The \u201cMopee\u201d term derives from a character appearing in The Flash #167 (February 1967). The term is used commonly in comics fandom to indicate a situation in a plot that fans ignore because it contradicts generally accepted continuity. Since 1996, he has moderated a Silver Age Trivia Challenge panel at the Chicago Comic-Com (formerly WizardWorld Chicago) and now the Chicago Comic & Entertainment Exhibition (C2E2). Four of his early columns were reprinted in Dr. Wonder #3 (July 1996), #4 (October 1996) and #5 (Fall 1997) published by Old Town Publishing. His Baby Boomer Comics book included illustrations of Mr. Silver Age by Jim Mooney, a long-time comic-book illustrator. ==Published works== * ==References== ==External links== * AMSA Forum Category:Living people Category:1954 births Category:Medill School of Journalism alumni Category:American male writers ",
