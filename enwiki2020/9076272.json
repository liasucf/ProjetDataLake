    "text": "Peter John Wyllie (born 8 February 1930, in London, England) is a British petrologist and academic. He was Professor of Geology at the California Institute of Technology from 1983 until his retirement in 1999. Prior to this, he held positions at the University of St Andrews (1955\u201356), Pennsylvania State University (1958\u201359 and 1961\u201366), the University of Leeds (1959\u201361), and the University of Chicago (1965\u201383). He is well known for his many contributions to the understanding of magmatism, particularly through his work on the experimental petrology of magmas and volatiles. In the early 1970s, Wyllie wrote two widely used textbooks; The Dynamic Earth (1971) and The Way the Earth Works (1976) which integrated the new understanding of magmatism and plate tectonics. He is also famous for his contributions to the coverage of earth sciences in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, particularly his outline of the field in Part Two of the Prop\u00e6dia. Wylie was President of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) from 1995 to 1999. ==Awards and honours== * Polar Medal, 1954 * National Academy of Sciences, USA, 1981 * Wollaston Medal, Geological Society of London, 1982 * Fellow of the Royal Society, London, 1984 * Roebling Medal, Mineralogical Society of America, 2001 ==References== ==External links== * Category:British geologists Category:Petrologists Category:1930 births Category:Scientists from London Category:Alumni of the University of St Andrews Category:University of Chicago faculty Category:University of Pennsylvania faculty Category:British emigrants to the United States Category:Wollaston Medal winners Category:California Institute of Technology faculty Category:Living people Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences Category:Foreign Members of the USSR Academy of Sciences Category:Foreign Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences Category:Foreign members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Category:Foreign Fellows of the Indian National Science Academy Category:Recipients of the Polar Medal ",
