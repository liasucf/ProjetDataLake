    "text": "Herman Schlundt (19 July 1869 in Two Rivers, Wisconsin \u2013 1937) was a United States chemist. ==Biography== He graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1894 and took his Ph.D. at the University of Leipzig in 1901. He was for a time connected with the faculty at the University of Wisconsin, and from 1902 was associated with that of the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri, where he was professor of physical chemistry in 1907\u201313, and chairman of the department of chemistry in 1910\u201315. After 1924, he and William McGavock fabricated a laboratory for the refining of mesothorium (from monazite ore) and radium (from discarded watch dials). It was a unique source of thorium and was resorted to by many noted scientists, for example Marie Curie. The lab received national press notice in 1930 and shortly thereafter closed. Cited and reproduced in the Columbia Business Times article. According to the latter source, this Columbia Missourian article appeared later in The New York Times on October 19. ==Works== Schlundt is the author of numerous articles on physical chemistry and radioactivity and of Laboratory Experiments in General Chemistry (1912) and Radioactivity of the thermal waters of Yellowstone National Park (1909). ==References== ==External links== * Category:1869 births Category:1937 deaths Category:People from Two Rivers, Wisconsin Category:People from Columbia, Missouri Category:American physical chemists Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison alumni Category:Leipzig University alumni Category:University of Missouri faculty Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison faculty ",
