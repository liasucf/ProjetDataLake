    "text": "Horace Pauleus Sannon (7 April 187027 August 1938) was a Haitian historian, politician and diplomat. Born in Les Cayes, Pauleus Sannon began medical studies at the Sorbonne in Paris, France, but abandoned them to study social- political sciences at the Coll\u00e8ge de France. While still in France, he published his first book, Haiti et le r\u00e9gime parlementaire. He wrote several books on the history of Haiti, including Essai historique sur la r\u00e9volution de 1843 and Histoire de Toussaint Louverture. Scholars consider the latter to be his most important work, influencing the views of both Haitians and non- Haitians on the Haitian Revolution. As a historian, he had a reputation for scrupulously backing up his statements with evidence. He was a co-founder, and the first president, of Haiti's Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Histoire et de Geographie, a group of Haitian intellectuals formed in 1924 who saw studying the past as a means to generate national pride and understand the conditions of the present (at the time, Haiti was occupied by United States Marines). The Societe popularized history among the public. He served as Haiti's Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1906, and negotiated a trade treaty with France. He was appointed Haitian Minister to the United States in 1909. He was a Haitian presidential candidate in 1926 and 1930. ==Works== * Ha\u00efti et le r\u00e9gime parlementaire * Un journaliste sous Boyer: Darfour (1898) * Histoire de Toussaint Louverture Volume 1 * Histoire de Toussaint Louverture Volume 2 * Histoire de Toussaint Louverture Volume 3 ==References== * Category:1870 births Category:1938 deaths Category:Foreign Ministers of Haiti Category:Haitian historians Category:Haitian male writers ",
