    "text": "The Drenica (Serbian Cyrillic: \u0414\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430, ) is a river in Kosovo, a 50 km-long left tributary to the Sitnica river. It flows entirely within Kosovo and gives its name to the surrounding Drenica region. The Drenica originates from the central section of the Crnoljeva mountain, in Drenica region. The river originally flows to the north and receives many streams coming down from the Crnoljeva (on the left) and Gole\u0161 (from the right) mountains. The composite valley of the river is densely populated, with several large villages (Krajmirovce, Sedlare, Rusinovce, Banjica, Komorane, Donja Koretica, Dobro\u0161evac) and a small town of Glogovac, one of two regional centers of Drenica region. At Glogovac, the Drenica receives the Vrbova\u010dka reka from the left and forms a large elbow turn to the north to the southern slopes of the \u010ci\u010davica mountain. Near the village of Veliki Bela\u0107evac, the Drenica turns to the south but at the village of Velika Slatina makes another elbow turn to the north, splits in two arms and empties into the Sitnica near the town of Kosovo. The Drenica belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin, drains an area of 447 km\u00b2 and it is not navigable. == Notes == {| style=\"margin-left:13px; line- height:150%\" |align=\"right\" valign=\"top\"|a. | |} == References == * Mala Prosvetina Enciklopedija, Third edition (1985); Prosveta; * Jovan \u0110.
