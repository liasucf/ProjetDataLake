Eventually a court ruled that the will was indeed a forgery, although in practical terms this ruling changed nothing concerning control of the Kerouac estate. Kerouac published three semi-autobiographical novels, Baby Driver: A Story About Myself in 1981,Brenda Knight Women of the Beat Generation: The Writers, Artists and Muses at the 1998 1573241385 Two of her autobiographical novels, Baby Driver and Trainsong, are similar to the narrative style that her father employed, but Jan Kerouac seems to be able to detach herself from her circumstances more than her father was able to and writes ... Trainsong in 1988 and posthumously published Parrot Fever in 2000. ==Death== On June 5, 1996, Kerouac died in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a day after her spleen was removed. She had suffered kidney failure five years earlier and was on dialysis. == Filmography == The Beat Generation: An American Dream (1988) What Happened to Kerouac?
