He attended the Butt Lane National School, and then spent some time studying at Allegheny College in Pennsylvania. Hancock worked as a coal miner in Staffordshire, and became active in the North Staffordshire Miners' Association, serving as its financial secretary from 1914. This role brought him greater prominence in the movement, and in 1926 and 1927 he served on the executive of the Miners' Federation of Great Britain.Robin Page Arnot, The Miners, vol.2, p.546-549 In the early 1930s, Samuel Finney, the general secretary of the North Staffordshire Miners, retired, and Hancock won the election to succeed him.
