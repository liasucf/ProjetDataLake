The Show is produced by Garima Productions. The Show derives its title from the famous sher by Shauq Bahraichi. ==Plot== \u201cPromise what benefits them and do what benefits us!\u201d has been the mantra of our opportunistic politicians for ages now. Still, whenever some shrewd politician shows up with sweet words and a welcoming smile the junta votes again hoping that the solution has arrived! Shri Chaitu Lal (Rajeev Nigam) is Chief Minister of a fictional state named Ulta Pradesh. This Chief Minister is known for fooling the innocent citizens by making false promises. Like any other neta Chaitu is a fairly manipulative, wise with words and is of an opportunistic kind. His 'thenga party' vouches only for black money by manipulating the system. He promises what benefits the common man but does what benefits him. Supporting him in this comedy show is his wife Imli Devi (Samta Sagar). She stands by her husband through the thick and thin. Even though Chaitu is the leader of the ruling party when it comes to home, his wife is his biggest support system. Imli hopes to see her brother and CM's enthusiastic brother-in-law, Putan (Ishtiyak Khan) as the Prime Minister of the nation. Putan a youth icon of his state is as shrewd as his Jijaji. He has 13 cases lodged against him and has purchased degrees from all the top colleges of the state. Puttan is no less to Chaitu in any way when it comes to politics and corruption. ==Cast== ===Main Cast=== * Rajeev Nigam as Chaitu Lal - The Chief Minister of Ulta Pradesh (Fictional State) * Samta Sagar as Imli Devi - Chaitu Lal's Wife * Ishtiyak Khan as Puttan - Chaitu Lal's Brother-in- law ===Recurring Cast=== * Melissa Pais as Malai Devi - Chaitu Lal's Sister- in-law * Shraddha Sharma as Genda Devi - Leader of Opposition Party * Dishank Arora as Genda Devi's Paternal Aunt's Husband * Poornima Verma as Rajneeti * Alika Nair as Party * Sonam Shekhawat as Ghotali * Riya Raval as Sarkar * Naitik Chudasama as Bahumat * Kinjal Mehta as Haseena Devi * Lalita Sen as Monica - Chaitu's First Personal Assistant * Babita Anand as Chaaya - Chaitu's Second Personal Assistant * Gazala Selmin as Parvati * Abhishek Agarwal as Bundi ==Reception== The show is a satirical take on the common man's issues. It shows Chaitu Laal dealing with common man's issues such as education, infrastructure, corruption etc. while also focusing on events like the rigged elections, buying and selling of MLAs and the foundation of random committees that misuse public money.
