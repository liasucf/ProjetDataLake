His main contribution was to systematically record the additions made by Islamic physicians in the Middle Ages, which added between 300 and 400 types of medicine to the one thousand previously known since antiquity. ==Life== Ibn al-Baitar was born in the city of M\u00e1laga in Andalusia (Muslim-controlled Spain) at the end of the twelfth century, hence his nisba \"al-M\u0101laq\u012b\". His name \"Ibn al-Baitar\" is Arabic for \"son of the veterinarian\", which was his father's job. Ibn al-Bay\u1e6d\u0101r learned botany from the M\u00e1lagan botanist Ab\u016b al-\u02bfAbb\u0101s al-Nab\u0101t\u012b with whom he started collecting plants in and around Spain. Al-Nab\u0101t\u012b was responsible for developing an early scientific method, introducing empirical and experimental techniques in the testing, description and identification of numerous materia medica, and separating unverified reports from those supported by actual tests and observations. Such an approach was thus adopted by Ibn al-Bay\u1e6d\u0101r. In 1219, Ibn al-Bay\u1e6d\u0101r left M\u00e1laga, travelling to the coast of North Africa and as far as Anatolia, to collect plants. The major stations he visited include Bugia, Constantinople, Tunis, Tripoli, Barqa and Antalya. After 1224, he entered the service of the Ayyubid Sultan al-K\u0101mil and was appointed chief herbalist. In 1227 al-K\u0101mil extended his domination to Damascus, and Ibn al-Bay\u1e6d\u0101r accompanied him there, which provided him an opportunity to collect plants in Syria. His botanical researches extended over a vast area including Arabia and Palestine. He died in Damascus in 1248. Ibn al-Bay\u1e6d\u0101r used the name \"snow of China\" (in Arabic, thalj al-\u1e62\u012bn) to describe saltpetre while writing about gunpowder. ==Works== ===Kit\u0101b al-J\u0101mi\u02bf li-Mufrad\u0101t al-Adwiya wa-l-Aghdhiya=== Ibn al-Bay\u1e6d\u0101r\u2019s largest and most widely read book is his Compendium on Simple Medicaments and Foods (). It is a pharmacopoeia (pharmaceutical encyclopedia) listing 1400 plants, foods, and drugs, and their uses. It is organized alphabetically by the name of the useful plant or plant component or other substance\u2014a small minority of the items covered are not botanicals. For each item, Ibn al-Bay\u1e6d\u0101r makes one or two brief remarks himself and gives brief extracts from a handful of different earlier authors about the item. The bulk of the information is compiled from the earlier authors. The book contains references to 150 previous Arabic authors, as well as 20 previous Greek authors.Russell McNeil, Ibn al-Bay\u1e6d\u0101r, Malaspina University- College.Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science, volume 1: Astronomy, Theoretical and Applied, pgs. 271\u2013272. Ed. Roshdi Rasheed. London: Routledge, 1996. One of the sources he quotes most frequently is the Materia Medica of Dioscorides who was inspired by Magon, another Amazigh, having also written an Arabic commentary on the work.Tafs\u012br Kit\u0101b Diy\u0101sq\u016br\u012bd\u016bs, - A commentary of Dioscorides' \"Materia Medica,\" by Abu Muhammad 'Abdallah ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Baytar de Malaga, Beirut 1989 (Arabic) Another book often cited by him is Book Two of the Canon of Medicine of Ibn S\u012bn\u0101 (Aveicenna). Both of those sources have similarities in layout and subject matter with Ibn al-Bay\u1e6d\u0101r's own book, but Ibn al-Bay\u1e6d\u0101r's treatments are richer in detail, and a large minority of Ibn al-Bay\u1e6d\u0101r's useful plants or plant substances are not covered at all by Dioscorides or Ibn S\u012bn\u0101. In modern printed edition, the book is more than 900 pages long. As well as in Arabic, it was published in full in translation in German and French in the 19th century.German edition in two volumes, 1840\u20131842, translated by Sontheimer. French edition in three volumes, 1877\u20131883, translated by Leclerc. Ibn al-Bay\u1e6d\u0101r provides detailed chemical information on the Rosewater and Orangewater production. He mentions: The scented Shurub (Syrup) was often extracted from flowers and rare leaves, by means of using hot oils and fat, they were later cooled in cinnamon oil. The oils used were also extracted from sesame and olives. Essential oil was produced by joining various retorts, the steam from these retorts condensed, combined and its scented droplets were used as perfume and mixed to produce the most costly medicines. ===Kit\u0101b al-Mughn\u012b f\u012b al-Adwiya al-Mufrada=== Ibn al-Bay\u1e6d\u0101r\u2019s second major work is Kit\u0101b al-Mughn\u012b f\u012b al-Adwiya al-Mufrada, an encyclopedia of Islamic medicine which incorporates his knowledge of plants used extensively for the treatment of various ailments, including diseases related to the head, ear, eye, etc. ===Other works=== *M\u012bz\u0101n al-\u1e6cab\u012bb. *Ris\u0101la f\u012b l-Aghdhiya wa-l-Adwiya. *Maq\u0101la f\u012b al-Laym\u016bn, Treatise on the Lemon (also attributed to Ibn Jumay\u02bf); translated into Latin by Andrea Alpago as Ebn Bitar de malis limonis (Venice 1593). *Tafs\u012br Kit\u0101b Diy\u0101sq\u016br\u012bd\u016bs, a commentary on the first four books of Dioscorides' \"Materia Medica.\"Tafs\u012br Kit\u0101b Di\u0101sq\u016br\u012bd\u016bs, - Commentaire de la \"Materia Medica\" de Dioscoride, by Abu Muhammad 'Abdallah ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn al-Baytar de Malaga, (ed.
