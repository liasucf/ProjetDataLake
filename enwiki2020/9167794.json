He played 125 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n matches over six seasons, at the service of Xerez. He represented the same club in La Liga. ==Club career== Born in Orihuela, Alicante, Valencian Community, Chema started his career with amateur and modest clubs, moving in the 2006\u201307 campaign to Xerez CD in the second division. A backup in his first two years (being second-choice to French St\u00e9phane Porato in his second season) he became an undisputed starter afterwards, playing in 41 games as the Andalusia side reached the top flight for the first time ever. In La Liga, Chema backed up Brazilian Renan, newly signed from Valencia CF, his first match only coming on 7 March 2010 in a 4\u20132 away win against neighbours M\u00e1laga CF. After retaining his post the following two games he suffered an injury, in an eventual immediate relegation as last. In the summer of 2014, after one season in the Superleague Greece with Skoda Xanthi FC, Chema returned to his homeland and signed with H\u00e9rcules CF in the third level. On 4 July 2017, the 37-year-old free agent moved down to division four and joined CD Eldense. ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:People from Orihuela Category:Spanish footballers Category:Valencian footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:Tercera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Real Murcia Imperial players Category:Alicante CF footballers Category:Xerez CD footballers Category:H\u00e9rcules CF players Category:CD Eldense footballers Category:Super League Greece players Category:Xanthi F.C. players Category:Spanish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Greece Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in Greece ",
