Karhade Brahmins are divided into two groups based on the Vedanta they follow, the first of which follows the Advaita Vedanta of Adi Shankara and the second of which follow the Dvaita Vedanta of Madhvacharya. Majority of Karhade Brahmins are Smarthas, while small minority among them are Madhwas. Like their Deshastha counterparts, traditionally the karhade allowed cross-cousin marriages.Karve, I., 1958. What is caste. Economic Weekly, 10(4), p.153. ;Sub-division and other claims There are three divisions of Karhade Brahmins - Karhade (from Desh), Padye and Bhatt Prabhu (from Konkan). \"Padhye\" was a further division of \"Padye\" - and were Khots or farmers. According to author Sandhya Gokhale, The Karhade Brahmins of Desh always looked down upon the Padyes and always considered them to be of inferior status. According to author Pran Nath Chopra, The Karhade Brahmins who were appointed as the priests came to be called as \"Upadhyayas\" which in due course became Padhye. ==Origin== The Karhade Brahmins take their name from the town of Karad in Satara district, the sacred junction of the Koina and Krishna. They migrated to the region between Malvan and Sangameshwar near the Konkan coast and made it their home land.The Karhade section, though it takes its name from Karad, a place in the Deccan region, is found chiefly in the Konkan coast. Karhade Brahmins are generally thought to be a branch of the Deshastha Rigvedi's who immigrated from their home in Satara district to the southern part of Ratnagiri on the Konkan Coast, where they were principally settled. == Demographics == Most Karhade Brahmins live in Maharashtra though a significant population exist in Goa, Karnataka, and cities outside Maharashtra such as Sagar and Indore in present day state of Madhya Pradesh.Ancestors of these people moved to these places during 18th century during the Maratha empire period.A southern branch of the Karhade Brahmins settled around the Kasargod region of the Malabar coast and they are called the \"Karada Brahmins\" and share their traditions with Kerala Brahmins and the Brahmins of South Karnataka. == Culture == ===Occupation=== Traditionally, the Karhade Brahmins were a community of priests who offered religious services in Hindu temple and to other communities. ===Language=== Marathi is the mother tongue of most of the Karhade Brahmins in Maharashtra. ===Diet=== Karhade Brahmins generally follow a vegetarian diet. == Notable people == *Moropant Ramachandra Paradkar (1729\u20131794), Marathi poet who was the last among those classified by Marathi literary scholars as pandit (\u092a\u0902\u0921\u093f\u0924) poets. *Balshastri Jambhekar (1810-1846), journalist and founder of Darpan, the first newspaper in the Marathi language.Tucker, R., 1976.
