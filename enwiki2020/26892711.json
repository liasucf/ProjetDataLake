    "text": "No Sweat is the fifth and final studio album by British glam rock band Geordie and the only one the band recorded without their original vocalist Brian Johnson who joined AC/DC. This album was released in 1983 by Neat records and reissued, on CD, in 2002 by Castle records, with 4 additional bonus tracks. New vocalist (Dr. Rob) Rob Turnbull's vocal delivery was critically noted as cleaner than Brian Johnson, being more reminiscent of Saxon's Biff Byford. ==Track listing== All tracks written by Geordie. #\"No Sweat\" - 3:26 #\"This Time\" - 2:49 #\"Move Away\" - 3:49 #\"Time to Run\" - 3:58 #\"So You Lose Again\" - 3:46 #\"Rock'n'Roll\" - 4:57 #\"Oh No!\" - 3:30 #\"Hungry\" - 3:43 #\"We Make It Rock\" - 3:37 #\"No Sweat\" (bonus on CD - live BBC, 1982) - 3:20 #\"So You Lose Again\" (bonus on CD - live BBC, 1982) - 3:32 #\"Rock'n'Roll\" (bonus on CD - live BBC, 1982) - 4:19 #\"Move Away\" (bonus on CD - live BBC, 1982) - 4:10 ==Personnel== *Vic Malcolm - guitar *Rob Turnbull - vocals *Tom Hill - bass guitar *Brian Gibson - drums *David Stephenson - guitar ==References== Category:1983 albums Category:Geordie (band) albums ",
