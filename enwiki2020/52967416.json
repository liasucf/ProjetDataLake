    "text": "John P. Killilea (June 19, 1928 \u2013 January 27, 1996) was an American basketball coach and scout. He served as the assistant coach to four National Basketball Association (NBA) team; the Boston Celtics (1972\u201377), the Milwaukee Bucks (1977\u20131983), the New Jersey Nets (1983\u201385), the Houston Rockets (1989\u20131993). Killilea was hired by the Topeka Sizzlers of the Continental Basketball Association (CBA) as their head coach in 1986 and served in that capacity until he was fired in January 1988 after being called for 14 technical fouls and ejected from three games. During his early career, Killilea was head coach of the Melrose and Silver Lake high school basketball teams. He was inducted into the Massachusetts Basketball Coaches Association's Hall of Fame in 1976. Killilea was the first person in the Boston Celtics organization to scout Larry Bird. According to Killilea, Bird was \"the best passing forward since Rick Barry.\" In 1977 Don Nelson was hired as head coach of the Milwaukee Bucks. Nelson at first suggested his former assistant coach with the Celtics, John Killilea, for the job. When the Bucks insisted they wanted Nelson at the head coach position he brought Killilea on as his assistant. United Press International reporter Michael V. Uschan wrote an article on March 20, 1981 titled \"Nelson matures as Bucks coach\". It noted that, \"Nelson depends on Killilea more than most other NBA coaches depend on their assistants\". Before the 1983\u201384 season, Killilea joined the New Jersey Nets as an assistant coach under Stan Albeck. After the season a New York Post report cited several anonymous Nets players who blamed their poor performance on an ongoing feud between Killilea and assistant coach Herman Kull. Nets' owner Joe Taub and head coach Stan Albeck approached the Post reporter, Steve Baronfeld, telling him that Kull suffered a heart attack after reading the story. The Post responded by pulling their reporters from the Nets' beat. An August 1983 United Press International report described Killilea as, \"one of the most defense-minded coaches in the [NBA].\" Killilea died of cardiac arrest while boarding a flight in Denver, Colorado. ==References== ==External links== *John Killilea Coaching Statistics at Basketball-Reference.com Category:1928 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Boston Celtics assistant coaches Category:Boston University Terriers men's basketball players Category:Continental Basketball Association coaches Category:High school basketball coaches in the United States Category:Houston Rockets assistant coaches Category:Milwaukee Bucks assistant coaches Category:New Jersey Nets assistant coaches Category:Sportspeople from Massachusetts Category:American men's basketball players ",
