    "text": "Reverend Musical Instruments, commonly known as Reverend Guitars, is an American manufacturer of electric guitars and basses. The company was established in 1997 by noted guitar and amplifier technician Joe Naylor, a graduate of the Roberto-Venn School of Luthiery. Reverend guitars are known for their combination of unorthodox construction methods, retro design, playability and affordable price. == History == The original Reverend models were known for their distinctive body shape as well as their use of non- traditional materials. Inspired by semi-hollow designs produced by Silvertone as well as the venerable Gibson ES-335, the original Reverend models were constructed using a core of solid mahogany surrounded by acoustic chambers. A strip of molded plastic provided the frame while the front and back of the guitar was constructed of phenolic laminate sheets in a variety of colors and finishes. All American-built Reverends were identical in body shape, with various models set apart by their pickup choices and tremolos. Because of its plastic-like texture and non-traditional appearance, the use of phenolic laminate would prove to be a polarizing design feature among players. Some guitarists were wildly enthusiastic about the distinctive style and lively tonal response, while others derided it as being too similar across the line and too plastic for their tastes. Although Reverend guitars were initially sold in large guitar stores around the country, Joe Naylor eventually made the decision to sell all of his guitars direct through an internet website for a short time. This move was one of many major changes instituted by Naylor over the years, as Naylor tried to adapt to the changing market. A short-lived line of bass-guitars, called the Rumblefish, received excellent reviews from critics but were eventually discontinued along with various amplifier models such as the Hellhound, Kingsnake, and Goblin. Naylor surprised many of the company's devoted customers when he announced that all USA Reverends were to be discontinued in favor of an imported line constructed in Korea. These guitars, known initially as the Stage King series and now known as Reverend Guitars, featured solid wood bodies and a variety of shapes. The new Reverend models have been highly regarded by players for their overall quality, affordable price, and distinctive appearance. In 2007, Naylor announced that guitars formerly made of mahogany would in the future be made of korina (Terminalia superba, also known as African limba) wood instead. Naylor cited more consistent guitar weight and excellent resonance as the reason for the change, which came into effect with guitars over serial number 07468. The company was bought by Ken and Penny Haas in 2010, and Joe Naylor retained his role as the designer and technical advisor. Under this arrangement, the Reverend Guitars line expanded to over 50 guitar models and more than 10 bass models. The company moved to Sylvania Township, OH in 2015. Reverend Guitars bought Joe Naylor's pickup company, Railhammer Pickups, in 2017 under the same arrangement as Reverend Guitars. Railhammer Pickups holds a patent for their design: US Patent No. D737891.https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/pdfs/51e6f579701788104491/USD737891.pdf Reverend Guitars signature models have been created with several notable artists, including Billy Corgan, Reeves Gabrels, and Mike Watt. == Models == Reverend has over 30 models, including 10 Signature Models. The guitars are made at Mirr Music in South Korea. Every guitar is inspected and set up at the Toledo, Ohio headquarters. Reverend uses their own custom pickups on each model. All of the guitars feature Reverend's distinctive and highly lauded Bass Contour Control (BCC), a knob allowing the player to control tone more finely than conventional bass/treble knobs (which Reverend guitars also include). The BCC allows the player to add more bass for a fuller, richer sound, or to subtract it, allowing for twangier tones that approximate those of vintage single-coil pickups. Bolt-on neck series * The Buckshot, features a Telecaster-style single-coil pickup at the bridge and, for added versatility in tone, a Revtron mini-humbucker pickup at the neck. The Buckshot is an extraordinarily versatile guitar noted for its ability to produce not only Telecaster-style twang, but also fuller, warmer tones, making it particularly suitable for country, rock, and punk music. * The Charger - a retro-styled but distinctive-looking guitar suitable for country, blues, and rock, with either clean or distorted tones. The Charger 290, featuring two Reverend P90 pickups, was a Guitar Player magazine Editors' Pick, noted for its versatility and snappy attack. The Charger HB has two Reverend humbucker pickups. * The Club King, a semi-hollow guitar prized particularly for rockabilly and jazz, is available in an RT model with two Reverend \"Revtron\" mini-humbucker pickups, and a 290 model with two Reverend P90s. * The Double Agent has a Reverend humbucker in the bridge position and P90 in the neck position, offering a unique combination of tones. * The Flatroc has two Revtron mini-humbuckers, making it particularly suitable for rockabilly. * The Jetstream, prized primarily by rock players for its big tone, is available in a 390 model, with three Reverend P90 pickups and has often been described as a \"Strat on steroids,\" and in HB model with two Reverend humbuckers. For Reverend's tenth anniversary in 2007, a special Jetstream model was released in a sparkling silver finish. * The Six-Gun 3 has 3 single-coil pickups, the Reverend Salnico single-coils featuring alnico 5 rod magnets, on a sleek body with a traditional tone. * The Kingbolt is the newest Reverend Bolt-on.

It is available in an HB or a 390 version.http://www.reverendguitars.com/instrument/warhawk-iii-hb/ * The Sensei series are all classic double-cutaway models. Each have a pair of Reverend pickups, in a choice of Humbuckers (HB), Revtrons (Reverend's mini-Humbuckers RT), Railhammers (RA), or P-90's (290). * Reverend's vintage V shaped guitar is called the Volcano. It has a raised center ridge for increased body mass and sustain. The Volcano comes with a pair of Special-H Zebra Humbuckers.
