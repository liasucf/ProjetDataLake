She has also presented numerous other television shows, including Wedding Switch as well as the Australian version of the US series of Playing It Straight and X Factor Australia on the Seven Network. ==Television and film career== Garonzi began her Australian TV career on Nickelodeon, hosting many TV shows on the network and was a co-host the night of the first ever Nickelodeon Australian Kids' Choice Awards.

She had appearances on many panel shows including Good Morning Australia, Rove, Today and The Project, and captained the team on Japanese spoof TV show Hole in the Wall. Garonzi was a backstage host for The X Factor Australia and the host of The Xtra Factor, a live 'after the main show' on 7Two; however, the show was a contractual obligation to the network for only one year and therefore not brought back for the subsequent series of main show.

She was also a credited writer and co-host of Uplate! on channel GO! with James Kerley and Shura Taft.
