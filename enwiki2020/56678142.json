Sutherland won the New Zealand amateur middleweight boxing title in 1937. He was duly selected to represent New Zealand in the same division at the 1938 British Empire Games, but was eliminated in his first bout, being easily defeated on points by the Welsh fighter, Denis Reardon, who went on to win the gold medal. A gold miner, Sutherland was killed on 16 January 1949 in a mining accident at Upper Nevis, about 40 km from Cromwell. He and a companion were working in a tunnel when the roof collapsed, burying Sutherland under the earth fall. ==References== Category:1912 births Category:1949 deaths Category:People from Otago Category:Boxers at the 1938 British Empire Games Category:New Zealand male boxers Category:Accidental deaths in New Zealand Category:Industrial accident deaths Category:Middleweight boxers ",
