    "text": "__NOTOC__ Eccard Freiherr von Gablenz (26 January 1891 \u2013 17 December 1978) was a German general in the Wehrmacht during World War II who commanded several divisions. He was a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross of Nazi Germany. ==Commands== During the German retreat during the Battle of Moscow, he commanded the XXVII. Armeekorps and was relieved of duty after repeated refusals to enforce Hitler's standfast orders. As commander of the 384th Infantry Division, he was flown out of the Stalingrad pocket in December 1942, shortly before the division's surrender. A contemporary Soviet press report described him as having liked his peacetime comforts, such as requiring a nap on a soft bed after every dinner. Gablenz went on to hold command on the Italian front, commanding the defense of Monte Castello in 1944. ==Awards and decorations== * Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 15 August 1940 as Generalleutnant and commander of 7.
