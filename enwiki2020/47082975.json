    "text": "The Schultiskopf lies in the highest part of the Central Black Forest and, at , is a ridge-like subpeak of the Obereck (). == Description == View into the valley of the Wilde Gutach The Schultiskopf, together with its western neighbour, the H\u00f6llkopf () forms a 2.5-kilometre-long rocky ridge whose steep northern slopes drop up to 550 metres into the valley of the Haslachsimonsw\u00e4lder Bach and whose southern side descends 400 metres into the Ibichbach valley. A footpath runs along the ridge, having climbed from Altsimonswald in the valley of the Wilde Gutach (), and via the Obereck to the Farnberg Plateau between Rohrhardsberg and Brend. From the H\u00f6llkopf the Kostgf\u00e4ll Ravine to the north, which runs parallel to the path, may be reached on unmarked forest tracks and linking footpaths. The summit is marked with a cast iron cross and offers views over the Simonsw\u00e4lder Tal to Kandel and, in clear weather, to the Feldberg. The view is partly obscured by trees. == References == Category:One-thousanders of Germany Category:Mountains and hills of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Category:Mountains and hills of the Black Forest Category:Emmendingen (district) ",
