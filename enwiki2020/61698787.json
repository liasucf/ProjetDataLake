    "text": "Gerdrup, formerly Gjerup, is a manor house and estate located three kilometres north of Sk\u00e6lsk\u00f8r, Slagelse Municipality, Denmark. The estate was from 1760 to 1919 owned by members of the Qvistgaard family and has since then been owned by the Fabricius family. The current main building is from 1866. It is now operated as a venue for meetings, parties and other events. ==History== ===Early history=== In the 12th century, Gerdrup belonged to the now extinct Hvide family, but nothing is known about the ownership of the estate in the 13th and 14th centuries. In 1417, Jep Jensen (Godov) and his wife Eln\u00e6 Pallesdatter ceded it to Anders Jacobsen Lunge, who was one of the largest landowners of his time. After Anders Jacobsen Lunge's death in 1429, the ownership of Gerdrup is once again unclear. In 1475, Gerdtrup was the subject of a legal dispute between J\u00f8rgen Rud, lensman of Salt\u00f8, and Jensen Sosadel Dyre. Christian I ended up ruling in favour of Dyre, who had claimed that Gerdrup had been \"in the custody of him and his parents in 16 and 40 years\". His daughter, Anne Dyre, would later marry the squire Claus Hansen (Stampe). Their son, S\u00f8ren Clausen Stampe, was the owner of Gerdrup in 1529. During the Count's Feud, in 1535, Gerdrup is in a cover letter listed as belonging to Knud Rud, but S\u00f8ren Stampe is later once again mentioned as the owner. After Stampe's death, Gerdrup passed to his son-in-law Peder Markvardsen Hundermark, who served in the Kalmar War (1611\u201313) under his uncle, Herluf Trolle, A great-grandson, Erik Hundermark, was the last male member of the Hundermark family. After his death, Gerdrup passed to his sisters, Eline and Anne Hundermark. Anne Hundermark married Frands Kaas. Ellen Hundermark married John Cunningham, a Scotsman who had served as captain of HDMS Trost on an expedition to Greenland and was lensman of Vard\u00f8hus in Norway. Another Scotsman, David Welwood, who is buried at Eggeslevmagle Church, was also associated Gerdrup in this period. Peder Vibe I 1654, Hans Welwood and Lorens Cunningham sold the estate to Peder Vibe. Two years later they had to enter into a settlement with Claus Kaas, the heir of Frands Kaas, which required them to pay him 2,000 Danish rifsdaler for him to recognixe the deed of 1654. Vibe was ennobled in 1634. In July 1848, he was appointed as royal treasurer (rentemester). Vibe's widow, Anne Cathrine Budde, married Joachim Frederik Vind in 1662. He died right after the marriage and Gerdrup was then transferred to the widow of his brother vice chancellor Holger Vinds, Margrethe Gjedde. In 1693, she ceded it to her son-in-law, Diderich Grubbe. Grubbe and his wife expanded the estate through the acquisition of more land. Gerdrup was after their death sold in auction. It was acquired by their son, Holger Grubbe, a lieutenant. The following year he ceded it to his sister, Diderikke Elisabeth Grubbe. Another sister, Christiane Elisabeth Grubbe, seems also to have owned a share in the estate in around 1731. In 1731, Christiane Harboe (n\u00e9e Fuiren). She died in 1735 and Gerdrup was the following year sold in auction. The new owners were bailiff in Copenhagen Oluf Bruun samt prefect J\u00f8rgen Willumsen. Bruun became the sole owner of the estate in 1739. In 1750, he sold it to chancery councilor Simon Borthuus. He once again expanded the estate with more land. He was succeeded on the estate by his brother, auditor- general Otto Borthuus. He sold it to major Caspar Frederik B\u00fclow. ===Qvistgaard family, 1760-1919=== Peder Vibe In 1760, Gerdrup was acquired by Morten Iversen Qvistgaard. He was also the owner of nearby Lyngbyg\u00e5rd. In 1786, he became a member of the Great Land Commission. He was an enthusiastic defender of the great agricultural reforms of the time and implemented them on his estate. After his death, Gerdrup and Lyngbyg\u00e5rd were both passed to his youngest son, Peter Christoffer Quistgaard. He was killed in the Battle of K\u00f8ge in 1807. His widow, Henriette Elisabeth Schow, kept the estate after her husband's death. One of the two unrealized design proposals created by G. F. Hetsch in 1840-41 In 1814, Henriette Elisabeth Schow married Peter Johansen de Neergaard but a prenuptual agreement secured both estates as her personal agreement. In 1831, she ceded the estate to her son, Morten Christen Qvistgaard while Lyngbyg\u00e5rd and the so-called Gimlinge kirkegods went to two other sons. Morten Qvistgaard commissioned the architect Gustav Friedrich Hetsch to design a new main building. Hetsch created two design proposals but Qvistgaard died before either of them was realized. His son, Victor Emilius Qvistgaard, who inherited the estate when he was just four years old, constructed a new main building from another design by Rudolf Unmack in 1864-66. In 1870, he ceded Gerdrup to his son. Viggo Johan Qvistgaard. ===Fabricius family, 1919-present=== Viggo Johan Qvistgaard's heirs sold the estate to Holger Fabricius. He had already inherited Lyngbygaard efter his mother, Tofa Alvilda Fabricius (n\u00e9e Qvistgaard).. Fabricius' widow, Kirstine Feiring, ceded Gerdrup to her son Peter Frederik Fabricius in 1953. Peter Nicolai Fabricius Melchior inherited the estate in 1987., ==Architecture== The current, two-storey main building from 1864-66 is a simple, red brick building.
