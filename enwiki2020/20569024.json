    "text": "Sambalpuri is an Indo-Aryan language variety spoken in western Odisha, India. It is alternatively known as Western Odia, and as Kosali (with variants Kosli, Koshal and Koshali), a recently popularised but controversial term, which draws on an association with the ancient kingdom of Kosala, whose vast territories also included the present-day Sambalpur region. Its speakers usually perceive it as a separate language, while outsiders have seen it as a dialect of Odia, and standard Odia is used by Sambalpuri speakers for formal communication. cited in A 2006 survey of the varieties spoken in four villages found out that they share three-quarters of their basic vocabulary with Standard Odia. == Geographical DIstribution == Core Sambalpuri variant spoken in Sambalpur, Jharsuguda, Bargarh, Subarnapur and Balangir districts. Also spoken in minor parts of Nuapada and western areas of Boudh districts. == Script == The Devanagari script was presumably used in the past as the undivided Sambalpur district was part of Central Provinces of British Raj from 1862 until 1905, after which it was merged with Orissa division of Bengal province after Partition of Bengal (1905).
