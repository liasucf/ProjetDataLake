She was the daughter of Kawazoe Katsuhige, a retainer of the Gam\u014d clan. She was an elite female officer under Nene's command and chief secretary to Toyotomi Hideyoshi. During the Toyotomi administration she possessed such authority that it was said that while Asano Nagamasa may run matters outside, K\u014dz\u014dsu ran matters inside. She accompanied the Toyotomi clan in Japan's unification campaigns. == Life == After Hideyoshi's death, she left \u014csaka castle with Nene and went to live in the capital. In 1606 with the help of Tokugawa Ieyasu, Nene established a Buddhist temple K\u014ddai-ji in Kyoto, and assumed the dharma name of K\u014ddai-in. After that, K\u014dz\u014dsu returned to Osaka. It is said that she helped defend the Toyotomi clan at the Siege of Osaka. In 1615 when the Osaka castle was engulfed in flames, Toyotomi Hideyori and Yodo- dono killed themselves, K\u014dz\u014dsu saved Senhime in the rear pavilion and escaped the castle with others, including Kaihime. When K\u014dz\u014dsu survived the battle of Osaka castle, she was hired by the Tokugawa Hidetada and put in charge of training Ooku ladies. She died on May 9, 1626. == References == Category:People of Sengoku-period Japan Category:Women of medieval Japan Category:16th-century Japanese people Category:Japanese women in warfare Category:Women in 16th-century warfare Category:16th-century Japanese women Category:17th-century Japanese women Category:Women in 17th-century warfare ",
