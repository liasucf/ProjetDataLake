    "text": "Savage Grace was a rock band from Detroit, Michigan in the late 1960s. The band released its eponymous debut album on Reprise in 1969. After moving to Los Angeles the following year, the group embarked on a second album, which took almost two years to complete. The group broke up in 1972, reforming in the 1990s until 2004. ==Biography== The band's origins trace to the east side of Detroit in the late 1960s. Session guitarist Ron Koss, a self-taught musician who had played locally and recordednwith Wilson Pickett, Marv Johnson, and Hank Ballard, joined with keyboardist John Seanor and drummer / percussionist Larry Zack. The trio added Ann Arborite Al Jacquez on lead vocals and bass. The new band performed throughout the Midwest in clubs, ballrooms, colleges, high schools, and pop festivals, eventually opening for various other acts including Three Dog Night, Procol Harum, Sha Na Na, The Moody Blues, Small Faces and countless others. At one festival, Yes, Soft Machine and Alice Cooper opened for Savage Grace. The band's first album, simply titled Savage Grace, was released in 1969. August 1970 they performed at the Goose Lake International Music Festival. In the fall of 1970, Savage Grace relocated to Los Angeles. Savage Grace 2 was released in May 1971. The group resumed touring with Jimi Hendrix and John Sebastian, but performance opportunities soon began to dwindle. During the late 1990s Ron Koss and Al Jacquez reunited and teamed up with bassist Mark Gougeon, guitarist Jeff Jones, drummer Bill Gordon, and keyboardist Jim Claire to produce Savage Grace 3 - officially titled One Night in America. The new Savage Grace performed several times until the death of Ron Koss in 2004. ==Line-up== ===Current members=== * Al Jacquez \u2212 bass, guitar & vocals * Mark Gougeon - bass & vocals * Mark Tomorsky \u2212 guitar & vocals * Frankie Charboneaux \u2212 drums * Jim King \u2212 keyboards ===1990s members=== * Ron Koss \u2212 guitar & vocals * Al Jacquez \u2212 guitar & vocals * Mark Gougeon - bass & vocals * Jeff Jones - guitar * Bill Gordon - drums * Jim Claire - keyboards ===Original members=== * Ron Koss \u2212 guitar & vocals * Al Jacquez \u2212 bass & vocals * John Seanor \u2212 piano, harpsichord * Larry Zack \u2212 drums, percussion ==Discography== ===Albums=== * Savage Grace (1969) * Savage Grace 2 (1971) * One Night in America ==References== ==General references== * ==External links== * Category:Progressive rock musical groups from Michigan Category:Musical groups established in 1968 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1972 ",
