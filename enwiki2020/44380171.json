    "text": "Ann Newmarch (born 1945 in Adelaide, Australia) is an Australian painter, printmaker, sculptor, professor, and co-founder of the Progressive Art Movement and WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution. Her work is said to be political, feminist, emotional, personal, and complex. Her work is extensive and she doesn't hold to an individualistic prescriptive 'signature' style. Newmarch was introduced to the women\u2019s movement in 1970 and balanced teaching, mothering and artmaking with community and cultural development work. ==Education== Ann Newmarch attended the Western Teacher's College in 1966. She also went on to attend the South Australian School of Art in Adelaide. When she graduated from this school, she became one of the few women to serve as an instructor there in 1969. At this point, Newmarch evolved into an overtly political artist. ==Art Practice== Newmarch's art practice is concerned with the gendered basis of the world and is a practitioner whose work critiques underlying assumptions around understandings of gender. Embracing feminism from the early 1970's, her art practice highlights that all representation is political and the absence of voice is in itself an acceptance of the status quo. Newmarch's early work heavily featured silkscreen printing with the inclusion of more sculptural objects only being introduced in the 90's. Her works now focus on the objects being the subjects and in this way hands and the body become canvases for the exploration of artmaking. ==Political interest== Newmarch has had a huge interest in politics, which has always played a role in her work. She was a co-founder in 1974 of the Progressive Art Movement, which focuses on political issues, social concerns, and education. ==Awards== Through the many commitments Newmarch has made to society, she was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia in 1989. On September 22, 2010, Newmarch was awarded the Australian Day Award for her photograph piece titled Women Hold Up Half the Sky, a production that shows how amazingly strong women are. The piece was a tribute to her Auntie Peg who built a house on her own while raising eight children and working two jobs. This photograph was recreated as a postcard for four major galleries. Newmarch was 'Highly Commended' in the Geoff Crowhurst Memorial Award category at the 2019 South Australian Ruby Awards. ==References== Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century artists Category:Australian feminists Category:Australian educators Category:Recipients of the Medal of the Order of Australia Category:20th-century Australian women artists Category:People from Adelaide Category:Artists from South Australia ",
