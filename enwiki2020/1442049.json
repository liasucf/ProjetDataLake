    "text": "The International Center of Photography (ICP), in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City, consists of a museum for photography and visual culture and a school offering an array of educational courses and programming. ICP's photographic collection, reading room, and archives are at Mana Contemporary in Jersey City, New Jersey. The organization was founded by Cornell Capa in 1974. ICP is the host of the Infinity Awards, inaugurated in 1985 \"to bring public attention to outstanding achievements in photography by honoring individuals with distinguished careers in the field and by identifying future luminaries\". == History == Since its founding in 1974 by Cornell Capa with help from Micha Bar-Am in Willard Straight House, on Fifth Avenue's Museum Mile, ICP has presented over 500 exhibitions, bringing the work of more than 3,000 photographers and other artists to the public in one- person and group exhibitions and provided various classes and workshops for students. ICP was founded to keep the legacy of \"Concerned Photography\" alive. After the untimely deaths of his brother Robert Capa and his colleagues Werner Bischof, Chim (David Seymour), and Dan Weiner in the 1950s, Capa saw the need to keep their humanitarian documentary work in the public eye. In 1966 he founded the International Fund for Concerned Photography. By 1974 the Fund needed a home, and the International Center of Photography was created. In 1985, a satellite facility, ICP Midtown, was created. Plans were also made for the redesign and reconstruction of the Midtown location.http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/711747056 === Redesign and reconstruction === In 1999, the headquarters building at 1130 Fifth Avenue was sold. The expanded galleries at 1133 Avenue of the Americas at 43rd Street were designed by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates Architects for the display of photography and new media. The reopening in the fall of 2000 of the site, previously used as a photo gallery for Kodak, provided in one location the same amount of gallery space as the two previous sites combined and became the headquarters of ICP's public exhibitions programs, and also housed an expanded store and a caf\u00e9. The expansion of the school of the International Center of Photography in the fall of 2001 created a Midtown campus diagonally across from the museum in the Grace Building at 1114 Avenue of the Americas. Designed by the architecture firm Gensler, the school facility doubled ICP\u2019s teaching space and allowed ICP to expand both its programming and community outreach. === Move to the Bowery and Essex Crossing === In 2014, ICP\u2019s board approved a plan to buy a building on the Bowery near the New Museum and relocate there. The center\u2019s school, whose lease continued through 2018, remained in Midtown, but was expected to eventually move downtown to consolidate operations.Randy Kennedy (September 24, 2014), Photography Center Leaving Midtown for the Bowery New York Times. The midtown museum closed on January 11, 2015 when its lease ended. The ICP museum at 250 Bowery opened on June 23, 2016. In 2017, ICP signed a deal with Delancey Street Associates to house its museum and school at Essex Crossing on the Lower East Side. In 2019, ICP sold its space at 250 Bowery and purchased its new home at 79 Essex Street at Essex Crossing.https://www.icp.org/about In January 2020, ICP opened its new integrated center at 79 Essex Street. Designed by architecture firm Gensler, the building has galleries, media labs, classrooms, darkrooms, shooting studios, a shop, caf\u00e9, research library and public event spaces. The new space is the cultural anchor of the $1.9 billion six-acre Essex Crossing development.Nancy Kenney (January 22, 2020), International Center of Photography prepares to move into a far bigger home in New York The Art Newspaper. ==ICP School== ICP's school serves more than 3,500 students each year, offering courses in a curriculum that ranges from darkroom classes to certificate and master's degree programs. Other educational programming includes a lecture series, seminars, symposia, and workshops hosted by professional photographers. Opened in 2001, the School was previously at a facility at 1114 Avenue of the Americas. Designed by Gensler, it was across the street from the former ICP Museum. ICP's school and museum are now located in a unified center on Manhattan's Lower East Side at 79 Essex Street. The school offers a year-round selection of continuing education classes; three one-year Certificate programs (Creative Practices in Photography, Documentary Practice and Visual Journalism, and New Media Narratives); and the ICP-Bard Program in Advanced Photographic Studies, a two-year graduate program leading to a master of fine arts degree. ===Public programs=== Public programs address issues in photography and its relationship to art, culture, and society and promote the interpretation of ICP's exhibitions and collections. The Photographers Lecture Series invites photographers to present their work while sharing ideas and concerns about the medium. Other seminars, symposia, and panel discussions feature artists, critics, scholars, and historians. ===Community programs=== Community programs relate to the exhibitions. Programs include interactive tours, family day events, workshops, long-term photography programs in four New York City public schools, summer photography programs in community centers, and a high school internship program designed to promote youth leadership. == Infinity Awards == The ICP hosts the Infinity Awards, which were inaugurated in 1985 \"to bring public attention to outstanding achievements in photography by honoring individuals with distinguished careers in the field and by identifying future luminaries\". ===Winners=== 1985 * Master of Photography: Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz * Applied/Fashion/Advertising: Sarah Moon * Art: David Hockney * Photojournalism: Alberto Venzago * Publication: Photo Poche * Young Photographer: 1986 * Master of Photography: Hiroshi Hamaya * Lifetime Achievement: Edward K.

Since its opening in 1974, ICP has acquired important historical and contemporary images through an acquisitions committee and through donations and bequests from photographers and collectors. The collection spans the history of photography, including daguerrotypes, gelatin silver and digital chromogenic prints. The collection is strongest in its holdings of American and European documentary photography of the 1930s to the 1990s. It comprises large bodies of work by W. Eugene Smith, Henri Cartier- Bresson, Robert Capa, the Farm Security Administration photographers, Alfred Eisenstaedt, Lisette Model, Gordon Parks, James VanDerZee, and Garry Winogrand. Recent purchases have included work by contemporary photographers such as Carrie Mae Weems, Justine Kurland, Katy Grannan, Vik Muniz, and Susan Meiselas. Another component of the collection is a significant group of photographically illustrated magazines, particularly those published between World War I and II, such as Vu, Regards, Picture Post, Lilliput, Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung, Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung, and Life. Opened in 2015, the International Center of Photography at Mana Contemporary is a 15,000-square-foot space that houses the permanent collection, a media lab, areas for research, and a gallery. ==Publications== In 2003 the ICP joined with the publisher Steidl of G\u00f6ttingen, Germany to launch the photography imprint ICP/Steidl. ===ICP/Steidl publications=== *\"Strangers: The First ICP Triennial of Photography and Video.\" 2003. * Young America: The Daguerreotypes of Southworth and Hawes. 2005.
