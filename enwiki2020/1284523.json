It has been designated as a Phoenix Point of Pride. ==Geography and ecology== Winter on South Mountain South Mountain Park preserves in a natural state a mountainous area of or approximately of native desert vegetation. Originally called Phoenix Mountain Park, it was formed in 1924 when President Calvin Coolidge sold its initial 13,000 acres (53 km\u00b2) to the city of Phoenix for $17,000. It has since been expanded through bond programs during the 1970s into the early 1980s. It is located south of central Phoenix, hence the name. Since the naming, suburban growth has nearly surrounded the park. Ahwatukee now borders to the south and Laveen to the west. South Mountain was originally known as the Salt River Mountains. The original mountain park committee consisted of J.C. Dobbins, chairman of the Phoenix city planning commission, Mrs. John Hampton, and H.B. Wilkinson.\"Commission Plans Purchase of 14,000 Acres To Create Pleasure Resort For Phoenix\" The Arizona Republic, April 6, 1924. Dobbins Road, named after J.C. Dobbins, runs east and west just north of the park. Twilight over Phoenix from South Mountain Park The park's lookout point rises over 1000 feet (305 m) above the desert floor. Beyond the roads leading to ramadas and the summit, the park features 58 miles (93 km) of trails for cycling, hiking and horseback riding. Much of the original park infrastructure was constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the early 1930s. The landmark Mystery Castle is located within its foothills. There is a variety of flora and fauna within South Mountain Park. One of the most notable flora is the Elephant tree, (Bursera microphylla), which exhibits multiple contorted trunk architecture.C. Michael Hogan. 2009. Elephant Tree: Bursera microphylla, GlobalTwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg A \"carrot tailed\" Chuckwalla at South Mountain Park. South Mountain Park is also notable for its chuckwalla population. With an average of 65 chuckwallas per hectare, South Mountain has the highest density of chuckwallas that has ever been reported.Kwiatkowski M.A, and Sullivan B.K. 2002. Mating system structure and population density in a polygynous lizard, Sauromalus obesus (=ater). Behavioral Ecology. 13 (2): 201-208. Further, male chuckwallas at South Mountain exhibit a \u201ccarrot tail\u201d phenotype, which is unique to this population.Kwiatkowski M.A, and Sullivan B.K. 2002. Geographic Variation in Sexual Selection Among Populations of an Iguanid Lizard, Sauromalus Obesus (=Ater).
