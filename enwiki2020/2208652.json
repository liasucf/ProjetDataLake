It began by producing animation mainly for Disney Afternoon TV series, such as Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers and Darkwing Duck, and soon expanded by providing animation services for Nickelodeon shows like Rocko's Modern Life and Invader Zim, and other series like Duckman on USA Network and Fatherhood on Nick at Nite. Many studios have been \"spun off\" from Sunwoo; the first to do so was Anivision, which was established in March 1991. Anivision worked on The Simpsons, with AKOM and Rough Draft Studios, and Rugrats, replacing Wang Film Productions for its 2nd season in 1992. Grimsaem Animation Co. Ltd., Seoul, Korea, which mainly does feature-length work for Nickelodeon, was established in March 1997. In April 1998, Sunwoo Digital International was established, whose most notable work was for the Fox TV series Family Guy. In April 2000, all of these spin-off studios were merged under the banner Sunwoo Entertainment, and it has remained that way ever since. ==TV series Sunwoo has worked on== *Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers (1989\u20131990) *TaleSpin (1990\u20131991) - 23 episodes. *Darkwing Duck (1991\u20131992) - 40 episodes. *Winnie the Pooh and Christmas Too (1991) (ink and paint/camera services) *Goof Troop (1992\u20131993) - 17 episodes. *The Simpsons (1989-present) *Rugrats (1992\u20132004) *Cro (1993-1994) *Bonkers (1993\u20131994) - 20 episodes. *Rocko's Modern Life (1993\u20131996, animation services only) - 38\u00bd episodes. *Aladdin (1994\u20131995) - 21 episodes. *Duckman (1994\u20131997) *Gargoyles (1994\u20131997) *Dumb and Dumber (1995-1996) - 13 episodes. *Jumanji (1996\u20131999) *The Mighty Ducks (1996\u20131997) *Quack Pack (1996) *Spin Kicker (1996) *101 Dalmatians: The Animated Series (1997\u20131998) - 7 episodes. *The Angry Beavers (1997\u20132001) *Johnny Bravo (1997) - 12,33 episodes. *Pepper Ann (1997\u20132001) *Recess (1997\u20132001) *Space Goofs (1997\u20131998) (Season 1 only) *Bad Dog (1998\u20131999) *Hercules (1998\u20131999) *The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald (1998\u20132003) *The Wild Thornberrys (1998\u20132004) *Family Guy (2005\u20132008) *The New Woody Woodpecker Show (1999\u20132000) (replaced by Mercury Filmworks for Season 3) *Rocket Power (1999\u20132004) *Dragon Tales (1999-2005) *Milo's Bug Quest (2000) *As Told By Ginger (2000\u20132006) *Baby Blues (2000\u20132002) *Buzz Lightyear of Star Command (2000\u20132001, animation services only) *The Weekenders (2000\u20132004) *Invader Zim (2001, animation services only) *The Mummy (2001-2003) *Space Hip Hop Duck (2002) *The Fairly OddParents (\"Crash Nebula\" episode only) *Teamo Supremo (2002-2004) *Mr. Bean: The Animated Series (2002\u20132004) *Big Bear and Nanook (2003) *Mini B (2003) *WAB/Animal Baby (2003) *ChalkZone (2003\u20132008) *All Grown Up!
