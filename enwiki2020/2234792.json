Many of her designs are considered \"over the top\" and embellished. She also is known for doing a cartwheel ending in a split at the end of her fashion shows. ==Early life and education== Johnson was born in Wethersfield, Connecticut, the second of three children born to Lena and John Johnson. She has an elder sister, Sally, and a younger brother, Robert. Johnson grew up in Terryville, Connecticut and took many dance classes, which inspired her love of costumes.\"Betsey Johnson Still Loves Cheerleaders and the Prom\". New York Magazine, February 14, 2012. Following her graduation from high school, Johnson studied at the Pratt Institute and then later graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Syracuse University where she was a member of the Alpha Xi Delta women's sorority.
