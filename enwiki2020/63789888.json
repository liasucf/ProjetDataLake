With the outbreak of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, France and the Dutch Republic found themselves allied against the Kingdom of Great Britain. The Dutch expected the British to send an expeditionary force to try and capture their Dutch Cape Colony, and Suffren was given command of a 5-ship squadron to reinforce it. The task force comprised the 74-gun H\u00e9ros (under Suffren) and Annibal (under Tr\u00e9mignon), and the 64-gun Art\u00e9sien (under Cardaillac), Sphinx (under Du Chilleau) and Vengeur (under Forbin), as well as the 16-gun corvette Fortune (under Captain de Lusignan), and seven transports carrying the R\u00e9giment de Pondich\u00e9ry, under Brigadier General Thomas Conway. Cardaillac was killed during the Battle of Porto Praya by a bullet to the chest. Lieutenant de la Bossi\u00e8re took over command of Art\u00e9sien. == Sources and references == Notes References Bibliography * * * Category:French Navy officers Category:1739 births Category:1781 deaths ",
