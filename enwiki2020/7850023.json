    "text": "Cumberland High School is a co-educational comprehensive secondary school (high school) located in the north-western metropolitan Western Sydney region of New South Wales, Australia. == History == Cumberland High School opened in January 1962 with an initial intake of 270 students in First Form (now known as Year 7). This student cohort commenced high school under the Wyndham Scheme, which extended New South Wales high school from five to six years and placed a greater emphasis on science and mathematics. The foundation headmaster was George Heery (1962\u20131965), who was responsible for the selection of the original school colours (brown, green and white), the school motto \"Finis Coronat Opus\", (\"the end crowns the work\") and the Cumberland school song. In addition to students from Carlingford, early students were drawn from as far afield as Pennant Hills, West Pennant Hills, and Beecroft to the north; from Epping, Ermington and Rydalmere to the east; from Dundas, Dundas Valley and Telopea to the south; and North Parramatta to the south-west. Subsequently, the student catchment area contracted with the establishment of nearby high schools, particularly Castle Hill High School (1963), Pennant Hills High School (1966), Carlingford High School (1968), and Muirfield High School (1976). In 2008, four Cumberland students took part in the Beijing Olympics, as members of the Olympic Games Orchestra. == Campus == Cumberland High is located at 183 Pennant Hills Road, Carlingford, New South Wales.

The grant is described in the Grant Register as \"laying and situated at The Ponds adjoining Carver's Farm\". Portion 100 was granted to William Butts on 19 November 1794, and described in the Grant Register as \"laying and situated in the district of The Ponds\".
