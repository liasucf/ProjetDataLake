In the 4th century, during the reign of Constantius II, this was the name by which the followers of A\u00ebtius and Eunomius were distinguished as a theological party. The term \"heterousian\" derives from the Greek , heteroo\u00fasios, \"differing in substance\" from , h\u00e9teros, \"another\" and , ous\u00eda, \"substance, being\". The semi-Arians condemned the Anomoeans in the Council of Seleucia, and the Anomoeans condemned the semi-Arians in their turn in the Councils of Constantinople and Antioch; erasing the word from the formula of Rimini and that of Constantinople and protesting that the Word had not only a different substance but also a will different from that of the Father.
