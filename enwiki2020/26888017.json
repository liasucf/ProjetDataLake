    "text": "Alfonso de la Cerda, (Valladolid 1270 - \u00c1vila 1333), called \"the disinherited,\" was the elder son of Ferdinand de la Cerda and his wife Blanche of France, and was a grandson of Alfonso X of Castile. Alfonso and his brother Fernando were candidates for the Castilian-Leonese crown during the reigns of Sancho IV of Castile, Ferdinand IV of Castile and Alfonso XI of Castile. In 1331, Alfonso renounced his rights and swore allegiance to Alfonso XI of Castile. == Biography == When Ferdinand de la Cerda died in 1275, Alfonso's grandmother, Violant of Aragon, took him and his newborn brother Fernando to Aragon. They were kept there 13 years in the fortress of X\u00e0tiva. Alfonso's grandfather, King Alfonso X of Castile, established a division of his realm. Sancho was to inherit Castile and Alfonso was to inherit Le\u00f3n, according to historian Joaqu\u00edn Cuevas Aller. After Alfonso X's death in 1284, the Leonese throne was usurped by Sancho, who would reign as Sancho IV. In September 1288, King Alfonso III of Aragon released Alfonso de la Cerda and proclaimed him king of Castile and Leon. Despite this support from the King of Aragon, Alfonso was unable to regain the throne. In 1304, as part of the Treaty of Torrellas, James II of Aragon and Ferdinand IV of Castile Alfonso agreed to resign all claims on the throne of Le\u00f3n. In return, he was appointed Lord of Alba, Bejar and Gibrale\u00f3n, and other manors, possessions and revenues, distributed throughout the Castilian-Leonese territory, in order that Alfonso de la Cerda could not form a large independent dominion. Later, Charles IV of France gave Alfonso de la Cerda the title of Baron de Lunel, a municipality located in the region of Languedoc-Roussillon, France. ==Death == On the death of Alfonso de la Cerda, his body was buried in the Monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda la Real de Las Huelgas de Burgos. ==Marriage and offspring== In 1290, Alfonso married Matilde of Brienne,Masnata y de Quesada, David E.
