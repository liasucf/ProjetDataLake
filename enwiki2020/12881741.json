Under the command of group captain the Hon. Max Aitken, six multi-national squadrons formed the Banff Strike Wing. Between September 1944 and May 1945, crews flying in Mosquito and Beaufighter aircraft targeted U-boats and surface vessels in the North Sea, causing the loss of thousands of tons of iron ore and other vital supplies. More than 80 airmen from the Wing gave their lives during the conflict. The airfield closed in 1946. In 1989, the R.A.F. Banff Strike Wing Memorial was erected on the Banff to Portsoy road near Portsoy. ==Attractions== In 2004, Boyndie's old school building was converted into a training centre for people with special needs, and a visitor centre and restaurant serving the local community. In 2006, Falck Renewables Wind Ltd built and commissioned the Boyndie Wind Farm, located on a disused World War II airfield. The wind farm has 8 turbines and when it\u2019s operating fully it generates 16.65 MW of electricity. The local community owns shares in the wind farm through the Boyndie Wind Farm Co-operative Ltd, which is the first wind farm co-operative in Scotland. ==Royal visit== On 11 November 2004 the Princess Royal visited Boyndie to tour the newly converted school building. ==See also== *Banff Bay ==References== * United Kingdom Ordnance Survey Map (2004) 1:50,000 scale, Landranger series; 29 ==Footnotes== Category:Villages in Aberdeenshire ",
