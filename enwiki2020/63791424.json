    "text": "The Byzantine\u2013Serbian wars were a series of wars between the Byzantine Empire and the early Serbian Principality, Grand Principality of Serbia, Serbian Kingdom, and Serbian Empire. Starting with the Sclaveni and Antae migrations into the Balkans, the succession of medieval Serbian states went through several periods of warfare with the Eastern Roman Empire. ==Early Contact between Constantinople and the Slavs== Some of the earliest belligerent contacts between Byzantium and the Slavs was during the Avar-Byzantine wars during the late 6th century, during which much of the Avar army was made up of Pannonian Slavs. During this period of invasion, often thought to be spanning from 574-588, the regions of Thracia and Moesia were devastated by up to a hundred thousand Sclaveni. ===Slavic invasions of the Balkans=== Serbian Principality in 850 The settlement of the Southern Slavs in the Eastern Roman Empire began in the mid-5th century with Slavic tribes along the Danube in Bavaria and Pannonia crossing over and settling in modern-day Bosnia and Croatia, slowly settling in Moesia, Scythia Minor, and Epirus, with some tribes moving as far south as the Peloponnese. During the 620s, an unnamed Serbian prince led a horde of White Serbs across the Danube to settle the western Balkans during the reign of Heraclius. These and many other Slavic tribes that settled in Sirmium, Moesia Superior, and nearby regions soon emerged as a unified Serbian cultural and political identity, emerging as the Principality of Serbia under the descendants of the unnamed Serbian prince. ===Principality of Serbia=== During most of the existence of this early medieval Serbian state, organized much like a confederation of tribes, headed by a Vlastimirovi\u0107 prince, the Serbs spent very little time in opposition to the Byzantine state. Much of the focus in the 8th and early 9th centuries was against Arab fleets, which often came into the Adriatic. The small amount of aggression between Serbs and Byzantines came from the limited Narentine piracy of Venetian trade vessels, which was responded to with several Venetian crackdowns in Pagania. Following the death of \u010caslav Vlastimirovi\u0107, the principality split into Duklja under the Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty and several smaller principalities, while the rest was annexed by the Byzantine Empire, which began to recover lost territory and by 1025 reached its highest territorial peak since the Arab conquests of Egypt and the Levant. ==Grand Principality of Serbia== The Grand Principality of Serbia regained its independence under Vukan Vojislavljevi\u0107 in the early 1090s, taking advantage of Alexios Komnenos' preoccupation in the struggle against the invading Seljuks. This power was quickly consolidated after the Serbs defeated a Byzantine army sent to pacify them in 1092 and obtained recognition from Alexios in two separate treaties between 1093 and 1095. Violations of this treaty were common, and the Serbian-Byzantine borders would often shift, especially around the cities of Ni\u0161 and Skopje. Vukan went on to found the Vukanovi\u0107 cadet branch of the Vojislavljevi\u0107 dynasty, which would rule over Ra\u0161ka, Zeta, Ni\u0161, and other regions until Stefan Nemanja defeated his brother Tihomir, who had been supported by a Byzantine army, and took the throne for himself, founding the Nemanji\u0107 branch. ===Stefan Nemanja=== While the Vojislavljevi\u0107i were better about keeping their pacts with the Byzantines, both them and their successors, the Nemanji\u0107i, were rather keen on taking territory from the declining state, whose last powerful Basileus, Manuel Komnenos, died in 1180. Following his demise, almost all remaining Byzantine holdings on the Adriatic Sea save Ragusa were conquered by Nemanja. A few years later, as the Catholic armies of the Third Crusade were keeping the Ayyubids occupied, Isaac Angelos turned his attention towards reconquering lost territories in the Balkans, primarily Bulgaria, but after that campaign failed he attacked Serbia instead, drawing an early victory on the Morava river and driving Nemanja into the mountains. However, domestic issues began to rise up in Constantinople, and that on top of Isaac's admiration for Nemanja, led the Basileus to abandon his campaign to reconquer Serbia. ===Du\u0161an=== Byzantine & Serbian Empires in 1355 In 1331 young Stefan Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an rose to the Serbian throne and over the course of twenty years conquered Epirus, Albania, the lands around Thessalonica, and much of Thessaly from the dwindling Byzantine Empire, founding the Serbian Empire. Du\u0161an had taken advantage of Constantinople's situation, which was very preoccupied battling constant Turkish raids, civil unrest, and dynastic revolts. This conquest of Greece didn't last long as his successor, Stefan Uro\u0161 V, was a considerably weaker leader, and Du\u0161an's empire had entirely collapsed into small provinces by the 1370s, and were conquered by the early 15th century. The fall of the Serbian Empire marked the end of the Byzantine-Serbian wars, as Byzantium itself had become so small that it no longer shared a border with any Serbian polities. Byzantium shared the same fate as the Serbian provinces, being conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1453. ==References== Serbia Byzantine Category:Medieval history of the Balkans ",
