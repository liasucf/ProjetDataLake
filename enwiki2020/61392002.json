At the beginning, his management is inspired to a line of prudent opening, softening the censure and giving space also to professionals (as Enzo Biagi and Ugo Gregoretti) not aligned with the DC. * 1 October. - The socialist Enzo Biagi becomes director of the TV news; he renews the program, giving less space to internal politics and officialdom and more to chronicle and news from the world. This new deal arouses harsh polemics by the right-wing and, after a year, Biagi resigns. * 4 November \u2013 The Second channel begins the broadcastings. This is the schedule of the first day. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ |9,05 PM |The war and the victory: special evening about the anniversary of the Italian victory in the first world war (a concert, a documentary and the teleplay The trench, see below) |- |11 PM |News |- |11,20 PM |The evil queen, ballet by Birgit Cullberg. |} The new channel airs two hours by day (since 9 PM) and is received only by a half of the Italian population. * 12 November. In the Council of ministers, Guido Gonella and Mario Scelba, exponents of the most conservative DC\u2019s wing, attack fiercely the variety shows, the Enzo Biagi's TV journal and the Political tribune (see below) accusing RAI to \u201chave put Togliatti and the ballerinas in the Italian families\u2019 heart.\u201d *On \u201cIl Verri\u201d, the essay Mike Bongiorno\u2019s phenomenology, by Umberto Eco, is published. The writing, despite its playful tone, is one of the first serious analyses of the television as social phenomenon. == Debuts == === Serials === * Giovanna la nonna del corsaro nero (Giovanna the black corsair's grandmother) \u2013 four seasons; directed by Alda Grimaldi, written by Vittorio Metz, with Anna Campori.

It's considered the masterpiece of the Italian TV variety, thanks moreover to the spectacular ballets, performed in minimalist scenography, to the Mina's talent, not only as singer but as entertainer too, and to the numerous guest stars. The Quartetto Cetra\u2019s musical parodies get so much success to be developed in a separate show (The Studio One library). === News and educational === * Tribuna politica (Political tribune) \u2013 political talk show, created after the success of Electoral tribune the previous year, hosted by Jader Jacobelli; in a press conference, a politician faces journalists by various tendencies.
