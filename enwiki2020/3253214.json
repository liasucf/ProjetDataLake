    "text": "Ordo\u00f1o III (-956) was the King of Le\u00f3n from 951 to 956, son and successor of Ramiro II (931-951). He confronted Navarre and Castile, who supported his half-brother Sancho the Fat in disputing Ordo\u00f1o's claim to the throne. He also had to deal with internal rebellion, attacks from the Muslims of al-Andalus, and the rebellion of Galicia. In response to the Muslims, Ordo\u00f1o III led a raid as far as Lisbon (955), coming back north with a very lucrative haul of loot. Faced with this great show of force, Abd-al-Rahman III (912-961) was pushed to negotiate and conclude a peace treaty with the king of Le\u00f3n. He tried to continue the actions of his father in fortifying the land and the royal authority in the face of the contumacious and secessional Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez of Castile. He even married Fern\u00e1n's daughter Urraca and later repudiated her over her father's alliance with Sancho. Urraca bore him at least two children: a son named Ordo\u00f1o who died young and a daughter named Theresa who became a nun. Ordo\u00f1o III was also father of Bermudo II, but opinion is divided as to whether he was son of Urraca, or of a mistress, one of the daughters of Count Pelayo Gonzalez. Ordo\u00f1o III died at Zamora in 956. ==Notes== Category:920s births Category:956 deaths Category:Leonese monarchs Category:Galician monarchs Category:10th-century monarchs in Europe Category:Beni Alfons Category:Burials in the Royal Pantheon at the Basilica of San Isidoro ",
