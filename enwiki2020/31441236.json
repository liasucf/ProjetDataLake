In early October, Orquia was announced to be featured in Shake, Rattle & Roll 14, an official entry to the annual Metro Manila Film Festival. The film was scheduled to be released on December 25, 2012 and was to be Orquia's first big screen appearance. However, in November 2012 Orquia's name was removed in the final cast list. Mutya Orquia received the Best Child Performance award for her performance as Abby Lim in Be Careful With My Heart at the 4th FMTM Awards 2012 for TV Entertainment. It was announced in June 2013 that Orquia was to reprise her role as Abby in a theatrical adaptation of Be Careful With My Heart, which was to be included in the 2013 Metro Manila Film Festival, but was later scrapped due to schedule constraints with the cast. In 2014, Orquia lent her vocals on the opening song of Be Careful with My Heart (The Lullaby Album) entitled Angel Of God released under Star Music. She was a regular cast member on the children's sketch comedy show Goin' Bulilit, having been a mainstay from 2012 to 2019. ==Filmography== ===Television=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year !!
