    "text": "Nude Ants is a live album by American pianist Keith Jarrett which was released by ECM Records in 1980. It was recorded during different live performances by Jarrett's 'European Quartet', featuring Jan Garbarek, Palle Danielsson and Jon Christensen, at the Village Vanguard in New York City in May 1979. The title of the album is a play on the phrase \"New Dance\", which is the title of the penultimate song. ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 4\u00bd stars, stating, \"The pianist very much dominates the music but Garbarek's unique floating tone on his instruments and the subtle accompaniment by Danielsson and Christensen are also noteworthy.\".Yanow, S. Allmusic Review accessed September 12, 2011 The album is a persuasive illustration of Jarrett's typically refined work with European classical and folk music influences. ==Track listing== All compositions by Keith Jarrett. # \"Chant of the Soil\" - 17:13 # \"Innocence\" - 8:15 # \"Processional\" - 20:33 # \"Oasis\" - 30:35 # \"New Dance\" - 12:57 # \"Sunshine Song\" - 12:03 ==Personnel== *Keith Jarrett - Piano, timbales, percussion *Jan Garbarek - Tenor and soprano saxophones *Palle Danielsson - Bass *Jon Christensen - Drums == Technical Personnel == * Tom McKenney - Recording Engineer * Martin Wieland - Mixing Engineer * Barbara Wojirsch - Cover Design and Layout * Manfred Eicher - Production == References == Category:Jan Garbarek live albums Category:Keith Jarrett live albums Category:1979 live albums Category:ECM Records live albums Category:Albums produced by Manfred Eicher Category:Albums recorded at the Village Vanguard ",
