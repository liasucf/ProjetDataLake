    "text": "It is alleged that as a result of benefits extended to Michael Lowry by Denis O'Brien that Esat Digifone was given an unfair advantage in the procurement of a mobile phone operator's licence. The Moriarty Tribunal found evidence of collusion between Lowry and O'Brien: \"There are three significant findings which are largely beyond dispute. They are: * Denis O\u2019Brien gave substantial sums of money to Fine Gael in order to make friends with people in the party. This happened at a time when Fine Gael was in government and O\u2019Brien was seeking a government decision in his favour. * Michael Lowry sought to be involved, to a greater or lesser degree, in the licensing process, seeking information about it on a number of occasions * Denis O\u2019Brien, or persons close to him, subsequently sought to give large amounts of money to Michael Lowry.\" ==References== Category:Political scandals in the Republic of Ireland Category:Michael Lowry ",
