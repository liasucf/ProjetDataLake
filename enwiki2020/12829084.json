Written as a third-person account of Eller's experiences at Microsoft, it goes into detail about the early years of Microsoft and its emergence as a massive corporation. Two chapters of the book deal specifically with the business contacts between Microsoft and GO Corporation. In April 2008, as part of a larger federal court case, the gesture features of the Windows/Tablet PC operating system and hardware were found to infringe on a patent by GO Corp. concerning gesture interfaces in operating systems for portable computers. ==References== ==External links== * The first chapter of Barbarians Led by Bill Gates at washingtonpost.com Category:1998 non-fiction books Category:Books about computer and internet entrepreneurs Category:History of Microsoft ",
