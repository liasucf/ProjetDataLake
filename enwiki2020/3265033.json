    "text": "Wycombe was, from 1894 to 1974, a rural district in the administrative county of Buckinghamshire, England. The district was created by the Local Government Act 1894 as successor to the disbanded Wycombe Rural Sanitary District. The district was named after, and based in, High Wycombe. The rural district did not include the town, however, which was a separate municipal borough (known as Chepping Wycombe until 1946). ==Area and parishes== The district consisted of a number of rural parishes surrounding High Wycombe. In 1934 it was enlarged, when a county review order added the area of the abolished Hambleden Rural District. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Parish !!
