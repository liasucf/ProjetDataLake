The ship was named for Fort Frances, a town in northwestern Ontario. Following the war, the vessel was transferred to the Department of Mines and Technical Surveys and used for hydrographic and oceanographic survey. The vessel was discarded in 1974 and broken up for scrap. ==Design and description== The reciprocating group displaced at standard load and at deep load The ships measured long overall with a beam of . They had a draught of . The ships' complement consisted of 85 officers and ratings.Lenton, p. 261 The reciprocating ships had two vertical triple- expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by two Admiralty three-drum boilers. The engines produced a total of and gave a maximum speed of . They carried a maximum of of fuel oil that gave them a range of at . The Algerine class was armed with a QF Mk V anti-aircraft gunChesneau, p. 65 and four twin-gun mounts for Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. The latter guns were in short supply when the first ships were being completed and they often got a proportion of single mounts. By 1944, single-barrel Bofors 40 mm mounts began replacing the twin 20 mm mounts on a one for one basis. All of the ships were fitted for four throwers and two rails for depth charges. Many Canadian ships omitted their sweeping gear in exchange for a 24-barrel Hedgehog spigot mortar and a stowage capacity for 90+ depth charges. ==Construction and career== Fort Frances was ordered on 25 November 1942 as part of the 1943 building program. The minesweeper was laid down on 11 May 1943 by Port Arthur Shipbuilding Company Ltd. at Port Arthur, Ontario and launched on 30 October. The ship was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 28 October 1944 at Port Arthur.Macpherson & Barrie, p. 195 After working up in Bermuda in January 1945, Fort Frances returned to Halifax, Nova Scotia and joined the Western Escort Force convoy escort groups W-8 and W-9 for short periods before the end of the war in Europe. The minesweeper was paid off into maintenance reserve on 3 August 1945. The ship was recommissioned on 23 October 1945 and this deployment lasted until 5 April 1946, when Fort Frances was paid off for the final time. In 1948, Fort Frances was transferred to the Department of Mines and Technical Surveys for use as a hydrographic ship. In 1958 she was converted into an oceanographic survey ship. Three laboratories were installed along with the ability to carry up to eight scientists, her main purpose being underwater acoustic research. Fort Frances served in this duty until she was sold in 1974 for scrap and broken up. In 2009, Fort Frances was presented with a framed history of the ship in commemoration of the Canadian Naval Centennial. ==See also== * List of ships of the Canadian Navy ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * * * * * ==External links== * Haze Gray and Underway * ReadyAyeReady.com Category:Ships of the Royal Canadian Navy Category:Algerine-class minesweepers of the Royal Canadian Navy Category:Ships built in Ontario Category:1943 ships Category:World War II minesweepers of Canada Category:World War II escort ships of Canada Category:Minesweepers of the Royal Canadian Navy ",
