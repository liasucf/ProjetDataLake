    "text": "In mathematics, a Leinster group is a finite group whose order equals the sum of the orders of its proper normal subgroups. The Leinster groups are named after Tom Leinster, a mathematician at the University of Edinburgh, who wrote about them in a paper written in 1996 but not published until 2001. He called them \"perfect groups\", and later \"immaculate groups\", but they were renamed as the Leinster groups by , because \"perfect group\" already had a different meaning (a group that equals its commutator subgroup). Leinster groups give a group-theoretic way of analyzing the perfect numbers and of approaching the still-unsolved problem of the existence of odd perfect numbers. For a cyclic group, the orders of the subgroups are just the divisors of the order of the group, so a cyclic group is a Leinster group if and only if its order is a perfect number. More strongly, as Leinster proved, an abelian group is a Leinster group if and only if it is a cyclic group whose order is a perfect number. ==Examples== The cyclic groups whose order is a perfect number are Leinster groups. It is possible for a non-abelian Leinster group to have odd order; an example, of order 355433039577, was constructed by Fran\u00e7ois Brunault. Other examples of non-abelian Leinster groups include certain groups of the form A_n\\times C_m, where A_n is an alternating group and C_m is a cyclic group . For instance, the groups A_5\\times C_{15128}, A_6\\times C_{366776} , A_{7}\\times C_{5919262622} and A_{10}\\times C_{691816586092} are Leinster groups. The same examples can also be constructed with symmetric groups, i.e., groups of the form S_n\\times C_{m}, such as S_3\\times C_{5}. The possible orders of Leinster groups form the integer sequence :6, 12, 28, 30, 56, 360, 364, 380, 496, 760, 792, 900, 992, 1224, ... == Properties == *There are no Leinster groups that are symmetric or alternating. * There is no Leinster group of order p2q2, where p, q are primes. * No finite semi-simple group is Leinster. * No p-group can be a Leinster group. * All abelian Leinster groups are cyclic with order equal to a perfect number. ==References== Category:Group theory ",
