Unable to make it in the seniors with Geelong, Tenabel made his way to South Melbourne and made seven league appearances in the 1965 VFL season. He played three games in 1966, followed by another seven in 1967, before leaving for Geelong West. Tenabel had a memorable first season at Geelong West in 1968. A follower in the club's Division Two premiership team, he kicked three goals in the grand final win over Williamstown and also won Geelong West's best and fairest award. He then captain-coached the club in the 1969 VFA season. He coached Newtown & Chilwell in 1973, 1974 and 1980. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1945 births Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Sydney Swans players Category:Geelong West Football Club players Category:Geelong West Football Club coaches Category:Newtown & Chilwell Football Club players Category:Living people ",
