    "text": "B\u00f6rek (; also burek and other variants) is a family of baked filled pastries made of a thin flaky dough such as phyllo or yufka, typically filled with meat, cheese or vegetables. It is found in the cuisines of the Turkish cuisine, Balkans, the South Caucasus, the Levant, and other parts of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. A b\u00f6rek may be prepared in a large pan and cut into portions after baking, or as individual pastries. The top of the b\u00f6rek is occasionally sprinkled with sesame or nigella seeds. ==Origin and name== B\u00f6rek was a popular element of Ottoman cuisine, and has been invented at the Ottoman court,Oxford Companion to Food, s.v. though there are also indications it was made among Central Asian Turks;Perry, Charles. \"The Taste for Layered Bread among the Nomadic Turks and the Central Asian Origins of Baklava\", in A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East (ed. Sami Zubaida, Richard Tapper), 1994, . other versions may date to the Classical era of the eastern Mediterranean.Patrick Faas (2003). Around the Roman Table: Food and Feasting in Ancient Rome. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 184.Speros Vryonis The Decline of Medieval Hellenism in Asia Minor, 1971, p. 482 The word b\u00f6rek comes from Turkish and refers to any dish made with yufka. Tietze proposes that the word comes from the Turkic root bur- 'to twist',.Tietze, T\u00fcrkisches etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch, Band I, Ankara/Wien Sevortyan offers various alternative etymologies, all of them based on a fronted vowel /\u00f6/ or /\u00fc/. Tietze's proposed source \"bur-\" (with a backed vowel /u/) for b\u00fcr\u00e4k/b\u00f6rek (with fronted vowels) is not included, because sound harmony would dictate a suffix \"-aq\" with a harmonised, backed /q/.\u042d.\u0412. \u0421\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0442\u044f\u043d, \u042d\u0442\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044c \u0422\u044e\u0440\u043a\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u042f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u0422\u043e\u043c \u0411, \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430 1978 Turkic languages in Arabic orthography, however, invariably write \u0643 and not \u0642 which rules out \"bur-\" which has a backed vowel /u/ at its core. B\u00f6rek may have its origins in Turkish cuisine and may be one of its most significant and, in fact, ancient elements of the Turkish cuisine, having been developed by the Turks of Central Asia before their westward migration to Anatolia in the late Middle Ages, or it may be a descendant of the pre-existing Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Anatolian dish en tyritas plakountas (Byzantine Greek: \u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c2) \"cheesy placenta\", itself a descendant of placenta, the classical baked layered dough and cheese dish of Ancient Roman cuisine. Recent ethnographic research indicates that b\u00f6rek was probably invented separately by the nomadic Turks of central Asia some time before the seventh century. ==Distribution and variants== B\u00f6rek is very popular in the cuisines of the former Ottoman Empire, especially in North Africa and throughout the Balkans. The South Slavic cuisines also feature derivatives of the b\u00f6rek. B\u00f6rek is also part of Mizrahi and Sephardic Jewish traditions. They have been enthusiastically adopted by the Ottoman Jewish communities, and have been described, along with boyos de pan and bulemas, as forming \"the trio of preeminent Ottoman Jewish pastries\". ===Turkey=== Turkey Sigara or kalem b\u00f6re\u011fi \u00c7ib\u00f6rek and Ayran Turkey enjoys a wide variety of regional variations of b\u00f6rek among the different cultures and ethnicities composing it, including: *Su b\u00f6re\u011fi 'water b\u00f6rek' is one of the most common types. Sheets of dough are boiled briefly in large pans, then a mixture of feta cheese and parsley (or in an alternative recipe minced meat, onions, tomato sauce) and oil is scattered between the layers. The whole thing is brushed with butter and laid in a masonry oven to cook. it may be thought of as a drier, less saucy version of the Italian lasagna. *Sigara b\u00f6re\u011fi 'cigarette b\u00f6rek' or kalem b\u00f6re\u011fi 'pen b\u00f6rek', a smaller, cylindrical variety is often filled with feta cheese, potato, parsley and sometimes with minced meat or sausage. A variety of vegetables, herbs and spices are used in b\u00f6reks, such as spinach, nettle, leek, and courgette, and usually ground black pepper. The name kalem b\u00f6re\u011fi was adopted in September 2011 by some Turkish pastry organisations in order to avoid alluding to smoking. *Pa\u00e7anga b\u00f6re\u011fi, is a traditional Sephardic Jewish specialty of Istanbul filled with past\u0131rma or ka\u015far, and julienned green peppers fried in olive oil and eaten as a meze. *Saray b\u00f6re\u011fi 'palace b\u00f6rek' is a layered b\u00f6rek where fresh butter is rolled between each of the dough sheets. *Tala\u015f b\u00f6re\u011fi or Nemse b\u00f6re\u011fi 'sawdust' or 'Austrian' b\u00f6rek, is a small square b\u00f6rek mostly filled with lamb cubes and green peas, that has starchier yufka sheets, making it puffy and crispy. *Kol b\u00f6re\u011fi 'arm b\u00f6rek' is prepared in long rolls, either rounded or lined, and filled with either minced meat, feta cheese, spinach or potato and baked at a low temperature. *Sar\u0131yer b\u00f6re\u011fi is a smaller and a little fattier version of the \"Kol b\u00f6re\u011fi\", named after Sar\u0131yer, a district of Istanbul *G\u00fcl b\u00f6re\u011fi 'rose b\u00f6rek', also known as Yuvarlak b\u00f6re\u011fi 'round or spiral b\u00f6rek' are rolled into small spirals and have a spicier filling than other b\u00f6rek. *\u00c7i\u011f b\u00f6rek or \u00c7ib\u00f6rek 'raw b\u00f6rek' is a half-round shaped b\u00f6rek, filled with raw minced meat and fried in oil on the concave side of the sac, very popular in places with a thriving Tatar community, such as Eski\u015fehir, Polatl\u0131 and Konya. *T\u00f6b\u00f6rek is another Tatar variety, similar to a \u00e7i\u011f b\u00f6rek, but baked either on the convex side of the sac, or in a masonry oven instead of being fried in oil. *Laz b\u00f6re\u011fi, a specialty of the Rize region, is a sweet version, filled with muhallebi (Ottoman-style milk pudding or custard) and served sprinkled with powdered sugar. It similar to Greek Bougatsa. *K\u00fct B\u00f6re\u011fi is similar to Laz b\u00f6re\u011fi, without the custard filling. It is also called sade (plain) b\u00f6rek and served with fine powdered sugar. Most of the time, the word \"b\u00f6rek\" is accompanied in Turkish by a descriptive word referring to the shape, ingredients of the pastry, for the cooking methods or for or a specific region where it is typically prepared, as in the above kol b\u00f6re\u011fi, su b\u00f6re\u011fi, tala\u015f b\u00f6re\u011fi or Sar\u0131yer b\u00f6re\u011fi. Tatar b\u00f6re\u011fi (Tatar b\u00f6rek) is an alternative name for the cheese and mint filled dumpling dish known as mant\u0131. ===Albanian byrek and lakror=== Byrek in Albania In Albania, this dish is called byrek. In Kosovo and few other regions byrek is also known as \"pite\". Byrek is traditionally made with several layers of dough that have been thinly rolled out by hand. The final form can be small, individual triangles, especially from street vendors called 'Byrektore' which sell byrek and other traditional pastries and drinks. It can also be made as one large byrek that is cut into smaller pieces. There are different regional variations of byrek. It can be served cold or hot. The most common fillings include: cheese (especially gjiz\u00eb, salted curd cheese), ground meat and onions (rag\u00f9 style filling), spinach and eggs, milk and eggs with pre-baked dough layers, but it can also be made with tomato and onions, peppers and beans, potato or a sweet filling of pumpkin, nettles (known as byrek me hithra), kidney beans (popular in winter), etc. Lakror is a specific kind of byrek from the region of Kor\u00e7a. The defining characteristics of lakror is that it is made up of only two layers of pastry and traditionally cooked on embers with a metal semispherical lid. Lakror is generally filled with greens, e.g. leek and gjiz\u00eb (a kind of cottage cheese, thicker than ricotta), lak\u00ebr being an Albanian word for cabbage but in this context an abbreviation of \"lak\u00ebr e eg\u00ebr\", a term which describes a family of green leaf vegetables i.e. sorrel, dandelion, scarole, catsear, etc. Other fillings are also possible, and tomato and onion is also common. Another related dish is Fli, typical from the North of Albania and Kosovo. It is made up of layers of a flour and water batter, cream and butter. Traditionally, it is baked on embers like lakror. ===Armenian byorek=== In Armenia, byorek (\u0562\u0575\u0578\u0580\u0565\u056f) or borek (\u0562\u0578\u0580\u0565\u056f), consists of dough, or phyllo dough, folded into triangles and stuffed with cheese, spinach or ground beef, and the filling is typically spiced. A popular combination is spinach, feta, cottage cheese (or pot cheese) and a splash of anise-flavoured liquor (such as raki). ===Assyrian burek=== Assyrian burek is usually stuffed with spiced ground beef, finely chopped onion, paprika, parsley and spices. The stuffing is placed on a thin layer of rolled out dough, then sealed, resembling a half moon or an empanada. Lastly, it is oven-baked or fried. ===Bulgarian byurek=== The Bulgarian version of the pastry, locally called byurek (Cyrillic: \u0431\u044e\u0440\u0435\u043a), is typically regarded as a variation of banitsa (\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430), a similar Bulgarian dish. Bulgarian byurek is a type of banitsa with sirene cheese, the difference being that byurek also has eggs added. In Bulgarian, the word byurek has also come to be applied to other dishes similarly prepared with cheese and eggs, such as chushka byurek (\u0447\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u044e\u0440\u0435\u043a), a peeled and roasted pepper filled with cheese, and tikvichka byurek (\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0432\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0431\u044e\u0440\u0435\u043a), blanched or uncooked bits of squash with eggs filling. ===Greek bour\u00e9ki, bourek\u00e1ki, bougatsa, and pita=== Galaktoboureko, sweet b\u00f6rek flavoured with lemon or orange In Greece, boureki (\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ad\u03ba\u03b9 ) or bourekaki (\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b5\u03ba\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 , the diminutive form of the word), and Cyprus poureki (\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ad\u03ba\u03b9, in the Greek dialects of the island) are small pastries made with phyllo dough or with pastry crust. Pastries in the b\u00f6rek family are also called pita (pie): tiropita, spanakopita and so on. The traditional filling for spanakopita comprises chopped spinach, feta cheese, onions or spring onions, egg, and seasoning.Zane, Eva (1992). Greek Cooking for the Gods. Santa Rosa, California: The Cole Group. . A special type of boureki is found in the local cuisine of Crete and especially in the area of Chania. It is a pie filled with sliced zucchini, sliced potatoes, mizithra or feta cheese and spearmint, and may be baked with or without a thick top crust of phyllo. A photo of bougatsa, a Greek variant of b\u00f6rek Bougatsa (Greek \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03b3\u03ac\u03c4\u03c3\u03b1 ) is a Greek variation of a b\u00f6rek which consists of either semolina custard, cheese, or minced meat filling between layers of phyllo, and is said to originate in the city of Serres, an art of pastry brought with the immigrants from Constantinople and is most popular in Thessaloniki, in the Central Macedonia region of Northern Greece.http://www.thessalonikiartsandculture.gr/blog/texnopersona/i-istoria- tis-bougatsas#.Vwkdo5yLT4Y The Greek city of Serres achieved the record for the largest puff pastry on 1 June 2008. It weighed 182.2kg, was 20 metres long, and was made by more than 40 bakers.http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-bougatsa Guinness World Records In Venetian Corfu, boureki was also called burriche, and filled with meat and leafy greens. Galaktoboureko is a syrupy phyllo pastry filled with custard, common throughout Greece and Cyprus. In the Epirus, \u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c1-\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03ad\u03ba (derives from the Turkish \u015feker-b\u00f6rek, \"sugar-b\u00f6rek\") is a small rosewater-flavoured marzipan sweet. The Pontian Greek piroski (\u03c0\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03ba\u03af) derives its name from b\u00f6rek too.\u039a\u03bf\u03c0\u03b9\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u039a\u03bf\u03c5\u03b6\u03af\u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5. \u03a5\u03b3\u03b9\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03ad\u03c2 \u2013 \u03b1\u03c5\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u039a\u03c5\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03ad\u03c2 It's almost identical in name and form to pirozhki (Russian: \u043f\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0436\u043a\u0438), which is of Slavic origin, and popular in Russia and further east. ===Israel=== Fresh potato bourekas on sale at a stall in Mahane Yehuda Market, Jerusalem In Israel, bourekas () became popular as Sephardic Jewish immigrants who settled there cooked the cuisine of their native countries. Bourekas can be made from either phyllo dough or puff pastry filled with various fillings. The most popular fillings are salty cheese and mashed potato, with other fillings including mushrooms, ground meat, sweet potato, chickpeas, olives, spinach, mallows, swiss chard, eggplant and pizza-flavour. Most bourekas in Israel are made with margarine-based doughs rather than butter-based doughs so that (at least the non-cheese filled varieties) can be eaten along with either milk meals or meat meals in accordance with the kosher prohibition against mixing milk and meat at the same meal. Israeli bourekas come in several shapes and are often sprinkled with seeds. The shapes and choice of seeds are usually indicative of their fillings and have become fairly standard among small bakeries and large factories alike. For example, Salty cheese (Bulgarian cheese)-filled as well as Tzfat cheese (from the city of Safed) with Za'atar-filled bourekas are usually somewhat flat triangles with white sesame seeds on top. Less salty cheese-filled are semi-circular and usually made with puff pastry. Potato- filled are sesame topped, flat squares or rectangles made with phyllo and tend to be less oily than most other versions. Mushroom-filled are bulging triangles with poppy seeds. Tuna-filled are bulging triangles with nigella seeds. Eggplant-filled are cylindrical with nigella seeds. Bean sprout-filled are cylindrical without seeds. Spinach-filled are either cylindrical with sesame seeds or made with a very delicate, oily phyllo dough shaped into round spirals. Bourekas with a pizza sauce are often round spirals rising toward the middle or sometimes cylindrical without seeds, differentiated from the bean sprout-filled cylinders without seeds by the red sauce oozing out the ends. Bourekas can also be found with mashed chickpeas, tuna and chickpea mix, pumpkin and even small cocktail frankfurters. Another variation filled with meat (beef, chicken or lamb), pine nuts, parsley and spices are eaten mainly as a main dish but sometimes as meze. The North African version, Brik can also be found in Israel. Bourekas come in small, \"snack\" size, often available in self-service bakeries, and sizes as large as four or five inches. The larger ones can serve as a snack or a meal, and can be sliced open, and stuffed with hard-boiled egg, pickles, tomatoes and Sahawiq, a spicy Yemenite paste. Supermarkets stock a wide selection of frozen raw-dough bourekas ready for home baking. Bakeries and street vendors dealing exclusively in bourekas can be found in most Israeli cities. Small coffee-shop type establishments as well as lottery and sports betting parlors serving bourekas and coffee can also be found. Meat bourekas are less common at bakeries and are considered something which is to be made at home. Meat bourekas are made from lamb, beef or chicken mixed with onion, parsley, coriander, or mint, pine nuts and spices, They are served as hot meze. The use of margarine in bourekas has caused some controversy in Israel due to a general trend of moving away from trans fats, which are found in many margarines. Bourekas have given their name to Bourekas films, a peculiarly Israeli genre of comic melodramas or tearjerkers based on ethnic stereotypes. ===Former Yugoslavia=== In the nations established or reestablished in the stead of the territories of the former Yugoslavia, burek is regularly available at most bakeries, and usually eaten as \"fast food\". It is often consumed with yogurt. Apart from being sold at bakeries, burek is served in specialised stores selling burek (or pitas) and yogurt exclusively (Buregd\u017einica). As of 2019, these terms seem to be virtually synonymous to one another, the reason being that Buregd\u017einica style shops would diversify and sell other pastries as well. ====Bosnian burek==== Bosnian rolled burek In the former Yugoslavia, burek, also known as pita in Bosnia and Herzegovina exclusively, is an extremely common dish, made with yufka and the Bosnian variant is arguably the most regionally prominent. It may be eaten for any meal of the day. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the burek is a meat-filled pastry, traditionally rolled in a spiral and cut into sections for serving. The same spiral filled with cottage cheese is called sirnica, with spinach and cheese zeljanica, with potatoes krompiru\u0161a, and all of them are generically referred to as pita. Eggs are used as a binding agent when making sirnica and zeljanica. This kind of pastry is also popular in Croatia, where it was imported by Bosnian Croats, and is usually called rolani burek (rolled burek). In Serbian towns, Bosnian pastry dishes were imported by war refugees in the 1990s, and are usually called sarajevske pite or bosanske pite (Sarajevo pies or Bosnian pies). Similar dishes, although somewhat wider and with thinner dough layers, are called savija\u010da or just \"pita\" in Serbia. These are usually homemade and not traditionally offered in bakeries. In 2012, Lonely Planet included the Bosnian burek in their \"The World's Best Street Food\" book. ====Round burek in Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Kosovo and Slovenia==== Round burek (filled with minced meat) is made in Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Slovenia. In Serbia, Albania, Kosovo, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Slovenia, burek is made from layers of dough, alternating with layers of other fillings in a circular baking pan and then topped with a last layer of dough. Traditionally it may be baked with no filling (prazan, meaning empty), with stewed minced meat and onions, or with cheese. Modern bakeries offer cheese and spinach, apple, sour cherries, potato, mushroom, and other fillings. The recipe for \"round\" burek was developed in the Serbian town of Ni\u0161. In 1498, it was introduced by a famous Turkish baker, Mehmed O\u011flu from Istanbul. Eventually burek spread from the southeast (southern Serbia, Kosovo and North Macedonia) to the rest of Yugoslavia. Ni\u0161 hosts an annual burek competition and festival called Buregd\u017eijada. In 2005, a 100 kg (220 lbs) burek was made, with a diameter of 2 metres (\u22486 ft) and it is considered to have been the world biggest burek ever made. In Slovenia, burek is one of the most popular fast-food dishes, but at least one researcher found that it is viewed negatively by Slovenes due to their prejudices towards immigrants, especially those from other countries of Former Yugoslavia. A publication of a diploma thesis on this at the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Ljubljana in 2010 stirred controversy regarding the appropriateness of the topic. The mentor of the student that had written the thesis described the topic as legitimate and burek as denoting primitive behavior in Slovenia in spite of it being a sophisticated food. He explained the controversy as a good example of the conclusions of the student. Actually, already in 2008, an employee of the Scientific Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SRC SASA) had attained his PhD degree with a thesis on meta-burek at the University of Nova Gorica. ===Romania=== In Romania, the food falls under the name \"pl\u0103cint\u0103\" and is most often made with cheese or cheese and spinach. In Dobrogea, eastern territory that used to be a Turkish province, one can find both the Turkish influence - pl\u0103cint\u0103 dobrogeana either filled with cheese or with minced meat and served with sheep yoghurt or the Tatar street food Suberek - a deep fried half Moon cheese filled dough. ===Moldova=== The regional cuisine of the Moldavian West bank of the Pruth still yields a type of dumpling-like food called burechiu\u015fe (sometimes called burechi\u0163e) which is described as dough in the shape of a ravioli-like square which is filled with mushrooms such as Boletus edulis, and sealed around its edges and then tossed and subsequently boiled in borscht like soupsAlexander REINHARDT, Gazeta de agricultura - Credinte si traditii de Ajun si Craciun or chorbas. They are traditionally eaten in the last day of fasting at the time of the Christmas Eve. It is not clear if the burechiu\u015fe derive their name from the Turco-Greek b\u00f6rek (which is a distinct possibility given the fact that Ottoman Moldavia was ruled for many decades by dynasties of Greek Phanariotes who encouraged Greek colonists to settle in the area), so at the receiving end of cultural and culinary influences coming from them, or it takes its name from that of the mushroom Boletus (burete in its Romanian language rhotacised version, and it meant \"mushroom\" as well as \"sponge\") by the pattern of the ravioli, which were named after the Italian name of the turnip with which they were once filled. ==See also== * Zelnik * Banitsa * Brik * Bierock * Gibanica * List of ancient dishes and foods * List of pastries * Pastel * Pierogi * Pirog * Pirozhki * Karelian pasty from Finland *Khachapuri * Samosa * Mongolian Khuushuur ==References== ==External links== * Category:Albanian cuisine Category:Algerian cuisine Category:Arab pastries Category:Ancient dishes Category:Armenian cuisine Category:Assyrian cuisine Category:Balkan cuisine Category:Kurdish cuisine Category:Bulgarian cuisine Category:Central Asian cuisine Category:Croatian cuisine Category:Cypriot cuisine Category:Greek pastries Category:Iranian cuisine Category:Iraqi cuisine Category:Israeli cuisine Category:Jewish baked goods Category:Jordanian cuisine Category:Lebanese cuisine Category:Levantine cuisine Category:Middle Eastern cuisine Category:Moroccan cuisine Category:Ottoman cuisine Category:Palestinian cuisine Category:Savoury pies Category:Stuffed dishes Category:Syrian cuisine Category:Tunisian cuisine Category:Turkish pastries ",
