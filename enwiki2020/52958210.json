Examples of such a task is missions with military units and observer missions. Exercises, readiness, service in an international staff and basing (equivalent) does not count as an international service, but is considered as an foreign official journey. The medal should not be used as an award in the event that Sweden is at war. ==Appearance and cost== The medal is formed of oxidized bronze and is of the 8th size (31 mm diameter). The obverse shows the heraldic arms of the Swedish Armed Forces and around the outer edge the words F\u00d6R INTERNATIONELLA INSATSER (\"FOR INTERNATIONAL SERVICE\"). The reverse is blank. The medal is worn in a 35 mm blue ribbon. The ribbon can after the Supreme Commander's decision be provided with a laurel wreath in silver.
