She is specialised in the 500, 1000 and 1500 m. ==Sports career== After spending a few years at local teams in the South Holland area, Boer was seen as one of the Netherlands main future talents and was offered a contract at the KNSB youth development team for the 2006\u201307 season. In the years before she already participated in several World Cup meetings. Her first success in her new team was winning a gold medal on the 500 m at the 2007 KNSB Dutch Single Distance Championships. She won the both races beating all the opponents, including favourites such as Marianne Timmer and Annette Gerritsen. ===2010 Winter Olympics=== Boer qualified to participate in all of her specialty distances at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. She just missed out on medals in each of them, coming in 4th on both the 500 and 1500 m and 6th on the 1000 m, 0.22, 0.14, and 0.22 seconds from winning a bronze medal, respectively. ===2014 Winter Olympics=== On 11 February 2014, Boer won the bronze medal in the women's 500 m longtrack speedskating event at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. This is the first medal at the Olympic women's 500 m longtrack speedskating event for the Netherlands. Two days later on 13 February 2014 Boer also won the bronze medal in the women's longtrack 1000 m event, making her the nation's first female skater to win Olympic medals on both sprint distances. ==Performance== ===Personal records=== ===Results timeline=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !| Season !!
