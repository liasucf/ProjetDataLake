    "text": "The Bethlehem Cemetery is a historic cemetery in rural Washington County, Arkansas. It is located about south of Canehill, near the junction of Arkansas Highway 45 and County Road 442. With its first documented burial in 1832, it is one of the oldest cemeteries in the county, and it is the only surviving remnant of the small frontier community of Bethlehem, which was established in 1827. The cemetery contains the remains of some of the area's earliest settlers, including the wife of preacher John Carnahan, who is believed to be the first person buried in the cemetery. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Cemeteries on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1832 Category:Protected areas of Washington County, Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures in Washington County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Washington County, Arkansas ",
