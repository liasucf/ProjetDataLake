The doctrine that > the world was created is ill-advised, and should be rejected. If God created > the world, where was He before creation? . . .How could God have made the > world without any raw material? If you say He made this first, and then the > world, you are faced with an endless regression . . . Know that the world is > uncreated, as time itself is, without beginning and end. And it is based on > the principles . . . - The Mahapurana (The Great Legend), Jinasena (India, > ninth century)\",Ct12-1 Afterword on Jinasena, D.
