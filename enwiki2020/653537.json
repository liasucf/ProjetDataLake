    "text": "Sulaymaniyah ( , as-Sulaym\u0101niyyah), also called Slemani, is a city in the east of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, not far from the Iran-Iraq border. It is surrounded by the Azmer Range, Goyija Range and the Qaiwan Range in the northeast, Baranan Mountain in the south and the Tasluja Hills in the west. The city has a semi-arid climate with very hot dry summers and cool wet winters. From its foundation Sulaymaniyah was always a center of great poets, writers, historians, politicians, scholars and singers, such as Nal\u00ee, Mahwi, and Piramerd.slimany The modern city of Sulaymaniyah was founded in 1784 by the Kurdish prince Ibrahim Pasha Baban, who named it after his father Sulaiman Pasha. Sulaymaniyah was the capital of the historic principality of Baban from 1784 to 1850. ==History== Stela of Iddi-Sin, King of Simurrum. It dates back to the Old Babylonian Period. From Qarachatan Village, Sulaymaniyah Governorate, Iraqi Kurdistan. Located in the Sulaymaniyah Museum, Iraq. The region of Sulaymaniyah was known as Zamwa prior to the foundation of the modern city in 1784. The capital of the Kurdish Baban principality (1649\u20131850), before Sulaymaniyah, was a territory named \"Qela\u00e7iwalan\". At the time of the Babani's rule there were major conflicts between the Safavid dynasty and the Ottoman Empire. Qela\u00e7iwalan became a battleground for the two rivals. Being of strategic importance and lying deep inside Safavid territory, there was concern that Qela\u00e7iwalan would be attacked and captured if the Babani did not give the Safavids military support, as both Sultan Mahmud II and Nader Shah were trying to gain the support of the dispersed Kurdish Emirates. This obliged Mahmud Pasha of Baban in 1781 to think about moving the center of its Emirate to another safer place. He chose Melkend\u00ee, then a village but now a district in central Sulaymaniyah, to construct a number of Serahs for his political and armed units. In 1783, Ibrahim Pasha Baban became ruler of the Emirate and began the construction of a new city which would become the capital of the Baban Emirate. In 1784 he finished erecting a number of palaces for trade called Qeyser\u00ees and bazaars, which were also used as baths, and began inviting people from the surrounding villages and Emirates to move to the newly established city. Soon Melkend\u00ee, which was originally intended to be the city itself, instead became one of its quarters and still is today. The new city of Sulaymaniyah was named after Sulaiman Baba, who was the first Baban prince to gain control of the province of \u015earez\u00fbr and its capital, Kirkuk. Sulaiman Baba invaded the neighboring Kurdish vassaldom of Erdalan, defeating their forces in 1694. Ottoman Sultan Mustafa II assigned him the district of Baban, which included the town of Kirkuk.G\u00e1bor \u00c1goston, Bruce Alan Masters (2009), Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire, p.70, Infobase Publishing, In the early 1800s refugees from Ardalan moved to Sulaymaniyah including Mastura Ardalan, the widow of Xosraw Xan\u00ee Erdalan, the ruler of the kingdom. Erdalan wrote an account of Kurdish history in Persian and was buried in Sulaymaniyah when he died in 1848. From 1922 to 1924, Sulaymaniyah has designated the capital of the Kingdom of Kurdistan, a short-lived unrecognized State declared by Iraqi Kurds following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.Prince, J.

Sulaymaniyah is the only city in South Kurdistan that regularly celebrates World Music Day or F\u00eate de la Musique. In one trip to the city, a journalist working for the BBC wrote about Sulaymaniyah's distinct culture: \"Culture is hugely important to the Kurdish people, especially in Sulaymaniyah, but there is a strong pull to the west\u2014modernisation and consumerism\u2014driven perhaps by the satellite televisions they have had access to since they started running their own affairs...And at the university, students mill around the campus, chattering with each other and doing some last-minute cramming for their exams. The war only stopped lectures for a few weeks. There are probably more women than men and they are happy to air their views to anyone who asks.\" == Economy == Since 2003 Iraq has seen a huge economic boom. Sulaymaniyah's economy today relies on tourism, agriculture and a number of small factories, most of which are involved in the building trade.
