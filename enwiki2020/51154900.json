    "text": "ParkJockey is an American parking revenue and access control startup that allows the real estate owners or operators to streamline parking operations using smart software and hardware technologies and data APIs. On the consumer- facing front, the company has developed a payment terminal kiosk for parking as well as a mobile application to search and pay for parking spaces. ParkJockey is the official parking partner of several organisations, including Ticketmaster, Hertz, the Miami Heat, and the parking provider at large venues including the Rose Bowl, the US Bank Stadium and the American Airlines Arena. == History and growth == ParkJockey was co-founded by two former management consultants in Chicago. Having diagnosed a number of inefficiencies in the parking industry, they lay the foundation of ParkJockey with a website for paying for off-street parking spaces. In 2013, ParkJockey raised $1.8 million in angel investment to develop a mobile app and has formally launched its services later in the year. Seeing a potential for growth in Europe, ParkJockey launched its London office in 2014 to serve all of the U.K. market. Since then, the company has undergone further investment rounds and has grown to become a B2B real estate technology platform offering landlords and parking operators hardware and software to manage and optimize parking operations, including big data services. It is headquartered in Miami, with operations across the U.S. and the U.K. On December 3, 2018, financial and technology news media reported that Softbank Group and Mubadala have recently bought stakes in ParkJockey, primarily to finance planned acquisitions of parking lot operators, with the total investment amount approximated to be between $800 million and $1 billion. ParkJockey changed their name to REEF technology in 2019. https://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/news/2019/06/26/how-this- softank-backed-startup-could-transform.html == Partnerships == Ticketmaster In January 2015, ParkJockey announced a partnership with the largest ticket sales company, Ticketmaster. The exclusive partnership is currently limited to the U.K. market. Miami Heat and American Airlines In December 2014, ParkJockey became the official parking provider for the NBA franchise, HEAT Group. For all Miami HEAT games and other events (e.g., concerts) at the American Airlines Arena, ParkJockey provides parking spaces in advance.
