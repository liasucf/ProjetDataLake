Lennie Gwyther (18 April 1922 - 1992), often referred to as \"Lennie the Legend\", was an Australian figure of significance due to his 1932 solo horseback journey, as a nine-year old boy, from Leongatha, Victoria, to Sydney, New South Wales. Accompanied by his horse, Ginger Mick, Gwyther undertook a journey to watch the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. == Personal life == Lennie Gwyther (Lennie the Legend) was born in Leongatha, on 18 April 1922 to Australian parents Captain Leo Tennyson Gwyther and Clara (Clare) Amelia Gwyther (n\u00e9e Simon). Lennie had four younger siblings, Beryl Ferrier n\u00e9e Gwyther, Noel Harry Gwyther, Keith Roy Gwyther and Leta Gardenal n\u00e9e Gwyther who was born in 1934, two years after Lennie's journey. They grew up on a farm, known as 'Flers' in the country town. When Lennie was nine, his father (The Captain), broke his leg on the Gwyther Farm and Lennie took over the responsibilities on the farm such as ploughing 24 fields. Consequently, Lennie was offered a reward, and he asked to attend the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. That was largely because of his interest with the engineering and construction of the bridge. His mother, Clara (Clare) Gwyther, was unsure of this arrangement but, due to the fulfilment of his duties, communication with those in Sydney, and the map Lennie and Captain Leo Tennyson Gwyther created, she allowed Lennie to go. On 3 February 1932, Lennie and Ginger Mick left Leongatha on the expedition to Sydney. He carried a haversack that included his toothbrush, silk pyjamas, spare clothes and a water bottle. Lennie alongside Ginger Mick before he departed. On 10 June, after his tenth birthday, Lennie Gwyther returned home and resumed with his family commitments on the Leongatha 'Flers' farm. Several years later, at the age of 19, he enlisted in the army for World War II. In that, he followed his father who fought on the Western Front in World War I and who was awarded the Military Cross and bar in 1916 and 1917, respectively. After serving in the Morotai Islands in the Pacific, Lennie commenced work as an engineer with General Motors' Holden at Fishermans Bend, Victoria and moved to Hampton, Melbourne, Victoria. Lennie Gwyther married and had a daughter, Mary Gwyther, and granddaughter, Sally Gwyther. He built a house for his mother, Clara (Clare) Gwyther. In later life, Lennie's passion for fishing and sailing was reflected in the fact that he built a yacht, with the intention of sailing to Tasmania and then to New Zealand. His granddaughter commented in 2015 that \"he had a lathe in the shed and he was always turning wood or making tools or tables. There wasn't really anything he couldn't do. I'm sure he would have attempted sailing around the world, that's how adventurous he was.\" The Adelaide Advertiser of 22 December 1951 published news of Lennie's brother, Pte. Keith Roy Gwyther, then serving in Korea. A photograph of Clare and Lennie Gwyther carried the caption: \"At her home in Leongatha (Vic.) the mother of Pte. Keith Roy Gwyther looks at his photograph ... With her is another son, Len. Pte. Gwyther was reported killed in action in Korea last April. This week the Chinese Communists named him as a POW\". Keith Gwyther was later released and returned to Australia. Lennie Gwyther died of cancer in 1992, at the age of 70. ===Ginger Mick=== On his second birthday in 1924, Lennie's grandfather, on his mother's side, Charles Simon, gifted him a two-year-old horse named Ginger Mick. Beryl Ferrier, Lennie's sister, stated \"the horse was foaled on the same day as my brother was born, and they grew up together\". Lennie Gwyther commented on Ginger Mick saying he was \"...dark chestnut just 12.2 hands high...\". He was named after his father's favourite character from C.J Dennis' book The Moods of Ginger Mick. Ginger Mick also competed and won competitions in two separate categories, school pony and ponies 12.2 and below in \"Leongatha, Foster and Yarram\". Ginger Mick would later go with Lennie on his 600 mile journey to Sydney. Eighteen years later, in 1949, Ginger Mick died and was buried on the Leongatha farm. Lennie photographed on his journey with Ginger Mick. == Significance == Lennie Gwyther became famous for his solo horseback journey to Sydney from the Victorian town of Leongatha as a nine- year-old boy. His journey was widely publicised in the media, particularly newspapers. Frequent updates regarding his whereabouts led Lennie to encounter experiences that were unprecedented on his departure. For example, outside of Parliament House in Canberra he met, shook the hand of, and had tea with Prime Minister Joseph Lyons'. Other instances include being \"...attacked by vagabonds...\" and being met with a bushfire. In Sydney, he met with Lord Mayor, Sir Samuel Walder, while also looking at Circular Quay, Bondi Beach and Taronga Zoo, where he rode an elephant. As he arrived in Martin Place, accompanied by 25 police, Gwyther was met by 10,000 cheering citizens. The Secretary of the Royal Agricultural Society, Colonel Somerville, also greeted him. He was wearing \"...khaki breeches, boots, and leggings, and a thick coat, and [was] carrying a cloth sun hat in his hand.\" Taking part in the opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge parade. On 19 March, 1932, Gwyther, with Ginger Mick, participated in the Royal Easter Show and paraded across the Sydney Harbour bridge in its opening. Following that, on 21 March, Lennie met cricketer Don Bradman at the Sydney Cricket Ground where he was gifted with a signed cricket bat. His journey home involved talking to children at Gunning Public School about his experience as well as celebrating his tenth birthday with shire councillors, being given one Australian pound. As he passed through Urana, he attended a children's ball as well as a reception organised by the local shire president. He also spent a couple of days in Widgiewa with councillor Otway McLaurin Falkiner. Upon his arrival back to Leongatha, Lennie was met by 800 citizens. He also delivered a return letter from Sydney's Lord Mayor to the president of the Woorayl Shire Council.

Peter Watchorn, a spokesperson for the Leongatha Chamber of Commerce, noted that media company Village Roadshow was interested in the books about Lennie, leading to speculation about a film.

Bob Newton, assisted by a committee, applied for a Federal Government community grant and, through the Leongatha Chamber of Commerce and Industry, established a fund-raising division, because the quotes for the statue, and the other associated items such as a plaque, totalled $60,000. Local residents Glenn Wright and his wife Shirley-Ann, started the fund-raising campaign with a $1,000 donation. Almost three years later, on 14 October 2017, a bronze statue of Lennie Gwyther riding Ginger Mick was unveiled in Leongatha by the Gwyther family. In attendance were his siblings Beryl Ferrier, Leta Gardenal and Keith Roy, his daughter and granddaughter Mary and Sally, his niece Julie Campbell, and sister-in-law Shirley Gwyther. Peter Watchorn noted that the importance of the statue was that Lennie's achievement had been somewhat forgotten, and it should be commemorated within the community as it . The plaque alongside the statue, made by C&L; Stainless, reads: The statue is located next to a public rest stop at 8 Anderson Street, Leongatha. == References == Category:1922 births Category:1992 deaths Category:Australian folklore ",
