He began playing basketball at age 10 in the youth sections of F.C. Barreirense after following his older sister to a tryout in Barreiro. In the 2017\u201318 season, Queta played two games for S.L. Benfica in the Liga Portuguesa de Basquetebol. On 31 August 2018, he officially parted ways with Benfica. == College career == On 29 August 2018, Queta signed to play college basketball for the Utah State Aggies, despite gaining interest from Texas Tech and Creighton. Head coach Craig Smith called him a \"very talented player and a fantastic person.\" Queta made an immediate impact for the Aggies, prompting the Deseret News to label him \"arguably the best rim protector the Utah State basketball program has ever had.\" On 19 November 2018, he recorded a game-high 24 points, 9 rebounds, and 5 blocks in an 80\u201363 win over Saint Mary's at the MGM Resorts Main Event. Queta posted 11 points and a season-best 19 rebounds on 1 December versus UC Irvine. At the conclusion of the season, Queta was named Mountain West Freshman of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year. He averaged 11.8 points and 8.9 rebounds as a freshman. Queta missed the first nine games of his sophomore season with a knee injury, but returned on 7 December 2019 against Fresno State. At the conclusion of the regular season, Queta was named to the Second Team All- Mountain West as well as conference Defensive Team. == National team career == Queta joined the Portuguese national under-18 team at the 2017 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship Division B. Through eight games, he averaged 10.2 points, 8.6 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks per game. His success at the 2018 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship Division B in Sofia, in which he averaged 14.1 points, 10.3 rebounds, and 2.9 blocks per game, drew attention from National Basketball Association (NBA) teams. Queta led Portugal to a gold medal at the 2019 FIBA U20 European Championship Division B in Matosinhos, Portugal, averaging 14.3 points, 11.0 rebounds, and two blocks per game and making the tournament All-Star Five.
