It takes place in July of each year, at Llanelwedd, near Builth Wells, in Powys, Mid Wales. The first show was held in Aberystwyth in 1904, and its success led to the development of the permanent showground at Llanelwedd, first used in 1963. No show was held in 1915\u201318, 1940\u201345 nor 2020. The latter year saw some events going virtual. == Format == The show lasts for four days and attracts more than 200,000 visitors annually, boosting tourism in Wales.

The Wales Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs runs a series of competitions throughout Wales throughout the year, and the finals of the practical competitions usually take place at the Show. Amongst these events are stock judging and tractor driving. ==Welsh Cob Senior Stallions class== The Welsh Cob Senior Stallion class is traditionally held on the Wednesday afternoon of the show (\"Welsh Cob Wednesday\").
