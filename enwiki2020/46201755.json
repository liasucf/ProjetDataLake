It is the smallest karst field in Inner Carniola. ==Geography== The Lo\u017e Karst Field lies between the Bloke Plateau to the north, Mount Race (, ) to the east, and Mount Sne\u017enik to the west. It is about long and wide, and lies on Triassic dolomite oriented in the Dinaric direction. Little Obrh Spring () lies on the south edge of the karst field in Kozari\u0161\u010de near Sne\u017enik Castle and is fed by water from Mount Sne\u017enik. Big Obrh Spring () lies on the east side of the karst field, near Vrhnika pri Lo\u017eu, and is fed by water from Mount Race and the Potok Plateau in the Lo\u0161ki Potok area. The streams from the two springs join west of PudobKomac, Bla\u017e, Karel Natek, & Matija Zorn. 2008. Geografski vidiki poplav v Sloveniji (= Geografija Slovenije 20).

Flooding affects only the western part of the karst field, below Dane, which is uninhabited. In the past, more of the karst field used to flood, and so at the end of the 19th century a lower entrance was cut into the cave, which reduced the depth and duration of flooding. ==Settlements== The settlements in the Lo\u017e Karst Field are relatively large and have a clustered or linear layout. Stari Trg pri Lo\u017eu is the economic and cultural center of the area. ==Economic activity== The karst field ranges between and in elevation and is surrounded by steep wooded slopes. The flat areas are used for tilled fields, and lower parts near the creeks for meadows. There are also meadows and pastures along the edges of the gentler slopes, especially on the sunny sides, where animal husbandry is practiced. The wood and metal industry has developed in Stari Trg pri Lo\u017eu. == References == ==External links== *Lo\u017e Karst Field on Geopedia Category:Municipality of Lo\u0161ka Dolina Category:Karst fields of Slovenia ",
