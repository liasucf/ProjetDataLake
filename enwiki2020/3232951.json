    "text": "\"Jesus to a Child\" is a song by British singer George Michael. It was the first of six singles from the album Older. The song peaked at number one in Australia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom; it was Michael's sixth UK number one, and his third as a solo performer. It also reached the top three on several other European charts, and became Michael's highest debut on the US Billboard Hot 100. It is one of Michael's best-known songs and was included on the 1996 album Older. It is a melancholy tribute to his lover Anselmo Feleppa. After Michael's death in 2016, Dame Esther Rantzen, founder of the charity ChildLine, revealed that Michael had secretly donated all of the single's royalties to the charity. She said \"George helped us to reach out to hundreds of thousands of children through his generosity. I met him a couple of times, he approached us, rather than us going cap in hand to him, but it was an intensely personal gift. He didn\u2019t want it to be known or to be part of his image.\" She told BBC News that \"he really wanted to keep his help secret, it was an intensely personal gift. It meant we could answer more children.\" ==Background== Although it was not officially released until January 1996, Michael unveiled the song in November 1994 during the inaugural MTV Europe Music Awards, where he performed it live in front of Berlin's Brandenburg Gate. The song was Michael's first self-penned hit in his homeland for almost four years, where it also became his first solo single to enter the UK chart at number one. In addition it was his first solo number one on an album since the Faith album released in 1987, and during the Wham! years. At almost seven minutes, it was also Michael's longest UK top 40 single. On the United States' Billboard Hot 100 it became the highest new entry, at number 7, by a British artist for more than 25 years. ==Content== The song was a melancholy tribute to Michael's Brazilian lover Anselmo Feleppa, whom he met when performing in Rio de Janeiro in 1991. Feleppa died two years later from an AIDS-related brain haemorrhage. Michael had been unable to write for the next 18 months as a consequence of his grief, but then penned the words to \"Jesus to a Child\" in little more than an hour, indicating that the time was right to move on with his life. The song is written with a rhythm and harmony that is influenced by the Brazilian bossa nova style. The exact identity of the song's subject\u2014and the nature of their relationship\u2014was cause for a certain amount of innuendo at the time, as Michael had not confirmed his homosexuality and did not do so until 1998. Until his death on Christmas Day 2016, Michael would consistently dedicate the song to Feleppa before performing it live. ==Critical reception== George Michael in the music video of \"Jesus to a Child\". Larry Flick from Billboard described the song as a \"gorgeous, quietly insinuating pop ballad.\" He noted that \"the words are, by turns, melancholic and romantic and are delivered with delicate ease\", adding that \"musically, Michael layers light, shuffling percussion with mild acoustic guitar lines and sweetly understated strings.\" Sarah Davis from Dotmusic wrote that \"in the context of the album, Jesus to a Child sets the scene for Michael's current direction - brooding, mature, reflective but not so downbeat as to disallow the good times.\" Tom Ewing from Freaky Trigger said that the song is \"his monument, a work Michael needs his public to hear. Even though few at the time knew the story behind it, the sincerity, and the will to somehow pass on something extraordinary and vanished, is palpable. It's a heartfelt celebration of the effect love can have on a life, and it's a songwriter consciously setting himself his hardest possible task, and achieving it.\" Hans-Petter Kj\u00f8ge from Norwegian newspaper Fredrikstad Blad said that it is a \"beautiful, simple with at the same time a sophisticated melody.\" He complimented Michael's \"great voice\" on the song. Swedish newspaper G\u00f6teborgsposten added that on the \"cozy\" song, Michael \"showed that he still mastered the craft.\"G\u00f6teborgsposten. 10 May 1996. Jan DeKnock from Knight Ridder called it a \"mesmerizing ballad\" and a \"stunning effort\". People described it as \"a long-winded bossa nova synth-pop concoction\" in their review of Older. Eric Henderson from Slant Magazine wrote: Michael E. Ross from Salon Magazine picked the song as one of the best on the Older album, adding it as \"almost painfully thoughtful. In lush, silken musical settings, Michael speaks the world-weary language of scorned love.\" Dave Fawbert from ShortList said that it is \"one of the most beautiful songs ever written\". Ed Morales for Vibe noted that \"the Sade-style synth chords that rule \"Jesus to a Child\" bolster Michael's typically breathy but precise musings. \"There's a sadness in my eyes\", he croons, and you can feel it.\" ==Music video== The music video for \"Jesus to a Child\" was directed by British director Howard Greenhalgh. ==Track listings== UK CD 1 (VSCDT 1571) #\"Jesus to a Child\" \u2013 6:50 #\"One More Try\" (live gospel version at Concert of Hope '93) \u2013 5:21 #\"Older\" (instrumental version) \u2013 5:18 UK CD 2 (VSCDX 1571) #\"Jesus to a Child\" \u2013 6:50 #\"Freedom '94\" (live version at MTV Europe Music Awards) \u2013 6:04 #\"One More Try\" (live gospel version at Concert of Hope '93) \u2013 5:21 #\"Older\" (instrumental version) \u2013 5:18 Cassette single #\"Jesus to a Child\" \u2013 6:50 #\"One More Try\" (live gospel version at Concert of Hope '93) \u2013 5:21 #\"Older\" (instrumental version) \u2013 5:18 ==Charts and certifications== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" !Chart (1996) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Czech Republic (IFPI CR) |8 |- !scope=\"row\"|Denmark (IFPI) |4 |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |2 |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Hungary (Mahasz) |1 |- !scope=\"row\"|Iceland (\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40) |14 |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Italy (Musica e dischi) |2 |- !scope=\"row\"|Japan (Oricon) |62 |- |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Spain (AFYVE) |1 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !Chart (1996) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA) |90 |- !scope=\"row\"|Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders) |49 |- !scope=\"row\"|Belgium (Ultratop 50 Wallonia) |12 |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada Top Singles (RPM) |71 |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada Adult Contemporary (RPM) |10 |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |11 |- !scope=\"row\"|France (SNEP) |58 |- !scope=\"row\"|Germany (Official German Charts) |89 |- !scope=\"row\"|Iceland (\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40) |98 |- !scope=\"row\"|Italy (FIMI) |8 |- !scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) |87 |- !scope=\"row\"|Netherlands (Single Top 100) |60 |- !scope=\"row\"|Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) |51 |- !scope=\"row\"|Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade) |27 |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |38 |} ===Certifications=== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1996 singles Category:George Michael songs Category:Songs written by George Michael Category:Number-one singles in Australia Category:RPM Adult Contemporary number-one singles Category:Number-one singles in Finland Category:Number-one singles in Hungary Category:Irish Singles Chart number-one singles Category:Number-one singles in Norway Category:Number-one singles in Scotland Category:Number-one singles in Spain Category:UK Singles Chart number-one singles Category:LGBT-related songs Category:Songs in memory of deceased persons Category:Songs about Jesus Category:Pop ballads Category:Music videos directed by Marcus Nispel Category:Music videos directed by Howard Greenhalgh Category:1996 songs ",
