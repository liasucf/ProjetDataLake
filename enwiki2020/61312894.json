    "text": "Michael Metcalf (1586 \u2013 27 December 1664) was an early English colonist in Massachusetts, who had been persecuted for his Puritan beliefs in his native England. Metcalf was from Norwich, England and worked as a master weaver. He was persecuted by the Church of England for his Puritan beliefs and, upon fleeing to Massachusetts, wrote a long letter addressed to \"all true professors of Christ's gospel\" in Norwich. He spoke of the \"great trouble\" he had with the \"Arch-Deacon's and Bishop's court at the hands of my enemies concerning the matter of bowing as well as for other matters of like consequence.\" Before the ecclesiastical court, Metcalf defended himself by quoting not only the Bible but also the church's own theologians. He related in his letter that their responses included \"Blockhead, old heretic, the devil made you, I will send you to the devil.\" When his life was put in danger, his wife sometimes hid him in the thatched roof of their house. Metcalf was one of the first residents of Dedham, Massachusetts and a signer of the Covenant. In 1641, he served as Selectman. At the age of 70 he began teaching reading in the Dedham Public Schools, the first system of its kind in the country. In 1652, Metcalf purchased a joined armchair that is today the oldest dated piece of American furniture. His descendant, Father Theodore Metcalf of the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston, served as Master of Ceremonies at the laying of the cornerstone ceremony at St. Mary's Church in Dedham in 1880, 244 years after Metcalf arrived in Dedham. ==References== ==Works cited== * * Category:Educators from Dedham, Massachusetts Category:Puritans Category:People from Norwich Category:Kingdom of England emigrants to Massachusetts Bay Colony Category:1586 births Category:1664 deaths Category:Dedham, Massachusetts selectmen Category:Signers of the Dedham Covenant Category:People from colonial Dedham, Massachusetts ",
