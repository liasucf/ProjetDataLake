    "text": "The Colony Hotel & Caba\u00f1a Club, in Delray Beach, Florida, is a Spanish Colonial Revival-style hotel dating from 1926, plus a separate beach-side recreation area with pool and caba\u00f1as. The hotel features Florida Mediterranean architecture in a three-story building with two domed towers. It has been described as \"the best known landmark\" in Delray Beach. The hotel, initially known as the Alterep Hotel, was built in 1925 by a group of investors led by Albert T. Repp (for whom the hotel was named). The cost was estimated at $250,000 and another $100,000 for furnishings. It opened in approximately January 1926. After the hotel struggled and went into receivership, it was purchased for $50,000 in 1935 by George Boughton. He renamed it the Colony and owned it until his death in 1986.https://www.newspapers.com/clip/50590459/obituary-for-george-madden- boughton/ While under Boughton's ownership, the Colony was open only seasonally from January to April. Boughton owned another hotel in Maine that he operated during the remaining months of the year. The property includes the Colony Hotel, at 525 East Atlantic Avenue, and the Colony Caba\u00f1a Club, at 1801 South Ocean Boulevard. The hotel is in the center of the city, and the caba\u00f1a club is on the ocean, to the east and south from the hotel.Google maps ==References== ==External links== * *Colony Hotel and Caba\u00f1a Club, official site Category:Hotels in Florida Category:Delray Beach, Florida ",
