    "text": "The 1985\u201386 USAC Gold Crown Championship season consisted of one race, the 70th Indianapolis 500 on May 31, 1986. The USAC National Champion and Indianapolis 500 winner was Bobby Rahal. The schedule was based on a split- calendar, beginning in June 1985 and running through May 1986. Since USAC had dropped out of sanctioning Indy car races outside the Indy 500, the Gold Crown Championship consisted of only one event. The preeminent national championship season was instead sanctioned by CART. ==Schedule and results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%\" ! Rnd ! Date ! Race Name ! Length ! Track !
