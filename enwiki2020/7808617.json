    "text": "Terminaator () is an Estonian rock group formed in 1987 by Arno Veimer and Jaagup Kreem in Tallinn 10. High School (today known as N\u00f5mme Gymnasium). Kreem was in the 7th grade then. The first public performance was in Tallinn 47. High School in the schoolbands' festival. The first time in the studio was in 1989. First songs \"Charleen\" and \"Meeletu maailm\" were recorded in 1991. They found wider fame in 1992, when they won the festival of young bands Rock In. They have also performed in Latvia, Lithuania and Finland, although they have not had much success outside of Estonia. On the Estonian television show \"7 vaprat\", Terminaator have appeared playing their songs \"Ainult sina v\u00f5id mu maailma muuta\", \"Juulikuu lumi\", \"See ei ole saladus\", and \"Portselanist t\u00fcdruk\". ==2005\u20132008== 2005 saw the release of the band's first live album, Go Live 2005, which was followed in 2006 by Terminaator's 7th studio album Nagu esimene kord. In the same year, Terminaator participated in a musical rendition of Romeo & Julia, which was accompanied by a soundtrack. In 2007, a traditional anniversary best-of album was released, titled 20, which included two new versions of older songs, two new songs and unreleased live recordings among others. Also, the first proper video was made for \"Juulikuu lumi 2007\". The second single released was \"\u00c4ra oota koidikuni\". In 2008, two non-album singles, \"Oh kuidas sust puudust tunneme\" and \"Pilves selgimistega\", were released. This is the first time that the band had released songs not featured on any albums (however, it is yet uncertain, if they will be included to the next studio album, due in 2010). In November 2008, Terminaator did three acoustic concerts, of which one will see a release on CD and DVD in 2009. ==2009\u2013== On 13 March 2009, Elmar Liitmaa and Harmo Kallaste announced their departure from the band. The reasons given were lack of time and new challenges. Since then, negotiations are being held with the former guitarist of Brides in Bloom, Taavi Langi. According to the band's website, recording of new material started in the end of March and the first single from the upcoming studio album was to be released in April. The new single, \"Just reedeti\", debuted on Raadio 2 on 14 May, featuring Taavi Langi on guitar. The new album, Rakett (Rocket), was released on 13 April 2011. == Members == * Jaagup Kreem \u2013 vocals, guitar * Henno Kelp \u2013 bass guitar (since 2003) * Roland Puusepp \u2013 drums (since 2003) * Taavi Langi \u2013 guitar (since 2009) === Former members === * Margus Paalamaa (1987\u20131988) \u2013 bass * Tiit Must (1987\u20131989) \u2013 drums * Arno \"Arch\" Veimer (1987\u20131995) \u2013 guitar * Andres Toome (1989\u20131992) \u2013 bass * Sulev \"Sulliwan\" M\u00fc\u00fcrsepp (1990\u20131992; 1996\u20131998) \u2013 guitar * Raimond \"My\" Vather (1990\u20131991) \u2013 drums * Andres Oja (1991) \u2013 drums * Eimel Kaljulaid (1991\u20132003) \u2013 drums * Indrek Timmer (1992\u20131995) \u2013 bass * Sven Valdmann (1995\u20132003) \u2013 bass * Margus Valk (1997\u20131998) \u2013 guitar * Elmar Liitmaa (1992\u20131996; 1999\u20132009) \u2013 electric guitar, backing vocals * Harmo Kallaste (1996; 2000\u20132009) \u2013 keyboards, backing vocals ==== Only on concerts ==== * Antz (1991) \u2013 drums * T\u00f5nu V\u00e4\u00e4rtn\u00f5u (1998) \u2013 keyboards * J\u00fcri Roosa (2000) \u2013 bass * Raul Vaigla (2003) \u2013 bass == Awards == * Golden Disc \u2013 1998, 2 awards; best band of the year and album of the year * Music awards \u2013 2001, audience's favourite; 2003, Stiina's favourite * Raadio 2\u20131995 & 2002, the first Estonian band to win the first place 2 times in the end of the year chart == Discography == * 1994: L\u00f5putu p\u00e4ev * 1995: Minu v\u00e4ike paradiis * 1997: P\u00fchertoonia * 1997: Kuld * 1998: Singapur * 2000: Head uudised * 2001: Risk * 2003: Kuut\u00f5bine * 2005: Go Live 2005 * 2006: Nagu esimene kord * 2006: Romeo & Julia (not released under the name of Terminaator) * 2007: 20 * 2009: Ingli puudutus * 2011: Rakett * 2014: Vaikuse meri ==References== == External links == *Official site * *Terminaator at Estmusic.com Category:Estonian rock music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1987 Category:1987 establishments in Estonia ",
