Yurco, Was Amenmesse the Viceroy of Kush, Messuwy?, Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt, Vol. 34 (1997), pp. 49-56, Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/40000798, Accessed: 22-04-2017 ==Viceroy of Kush== Messuy was appointed Viceroy of Kush in year 5 of Merneptah and followed Khaemtir in office. Messuy added many inscription to temples and sites in Nubia, including Amada, Aksha, Amara, Temple of Beit el- Wali, Wadi es-Sebua, and Bigeh Island. ==Identification of Messuy with Pharaoh Amenmesse== Rolf Krauss was the first to suggest that Messuy was to be identified with Amenmesse. Kraus conjectured that Messuy had taken power in Southern Egypt after a short reign of Seti-Merneptah, the son and heir of Merneptah.Rolf Krauss, \"Untersuchungen zu Konig Amenmesse,\" 1. teil, Studien zur Altdgyptischen Kultur 4 (1976), 161-99; idem, \"Untersuchungen zu Konig Amenmesse,\" 2. teil, SAKb (1977), 131-74. (reference from Yurco's 1977 article) One argument in favor of Viceroy Messuy taking on a royal role is an addition of a Uraeus to the brow of Messuy's depictions in the Temple of Amada. Aidan Dodson, Messuy, Amada, and Amenmesse. Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt, Vol. 34 (1997), pp. 41-48, Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/40000797 Accessed: 22-04-2017 Dodson for instance is a proponent of this theory, but it has not been generally accepted. Dodson, Poisoned Legacy: The Fall of the Nineteenth Egyptian Dynasty, American University in Cairo Press, 2010 Others such as Yurco suggest there is no uraeus, but merely weathering of the stone that gives a false impression of one. ==Death and Burial== Messuy may have been buried at Aniba. This tomb was excavated and published by Georg Steindorff.Georg Steindorff, Aniba, 3 vols. Mission Archeologique de Nubie 1929-1934 (Gluckstadt: J. J. Augustin, 1935-37), vol. 1, p. 79, tomb S90, p. 198, tomb S90, vol. 2, p. 58, SA36, plate 34, no. 6 door post with text of Messuwy.
