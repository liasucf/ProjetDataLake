Wichita Northeast Magnet High School was the first magnet high school in Kansas. The magnet areas at Northeast include visual arts, science, and law. Students are also exposed to mathematics and language arts. Since it is a magnet school, there is no district boundary placed by the school district, meaning any high school age student within the Wichita city limits, can attend the school without requiring a special transfer, they still, however, are required to apply for the school, then students are selected at random to attend. ==History== In 1988, the district administration surveyed all eighth through eleventh grade students in the district to determine what special or choice high school programs would be most attractive. The responses indicated a very strong interest in science/technology as well as the visual arts. Wichita Northeast Magnet High School opened in 1990 as a secondary school of choice in the Community Education Center, originally called Mathewson Intermediate School. The Community Education Center site was chosen because of its proximity to Wichita State University. The colleges of Engineering and Fine Arts helped in the development of the program. Necessary remodeling was done and the Northeast Magnet High School began in August 1990 with the magnet choices of science/technology and visual art.A History of Wichita Public School Buildings; USD 259. In 1996, Northeast Magnet merged with the Downtown Law Magnet program, and in 1998, the law program moved from City Hall to its current location. In the early 2000s the school was updated through the passed bond issue. Renovations included, but were not limited to, the cafeteria and science classrooms. In 2008, a bond issue was approved to build 5 new schools in USD 259, which included a new high school.Bond Issue 2008 - 5 New Schools; Wichita Public Schools.
