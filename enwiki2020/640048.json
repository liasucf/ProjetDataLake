The work involved Abramovi\u0107 standing still while the audience was invited to do to her whatever they wished, using one of 72 objects she had placed on a table. These included a rose, feather, perfume, honey, bread, grapes, wine, scissors, a scalpel, nails, a metal bar, and a gun loaded with one bullet.\"Marina Abramovi\u0107 on Rhythm 0 (1974)\", Marina Abramovi\u0107 Institute, 2014, c. 01:00 mins.\"Marina Abramovi\u0107. Rhythm 0. 1974\", Museum of Modern Art. There were no separate stages. Abramovi\u0107 and the visitors stood in the same space, making it clear that the latter were part of the work.Frazer Ward, No Innocent Bystanders: Performance Art and Audience, University Press of New England, 2012, p. 125. The purpose of the piece, she said, was to find out how far the public would go: \"What is the public about and what are they going to do in this kind of situation?\"Abramovi\u0107 2014, c. 00:00 mins. ==Performance== Her instructions were placed on the table: > Instructions. > There are 72 objects on the table that one can use on me as desired. > Performance. > I am the object. > During this period I take full responsibility. > Duration: 6 hours (8 pm \u2013 2 am).Ward 2012, p. 119. Abramovi\u0107 said the work \"pushed her body to the limits\". Visitors were gentle to begin with, offering her a rose or a kiss. Art critic Thomas McEvilley, who was present, wrote: > It began tamely. Someone turned her around. Someone thrust her arms into the > air. Someone touched her somewhat intimately. The Neapolitan night began to > heat up. In the third hour all her clothes were cut from her with razor > blades. In the fourth hour the same blades began to explore her skin.

When a loaded gun was thrust to > Marina's head and her own finger was being worked around the trigger, a > fight broke out between the audience factions.\"Ward 2012, p. 120. As Abramovi\u0107 described it later: \"What I learned was that ... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you ... I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation.\"Daneri, 29; and 30 When the gallery announced the work was over, and Abramovi\u0107 began to move again, she said the audience left, unable to face her as a person.Abramovi\u0107 2014, c. 01:45 mins. ==Reception== Rhythm 0 ranked ninth on a Complex list of the greatest works of performance art ever done. ==External links== Marina Abramovic on performing Rhythm 0 (1974) ==See also== *Endurance art *The Death of The Artist *Empathy and Prostitution ==References== Category:Performances Category:1974 in art ",
