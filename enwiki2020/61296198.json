    "text": "Reginaldo Manzotti (25 April 1969) is a Catholic priest and Brazilian singer, also known as \"The Father who gathers crowds\", is a native of Para\u00edso do Norte, in the interior of Parana. He was ordained a priest at the age of 25 and is currently parish priest of the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe, in Curitiba \u2013 PR. He coordinates the Evangelizar \u00e9 Preciso association, with thousands of members across the country. For his gift of taking the divine word through music and the media, Father Reginaldo is requested by archdioceses and communities throughout Brazil to participate in evangelization movements, including non-Catholic movements; it is important to highlight that in all its events there is no cost to participate; the priest asks only for the collaboration of all to bring 1 kg of non-perishable food to give to the needy. In October 2011, in the IV Evangelize of Fortaleza, over one million four hundred thousand faithful were present. His official website receives almost one million hits per month. ==Biography== Father Reginaldo was born in Para\u00edso do Norte, in the northwestern municipality of the state of Paran\u00e1, the youngest of the six children of Perc\u00edlia Maria and Ant\u00f4nio Manzotti, through whom he descends from Italians. Manzotti studied in his native city until he was eleven years old, when he joined the Carmelite Seminary of the Immaculate Conception of Graciosa, in Paranava\u00ed. He graduated from San Jos\u00e9 Seminary in the same city. Later, in Curitiba, he studied Philosophy at the Vincentian Institute of Philosophy (later recognized by the University of S\u00e3o Paulo) and completed his baccalaureate in Theology by Studium Theologicum (recognizing this course by the Pontifical Lateran University of Rome). Soon after, he left for a year-long experience in the municipality of Camocim de S\u00e3o F\u00e9lix, in the State of Pernambuco. He received the presbyterate in his native city, on 14 January 1995, by the hands of Bishop Alberto F\u00f6rst, O.Carm., Bishop of Dourados.. In 1999, he sought Archbishop Pedro Ant\u00f4nio Fedalto to accept him in the Archdiocese of Curitiba. Dom Pedro resisted, at first, but yielded, with the endorsement of the Order of the Carmelites, and on 3 January 1999, he appointed him parish priest of St. Joseph of Vila Antonieta in Pinhais. After the three years of experience required by the Code of Canon Law and with the favorable opinion of the Presbyteral Council, Manzotti was lodged in the archdiocese on 19 March 2002, continuing in the same parish. In 2003, he founded the association Evangelizar \u00e9 Preciso, an evangelization movement. On 26 September 2005, Father Reginaldo Manzotti, at the invitation of the Colm\u00e9ia de Maring\u00e1 radio station in Paran\u00e1, began to broadcast his \"Experience of God\" program by the Archdiocese of Maring\u00e1. From 2005, with the partnership of R\u00e1dio Colm\u00e9ia, the retransmission began with other partner radios, called \"sister radios\" that today goes beyond the 1500 stations. On 5 February 2005, Archbishop Moacyr Jos\u00e9 Vitti transferred him to the Immaculate Conception Parish of Guabirotuba, where he was able to better develop his work as a communicator. Thanks to the generosity of Father Paulo Iubel, who proposed the exchange with his parish, Bishop Moacyr transferred Manzotti to the Parish of Our Lady of Guadalupe on 8 January 2006. Today Father Reginaldo is the director of Radio Evangelizar, in which he himself presents a program of evangelization. He is also the director and coordinator of TV Evangelizar. His studio album Sinais do Sagrado reached sixth place in the TOP 20 ABPD. And the DVD \"Creio no Deus do Imposs\u00edvel\" was certified with Double Platinum Disc by ABPD, due to the more than 100 thousand copies sold in the country. Born in Para\u00edso do Norte (PR), Father Reginaldo Manzotti, known as the \"Father who gathers crowds\", is the coordinator of the Evangelizar \u00e9 Preciso Association, a work of evangelization that has thousands of associates throughout Brazil. He is pastor of the Nossa Senhora de Guadalupe Church in Curitiba (PR) and daily shows TV and radio programs that are broadcast to various stations in the country. Father Reginaldo is the author of books such as \"10 Responses That Will Change Your Life,\" \"20 Steps to Inner Peace,\" and \"Mother of All, Mary.\"Paz Interior\" e \"M\u00e3e de Todos, Maria\". In 2011, he launched \"Uma Ora\u00e7\u00e3o Por Dia\" and the following year \"Minha Primeira B\u00edblia\", adapted by him to the children. He also published the book \"Feridas da Alma\" with the aim of launching, through prayers and guidance, a little Divine Light on the shadows of human fragility. In 2013, he released the CD \"Fa\u00e7a Me Crer\", which has special guest appearances, including names like Luan Santana and Neguinho da Beija-Flor. Also in the same year he was nominated with the CD Paz e Luz for the Latin Grammy in the category of Best Portuguese Christian Album. His last studio album released, T\u00e1 Na M\u00e3o de Deus, was awarded on 20 April 2018. In 2018, Father Reginaldo Manzotti in partnership with the pair Simone and Simaria, released the single Espalhar Amor.
