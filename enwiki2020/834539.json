    "text": "Kanishka II (Brahmi: 12px10px12px K\u0101-\u1e47i-\u1e63ka) was one of the emperors of the Kushan Empire from around 225\u2013245 CE. He succeeded Vasudeva I who is considered to be the last great Kushan emperor. ==Rule== While he upheld Kushan rule in northern India, it is likely that Kanishka II lost the western part of his empire, namely Bactria/Tokharistan to the Sasanian Shapur I (240-272 CE), whose conquests would be consolidated by the Kushano-Sassanians. In his inscriptions at Naqsh-e Rostam Shapur now claimed that he controlled the realm of the Kushans (K\u016b\u0161\u0101n \u0161ahr) \u201cup to Purushapura\u201d (Peshawar), suggesting that he may have expanding even beyond the Hindu-Kush at the expense of the Kushans. The rock inscription at Rag-i-Bibi further support this view. Several overstrikes by the Kushano-Sasanian Peroz I Kushanshah over coins of Kanishka II are known, and it is from the time of Peroz that the first Kushano-Sasanian coins were issued south of the Hindu-Kush. Kanishka II may have retaken control of Gandhara at one point, as well as Kapi\u015ba, and there are suggestions that following these successes he may have created a second Era of Kanishka in celebration of the hundredth anniversary of the original one. ==Coinage and dated statuary== Image:Coin of KanishkaII.jpg|Coin of Kanishka II with lord shiva .
