The Tenancy Act intended to safeguard tenants from eviction and to fix fair rents, while the Land Purchase Act allowed the government to purchase large swathes of land owned by non-agriculturalists to be resold on a tenancy basis to genuine farmers. In 1938, the Legislature passed into law the progressive University Act. ==References== Category:Legislatures of Myanmar Category:History of Myanmar Category:Organizations established in 1936 Category:Imperial Legislative Council of India Category:Defunct bicameral legislatures Category:1936 establishments in Asia Category:Organizations disestablished in 1947 Category:1947 disestablishments in Asia ",
