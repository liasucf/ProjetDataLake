    "text": "Conaing Begeclach was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, joint High King of Ireland with his brother or half-brother Eochu F\u00edadmuine. They took power after killing the previous High King, Eochu Uairches. Conaing ruled the northern half of Ireland, Eochu the south. Their parentage is unclear. The Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn reports two possibilities: that he and Eochu were the sons of Congal, son of Lugaid Cal of the Corcu Laigde of County Cork; or that Eochu was the son of Congal, and Conaing was the son of Dui Temrach, son of Muiredach Bolgrach, but both had the same mother, who was also the mother of Eochu Uairches.R. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, p. 255-259 Geoffrey Keating makes them both sons of Dui Temrach,Geoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn 1.27 and the Four Masters make them the sons of Dui's son Congal Coscarach.Annals of the Four Masters M4356-4388 After five years of joint rule, Eochu was killed by Eochu Uairches' son Lugaid L\u00e1mderg. According to the Lebor Gab\u00e1la, Conaing remained in power in the north, while Lugaid took the south. The Annals of the Four Masters say Lugaid ousted Conaing and took complete control of Ireland. Seven years later, Conaing killed Lugaid and became sole ruler for a further ten (or twenty) years, after which he was killed by Lugaid's son Art. The Lebor Gab\u00e1la synchronises Conaing's career with the reigns of Artaxerxes I (465\u2013424 BC) and Darius II (423\u2013404) of Persia. The chronology of Keating's Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn dates his career to 621\u2013599 BC, that of the Annals of the Four Masters to 844\u2013812 BC. However, in the saga Do suidigud tellaich Temra (\"the settling of the manor of Tara\"), the crucifixion of Christ takes place during his reign.R. I.
