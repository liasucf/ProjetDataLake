In addition, one congregation near the state's western border is in the Rocky Mountain District, and another in Lincoln is in the non-geographic English District. The Nebraska District includes approximately 249 congregations and missions, subdivided into 22 circuits, as well as 37 preschools, 39 elementary schools, 4 high schools, and 1 summer camp. Baptized membership in district congregations is approximately 108,000;http://lcms.org/page.aspx?pid=456&reid;=DtH6SUNaYUoFD73TWui4%2fA%3d%3d&bbsys;=0&bbrt;=0 with the total population of the district's area (Nebraska, excepting its 11 western counties) standing at 1,674,000 as of 2005, the district's membership represents 6.5% of the local population - the highest of any of the LCMS' 33 geographical districts. The Nebraska District was formed in September 1970 when the Northern Nebraska and Southern Nebraska Districts merged; a portion of the Northern Nebraska District was simultaneously separated to create the Wyoming District. An earlier Nebraska District had existed from 1882 to 1922, before dividing until the 1970 reorganization. District offices are located in Seward, Nebraska. Delegates from each congregation meet in convention every three years to elect the district president, vice presidents, circuit counselors, a board of directors, and other officers. The Rev. Russell Sommerfeld has been the district president since 2003, having been re-elected to a third term 2009. The last convention was held June 4\u20136, 2009 at Concordia University Nebraska under the theme \"Full of Grace -- Seasoned with Salt\". The next will be held on June 8\u20139, 2012 at Concordia University Nebraska under the theme \"The Good Life\" (Gal 6:9-10).http://www.ndlcms.org/news/convention/index.html Concordia University Nebraska, part of the LCMS Concordia University System, is located within the district. ==Presidents== *Rev.
