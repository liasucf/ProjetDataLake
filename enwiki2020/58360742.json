    "text": "The Hausj\u00e4rvi Gravel Pit Murders were a series of two or more crimes during the 1990s that were connected to gravel pits around Hausj\u00e4rvi municipality in north of Helsinki urban area in Finland. According to the National Bureau of Investigation, the three different events were the doing of a one-person, who has been called the J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 Serial Killer. == The crimes == === Abduction of Helena Meril\u00e4inen === In November 1990, 39-year-old Helena \"Hellu\" Meril\u00e4inen was spending her evening at J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4. She left her friend at midnight and was about to travel home to Riihim\u00e4ki. She walked to the train station and left waiting for the train on the pier, when she was soon followed by a dark-haired man dressed in a leather jacket. The man asked about her travel plans, and she told him that she was expecting to catch a train to Riihim\u00e4ki. The man offered Meril\u00e4inen a ride home, and because she was under the influence of alcohol, she agreed. He then walked her to his car, which Meril\u00e4inen later stated in the interrogations was a light-coloured passenger car, not a station wagon, probably an elder Mazda or Datsun.YLE - Kadonneet: Perjantai 13. p\u00e4iv\u00e4 At the start of the trip, the man offered alcoholic beverages and some form of medicine in the form of capsules, to which Meril\u00e4inen accepted both. The man himself took several of the capsules during the drive. During the trip, she noticed that the man seemed distressed and that he had a child seat at the back. She fell asleep, and when she woke up, Meril\u00e4inen noticed that the car was not on the road to Riihim\u00e4ki, but on a remote forest path. When she asked the man about the route, he assured her that he was still on the right way. The man drove the car to a dark gravel pit and stopped the car. He tried to persuade Meril\u00e4inen to stay in the car for a night, but she refused and said that she wanted to go home. At that point, the man said that he needed to go urinate and left the car, with Meril\u00e4inen feeling the same need and also leaving the car. When Meril\u00e4inen squatted, the man quickly approached and struck her to head with the edge of a knife. Despite the injury, Meril\u00e4inen managed to flee towards the forest. She heard the man say \"I did not succeed this time\". When she started running, the man spoke something to himself and entered his car. After a while, Meril\u00e4inen found a road to a house and alerted them for help. An ambulance was called, and she got away with minor physical injuries. She was apparently saved by a thick woollen knit cap. === Tuula Lukkarinen === In April 1991, 28-year-old Tuula Lukkarinen left Kellokoski psychiatric hospital on vacation, with the purpose of travelling to Hyryl\u00e4 for a custody case for her son. She left the hospital at around 8.30 in the morning. However, she never made it to Hyryl\u00e4, and was last seen in J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 at around nine o'clock am waiting on a liquor store to open.OTETAAN KIINNI Tuula Lukkarisen SURMAAJA!/LET'S CATCH THE KILLER of Tuula Lukkarinen!, Alibi 9/1991. Retrieved 28 May 2019. The next day, a landowner discovered her badly mutilated body in the woods near a gravel pit, the body being less than 100 metres away from the place where, a five months earlier, Meril\u00e4inen was attacked. According to police, Lukkarinen was transported to Hausj\u00e4rvi between the day of disappearance and the day of discovery and the time of death had been around midnight. The body had been dragged a few dozen meters to the woods from a small road that led to the gravel pits. A blizzard had hit the area during the hours after her death and caused damage to the crime scene. According to police Lukkarinen was not raped.OTETAAN KIINNI Tuula Lukkarisen SURMAAJA!/LET'S CATCH THE KILLER of Tuula Lukkarinen!, Alibi 9/1991. Retrieved 28 May 2019. === Maarit Haantie === 40-year-old Maarit Haantie disappeared in August 1993, and is also suspected of being the victim of a possible serial killer. Her body was searched for by the local authorities to no avail. The NBI began investigating the cases of the three women as the doing of one killer, arguing that many factors, such as the use of alcohol, the dark hair color and being in the same area contributed to the theory. According to NBI they also have information that connects the disappearance to the two earlier cases that they won't publish due to an open investigation.Malin, Jarkko: Police still believes they can find the Hiki\u00e4 serial killer Aamuposti, 16.07.2008. ==== Disappearance ==== Haantie was attending a party at the restaurant Zapata in J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 on August 13, 1993. She was going there with her partner and a few friends. All of them got in the restaurant except Haantie. Haantie was not let in by the doorman because of her drunkenness. She was last seen standing outside the building, and hasn't been seen since. ==== Investigation ==== The disappearance of Haantie was initially filed to the Riihim\u00e4ki Police, who treated the case as a normal disappearance without any indication of homicide. Soon, however, it was discovered that a bag belonging to Haantie had been found in a restaurant called Martina at the town of Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4. During interviews with the staff, it was apparent that the employees had removed a drunk person who resembled Maarit Haantie. It soon became clear that in 1991, a woman by the name of Tuula Lukkarinen had been found brutally murdered in a Hausj\u00e4rvi gravel pit. Earlier, in 1990, Helena Meril\u00e4inen was attacked in the same area where Lukkarinen's body was discovered five months later. Helena had been hit with a knife, but managed to escape. The police assumed that Meril\u00e4inen had been attacked by the same man who had killed Tuula Lukkarinen. The whole chain of events mentioned above had drawn the attention of the NBI, and soon the case of Haantie was included in the investigation. A large search was carried out in the woods around the Hausj\u00e4rvi municipality and especially the gravel pits area south of Hiki\u00e4 village, but nothing was found. The investigation, however, has remained active to this day. In 2007, the television series \"Kadonneet\", \"Disappeared\" did an episode on Haantie's case, which attracted a lot of attention. In the section, the NBI specifically asked for a hint about a dark-haired man in J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 in the early 90s who offered rides to women, as described by Helena Meril\u00e4inen. Helena Meril\u00e4inen, Tuula Lukkarinen and Maarit Haantie were combined the use of alcohol, dark hair and living environment, with the NBI believing that the same perpetrator is responsible for all three cases. The Kadonneet episode gathered about 30 new tips, which helped with the offender's profiling. According to the NBI, the hints have been very important for the investigation, and have confirmed the results of earlier profiling. Investigation is still active, and the Bureau strongly believes that there have been other murder attempts. The NBI has searched for Haantie from the forest areas in Hausj\u00e4rvi as late as in 2017, claiming that they have information that connects Haantie to the area.Malin, Jarkko: Police still believes they can find the Hiki\u00e4 serial killer Aamuposti, 16.07.2008. === Fourth case === In 2017 it was published in the media that there had been a possible fourth case involving the murders. In 1989 a drunken 30-year-old woman had just exited a restaurant in J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4 when a man offered her a ride, offering her alcohol and pills and then driving her to a forest area, the case resembling the case of Helena Meril\u00e4inen's. Although the woman did make it, the victim's mother brought it up after the woman had died of natural causes years later. === Similar unsolved cases in the area === In year 1988 there were several cases of a man with a similar description and driving a white Volkswagen Passat liftback harassing women in the areas close by and even attempting to abduct a 19-year-old woman in H\u00e4meenlinna by threatening her with a pistol while the woman was able to escape from a moving car.Nykyposti 1/89, January 1989 In December 1987 a 19-year-old woman Heidi H\u00e4r\u00f6 went missing in M\u00e4nts\u00e4l\u00e4 after leaving a local bar and probably hitching a ride. Her decomposed body was found five months later from a forest area in Pukkila with some of her clothes missing.Kadonnut nainen l\u00f6ytyi kuolleena Pukkilassa/Missing woman found dead in Pukkila Helsingin Sanomat, 03.05.1988. == Offender's profile == Over the years, the perpetrator has been profiled largely based on Meril\u00e4inen's story and events, with the description as following: * At the time of the events in 1990, the man was between 30 and 40 years old, and had a dark, curly hair. * He is about 1.70 m tall. * He knows the anatomy of a human or a large animal (according to the Lukkarinen murder). * He possibly had an infant child at the time, as the car's back seat had a child restraint. * The car itself is thought to be a Sedan Mazda or Datsun. * He was familiar with the towns of J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4, Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 and Riihim\u00e4ki that locate along the railway and with the forest area around the Hiki\u00e4 village. * It is believed that he is unable to form a normal relationship with a woman. * The man had spoken about his child and told he had a bad relationship with his wife, and is believed that he might have divorced. A lot of new tips about the killer have been provided due to the Kadonneet episode. According to some, a dark-haired man is believed to have offered rides to a few women still in the 21st century. According to the tips a man fitting to the description has last been offering a ride to a woman in year 2006. The NBI is still investigating the case, believing that the killer can be found. They have also taken into account that the killer hasn't been found yet because he might be living abroad or is dead. ==See also== *List of unsolved murders == References == == See also == * Ylen El\u00e4v\u00e4 Archive: Disappeared: Maarit Haantie Category:Hausj\u00e4rvi Category:Unsolved murders in Finland Category:Serial murders in Finland Category:Unidentified serial killers Category:1990s murders in Finland Category:1990 crimes in Finland Category:1990 murders in Europe Category:1991 crimes in Finland Category:1991 murders in Europe ",
