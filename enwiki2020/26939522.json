    "text": "Luxembourg was represented by French singer Hugues Aufray, with the song '\"D\u00e8s que le printemps revient\", at the 1964 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 21 March in Copenhagen. The song was chosen internally by broadcaster RTL. == At Eurovision == On the night of the final Aufray performed first in the running order, preceding the Netherlands - the first of only two instances to date of a country being drawn to perform last one year and first the next. Only an audio recording of Aufray's performance is known to survive, as the video master of the 1964 contest is believed to have been destroyed in a fire at the Danish TV archive during the 1970s. Each national jury awarded 5-3-1 to their top three songs, and at the close of voting \"D\u00e8s que le printemps revient\" had picked up 14 points (5 from Germany, and 3 each from France, Italy and the Netherlands), placing Luxembourg joint 4th (with France) of the 16 entries. The Luxembourgian jury awarded its 5 points to contest winners Italy.ESC History - Luxembourg 1964 ===Points awarded to Luxembourg=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=3|Points awarded to Luxembourg |- !width=34%|5 points !width=33%|3 points !width=33%|1 point |- | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * * * | valign=\"top\" | |- |} ===Points awarded by Luxembourg=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"gold\"|'|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"silver\"|3 points|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"#CC9966\"|1 point|| |- |} ==See also== *Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1964 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1964 Category:Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:1964 in Luxembourg ",
