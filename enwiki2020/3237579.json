The temple is believed to have got the name from Thiru Shambara or the Holy Shambara in reverence to Maharishi Shambara who is supposed to have meditated here. The main deity of the temple is Shree Krishna after \"Kamsavadham\", sitting in Raudra posture (ferocious posture). This temple is considered equal in status to the world-famous Guruvayoor Temple, and is also called North Guruvayoor, since it is located to the north of Guruvayoor Temple.
