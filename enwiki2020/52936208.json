    "text": "Sudoeste: cadernos de Almada Negreiros (Portuguese for \"Southeast\") was a Portuguese review published in Lisbon in 1935. The magazine was an attempt to continue the Orpheu movement. It was headed by Almada Negreiros (as suggested in the magazine's title), in collaboration with D\u00e1rio Martins, which put their knowledge in different forms of direct interventionism, contacts and its influences to the publication of the periodical. Three issues were published between June and November 1935. The first issue reflected through its essays and text that forms the same theoretical presupposition: Life understood with a constructive union between the whole individuals. It also exacerbates having a value in creativity with an indispensable likeliness in all of the areas including arts and politics, condemning in a less objective form, which had mixed up the elements which annulled the potentials. Its third issue was relatively the first that it adopted the contributors from the reviews Presen\u00e7a, the former Orpheu, notably by the writers including the great Fernando Pessoa, M\u00e1rio de S\u00e1-Carneiro, Lu\u00eds de Montalvor, Raul Leal, Alfredo Guisado, Alvaro de Campos, Jo\u00e3o Gaspar Sim\u00f5es, Jos\u00e9 R\u00e9gio Adolfo Casais Monteiro, Sa\u00fal Dias, Carlos Queir\u00f3s, Carlos Ramos, Pardal Monteiro and M\u00e1rio Saa, along with its illustrations by Sara Afonso and M\u00e1rio Eloy.
