    "text": "Three Holy Hierarchs Chapel The Three Holy Hierarchs Chapel () is a Romanian Orthodox chapel located at 46 Mihail Sadoveanu Alley in Ia\u0219i, Romania. It is dedicated to the Three Holy Hierarchs. A new building for the Vasile Lupu Normal School was erected in 1891. This was some 5 km from the city center and its churches, and it was felt that prayer space should exist closer by. Thus, the chapel was built for the students between 1907 and 1911, funded through the state institution Casa Bisericii. The architects also took care of the painting and decoration. The chapel's dedication reflects the fact that the beginning of education in Moldavia was linked to Trei Ierarhi Monastery. The chapel was blessed by Pimen Georgescu, Metropolitan of Moldavia. It was used by the students until 1947 and the establishment of a communist regime. It was then closed down until 1990 when, in the aftermath of the Romanian Revolution, it reopened for services. Since 1995, it serves as a chapel for students from the theological seminary that now occupies the normal school building. At the same time, it is open to normal school students. C\u0103t\u0103lina Mihalache, History at the Ia\u0219i County Cultural Office site The chapel is made of stone and brick, with the two materials alternating on the exterior.

The iconostasis is elaborately carved, while the roof is simple. There is no spire, only five large metal crosses on the roof. Repairs were carried out during the 1990s.
