    "text": "Francisco \"Paquito\" Fern\u00e1ndez Ochoa (February 25, 1950 \u2013 November 6, 2006) was a World Cup alpine ski racer from Spain. Born in Madrid and raised north of the city in Cercedilla, he was the eldest of eight children whose father ran a ski school. Paquito raced in all of the alpine disciplines and specialized in slalom. At the age of 21, he won an Olympic gold medal in the slalom at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan. He is known for being the first (& only) Spaniard to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics. Thirty years later, German-born Johann M\u00fchlegg won three gold medals in cross-country skiing for Spain in 2002, but was later stripped of his gold medals for doping offenses. ==Career== Fern\u00e1ndez Ochoa made his international debut at age 17 at the 1968 Winter Olympics, where he finished 38th in the downhill and giant slalom, and 23rd in the slalom. His first top ten finish on the World Cup circuit was the following season, a sixth-place finish in the slalom at Meg\u00e8ve, France, on January 26, 1969. He was one of five siblings that raced for the Spanish alpine ski team and competed at the Winter Olympics (brothers Lu\u00eds and Juan Manuel and sisters Dolores and Blanca). Blanca was the only other Spanish skier to win a medal at the Winter Olympics; she won the bronze in the women's slalom at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. Statue of Fern\u00e1ndez Ochoa in Cercedilla, Spain Fern\u00e1ndez Ochoa competed in four Winter Olympics (1968-80). He won only one World Cup race, a slalom in 1974 in Zakopane, Poland. Both of his career wins came over Gustav Th\u00f6ni of Italy, the dominant technical ski racer of the early 1970s. At the 1974 World Championships, Fern\u00e1ndez Ochoa won a bronze medal in the slalom. His best season was 1975; he finished 9th in the overall standings and 7th in the slalom standings. He finished ninth in the slalom at the 1976 Winter Olympics. Fern\u00e1ndez Ochoa retired from international competition at age 30, following the 1980 World Cup season, and finished with four World Cup podiums (top 3) and 30 top ten finishes. He then raced for several seasons on the pro tour in North America. Fern\u00e1ndez Ochoa died of lymphatic cancer at age 56 in Cercedilla, Community of Madrid in November 2006. Less than two weeks before his death, a statue of him was erected in Cercedilla. He was survived by his wife Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Vargas (m. 1973) and their three children: B\u00e1rbara, Paula, and Francisco. Francisco Fern\u00e1ndez Ochoa City Ice Rink in Valdemoro, Madrid and Francisco Fern\u00e1ndez Ochoa City Sports Center in Carabanchel, Madrid were named in his honor. ==World Cup results== ===Season standings=== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" !Season !!
