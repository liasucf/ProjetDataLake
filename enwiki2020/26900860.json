It is located at the intersection of the Cologne\u2013Aachen high-speed line with the lines to Linnich, Heimbach and Euskirchen. Until 1992 it was also connected to the Erft Railway. The train is served by Regional-Express, Regionalbahn and S-Bahn trains. It is the terminus of line S12 Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn. In addition, a pair of Intercity- Express between Aachen, Cologne and Berlin and a single InterCity train from Berlin stop at the station. The station was opened on 1 September 1841 by the Rhenish Railway Company on its original line from Cologne to Belgium. ==History == D\u00fcren station in 1920 Part of the station opened in 1841 D\u00fcren station was established on 1 September 1841 with the opening of the Aachen\u2013D\u00fcren\u2013Cologne line. The station became more and more important during the period of industrialisation. This resulted in the opening of the following lines: {| class=\"wikitable\" |1864 || D\u00fcren \u2013 Euskirchen |- |1869 || D\u00fcren \u2013 Bedburg \u2013 Neuss |- |1873 || D\u00fcren \u2013 J\u00fclich \u2013 Linnich |- |1903 || D\u00fcren \u2013 Heimbach |} Due to its ever-improving accessibility D\u00fcren was served by increasing numbers of express trains on the various lines. Thus, there were express trains via Euskirchen to Bonn and via Bedburg and Neuss to D\u00fcsseldorf. A depot for the maintenance of locomotives was also built at D\u00fcren. It was originally located immediately next to the station. In 1930, construction began on a new railway depot, which was located on the Aachen\u2013Cologne line towards Merzenich. The construction took about three years and it became operational in 1933. Unlike the rest of D\u00fcren, which was destroyed by the attacks of the Allies, the station was largely unscathed by World War II. During the war, the engine depot was badly damaged and it was only partially rebuilt after the war. Consequently, D\u00fcren depot lost its importance. ===Post- war=== Old turntable and Rurtalbahn train in the station The great destruction of D\u00fcren during World War II reduced the city's financial resources. Decades old plans for remodelling the tracks and the construction of a new station building were therefore not implemented. Nevertheless, on 15 May 1949, D-Z\u00fcge (express trains operated using coaches with corridors) began serving D\u00fcren station again. There were two express services: one from Brussels via Aachen, Cologne and Wiesbaden to Frankfurt, the second from Aachen via Cologne, Wiesbaden, Heidelberg, Stuttgart and Ulm to Munich. Thus, it was possible to travel from D\u00fcren without changing at Cologne or Aachen. Following a significant fall in freight traffic, D\u00fcren depot closed on 1 July 1986 and was demolished three years later. As a result, D\u00fcren became a hub almost entirely for passenger services with little freight transport. In the next few decades, an increasing number of fast services stopped in D\u00fcren, including InterCity, InterRegio, EuroCity and night trains. The period of fast services ended with the modernisation of the line in the early 21st century. In December 2002, the last D-Z\u00fcge on the Cologne\u2013Ostend route and the last night train on the Aachen\u2013Dresden route were abandoned. A year later, the InterCity and night train lines were also modified so that D\u00fcren was no longer served by long- distance services. The station was also downgraded to a category 4 station. The mayor of D\u00fcren unsuccessfully tried to get Intercity-Express and Thalys high speed trains on the Aachen\u2013Cologne line to stop at D\u00fcren. Deutsche Bahn agreed, however, that the station would be upgraded to category 3 as soon as InterCity or night trains returned to the Aachen-Cologne line. The upgrading of the Aachen\u2013D\u00fcren\u2013Cologne line and the related establishment of a S-Bahn line from D\u00fcren to Cologne led to a renewed increase in the importance of the D\u00fcren node. However, the D\u00fcren\u2013Bedburg line was dismantled, the D\u00fcren\u2013Euskirchen line was closed and the D\u00fcren\u2013J\u00fclich\u2013Linnich and the D\u00fcren\u2013Heimbach lines were sold to the D\u00fcrener Kreisbahn (D\u00fcren District Railway, DKB). Passenger and freight traffic on the latter lines was subsequently revitalised by the DKB. These services are now operated by Rurtalbahn. The station building has been preserved until today. With the development of the high-speed line between Cologne and Aachen, D\u00fcren station was partially restored and completely modernised. The tracks and platforms were renewed and later the station building was renovated and modernised in stages. During the first stage of the upgrading of the Cologne\u2013D\u00fcren line the platforms were all remodelled and upgraded to make them accessible by the disabled. The entrance to the station from Cologne was rebuilt for a top speed of 160 km/h. During the second stage tracks 1 and 2 will be upgraded for 200 km/h operations. ==Service at the station == The station is fully accessible with lifts available at all platforms. There are also guidelines on the ground for the blind. Services are available in the station building, including a ticket office, a bookstore, a bank, toilets, lockers and a DB-Service Store. The station also has a Bahnhofsmission (a charity that gives assistance of various sorts at German stations). At the southern exit to the station is a subway to the newly built bicycle parking, which was opened in September 2010 after several months of construction. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Railway stations in North Rhine-Westphalia Category:S13 (Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn) Category:Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn stations Category:Railway stations in Germany opened in 1841 Category:Buildings and structures in D\u00fcren (district) ",
