    "text": "The TCR International Series was an international touring car championship. The championship was promoted by World Sporting Consulting (WSC), founded by former World Touring Car Championship manager Marcello Lotti. It was marketed as a cost-effective spin-off of the WTCC, targeted at C-segment hatchbacks production-based touring cars. The title TCR follows the naming convention now used by the FIA to classify the cars that compete in touring car racing, with TC1 referring to the top tier as used by the FIA WTCC and TC2 referring to the legacy cars which principally compete in the FIA ETCC. On 6 December 2017, FIA's World Motorsport Council announced that the series will merge with World Touring Car Championship and European Touring Car Cup starting in 2018. ==History== On 15 July 2014, Lotti revealed further details on the TCR series. On the same day it was announced that the TCR series will award a Drivers' Championship title and a Teams' Championship title. The number of teams will be limited to eight and the number of competitors to twenty-four. It was also announced that the series will run alongside Formula One at selected events. On 21 July 2014, more details about the series became available: the race weekend format will be structured like the WTCC, with two free practice sessions and a two part qualifying session, followed by two races on Sunday. The first event would take place in Italy in March, but when a provisional calendar for the 2015 season was released on 31 October, it became clear that the first event will take place at the Sepang International Circuit on 29 March. Lotti confirmed the technical principles of the SEAT Le\u00f3n Cup Racer, which is also set to be adopted in the Single-Make Trophy category of the European Touring Car Cup in 2015, will be used by the TCR Series. On 29 July 2014, former WTCC driver Pepe Oriola said in an interview with TouringCarTimes that he hopes to compete in the new series, because he was set to drive for the Onyx Race Engineering team in the 2014 WTCC season with their new Ford Fiesta TC1 car for the last part of the season, before the project was abandoned with no support for homologation from Ford. On 15 September 2014, the TCR organisation announced the first cars, teams, regulations and events of its inaugural season in 2015. Target Competition became the first team to confirm entry in the series and will run SEAT Le\u00f3n Eurocup cars in 2015. Onyx Race Engineering has also confirmed they are developing the Ford Focus for the championship. A week later Paolo Coloni Racing announced plans to enter the championship in 2015. Team principal Paolo Coloni, son of F1-team founder Enzo Coloni, is known for its accomplishments in the GP2 Series in 2005 and in 2009 to 2012. The team will confirm at a later date their planned car and driver line-up. On 31 October 2014, a provisional calendar for its inaugural season was released. It will consist of twelve weekends, four in Asia, five in Europe, two in South America and one to be announced. On 7 November 2014, the fourth team was announced: the Swedish STCC team WestCoast Racing will join the series with three Honda Civics build by JAS Motorsport. On 20 November Liqui Moly Team Engstler announced they will participate with Volkswagen Golfs and Franz Engstler will be driving one of the VWs. On 5 December 2014, the series was approved by the FIA and renamed TCR International Series instead of using the original TC3 International Series name. On 27 January 2015, Marcello Lotti announced three new teams for the inaugural season: Zeng\u0151 Motorsport, Proteam Racing and Campos Racing. On 13 February Jordi Oriola announced he will be driving a Target Competition SEAT at Valencia and Monza and Mikhail Grachev was confirmed on 17 February at Engstler Motorsport. In the end of February and in March almost half of all the drivers were confirmed, but just one week from the first round in Sepang Onyx Race Engineering, Paolo Coloni Racing and Proteam Racing have not confirmed a single driver. On 20 March the TCR International Series organisation announced the first TV deals for the inaugural season. On 29 May 2015, David Sonenscher announces the TCR Thailand Series, starting from 2016. ===Seasons=== * 2015 TCR International Series * 2016 TCR International Series * 2017 TCR International Series ==Technical regulations== On 15 September 2014, technical regulations for the category were announced.
