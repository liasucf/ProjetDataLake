In 1997 Congebec purchased its first warehouse in the Montreal region. In 2002, it was the first phase of construction for the Boucherville warehouse which was the beginning of a strong expansion for Congebec. In 2004, Congebec purchased the Centre Frigorifique Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie, which is now referred to as Sainte-Julie warehouse. In doing so, Congebec also purchased CFM logistics that now is Congebec's transport division. After the acquisition, Congebec became the largest refrigerated warehouse company in Quebec and second largest in Canada. In 2006, the Boucherville warehouse was considerably expanded. A seventh warehouse was built in Manseau in autumn 2008. This warehouse is almost entirely dedicated to the cranberry industry. In 2011, Congebec entered the Toronto market with the opening of an 8th refrigerated warehouse strategically located near Pearson Airport, with more than three million cubic feet. In 2013, Congebec conducted its largest expansion in history by acquiring four Westco Multitemp warehouses located in Calgary, Saskatoon and Winnipeg, which gave Congebec a total of more than 48.3 million cubic feet. In 2015, Capital r\u00e9gional et coop\u00e9ratif Desjardins (CRCD), a retail fund managed by Canadian private equity firm Desjardins Capital de risque, led an undisclosed investment in Congebec Logistic Inc. The deal was also backed by Fondaction CSN and Investissement Qu\u00e9bec and supported the transfer of management of Congebec Logistic from its founder, Laurier Pedneault, to his son, Nicholas-P Pedneault. As a result of the transaction, CRCD, an existing investor in the company, became the majority shareholder. On April 25, 2017 Nick Pedneault was named Chairman of the WFLO (World Food Logistics Organisation) and said he would focus his efforts on the development and growth of the industry as well as on the promotion of the GCCA (Global Cold Chain Alliance). The WFLO represents the research and education component of the GCCA.
