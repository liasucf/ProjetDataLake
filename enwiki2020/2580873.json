    "text": "Belle \u00c9poque is a 1992 Spanish comedy-drama film directed by Fernando Trueba. The title does not derive from the period in French history known as the Belle \u00c9poque (\"The Beautiful Era\") but from the days before the Spanish Civil War. Belle \u00c9poque received the Goya Award for Best Film along with eight other Goya Awards and was named Best Foreign Language Film at the 66th Academy Awards. ==Plot== The year is 1931. Spain is politically divided between Republicans and Traditionalists and on the verge of the Spanish Second Republic. Fernando, a young soldier, deserts. He befriends Manolo (Fernando Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez), a man with a large house in the country. Fernando meets and is enchanted by Manolo's four daughters. As he meets each of the first three one by one, he falls in love and has sex with each of them, determining to marry. With each one, however, a complication arises: Clara (Miriam D\u00edaz-Aroca), a widow who only recently lost her husband and who seeks solace with Fernando; Violeta (Ariadna Gil), a lesbian who is attracted to Fernando only when he is dressed as a woman for a costume ball and Roc\u00edo (Maribel Verd\u00fa), a social climber who is about to marry into a royalist family for the security it would provide and who only momentarily succumbs to Fernando's charms. Heartbroken each time, the father of the girls encourages Fernando to have patience. Each of the daughters is beautiful and represents a different aspect of feminine sexuality. The youngest of the family, Luz (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz), represents na\u00efvet\u00e9. While Fernando is pursuing her sisters, Luz gets progressively angry and jealous. Eventually Fernando realizes, however, that Luz is the best one of the four to marry. ==Cast== *Jorge Sanz as Fernando *Fernando Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez as Manolo *Miriam D\u00edaz Aroca as Clara (as Miriam D\u00edaz-Aroca) *Ariadna Gil as Violeta *Maribel Verd\u00fa as Roc\u00edo *Pen\u00e9lope Cruz as Luz *Gabino Diego as Juanito *Michel Galabru as Danglard *Agust\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez as Don Luis *Chus Lampreave as Do\u00f1a Asun *Mary Carmen Ram\u00edrez as Amalia *Juan Jos\u00e9 Otegui as Guard (El cabo) *Jes\u00fas Bonilla as Guard (El n\u00famero) *Mar\u00eda Galiana as La Polonia *Joan Potau as Paco (as Juan Potau) ==Critical reception== Belle \u00c9poque received positive reviews getting a 93% on rottentomatoes.com.
