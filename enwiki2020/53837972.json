Voters chose three representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Nevada was won by Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan, who narrowly won the state with 45.71% of the vote, to the Republican Party nominee William Howard Taft\u2019s 43.93%, winning him the state\u2019s three electoral votes. Socialist candidate Eugene Debs received his highest percentage nationally in Nevada with 8.57% of the vote. Bryan, who had also carried the state against William McKinley in both 1896 and 1900 saw a loss of 35.50% from his 1896 vote and of 16.54% from his 1900 vote. Until 2016, this was the last presidential election where a Democrat carried Nevada without winning the presidency. ==Campaign== The six Democratic Nevada delegates were selected at the state convention held in Carson City and consisted of Senator Francis G.
