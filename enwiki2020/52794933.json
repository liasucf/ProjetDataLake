    "text": "Turing House School is a co-educational comprehensive secondary school which was opened in 2015 in the London Borough of Richmond, south-west London, under the Government's free schools initiative. The proposal for the school was initiated by local parents in partnership with the Russell Education Trust (RET), who operate four other free schools in the south and south-west of England. Turing House School is named in honour of Alan Turing the famous mathematician who lived for a while in nearby Hampton when he worked at the National Physical Laboratory. The school is governed by RET, with a range of governance responsibilities delegated to the school's local governing body. ==Ofsted== In May 2018 the school was rated by Ofsted as \"good\" overall, with areas being \"outstanding\". ==Site== Due to delays in securing a permanent site large enough for a secondary school, Turing House has been temporarily housed in a converted office block in Teddington, using local sports facilities at Bushy Park, and a second site in Hampton. It plans to move to a permanent site in Whitton, in 2021. The site is adjacent to Borough Cemetery, Heathfield Recreation Ground, and Sempervirens Nursery (which is also the head office of the nursery's owner, Kingston Landscape Group). The proposed site has resulted in controversy due to the Metropolitan Open Land designation. ==Admissions== Admissions for Year 7, and in-year admissions for all year groups are handled by Richmond Council's schools admission team. The 2019 Year 7 oversubscription criteria allocate places by distance from two Admissions Points in Fulwell and Heathfield at a ratio of 80:20. ==References== ==External links== * Turing House School website * State schools in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames Category:2015 establishments in England Category:Educational institutions established in 2015 Category:Secondary schools in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames Category:Academies in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames Category:Free schools in London Category:Twickenham Category:Alan Turing ",
