In his childhood Thomas attended Haddington Grammar School and then the University of Edinburgh, where he studied theology.

The couple lived in Monkton, where Clementina's uncle had been Presbyterian minister. ==Move to Dunedin== At the age of 47, Burns joined the Free Church secession from the Church of Scotland. The proposal for a Free Church settlement in New Zealand gained Burns's interest, and he was offered the position of minister of the New Edinburgh scheme (later the Otago scheme) in June 1843. Burns and William Cargill established a lay association to promote the settlement in May 1845. On 27 November 1847, Burns and 239 settlers sailed on the Philip Laing from Greenock, among them his wife, five daughters, and one son, Arthur John Burns. They arrived at the new settlement of Dunedin on 15 April 1848.
