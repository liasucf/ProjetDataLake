    "text": "Jules F\u00e9tique (1875 in Mirecourt (Vosges) \u2013 1951 in Gagny (Seine Saint Denis)) was a prominent French archetier from a family of bowmakers. Son of Charles Claude F\u00e9tique (1853-1911) a violin maker, and brother to Victor F\u00e9tique, Jules F\u00e9tique served his apprenticeship under Paul \u00c9mile Miquel before joining the Bazin Family and Charles Nicolas Bazin. In 1902, Jules F\u00e9tique joined the workshop of Eug\u00e8ne Sartory in Paris with whom he remained until 1912. This collaboration had a strong influence on his style. During this period he also worked for his brother Victor F\u00e9tique. In 1912 Jules F\u00e9tique worked with 'Caressa et Fran\u00e7ais' but maintained his collaboration with Eugene Sartory. In 1927, F\u00e9tique received the diploma of \u00abMeilleur Ouvrier de France\u00bb (1st Craftsman of France) and in 1937, the \u00ab Dipl\u00f4me d'Honneur \u00bb (Diploma of Honor) at the International Paris Exhibition. By 1934 he left Caressa et Fran\u00e7ais and established his own workshop in Paris at Rue de Moscou, with Andr\u00e9 Dugad, who himself was a former collaborator of Caressa et Fran\u00e7ais. At this time, F\u00e9tique ended his collaboration with Eug\u00e8ne Sartory. His style changed and became more influenced by the school of Dominique Peccatte. ==Quotes== \"Vigneron and Jules Fetique produced bows that at times could rival a Sartory in terms of strength and handling....\" Stefan Hersh \"It is unfortunate that Jules Fetique bows are known as a poor man's Sartory (among professionals), because they are superb bows and deserve to be recognized on their own terms (as such). Early work resembles Sartory. Later work is inspired by D. Peccatte .\" - Filimonov Fine Violins Gennady Filimonov ==References== * * * * Dictionnaire Universel del Luthiers - Ren\u00e9 Vannes 1951,1972, 1985 (vol.3) * Universal Dictionary of Violin & Bow Makers - William Henley 1970 Category:1875 births Category:1951 deaths Category:People from Mirecourt Category:Bow makers Category:Luthiers Category:Bowed string instrument makers ",
