    "text": "The EFMD Quality Improvement System (EQUIS) is a school accreditation system. It specializes in higher education institutions of management and business administration, run by the European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD). EQUIS has accredited 189 institutions in 45 countries around the world. Scope of business school accreditation for AACSB, EQUIS and AMBA Number of schools with single, double and triple (AACSB-AMBA-EQUIS) accreditation outside North America == History == EQUIS' directors as of 2018 are Ulrich Hommel and David Asch. In the past 20 years of existence the organization has accredited 189 institutions in 45 countries. == Object of the accreditation == The accreditation is awarded to business schools based on general quality. The process also takes into account the business school's level of internationalization, which is not a strict requirement for accreditation by the other two major international accreditation bodies: AACSB and AMBA. So far, all fully accredited EQUIS business schools applying for AACSB accreditation have succeeded, which has not been the case the other way. EQUIS accreditation can be granted for three years (with annual progress reports on the areas of improvement required) or for five years (with a mid-term progress report on development objectives required). == See also == * Association of MBAs (AMBA) * Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) * List of EQUIS accredited institutions * Triple accreditation == Notes and references == == External links == * Category:School accreditors ",
