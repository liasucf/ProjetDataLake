It follows a different march style: Intro(4 bars)--[:A(16):]--[:B(16):]--Trio [:C(16):]--[:D(16):]. In part D, the tune starts off quiet, grows louder, and fades away. The march is notable for lacking a \"stinger,\" or tutti chord on beat two. ==References== Category:Sousa marches Category:1893 compositions Category:Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn ",
