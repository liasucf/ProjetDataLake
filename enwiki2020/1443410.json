    "text": "Elizabeth Courtney Hendrickson Meder (born July 3, 1979) is an American actress. Her big break came when she was cast as character Frankie Stone on the daytime drama All My Children. Her equally popular role of Maggie Stone, the character's identical twin, launched the character into iconic status as one half of supercouple Bianca Montgomery and Maggie Stone. Following her departure from All My Children, Hendrickson guest starred in several primetime shows. Since 2008, she starred as fashion vixen Chloe Mitchell on The Young and the Restless. ==Early life== Hendrickson was born in New York City. Her family later moved to Northport, Long Island, and maintained a home there. At an early age, Hendrickson showed an interest in the performing arts. \"Artistic people have always surrounded me,\" she stated in a Q&A; interview, citing her actor/artist family as her inspiration for wanting to become an actress. \"Their talent and love for the arts continue to inspire me and always will.\" Her cousin is documentary filmmaker Dennis Michael Lynch. By age 5, Hendrickson was tap dancing on tabletops at family weddings. As she aged, her love for performing deepened. Hendrickson studied musical theatre at Syracuse University for two years before returning to New York. She transferred to Fordham College in her sophomore year. She auditioned for the roles of Bianca Montgomery, Rain Wilkins and Pine Valley High cheerleader Mindy on the daytime drama All My Children, but others were cast in the parts. She tried out as Guiding Light character Michelle Bauer Santos, a role that eventually went to actress Rebecca Budig. ==Career== ===All My Children=== In 2001, when All My Children head writer Richard Culliton wanted to set up a murder storyline, he created character Mary Frances Stone (referred to onscreen as \"Frankie\"). Hendrickson was cast in the part. Her character was set to be the lesbian girlfriend of Bianca Montgomery (Eden Riegel) and be killed in 3 months. It was deemed unlikely that a homosexual pairing on a soap opera would be successful, but fan reaction to the Bianca and Frankie pairing was unprecedented. Unfortunately, the Culliton murder storyline could not be rewritten, so Frankie was killed and Bianca's mother, Erica Kane (Susan Lucci), was seen standing over her corpse holding a gun. This prompted uproar in the soap opera community, and producers quickly thought up a way to bring the actress back to the show. Rather than rewrite Frankie's murder, the writers created her identical twin sister, Mary Margaret Stone (better known as Maggie), in 2002. Maggie quickly became instrumental in solving her sister's murder. Storyline tension was created when it was revealed that unlike Frankie, character Maggie was not gay. This, however, did not stop Bianca and Maggie (fondly referred to in soap circles as BAM) fans from becoming very vocal about their support for the couple. After several heterosexual pairings involving Maggie did not work on the show, the writers began to develop a deepening relationship between the two characters. Eventually, Maggie kissed Bianca, moments before Bianca's lover, Lena Kundera (Olga Sosnovska), walked in. Bianca and Maggie became one of the most demanded couples in soap opera history. Hendrickson subsequently gained a loyal lesbian following. In 2006, Lesbianation.com, self-proclaimed as the leading online community for lesbians, voted her on their top ten list of Women We Love. The following year, Hendrickson again made the list. Hendrickson portrayed the popular role of Maggie until February 2005. Onscreen, Maggie exited Pine Valley with Bianca, traveling with her and her daughter, Miranda, to live in Paris. In late 2005, during Bianca's visit to Pine Valley, it was revealed that Maggie and Bianca had become lovers offscreen. In real life, Hendrickson and former castmate Eden Riegel have since separately moved to Los Angeles, and are pursuing other acting ventures. Riegel, however, did return to All My Children for a year, as part of a major storyline in late 2006, early 2007. Hendrickson returned again in January 2007 for a short 3-week stint. Her last airdate was February 7, 2007 when her character returned to Paris.She cried mea culpa, clashed with Zoe and ultimately returned solo to France. Unfortunately, BAM fans, Maggie appears to have left the building. Try though she might, AMC's Maggie can't seem to convince her ex, Bianca, that her cheating days are over. After begging for forgiveness and pitching in at Fusion, Mags makes her lonely exit on Wednesday, February 7. Is this the end for AMC's Sapphic supercouple? \"Bianca still loves her,\" headwriter Megan McTavish assures the audience. \"And yet, at the same time, I don't think it's a given that you necessarily forgive the person who cheated on you. So Maggie has an uphill climb.\" Ms. Stone's ambiguous exit leaves viewers wondering whether she'll return, yet an AMC rep says nothing is planned at this time. ===Other roles=== Since leaving All My Children, Hendrickson has earned guest starring roles in the television shows Medium, Cold Case, CSI: Miami and an uncredited role in Criminal Minds. She was to guest star on an episode of Criminal Minds titled Doubt on April 25, 2007, in the role of Katie, but the episode was pulled in deference to the tragedy at Virginia Tech and similar subject matter. The episode became the Season 3 premiere instead. Hendrickson signed on to play the role of Chloe Mitchell, a fashionista who stirs up trouble on the daytime drama The Young and the Restless in early 2008. It was revealed on the August 29, 2008 episode that the character was actually Kate, daughter of Katherine Chancellor's maid, Esther Valentine. Hendrickson exited the program in spring 2014.Young, Candace (April 23, 2014).. Soaps.sheknows.com Retrieved June 1, 2016. In May 2016 it was announced that Hendrickson was returning to The Young and the Restless.. Soapcentral.com. May 27, 2016. Retrieved June 1, 2016. Hendrickson has starred in the web series Imaginary Bitches with Riegel. In May 2018, it was announced that Hendrickson had joined the cast of General Hospital as Margaux Dawson. ==Personal life== Hendrickson married Rob Meder on June 29, 2019, after becoming engaged in December 2018. The couple's daughter, Josephine James, was born on March 27, 2020. Her pregnancy was written into her character's storyline on The Young and the Restless. ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Role ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes |- ! colspan=\"4\"| Film |- | 2005 || Searching for Bobby D || Denise || TV movie |- | 2006 || That Guy || 411 Partygoer || Comedic short |- ! colspan=\"10\"| Television |- | 2001 || Law & Order: Special Victims Unit || Mandy Schumacher || Episode: \"Consent\" |- | 2006 || Medium || Mindy || Episode: \"Method to His Madness\" |- | 2006 || Cold Case || Emma Elizabeth Vine - 1968 || Episode: \"Debut\" |- | 2006 || CSI: Miami || Rebecca Roth || Episode: \"Going, Going, Gone\" |- | 2001\u201307 || All My Children || Mary Frances \"Frankie\" Stone / Mary Margaret \"Maggie\" Stone || Contract roles |- | 2006\u201307 || Criminal Minds || Amy Cole / Katie || Episodes: \"P911\" & \"Doubt\" |- | 2008\u201315; 2016\u201317; 2019\u2013present || The Young and the Restless || Chloe Mitchell || Contract role; February 6, 2008 \u2013 May 27, 2014; guest star: October 14, 2014 and October 12-October 14, 2015 |- | 2015 || NCIS: New Orleans || Beth || |- | 2015 || Major Crimes || Sarah || |- | 2018\u201319 || General Hospital || Margaux Dawsonhttps://www.imdb.com/name/nm1058513/ || Contract role; May 29, 2018 \u2013 June 18, 2019 |- ! colspan=\"4\"| Other work |- | rowspan =\"1\"| unknown || Tide || Young wife || TV commercial |- | 2009 || McDonald's || Girlfriend || TV commercial |- | 2009 || Special K: || Scary Girl || TV commercial |- | 2009 || Bud Light: Language of Love || Hot girl || TV commercial |- | 2009 || Ford Fusion: Ice || Girlfriend || TV commercial |- | 2009 || Imaginary Bitches || Lizzie || Web series |} ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |+List of acting awards and nominations |- ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Award ! scope=\"col\" | Category ! scope=\"col\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2009 |Daytime Emmy Award | Outstanding New Approaches - (Daytime Entertainment) | Imaginary Bitches | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2012 |Daytime Emmy Award |Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series | The Young and the Restless | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2014 |Daytime Emmy Award |Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series | The Young and the Restless | | |- ! scope=\"row\"|2015 | Daytime Emmy Award | Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series |The Young and the Restless | | |- ! scope=\"row\"|2018 | Daytime Emmy Award | Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series |The Young and the Restless | | |} ==References== ==External links== * *Elizabeth Hendrickson in Bud Light Commercial *Elizabeth Hendrickson in Ford Fusion Commercial *Imaginary Bitches Web Series Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:American television actresses Category:American soap opera actresses Category:Actresses from New York (state) Category:People from Northport, New York Category:21st-century American actresses ",
