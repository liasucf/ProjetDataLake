The lake receives (at least theoretically) water from several streams from the Bogda Shan range. The lake is almost round, some 5\u20136 km in diameter, which makes it the largest freshwater lake in the \u00dcr\u00fcmqi region. Chaiwopu Township, Chaiwopu Railway Station on the Lanxin Railway, and China National Highway 312 are located near the northern and northeastern shore of the lake. Local media has referred to Chaiwopu Lake as \"charming and beautiful\".First hiking competition in Xinjiang opens by Chaiwopu Lake , Xinhuanet, 2010-02-08 The lake and its surroundings are officially protected as \u00dcr\u00fcmqi Chaiwopuhu National Wetland Park (\u4e4c\u9c81\u6728\u9f50\u67f4\u7a9d\u5821\u6e56\u56fd\u5bb6\u6e7f\u5730\u516c\u56ed).\u4e4c\u9c81\u6728\u9f50\u67f4\u7a9d\u5821\u6e56\u56fd\u5bb6\u6e7f\u5730\u516c\u56ed (\u00dcr\u00fcmqi Chaiwopuhu National Wetland Park) on Hudong.com The name of the lake (and of the eponymous township) is occasionally written as Chaiwobao.E.g., on Google Maps as of 2010-05-01 This is probably a misspelling: although the Chinese character \u5821 has two readings, \"bao\" and \"pu\", it is the latter reading that, according to dictionaries, is normally used in place names. ==References== Category:Lakes of Xinjiang Category:Nature reserves in China Category:\u00dcr\u00fcmqi ",
