    "text": "Forsaken (, literally \"Extraterrestrial\") is a 2018 Russian science fiction psychological thriller directed by Aleksandr Kulikov. Originally known as \"Martian\", the movie bears striking similarities to Ridley Scott's 2015 film, and, despite having a different ending, was heavily criticized in Russia and worldwide. It received generally negative reviews.\u0421\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u044b: \u0442\u043e\u043f-10 \u0437\u0430 2018 \u0433\u043e\u0434 | \u0418\u0437\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 | \u041c\u0438\u0440 \u0444\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0438 \u0444\u044d\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0437\u0438 ==Plot== In near-distant future, a space expedition consisting of three astronauts is sent to Mars by Roscosmos. Two of the crewmembers die on impact, leaving only their captain, Alexander Chapaev, a surviving member. He starts counting his days on the planet, aided only by a still working radio communication with Earth, as well as a robotic drone to keep him company. On Earth, all efforts to bring Alexander back home turn into quarrels between the government and the space agency, until some private investor proposes his help. However, it soon turns out to be a hoax, since the company sending Alexander subsistence for survival decides to turn his broadcast into a reality show, and is not interested in getting the astronaut back to Earth at all. Bereft of his family, Chapaev starts having mind-boggling hallucinations and meets an entity who reveals to be sentient Mars lifeform. The film ends with Chapaev not knowing what is real and what isn't anymore, while it is hinted that the whole mission was staged only to raise TV ratings among the viewers. ==Cast== * Andrey Smolyakov as Aleksandr Kovalyov * as Anna * as Pyotr Novikov * Grigory Siyatvinda as Grisha Star * as Alexey Alexeyevich * as Aleksandr Chapaev * Yevgeniya Shipova as news correspondent * Boris Moiseev as Roman Randolf * Maksim Surayev as Maksim Surayev ==Reception== The film was a clear box office bomb, grossing out only around 15 million Russian rubles ($206,000 US) on a 350 million ruble ($4,800,000 US) budget. It was considered the worst grossing movie in Russian film history, until it was surpassed by Spitak within the same year. Fond Kino has released a statement in 2019 in which it officially apologized for having allocated taxpayer income money for the production of this film (in Russia, this is not the first time a federal body allocates taxpayer money for movies that bomb in box office, and the gesture itself is infamously considered by Russians to be a part of government corruption).\u0418\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0438 2018 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430: \u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f\u0442\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0437\u043e\u0432 \u2014 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0438\u0435 \u0443\u0431\u044b\u0442\u043a\u0438 \u0438\u043d\u0434\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u044f\u0442 \u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043e 5 \u043c\u043b\u0440\u0434 \u0440\u0443\u0431 | \u041a\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b KINODATA.PRO. \u0412\u0441\u0435 \u043e \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e: \u043f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c\u043e\u0432, \u0430\u0444\u0438\u0448\u0430, \u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e, \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0437\u043e\u0440\u044b, \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u0431\u043e\u0440\u044b. ==References== == External links == * * * Forsaken on KinoPoisk Category:2018 3D films Category:2018 films Category:2010s science fiction drama films Category:2010s survival films Category:Films about astronauts Category:Films about solitude Category:Films about space hazards Category:Films set in Moscow Category:Films shot in Moscow Category:Mars in film Category:Reality television Category:Russian 3D films Category:Russian-language films Category:Russian films Category:Russian science fiction drama films Category:Space adventure films Category:2018 science fiction films Category:2018 psychological thriller films ",
