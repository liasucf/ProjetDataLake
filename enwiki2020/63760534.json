    "text": "Parmotrema barioense is a species of corticolous lichen in the family Parmeliaceae. The holotype specimen was collected in a Kerangas forest in Sarawak, Malaysia. It has a loosely attached greyish thallus measuring wide, comprising individual lobes 6\u201320 mm wide. It contains the secondary compounds atranorin, chloroatranorin, protocetraric acid, and butlerin derivatives. The lichen resembles Parmotrema zollingeri, but can be distinguished from that species by the older, convoluted lobes in the centre of the thallus, the larger ascospores, and the presence of butlerins. ==See also== *List of Parmotrema species ==References== Category:Fungi described in 1997 Category:Fungi of Asia barioense ",
