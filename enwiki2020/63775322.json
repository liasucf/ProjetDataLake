    "text": "Ada Winifred Weekes Baker (1866 1949), better known as Madame Ada Baker, was an Australian soprano, vaudeville star and singing teacher. Born in Strawberry Hills in Sydney, she moved with her family to Wagga Wagga where she taught singing lessons before moving to Sydney for further training under Albert Fisher. After a successful debut at the Promenade Concerts, held at what is now Surry Hills, she toured China and India for several years as part of the Willard Opera Company. Upon her return she joined Harry Rickards' Sydney-based vaudeville circuit and, after the company toured in Western Australia, established herself for a number of years in Perth as a singing teacher and performer. Baker moved back to Sydney in 1907 where she reestablished herself as a singing teacher and an influential part of Sydney's musical society. She gave numerous concerts and was an active fundraiser for a number of charities, later becoming a life governor of the Rachel Forster Hospital for Women and Children. She remained teaching till only a few weeks before her death at the age of 82. ==Early life and career== Baker was born on 11 August 1866 in Strawberry Hills to George Frederick Baker, auctioneer, and Sarah Wilkinson Baker, . She moved to Wagga Wagga when her father purchased the Pastoral Hotel, and whilst living there she started music classes to fund singing lessons in Sydney. Early in her career she raised \u00a350 for Wagga hospital and \u00a324/15/6 to the Lord Mayor of Sydney for survivors of the shipwreck of the Ly- ee-moon off the Green Cape Lighthouse. Baker moved to Sydney in 1886 to be a pupil of Albert Fisher. During the same year, she participated in a number of Promenade concerts, held at the Exhibition Building which was situated in Prince Alfred Park. She received favourable reviews, with The Evening News praising her debut performance, writing that: She performed in another two concerts and on her second concert The Sydney Morning Herald also praised her, writing that: Bondi Aquarium 1891 After Baker became pregnant to law clerk Charles Hall, they married on 23 April 1887 at the Congregational Church in Surrey Hills. It later came to light that Hall appeared to have married her rather reluctantly as Baker's brother threatened to \"break his head\" if he did not. The couple then had two children: Beatrice (nick-named \"Trixie\") in 1887 and Vera in 1889. Being a mother did not stop Baker from performing as in 1887 she sung in three concerts at Bondi Aquarium (at Tamarama). She later performed in M. Henri Kowalski's \"Grand Concert\" at Centennial Town Hall on October 25, 1890 as the lead soloist, singing Gioachino Rossini's \"La Carita\", and finished 1891 in the Christmas pantomime playing Zorillda in Sinbad the Sailor. Between 1891 and 1893 she toured India and China with the Willard Opera Company, playing lead for four years in a number of Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and created something of a stir in the part of Hollee Beebee in The Nautch Girl. Many years later she recounted how she gave a concert to the Maharaja of Mysore (though later she stated that it was to the Maharaja of Cooch Behar), recalling in particular that during the concert only six people were in the direct audience, and that though she could not see the women of the court she could hear them. She also claimed that after the concert she was granted the privilege of riding on the Maharajah's elephant. Upon her return from overseas, she performed in a hospital benefit at the School of Arts in North Sydney, and afterwards joined Harry Rickards' vaudeville circuit at Tivoli's theatre starting in August 1894. During the time she performed for Tivoli's she applied for divorce from Charles Hall, on the grounds of desertion starting in 1891. During the court case, her lawyer revealed that Charles had been convicted of embezzlement, and it was alleged by Hall's lawyers that Baker had been having an affair with her colleague Harry Fitzmaurice, which she vehemently denied. The judge found that there was no evidence of desertion but also found that he could not find any evidence that Baker had been unfaithful to her husband, so dismissed the case. As this was a time before no fault-divorce in Australia (which was only enacted in 1975), if neither spouse could prove fault in the marriage by the other spouse, then divorce would not be granted by the courts. Consequently, Ada and Charles never formally divorced. ==Move to Western Australia== Advertisement announcing Ada Baker's intentions to stay in Perth to teach singing. During July and August of 1898 Rickards' Tivoli company played in Western Australia. When the company returned to Sydney, Baker left them and stayed in Perth. In Perth, she established herself as a singing teacher, whilst performing with the Fremantle Orchestral Society, the Perth Musical Union, and the Lyric Club. Baker's time in Perth was not without drama, as in December 1898 she sued the proprietors of The Continental Gardens over lost wages. The case centered around Baker's assertion that when she signed her contract with the Gardens she claimed she told them she could not travel, however the company put on performances at the goldfields in the Kalgoolie and Coolgardie regions where Baker was prominently billed. When Baker learned of this, she had evidently produced a medical certificate that claimed she was too sick to travel. She vehemently denied she knew what opposing counsel meant by her not going due to \"a Coolgardie or Kalgoorlie reason\", however the defendants counter-claimed that Baker fully knew of the travel arrangements and that when she did not attend they were financially and reputationally disadvantaged by her non- appearance. Furthermore they produced a witness who claimed that Baker told them that it would inconvenience her singing business if she was to go to the fields. The court was unimpressed by Baker's claims of illness and, as the only reason she produced a medical certificate was to avoid attending the fields, decided to find against Baker. Despite this, when Baker finally left Western Australia in 1907 she had established a solid reputation, with The Bunbury Herald describing her as \"perhaps the best mezzo soprano vocalist in the State\". For many years afterwards her achievements and performances in Sydney were reported in the West Australian press. Her husband, Charlie Hall, was still living in Western Australia, but despite the fact that Baker only came to Perth with the Tivolli company, the Truth reported that \"there seemed no regret for 'the man she had left behind her.'\" ==Return to Sydney== Baker returned to Sydney in the late part of 1907, and her first performance was for the Highland Society. She quickly started a new juvenile choir at Nicolson and Co., a piano importer then situated in George St, Sydney. She had soon enrolled over 60 students, with her first concert being held in aid of the Perth Children's Hospital, where she raised over \u00a343. By March 1908 she also commenced teaching singing to young students in Marrickville, with her first concert being held on Friday, 19 June 1908 at St James Hall, in Phillip Street, Sydney. It was around this time that she began to be known as Madame Ada Baker, the earliest reference in the press to this new title being in The Sunday Times during August 1908. Baker arranged music for and led the St Cecilia Ladies' Choir in Pymble, where she raised \u00a31000 for the local branch of the British Red Cross Society during World War I. The Sydney Morning Herald said of the choir that \"Madame Ada Baker's Pymble Cecilia Ladles' Choir can fairly claim to be the original 'All-Girl' Patriotic Entertainers.\" The choir performed a variety of concerts, including the play The Princess of Poppyland, by C. King Proctor, and the cantata The Hours, by Shapcott Wensley. Over the years, Baker was a prolific fundraiser. She raised money for the Sydney Hospital, assisted with fundraising for the Protestant Orphan's Fair, the Callan Park Hospital for the Insane, the Sydney Mission to Seamen, the Sydney Night Refuge for destitute men, the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, and a number of other charities. Baker showed a particular enthusiasm towards raising funds for the Rachel Forster Hospital for Women and Children, for which she was made a life governor in 1927, and from 1925 to 1932 raised \u00a3500 for a permanent cot. In 1932 she raised a further \u00a3140 for the hospital. Baker also arranged and performed in numerous concerts, recitals and eisteddfods, including a performance of Stephen Vost Janssen's concert The Rajah's Ruby (in 1921) and operetta The Lucky Dream (in 1930), Arthur A. Penn's light comic opera In Old Havana (in 1928) and The China Shop (in 1937), Franz von Supp\u00e9's opera Boccaccio (in 1933), Paul Lac\u00f4me's op\u00e9ra comique Ma Mie Rosette (in 1935), and Robert Planquette's op\u00e9ra comique Les Cloches de Corneville (in 1939). Starting in mid 1925, Baker arranged radio programmes and had her juvenile students broadcast over the radio, normally on 2FC. ==Later life== Baker continued working throughout her life and remained deeply involved in teaching children how to sing. In March 1933 she was elected to the executive of the Australian Music Teachers' Alliance and on 25 November was elected vice-president. She was reelected to this position in 1934 and 1935. She gave two lectures for the Music Teachers' Alliance: the first in July 1934 was on \"The Training of Children's Voices\" and the second, given in August 1938, was on English music of the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries. By 1939 she had become an active member of the Nothing Under Seventy club, whose members were exclusively seventy years of age and above, regularly giving performances and remaining involved in charity work with the other members. She continued to raise funds for charity. In 1945, after one of her grandchildren died in the RAF, she setup the \"Grandmothers' Victory Bond League\" to aid funding for Australia's fight in the Second World War. This, she said, would \"give grandmothers a chance to do what they can to help fill the Third Victory Loan\". Baker worked till she was 82, but retired after she was injured in a motor vehicle accident. Upon her retirement, over 60 students and former pupils arranged a testimonial concert for her to be held at Sydney Town Hall. The concert was held on Thursday 14 July 1949, but she was too sick to attend. She died at her Pymble home on 24 July 1949. Services were held at St. Swithen's Church in Pymble, and she was interred at Northern Suburbs Crematorium. Ada Baker Street in Forde, Australian Capital Territory is named in her honour. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1866 births Category:1949 deaths Category:Australian sopranos ",
