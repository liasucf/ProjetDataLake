He counts with a postgraduate degree on public management from FLACSO and a master's degree on public administration from the University of Buenos Aires School of Economics. ==Political career== Katopodis's public service career began in 2003, during the presidency of N\u00e9stor Kirchner, when he worked in the Ministry of Social Development. From 2005 to 2008 he was Undersecretary of Operation Co- ordination in the provincial Ministry of Social Development of Buenos Aires Province under Governor Felipe Sol\u00e1. In 2007 he ran for the mayoralty of General San Mart\u00edn, losing in the primaries against incumbent mayor Ricardo Ivoskus. ===Intendencia of General San Mart\u00edn=== In 2011, Katopodis ran for the mayoralty of San Mart\u00edn for a second time, this time against Daniel Ivoskus, the incumbent mayor's son. Katopodis won in an upset victory by just 7 percentage points. He ran under the Frente Social ticket, aligning himself to the ruling Front for Victory. Katopodis was re-elected for a second term in 2015, this time beating former mayor Ricardo Ivoskus.

He assumed the position alongside the rest of the cabinet on 10 December 2019. His deputy in the mayoralty, Fernando Moreira, took his position as intendente upon his appointment in the ministry. In 2020 he denounced that the previous administration had amassed a $ 35,000-million debt on public works, and up to 60% of all ongoing works were completely paralyzed. Katopodis stated that due to the accumulated debt, the ministry's priorities would be federal integration, job creation, and the completion of ongoing works. ==Personal life== Katopodis is married to Nancy Cappelloni, a school teacher and politician, with whom he has two children. Since the 1980s the Katopodis household has lived in San Mart\u00edn, part of the Greater Buenos Aires metropolitan area.
