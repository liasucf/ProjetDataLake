The Billboard Book of No. 1 Adult Contemporary Hits (Billboard Publications) It was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category Best Male Pop Vocal performance. The three verses of the song are each a plea from the narrator to a woman whom he hopes will join him in, respectively, Boston, Denver, and Los Angeles, with each verse concluding: \"She said 'No \u2013 boy would you come home to me'\"; the woman's sentiment is elaborated on in the chorus which concludes with the line: \"I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee.\" Tennessee is the home state of Dave Loggins, who has said of \"Please Come to Boston\" \u2013 \"The story is almost true, except there wasn't anyone waiting so I made her up. In effect, making the longing for [a companion] stronger. It was a recap to my first trip to each of those cities...[and] how I saw each one. The fact of having no one to come home to made the chorus easy to write. Some forty years later, I still vividly remember that night [of composition], and it was as if someone else was writing the song.\" ==Chart performance== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1974) !Peak position |- | Australia (Kent Music Report) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|47 |- |Canadian RPM Top Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|4 |- |Canadian RPM Adult Contemporary Tracks | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- |U.S. Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|5 |- |U.S. Billboard Easy Listening | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |} ==Covers== The song has been covered numerous times, most notably by country music singer David Allan Coe and folk singer Joan Baez, who actually began her career in the Boston-Cambridge area and included the song on her 1976 live album From Every Stage: like other female singers performing \"Please Come to Boston\", Baez sings from the perspective of the woman refusing the invitations.
