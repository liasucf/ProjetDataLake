The game serves as a direct sequel to Dungeon Hunter 4 which ended amidst the dying Valenthia city state. Dungeon Hunter 5 is an online game that requires an internet connection in order to play. ==Gameplay== The basic gameplay of Dungeon Hunter 5 shares some similarities to its predecessor, Dungeon Hunter 4, such as picking up loot, using skill attacks and using potions. However, unlike its predecessor, the game is not an open-world nor exploration, but rather a level-based dungeons that have a series of difficulties. As the hero progresses, he/she will encounter even stronger enemies which puts his/her skill to the test. Dungeon Hunter 5 doesn't also feature and contain a class system, instead picking off a starter type of weapon in the beginning in the game. The player character can also add friends though they can no longer co-op in missions. There is also an energy system which restricts the players from performing too many dungeons. Aside from these main features, there is also a new mode called Stronghold in which player characters can collect minions to place them inside the stronghold. A new type of currency called quartz is also featured and can be used for fusing minions. If a player fought and raids another player, his/her shield will switch off thus making him/her vulnerable from other players. This has a level up ranks which forces the players to fight even more powerful players across their strongholds. There is also a trophy system in which the player can gain trophies by winning, but it can decrease if he/she lost the raid attempt. The loot system has also been expanded, not just the melee weapons, ranged weapons and armor body parts, but also the evolution items, skill weapons, backpacks and belts. A new fusion system has also been implemented in which players can pick an item and fuse it with unequipped or unwanted ones. Prior to the loot and fusion system, there is an evolution system where the item's level is maxed out, the player can use evolution materials to evolve them. ==Setting== Dungeon Hunter 5 is primarily set in the shattered world called Valenthia, the same as were the previous game was set. The city overall is more detailed and has much better shadows than its predecessor. ==Rail accident== Prosecution says that the dispatcher causing the Bad Aibling rail accident, leaving 12 people dead and 89 injured, played Dungeon Hunter 5 on his smartphone during work. ==References== Category:IOS games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Universal Windows Platform apps Category:2015 video games Category:Windows Phone games Category:Gameloft games Category:Action role-playing video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Video games featuring protagonists of selectable gender Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games using procedural generation Category:Windows games Category:Video games developed in Canada ",
