    "text": "\"I'm Jealous\" is a song written by Ike Turner and Jane Bossung. It was released by R&B; duo Ike & Tina Turner on Sue Records in January 1961. The record was the third single from the duo's debut album The Soul of Ike & Tina Turner. == Critical reception == The single was chosen as Cash Box's Pick of the Week. Cash Box (February 4, 1961): \"Twosome, having clicked with 'A Fool In Love' and 'I Idolize You,' seem to have their third-in-a-row dual mart'er in 'I'm Jealous.' It\u2019s a shufflin' blueser featuring Tina at her wailing best. Ike's instrumentalists and the gal chorus lend a solid backdrop. The coupler, 'You're My Baby,' is another rhythmic shuffler with loads of appeal.\" Billboard (January 30, 1961): \"Two solid sides. On top, the gal half of the duo goes it alone on a wonderfully effective gospel-inspired performance. Much excitement here. The flip features the duo on a good blues-based ballad. Either side here with an edge to the first. Sides also have pop potential.\" == Chart performance == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Chart !Peak position |- |US Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|117 |- |US Cash Box Top 100 |align=\"center\"|83 |- |US Cash Box Top 50 R&B; |align=\"center\"|43 |} == References == Category:1961 singles Category:1961 songs Category:Ike & Tina Turner songs Category:Songs written by Ike Turner Category:Song recordings produced by Ike Turner Category:Sue Records singles ",
