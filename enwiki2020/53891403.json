    "text": "Amino acid replacement is a change from one amino acid to a different amino acid in a protein due to point mutation in the corresponding DNA sequence. It is caused by nonsynonymous missense mutation which changes the codon sequence to code other amino acid instead of the original. == Conservative and radical replacements == Not all amino acid replacements have the same effect on function or structure of protein. The magnitude of this process may vary depending on how similar or dissimilar the replaced amino acids are, as well as on their position in the sequence or the structure. Similarity between amino acids can be calculated based on substitution matrices, physico-chemical distance, or simple properties such as amino acid size or charge (see also amino acid chemical properties). Usually amino acids are thus classified into two types: * Conservative replacement - an amino acid is exchanged into another that has similar properties. This type of replacement is expected to rarely result in dysfunction in the corresponding protein . * Radical replacement - an amino acid is exchanged into another with different properties. This can lead to changes in protein structure or function, which can cause potentially lead to changes in phenotype, sometimes pathogenic. A well known example in humans is sickle cell anemia, due to a mutation in beta globin where at position 6 glutamic acid (negatively charged) is exchanged with valine (not charged). == Physicochemical distances == Physicochemical distance is a measure that assesses the difference between replaced amino acids. The value of distance is based on properties of amino acids. There are 134 physicochemical properties that can be used to estimate similarity between amino acids. Each physicochemical distance is based on different composition of properties. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Properties of amino acids employed for estimating overall similarity |Two-state characters |Properties |- |1-5 |Presence respectively of: \u03b2\u2015CH2, \u03b3\u2015CH2, \u03b4\u2015CH2 (proline scored as positive), \u03b5\u2015CH2 group and a\u2015CH3 group |- |6-10 |Presence respectively of: \u03c9\u2015SH, \u03c9\u2015COOH, \u03c9\u2015NH2 (basic), \u03c9\u2015CONH2 and \u2015CHOH groups |- |11-15 |Presence respectively of: benzene ring (including tryptophan as positive), branching in side chain by a CH group, a second CH3 group, two but not three \u2015H groups at the ends of the side chain (proline scored as positive) and a C\u2015S\u2015C group |- |16-20 |Presence respectively of: guanido group, \u03b1\u2015NH2, \u03b1\u2015NH group in ring, \u03b4\u2015NH group in ring, \u2015N= group in ring |- |21-25 |Presence respectively of: \u2015CH=N, indolyl group, imidazole group, C=O group in side chain, and configuration at \u03b1\u2015C potentially changing direction of the peptide chain (only proline scores positive) |- |26-30 |Presence respectively of: sulphur atom, primary aliphatic \u2015OH group, secondary aliphatic \u2015OH group, phenolic \u2015OH group, ability to form S\u2015S bridges |- |31-35 |Presence respectively of: imidazole \u2015NH group, indolyl \u2015NH group, \u2015SCH3 group, a second optical centre, the N=CR\u2015NH group |- |36-40 |Presence respectively of: isopropyl group, distinct aromatic reactivity, strong aromatic reactivity, terminal positive charge, negative charge at high pH (tyrosine scored positive) |- |41 |Presence of pyrollidine ring |- |42-53 |Molecular weight (approximate) of side chain, scored in 12 additive steps (sulphur counted as the equivalent of two carbon, nitrogen or oxygen atoms) |- |54-56 |Presence, respectively, of: flat 5-, 6- and 9-membered ring system |- |57-64 |pK at isoelectric point, scored additively in steps of 1 pH |- |65-68 |Logarithm of solubility in water of the \u029f-isomer in mg/100 ml., scored additively |- |69-70 |Optical rotation in 5 \u0274-HCl, [\u03b1]D 0 to -25, and over -25, respectively |- |71-72 |Optical rotation in 5 \u0274-HCI, [\u03b1] 0 to +25, respectively (values for glutamine and tryptophan with water as solvent, and for asparagine 3\u00b74 \u0274-HCl) |- |73-74 |Side-chain hydrogen bonding (ionic type), strong donor and strong acceptor, respectively |- |75-76 |Side-chain hydrogen bonding (neutral type), strong donor and strong acceptor, respectively |- |77-78 |Water structure former, respectively moderate and strong |- |79 |Water structure breaker |- |80-82 |Mobile electrons few, moderate and many, respectively (scored additively) |- |83-85 |Heat and age stability moderate, high and very high, respectively (scored additively) |- |86-89 |RF in phenol- water paper chromatography in steps of 0\u00b72 (scored additively) |- |90-93 |RF in toluene-pyridine-glycolchlorhydrin (paper chromatography of DNP-derivative) in steps of 0\u00b72 (scored additively: for lysine the di-DNP derivative) |- |94-97 |Ninhydrin colour after collidine-lutidine chromatography and heating 5 min at 100 \u00b0C, respectively purple, pink, brown and yellow |- |98 |End of side-chain furcated |- |99-101 |Number of substituents on the \u03b2-carbon atom, respectively 1, 2 or 3 (scored additively) |- |102-111 |The mean number of lone pair electrons on the side-chain (scored additively) |- |112-115 |Number of bonds in the side-chain allowing rotation (scored additively) |- |116-117 |Ionic volume within rings slight, or moderate (scored additively) |- |118-124 |Maximum moment of inertia for rotation at the \u03b1\u2015\u03b2 bond (scored additively in seven approximate steps) |- |125-131 |Maximum moment of inertia for rotation at the \u03b2\u2015\u03b3 bond (scored additively in seven approximate steps) |- |132-134 |Maximum moment of inertia for rotation at the \u03b3\u2015\u03b4 bond (scored additively in three approximate steps) |} === Grantham's distance === Grantham's distance depends on three properties: composition, polarity and molecular volume.

Typical amino acids and their alternatives usually have similar physicochemical properties. Leucine is an example of a typical amino acid. * Idiosyncratic amino acids - there are few similar amino acids that they can mutate to through single nucleotide substitution. In this case most amino acid replacements will be disruptive for protein function. Tryptophan is an example of an idiosyncratic amino acid. == Tendency to undergo amino acid replacement == Some amino acids are more likely to be replaced. One of the factors that influences this tendency is physicochemical distance. Example of a measure of amino acid can be Graur's Stability Index. The assumption of this measure is that the amino acid replacement rate and protein's evolution is dependent on the amino acid composition of protein. Stability index S of an amino acid is calculated based on physicochemical distances of this amino acid and its alternatives than can mutate through single nucleotide substitution and probabilities to replace into these amino acids. Based on Grantham's distance the most immutable amino acid is cysteine, and the most prone to undergo exchange is methionine. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Example of calculating stability index for Methionine coded by AUG based on Grantham's physicochemical distance !Alternative codons !Alternative amino acids !Probabilities !Grantham's distances !Average distance |- |AUU, AUC, AUA |Isoleucine |1/3 |10 |3.33 |- |ACG |Threonine |1/9 |81 |9.00 |- |AAG |Lysine |1/9 |95 |10.56 |- |AGG |Arginine |1/9 |91 |10.11 |- |UUG, CUG |Leucine |2/9 |15 |3.33 |- |GUG |Valine |1/9 |21 |2.33 |- ! colspan=\"4\" |Stability index |38.67 |} == Patterns of amino acid replacement == Evolution of proteins is slower than DNA since only nonsynonymous mutations in DNA can result in amino acid replacements. Most mutations are neutral to maintain protein function and structure. Therefore, the more similar amino acids are, the more probable that they will be replaced. Conservative replacements are more common than radical replacements, since they can result in less important phenotypic changes. On the other hand, beneficial mutations, enhancing protein functions are most likely to be radical replacements. Also, the physicochemical distances, which are based on amino acids properties, are negatively correlated with probability of amino acids substitutions. Smaller distance between amino acids indicates that they are more likely to undergo replacement. == References == Category:Amino acids Category:Biochemistry ",
