    "text": "WASP-31b is a low-density (puffy) \"hot Jupiter\" extrasolar planet orbiting the metal-poor (63% of solar metallicity) dwarf star WASP-31. The exoplanet was discovered in 2010 by the WASP project. WASP-31b is in the constellation of Crater, and is about 1305 light-years (light travel distance) from Earth. ==Characteristics== WASP-31b is a low-density (puffy) \"hot Jupiter\" exoplanet with a mass about 0.48 times that of Jupiter and a radius about 1.55 times that of Jupiter. The exoplanet orbits WASP-31, its host star, every 3.4 days. thumb|center|400px|Comparison of \"hot Jupiter\" exoplanets, including WASP-31b (top row; 3rd from left) (artist concept) From top left to lower right: WASP-12b, WASP-6b, WASP-31b, WASP-39b, HD 189733b, HAT-P-12b, WASP-17b, WASP-19b, HAT-P-1b and HD 209458b. In 2012, it was found from Rossiter\u2013McLaughlin effect what WASP-31b orbit is orbiting the parent star in prograde direction, with WASP-31 star rotational axis inclined to planetary orbit by 2.8 degrees. The spectroscopic study in 2014 have revealed the WASP-31b have a dense cloud deck overlaid by hazy atmosphere.The atmosphere of hot-Jupiter exoplanet WASP-31b WASP-31b was also reported to have significant amounts of potassium in upper atmosphere, but detection of potassium was refuted in 2015. The potassium detection discrepancy was resolved in 2020 with the improved cloud deck model,J. Chouqar, M. L. Morales, A. Daassou, A. Jabiri, Z. Benkhaldoun, Bruce G. Elmegreen, L. Viktor T\u00f3th, Manuel G\u00fcdel, \"Modeling the Transmission Spectra of WASP-31b\" with best fit being very small amount of water over clouds and no potassium at all. ==See also== * WASP-6b * WASP-17b * WASP-19b * WASP-39b * WASP-121b ==References== ==External links== Category:Exoplanets discovered by WASP Category:Exoplanets discovered in 2010 Category:Giant planets Category:Hot Jupiters Category:Crater (constellation) ",
