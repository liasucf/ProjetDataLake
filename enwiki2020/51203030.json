Next to the Yelachenahalli Metro station, stands the electrical switch yard for the metro line. This area was earlier occupied by Shravanthi Kalyana Mantapa. The land was acquired by Namma Metro to build the Yelachenahalli Metro Station. The station also serves the residents of Reserve Bank Layout, Kumaraswamy Layout, ISRO Layout and neighborhoods beyond Konanakunte, like Kaggalipura. The metro station was initially named Puttenahalli Metro station. The station being closer to Yelachenahalli than Puttenahalli, was renamed to Yelachenahalli metro station in July 2016.http://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/others/Puttenahalli- metro-station-renamed-as-Yelachenahalli/articleshow/53345302.cms ==References== Category:Namma Metro stations Category:Railway stations in Bangalore ",
