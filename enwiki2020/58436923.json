However, it does recommend countries to continue to monitor potential cases and to carefully record any unusual patterns. === European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control === After the confirmed case in the United Kingdom, the ECDC repeated their risk assessment that close contacts of confirmed cases must be monitored for symptoms for at least 14 days after the last exposure. The organization also repeated that cases of the syndrome were not unexpected and had been observed in Europe before, and the risk of transmission to the general population from the confirmed case was extremely low. ==See also== *COVID-19 pandemic == References == Category:2018 health disasters Category:August 2018 events in Asia Category:Middle East respiratory syndrome Category:September 2018 events in Asia Category:2018 in Saudi Arabia Category:Disease outbreaks in Saudi Arabia Category:2010s disease outbreaks ",
