Do you not know this post? It is the brave post of the teacher. That post is in its joy, When its beneficial effects Reach back to people. Work and free action Will soon end the scorn, Which was till now mostly its reward. It hated and hates idleness, Because it only loves diligence and order. Gladly it carries the heavy burden, Is patient and never saddened, Not even when oppressed by poverty, And the family lacking bread. It was often the mockery of the foolish, But never lost generosity, Trusting firmly in God, Who is and remains his greatest good. Always serious and modest Remaining even in joy and pain. Do you know the post which wakes up the mind, Makes the child fit for life, It was often rewarded with disgrace Ridiculed by fools. Listen! This is the post of the teacher, Which is so useful for the fatherland. For the welfare and happiness of people Fight further, you brave post! Your fate will change In a better fatherland, Where you will receive from God's Son Your reward shortened on earth. |} == Music == The 84-bar long work in E-flat major is scored for choir and voice quartet.
