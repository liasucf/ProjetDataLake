Sj\u00f3nvarp S\u00edmans broadcasts both Icelandic and foreign television shows. Since its foundation in 1999 it has aired crime, drama, reality and comedy television series. It is distributed by analogue over-the- air broadcast signal and also digitally via S\u00edminn and Vodafone IPTV and Vodafone Digital \u00cdsland. Sj\u00f3nvarp S\u00edmans used to be free to anyone living in Iceland but switched to a premium subscription channel in 2009. In 2015, after Skipti, the former parent company of S\u00edminn and Skj\u00e1rinn, merged with S\u00edminn, the channel switched to a mixed subscription model. Watching the linear broadcast is free but a subscription option called Sj\u00f3nvarp S\u00edmans Premium offers more content then the linear broadcast, such as a library of old shows and series, shows what have not been aired in the linear broadcast, movies and more. On 1 June 2016, the channel's name was changed from Skj\u00e1rEinn to Sj\u00f3nvarp S\u00edmans, to reflect the revolution the channel and S\u00edminn itself had been through since the merger of S\u00edminn and its sister companies. ==See also== * R\u00daV * St\u00f6\u00f0 2 ==References== Category:Television channels in Iceland Category:Television channels and stations established in 1999 Category:Companies based in Reykjav\u00edk Category:1999 establishments in Iceland ",
