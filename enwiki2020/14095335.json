The history of \u017belazno/Eisersdorf goes back to the 13th century when it was part of an ancient trade route called the Amber Road. The settlement was first mentioned as Eyserzdorf in 1326. The settlement's prosperous medieval history left its legacy, which can be seen to this day. The village also features a 15th-century Gothic tower, an 18th-century palace and a manor house that once belonged to the famous M\u00fcnchhausen aristocratic family. Prior to 1945 Eisersdorf was part of Germany and after World War II it was renamed \u017belazno upon being transferred to Poland. ==Gallery== File:2015 Pa\u0142ac w \u017bela\u017anie 04.JPG|\u017belazno Palace File:2015 Wie\u017ca mieszkalna w \u017bela\u017anie 04.JPG|15th-century medieval tower File:2016 Dw\u00f3r von M\u00fcnchhausen\u00f3w w \u017bela\u017anie 01.jpg|Manor house of the M\u00fcnchhausens File:2017 Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015bw.
