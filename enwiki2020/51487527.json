Spackman left school at the age of thirteen, and took his first job running errands for printers. In time, he became a printer himself, and joined the National Union of Printing and Paper Workers. This merged into the National Union of Printing, Bookbinding, Machine Ruling and Paper Workers, and Spackman became chair of its London Central branch, then secretary of the union's printing and paper-making section. When the union was reorganised, he became its organising secretary, then in 1939 he was elected as general secretary.Trades Union Congress, \"Obituary: E. W. Spackman\", Annual Report of the 1956 Trades Union Congress, p.312 Spackman was also a member of the executive of the Printing and Kindred Trades Federation, chairing it for some years, and also served as chair of the Printing Trades Joint Industrial Council.
