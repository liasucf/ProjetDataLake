    "text": "The Philharmonia Chorus is an independent self-governing symphony chorus based in London, UK. The Chorus Master is Gavin Carr. == Foundation == The Philharmonia Chorus was founded in 1957 by Walter Legge as a choral counterpart to the Philharmonia Orchestra which he had founded twelve years earlier. The Chorus\u2019s first concert, a performance on 12 November 1957 of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, completed a cycle of Beethoven symphonies in London\u2019s Royal Festival Hall with the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Otto Klemperer and was recorded with the same performers. To create his chorus, Legge turned to Wilhelm Pitz, then chorus master of the Bayreuth Festival. Between the first rehearsal in February 1957 and first concert there was a long period of preparation during which Pitz rehearsed the Chorus in not only the scheduled Beethoven but also in choral passages from Wagner\u2019s Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg. From that preparatory work emerged a chorus unique for its blend of the British choral tradition and German musical training and discipline, and for a dramatic quality found more typically in opera than in a symphony chorus. The full yet homogeneous and professionally disciplined sound immediately attracted critical notice. == Early years == Under Legge\u2019s management and Pitz\u2019s training the Chorus worked with many of the most distinguished conductors of the time: Wolfgang Sawallisch, Sir Thomas Beecham, Herbert von Karajan, Leopold Stokowski, Sir John Barbirolli, Sir Adrian Boult and - in a relationship that became especially close - Carlo Maria Giulini. Benchmark recordings of Lucia di Lammermoor with Maria Callas and Tullio Serafin, Sir William Walton conducting his own Belshazzar's Feast, Brahms Ein deutsches Requiem, Beethoven\u2019s Fidelio and Mahler\u2019s Second Symphony under Klemperer, and Verdi Requiem and Quattro Pezzi Sacri with Giulini won particular acclaim. Tours followed to the Edinburgh Festival, to Lucerne, and with Giulini to Parma where the audience in the Teatro Regio paid it the remarkable compliment of showering carnations on this British chorus singing Verdi to Italians. == Self-governance == When Legge relinquished management in 1964, the re-formed New Philharmonia Chorus became a self-governing body independent of the Philharmonia Orchestra with a Council of Management of twelve Directors elected by the members, a system of governance which remains in place today. The first concert of both New Philharmonia Orchestra and New Philharmonia Chorus took place on 27 October 1964, a performance of Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony again conducted by Klemperer. In succeeding years the Chorus performed and recorded works with further renowned conductors: Lorin Maazel, George Szell, Daniel Barenboim and Rafael Fr\u00fchbeck de Burgos (notable recordings of Mendelssohn\u2019s Elijah, Orff\u2019s Carmina Burana and Haydn's Die Sch\u00f6pfung), and further collaborations with Walton, Benjamin Britten conducting his Spring Symphony, and a landmark performance, later released on LP and then CD, of Britten\u2019s War Requiem conducted by Giulini, with Britten himself conducting the chamber ensemble. During the 1960s the Chorus was considered by many critics to be the finest symphony chorus in the UK and perhaps also in Europe. On his retirement in 1971, Wilhelm Pitz was succeeded as Chorus Master by Walter Hagen-Groll (from the Deutsche Oper of West Berlin), in 1975 by Norbert Balatsch (chorus master of both the Vienna State Opera and the Bayreuth Festival), in 1980 by Heinz Mende (former chorus master of the Chor des Bayerischen Rundfunks in Munich), and then in 1984 by Horst Neumann (chorus master of the MDR Rundfunkchor). == Re-instatement of the original name == On 1 September 1977 the Chorus was able to take back its former name, Philharmonia Chorus, and later the same month gave two performances of Mahler\u2019s Eighth Symphony in Belgium with the similarly reinstated Philharmonia Orchestra under Michael Tilson Thomas. These years saw the Chorus tour widely throughout Europe: several staged operas in the Roman Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Antique d\u2019Orange, Haydn\u2019s Die Sch\u00f6pfung in Paris and London to celebrate the UK\u2019s entry into the European Economic Community in 1973, Handel\u2019s Judas Maccabeus with Sir Charles Mackerras at the Teatro alla Scala Milan in 1980 followed ten years later by a second appearance at La Scala in Bach\u2019s Mass in B minor under Giulini. A 1979 recording of Mozart\u2019s Requiem with the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Giulini won the 1981 Grammy Award for Best Choral Performance. In the UK there were engagements with Riccardo Muti, Sir Georg Solti, Lovro von Mata\u010di\u0107, Giuseppe Sinopoli (appointed Principal Conductor of the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1984 and with whom the Chorus appeared in Parma and Taormina), Rafael Kubelik, Kurt Sanderling (including the Chorus' second recording of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony), Sir Andrew Davis, Seiji Ozawa, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Bernard Haitink, Charles Dutoit, and in 1980 the Chorus's first appearance at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden in a performance of Verdi\u2019s Requiem at the Rudolf Kempe Memorial Concert. A second appearance in the same House six years later in Britten\u2019s War Requiem with the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Simon Rattle was a Memorial Concert for Sir Peter Pears. These years also saw the Chorus appearing regularly in the UK outside London with notable visits to Cardiff, Brighton, Nottingham, Derby, Cheltenham, Cambridge and Aldeburgh. At Aldeburgh in 1985 the Chorus gave the world premi\u00e8re of Britten's unfinished final composition Praise We Great Men, with the Philharmonia Orchestra under Mstislav Rostropovich, and three years later took part in a semi-staged performance of Britten's Paul Bunyan. Two years later in 1988 a particular honour was paid the Chorus: an invitation to perform in Mahler\u2019s Eighth Symphony in Amsterdam\u2019s Concertgebouw to mark the 100th Anniversary of the Concertgebouw Orchestra and concert hall, the hall\u2019s re-opening after renovations, and Bernard Haitink\u2019s last concerts as chief conductor of the Concertgebouw Orchestra. == New horizons == In 1992 David Hill became Chorus Master and Artistic Director. Director of Music at Westminster Cathedral and later at Winchester Cathedral, he was the first Briton to hold the post. He was succeeded in 1998 by Robert Dean, formerly Head of Music at Scottish Opera and Professor of Singing at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama. In these years the Chorus performed Rachmaninov\u2019s Vespers in Westminster and Winchester Cathedrals and recorded it, accompanied Luciano Pavarotti \u201cin the Park\u201d and at Leeds Castle, remixed Beatles numbers, and performed before HM The Queen for the 50th Anniversary of VE Day. At London's Royal Festival Hall, its traditional home, the Chorus appeared regularly with Claus Peter Flor and the Philharmonia Orchestra's then Principal Guest Conductor, Leonard Slatkin. In December 1997 the Chorus celebrated its 40th Birthday with its patron The Prince of Wales in attendance at a Gala performance of Verdi\u2019s Requiem with the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by James Levine, followed three days later by a performance of Mahler\u2019s Eighth Symphony with the same conductor. During this period the Chorus performed for the first time with Valery Gergiev and Sir Mark Elder. Several European tours of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony followed with Giulini and the European Community Youth Orchestra, with Sir Yehudi Menuhin and the Sinfonia Varsovia, and in December 1999 with Sir Simon Rattle and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, culminating in a Millennium Concert broadcast by BBC Television from Ely Cathedral. Other overseas tours took place to Strasbourg, the first visit to the US (to Baltimore), and in 2000 the Chorus was invited to perform in the Vatican's Paul VI Audience Hall for Pope John Paul II on his 80th birthday. In autumn 2002 the Chorus joined the orchestra and chorus of Norddeutscher Rundfunk and the BBC Singers in the presence of the President of Germany Johannes Rau and former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev for a concert of reconciliation, Britten\u2019s War Requiem conducted by Mstislav Rostropovich, performed in the Turbine Hall of the former Nazi rocket development factory in Peenem\u00fcnde, north Germany. In 2004, following a semi-staged concert performance of Weber\u2019s Der Freisch\u00fctz at the Edinburgh Festival the previous year, Sir Charles Mackerras agreed to become the Chorus\u2019s first President, which post he held until his death in 2010. The 50th anniversary was celebrated in June 2007 with a performance of Verdi\u2019s Requiem with the Philharmonia Orchestra under Riccardo Muti in the presence of their Patron The Prince of Wales. In Autumn 2008 Edward Caswell became Artistic Director, training the Chorus for a performance of Bernstein\u2019s Kaddish Symphony in London\u2019s Barbican Centre conducted by John Axelrod in a concert to mark the 70th Anniversary of Kristallnacht. == Recent developments == In April 2010 the Philharmonia Chorus returned to its tradition of German musical training with the appointment as Chorus Master of the Berlin-based conductor Stefan Bevier who was himself also a singer as well as being a former player with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Earlier the same year was launched the Philharmonia Chorus Professional Singer Scheme, through which specially auditioned professional singers in the early years of their career join a pool, to be drawn on when required. Then in 2013 was launched the Student Singer Scheme to attract to the Chorus as members young singers with potential to progress to a professional career. The resultant choral make-up thus blends amateur singers with student and professional singers. The Chorus\u2019s performing repertory continues to combine new or seldom heard works with choral staples. The Chorus gave the London premi\u00e8re of Jeajoon Ryu\u2019s Sinfonia da Requiem with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and the world premi\u00e8re of John Powell\u2019s A Prussian Requiem with the Philharmonia Orchestra. The Chorus\u2019s several appearances at the \u201cEaster at King\u2019s\u201d Festival conducted by Stephen Cleobury and broadcast by BBC Radio from King\u2019s College Chapel Cambridge have included James MacMillan\u2019s recently composed St John Passion in the presence of the composer, Frank Martin\u2019s Golgotha in the presence of the composer\u2019s widow, and Herbert Howells\u2019s Stabat Mater. Opera in concert performances have included Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder, Fidelio and Die Fledermaus. There have been recordings with Benjamin Zander of Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony and Mahler\u2019s Second Symphony. Performances including Brahms\u2019s Ein deutsches Requiem, Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony and Missa solemnis, Mahler\u2019s Second and Eighth Symphonies, Britten\u2019s War Requiem and Verdi\u2019s Requiem have been given with conductors including Christoph von Dohn\u00e1nyi, Charles Dutoit, Daniele Gatti, Daniel Harding, Vladimir Jurowski, Lorin Maazel, Paul McCreesh, Andris Nelsons, Gianandrea Noseda, Vasily Petrenko and Esa-Pekka Salonen. The Chorus has also performed in live showings of the films Amadeus, Breakfast at Tiffany's and Gladiator. A performance in Hamburg of Elgar\u2019s The Dream of Gerontius conducted by Sir Jeffrey Tate, a former member of the Chorus, led to his appointment as President, which position he held until his death in 2017. The Chorus has continued to tour abroad, performing in Germany at the Rheingau Festival, and in Spain and France, with several appearances in Valencia with the Orquesta de Valencia conducted by Yaron Traub and in Lille with the Orchestre National de Lille including a cycle of Mahler Symphonies under Alexandre Bloch and Poulenc's late work Sept r\u00e9pons des T\u00e9n\u00e8bres. Other highlights have included performances of Berlioz\u2019s Grande Messe des morts with the Orchestre National de Lyon under Leonard Slatkin in Lyon and in the composer\u2019s birthplace of La C\u00f4te-St-Andr\u00e9, and Beethoven\u2019s Missa solemnis under Sir Jeffrey Tate in the opening festival of Hamburg\u2019s remarkable new Elbphilharmonie, the Chorus being the sole British group to be so featured. The Chorus's 60th Anniversary in November 2017 was celebrated with a performance of Walton\u2019s Belshazzar\u2019s Feast with the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Edward Gardner. Following Stefan Bevier's sudden death in January 2018, another singer and conductor, Gavin Carr, was appointed Chorus Master. Before Covid-19 brought activity to a halt Gavin had prepared the Chorus for performances in London, Bath and Lille, a particular highlight being the performance of Berlioz's Grande Messe des morts with the Philharmonia Orchestra in St Paul's Cathedral under John Nelson to mark the sesquicentenary of the composer's death. The Chorus has a full programme in waiting as soon as Covid-19 allows, including appearances in London, King's College Cambridge and Lille. == Chorus Masters == 1957-1971 Wilhelm Pitz 1971-1975 Walter Hagen-Groll 1975-1980 Norbert Balatsch 1980-1983 Heinz Mende 1984-1992 Horst Neumann 1992-1998 David Hill (Artistic Director) 1998-2007 Robert Dean (Artistic Director) 2008-2010 Edward Caswell (Artistic Director) 2010-2018 Stefan Bevier 2018 Gavin Carr == Accompanists == The Chorus has had four Accompanists: first, Viola Tunnard, followed in 1962 by her duet partner Martin Penny, both collaborators with Britten at Aldeburgh.
