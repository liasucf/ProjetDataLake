    "text": "Heworth ARLFC is an amateur rugby league football club based in Heworth, York. The first team plays in the NCL Division Three. In 1986, the club was one of ten founder members of the BARLA National Amateur League (now known as the National Conference League), and were the winners of the inaugural 1986\u201387 season. Heworth has produced many players who went on to play the game professionally, most notably former internationals Geoff Wriglesworth, Kenneth Bowman, Colin Forsyth, David Watkinson and Gary Divorty. The club went into decline following their success in the early years of the league, and in 2012 were demoted to NCL Division Three after failing to fulfill one of their fixtures. In 2015, the club withdrew from the National Conference League altogether due to a lack of playing strength. The club returned to the National Conference League in 2019. ==Honours== * National Conference League Premier Division ** Winners (1): 1986\u201387 * National Conference League Division One ** Winners (1): 1993\u201394 * BARLA Yorkshire Cup ** Winners (1): 1993\u201394 ==References== ==External links== *Club website *Club information on NCL website Category:BARLA teams Category:Sport in York Category:Rugby clubs established in 1922 Category:1922 establishments in England Category:Rugby league teams in North Yorkshire ",
