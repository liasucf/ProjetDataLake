    "text": "Cerdocyonina is an extant subtribe of canids exclusively endemic to the Americas. Often described to be \"fox-like\" in appearance and behavior, they are more closely related to the wolf-like canids such as Canis than they are to the fox genus Vulpes. Its members are colloquially known as the South American canids. ==Taxonomy== Prior to the 1990s there have been different systematic hypotheses pertaining to the relationships among South American canids, most frequent was the notion of there being three genera and subgenera (after Langguth 1969 and 1970): * Genus Cerdocyon ** Subgenus Atelocynus ** Subgenus Cerdocyon ** Subgenus Speothos * Genus Dusicyon ** Subgenus Lycalopex (Langguth recognized it as \"Pseudalopex\") ** Subgenus \u2020Dusicyon * Genus Chrysocyon Morphological and DNA evidence shows that the South American canids, being the most diverse group of canids on any continent, forms its own natural group. The cladogram below is based on the phylogeny of Lindblad-Toh et al. (2005), modified to incorporate recent findings on Lycalopex species and Dusicyon. ==References== Category:Animal subtribes Category:Canines ",
