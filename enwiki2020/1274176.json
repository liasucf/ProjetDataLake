In 1968 she was part of the extraordinarily successful revue L'Osstidcho, followed the next year by L'Osstidchomeurt with Robert Charlebois, Yvon Deschamps and Mouffe. She and Charlebois recorded the landmark song \"Lindberg'\" and toured France in 1969. In April 1970 Forestier starred in the Michel Tremblay, Fran\u00e7ois Dompierre musical, Demain matin Montr\u00e9al m'attend. She continued with acting, appearing in Jacques Godbout's 1972 film IXE-13, singing on the original film score. Forestier topped the Quebec charts in 1973 with a version of the folk song \"La Prison de Londres\", performed with guitarist Claude Lafrance, and pianist Jacques Perron. With this song Forestier started to turn away from the hard rock of her early career to a repertoire largely inspired by Quebec folk music, and to a more personal style, which she continued through the 1970s. In 1980 Forestier played Marie-Jeanne, the robot waitress in the Montreal production Luc Plamondon, Michel Berger rock opera Starmania. Two years later, with Plamondon as producer, she staged the hit show Je suis au rendez-vous. This was the first of a series of shows in the 1980s, culminating in an appearance with Belgian singer Maurane as part of the Francofolies de Montr\u00e9al in 1989. In 1990 she appeared at the Place-des-Arts in Montreal as \u00c9milie Nelligan, the mother of the poet in the romantic opera Nelligan by Michel Tremblay and Andr\u00e9 Gagnon. Forestier defended Yann Martel's novel Histoire de Pi in the French version of Canada Reads, which was broadcast on Radio-Canada in 2004. In March 2019, she was one of 11 singers from Quebec, alongside Ginette Reno, Diane Dufresne, C\u00e9line Dion, Isabelle Boulay, Luce Dufault, Laurence Jalbert, Catherine Major, Ariane Moffatt, Marie Denise Pelletier and Marie-\u00c9laine Thibert, who participated in a supergroup recording of Ren\u00e9e Claude's 1971 single \"Tu trouveras la paix\" after Claude's diagnosis with Alzheimer's disease was announced.\"La chanson pour Ren\u00e9e Claude en t\u00eate du palmar\u00e8s iTunes Canada\".
