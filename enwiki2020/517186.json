    "text": "Tatyana Petrovna Nikolayeva Tatyana Petrovna Nikolayeva (, Tat'jana Petrovna Nikolaeva; May 4, 1924November 22, 1993) was a pianist, composer and teacher from Soviet Russia. ==Life== Nikolayeva was born in Bezhitsa, in the Bryansk district, on May 4, 1924. Her mother was a professional pianist and studied at the Moscow Conservatory under the renowned pedagogue Alexander Goldenweiser, and her father was an amateur violinist and cellist. When in Leipzig the International Johann Sebastian Bach Competition was founded to mark the bicentenary of Bach's death in 1750, Nikolayeva won first prize in 1950; as a member of the jury, Dmitri Shostakovich he composed and dedicated the 24 Preludes and Fugues, Op.87, to her: it remained an important part of her piano repertoire. She sat as a jury member on international competitions such as the International Tchaikovsky Competition and the Leeds Piano Competition. She recorded her own transcription of Sergei Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf. Nikolayeva was the teacher of Nikolai Lugansky; shortly before her death, she declared him \"The Next One\" in the line of great Russian pianists. Among her other students was Andr\u00e1s Schiff, whom she taught in summer courses at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik Franz Liszt, Weimar. She died on November 22, 1993 in San Francisco after succumbing to a brain haemorrhage during a performance of one of the Op.87 fugues at the Herbst Theatre. As James Campbell-Methuen commented in her obituary, \"Aside from the Shostakovich, though, Tatiana Nikolayeva will be remembered as a Bach player who flung stylistic considerations to the winds and played the music with an irrepressible musical intelligence and knowledge of the resources of her chosen instrument.\" ==Partial repertoire== * Preludes, Op. 34 (Shostakovich) ==Compositions== * Violin Concerto (1972) * Symphony (1955; rev. 1958) * 24 Concert \u00c9tudes, Op. 13 (1951\u201353) * Piano Quintet (1947) ==References== ==External links== * website in memoriam of Tatiana Nikolayeva * Short biography and photograph from Hyperion Records * Interview with Tatiana Nikolayeva by Bruce Duffie, October 16, 1992 Category:1924 births Category:1993 deaths Category:People from Bryansk Category:People's Artists of the USSR Category:Stalin Prize winners Category:Russian classical pianists Category:Russian women pianists Category:Women classical pianists Category:Russian classical composers Category:Soviet female classical composers Category:Russian female classical composers Category:20th-century classical composers Category:Russian music educators Category:Piano pedagogues Category:Moscow Conservatory alumni Category:20th-century classical pianists Category:20th-century women composers ",
