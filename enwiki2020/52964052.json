Monument in P\u011b\u010d\u00edn In 1913, he became a member of the M\u00e1nes Union of Fine Arts. Two years later, he went to Nov\u00e1 Ves u Chot\u011bbo\u0159e at the invitation of Jarmila \u0160\u0165astn\u00e1-Mixov\u00e1 (sister of the poet ) where he and several other young Czech artists spent the time painting en plein aire. In 1916, he was drafted into service and was stationed in Salzburg, Bergheim and Fondo. He held his first exhibition upon returning. From 1919 to 1920, he lived in Nov\u00e9 Hrady and Vysok\u00e9 M\u00fdto as a guest of the painter , and created a series of works on apple farming. He married Albertina Venclov\u00e1 (an amateur actor) in 1921 and, after touring Slovakia and Hungary, settled in P\u011b\u010d\u00edn. From then on, most of his works consisted of landscapes of the local countryside there. His wife died in 1928. From 1930 to 1931, to help relieve his depression, he visited France with his friend, , where he visited the art galleries and went on painting expeditions to Normandy. Upon returning, he exhibited the works he created there, but they were not critically well received. Back in P\u011b\u010d\u00edn, he attempted to synthesize what he had learned by painting seascapes with his earlier landscape style and spent much of his time in the Orlick\u00e9 Mountains. Many of his works from this period were left unfinished. He had always suffered from a weak heart. In 1939, his health began to fail and he died three years later while seeking a cure at the spa in Pod\u011bbrady. A small monument to him has been erected in P\u011b\u010d\u00edn. ==Selected paintings== File:Trampota-Hillside.jpg|Hillside near Nov\u00e1 Ves File:Trampota- Fishermen.jpg|Fishermen in \u00c9tretat File:Trampota-Easter.jpg|Easter in P\u011b\u010d\u00edn File:Trampota-Village.jpg|Village in the Orlick\u00e9 Mountains ==References== ==Further reading== * Ji\u0159\u00ed Hlu\u0161i\u010dka, Jan Trampota, Galerie Anton\u00edna Proch\u00e1zky, Brno, 2009 == External links == *ArtNet: More works by Trampota. *Jan Trampota @ abART Category:1889 births Category:1942 deaths Category:20th-century Czech painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:Landscape painters Category:Expressionist painters Category:Artists from Prague Category:Czech male painters ",
