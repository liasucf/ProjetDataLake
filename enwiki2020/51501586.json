Her four losses were against women with a combined amateur record of 20\u20131\u20131. She also has a notable victory over former UFC fighter Jessamyn Duke. Evans-Smith began her professional career on March 2, 2013, in the quarterfinals for the CFA Women's PGA Tournament.

A recent report from The Wrestling Observer Newsletter announced that Evans-Smith was one of the 17 fighters selected for TUF 18 but at age 25, instead preferred to regain her place in the CFA tournament.

After a back-and-forth first round, she started taking over in the second round. The round ended in controversy because while Evans-Smith was applying punches from the top position, the referee failed to hear the signal announcing the end of the round, so she continued to beat on Fallon Fox. The referee called the fight a TKO in her favor when the round should have already been over. As Ashlee, her corner and the crowd celebrated, the referee informed her that he had made a mistake, and the fight would go to a third round. In the 3rd, Ashlee was able to get the top position again and managed to hit a wave of punches, until the referee intervened and stopped the fight, giving her the win by TKO in the third round. ===WSOF=== Evans-Smith then signed with the World Series of Fighting to fight Marciea Allen at WSOF 10.
