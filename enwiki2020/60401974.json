The term Kuuma koira is Finnish for \"Hot dog\", but the ingredients differ so much that Kuuma koira is completely different cuisine. The dish is not well known outside Pirkanmaa region, but Nokia holds an annual International Kuuma koira day in March to celebrate the cuisine.https://allevents.in/nokia/kansainv%C3%A4linen-kuuma- koira-p%C3%A4iv%C3%A4/20002845706068# Thousands of Kuuma koiras are eaten at the local grills on that date. == Invention and rise to fame == The dish was conceived in 1960s by Teodor Lepp\u00e4nen (1902\u20131978), a fast food grill owner from Nokia. The most well known story about the invention says that he had been selling apple jelly doughnuts with coffee and steamed sausages. Combining the surplus ingredients to save some money, he created Kuuma koira. In the following decades, other grill owners at the area copied the dish, and it became a staple in the local fast food scene. In the end of the first decade of the millennium, MTV3 Enn\u00e4tystehdas record making show had Mikko Salonen from Nokia eating four and a half Kuuma koiras in 5 minutes on a live broadcast, creating a new official record. Around the same time, the International Kuuma koira day was held for the first time. These events together propelled the cuisine to the knowledge of all Finns, further aided by Finnish Grillit Huurussa fast food program on Nelonen TV channel in 2016. == See also == * Hot dog ==References== Category:Fast food Category:Street food Category:Finnish cuisine Category:Finnish words and phrases ",
