Her brother Norman had shares in a mine in nearby Dark Corner and also lived in Sunny Corner for much of his life.\u2019Sunny Corner: Death of Mr. N. Poyitt\u2019 Lithgow Mercury 8 December 1938 p.7 ==Adult life and writing career== She wrote a version of her first published novel, Pavots de la Nuit, when she was 21. She married George Nicol Williams on 30 December 1891 in Hartley, NSW.\u2018Births, Deaths and Marriages\u2019, Sydney Mail and New South Wales Advertiser, 30 Jan 1892 p. 275 They had one child, Roy Nicol Williams, who died in infancy. In late 1903 Williams travelled to New Caledonia to take a mining job, and was killed the following April in a work-related accident, at the age of 32.\u2018A Report from Noumea\u2019 Lithgow Mercury 1 April 1904 p. 5 In 1905, she married Malcolm E. Yates, but the marriage lasted only six months. Nonetheless in her daily life she continued to be known as \u2018Mrs. Yates\u2019 until her death almost half a century later. Malcolm Yates died in 1930. Her writing, under the name of Wolla Meranda, was appearing in the regional press in NSW as early as 1911.Wolla Meranda, \u2019A Pin to See a Poppy Show\u2019 Dubbo Dispatch and Wellington Independent 8 September 1911 p. 3 She became known for her war poetry during the First World War. She was a frequent correspondent with the notable Australian writer and critic A. G. Stephens and contributed to his publications. She often wrote about the natural environment and Australian flora and fauna, and maintained a column, 'Bush Calendar,' for Stephens' magazine The Bookfellow between 1921 and 1922. She was described in 1930 as \u2018a prominent nature lover.\u2019 David G. Stead \u2018The Merola or Currawong\u2019 Sydney Mail 22 October 1930 p. 19 In 1920 she submitted her novel In Mulga Town for consideration in the Australian literary competition launched by C. J. De Garis. The Bookfellow claimed in 1920 that the book had been \u2018picked\u2019 in the competition,\u2018News and Notes\u2019 The Bookfellow 15 February 1921, 5.The original misspells this name as \u2018Wolla Miranda\u2019 but it was not amongst the three prizewinners, and nor was it published by the C. J. De Garis Publishing House. Pavots de la Nuit was her first published novel, issued in French by the Parisian firm of Editions Sansot in 1922 and prepared in collaboration with Iann Karmor. Reviewing the book favourably, one columnist suggested that while its setting was undeniably Australian, \u2018the characters, psychology and atmosphere remain Parisian\u2019.\u2018Shorter Notices\u2019 Daily Telegraph 26 May 1923 p. 14 The book appeared in English in 1930 as Poppies of the Night. Wolla Miranda's three subsequent published works were in English: Villa of the Isles in 1930, The Red River of Life in 1931 and Light and Outer Darkness in 1935. All of these works were published by William Brooks of Sydney, although The Red River of Life was also produced in a self-published edition in 1931 and it appears that she financed the publication of all her works published in Australia. Wolla Meranda also produced a number of manuscripts which remain unpublished. These include The World Tongue, What is Truth, The Summer Seas, The Perfidy of Jane Forster, Gold Dust of Mittewa Creek In Mulga Town, Big Jack of Mittewa Creek, and Old Paddy O\u2019Mara. The last three mentioned are retained in manuscript form at the Mitchell Library in Sydney. In 1920, Wolla Meranda successfully petitioned for the release of Julien de Sanary, a convict imprisoned in New Caledonia. She had encountered de Sanary in New Caledonia following the death of her first husband and was inspired by his poetry to campaign for his release and relocation to Australia. Once de Sanary was freed, the two lived together at Sunny Corner until his death in 1929.Briony Neilson, 'Settling Scores in New Caledonia and Australia:French Convictism and Settler Legitimacy' Australian Journal of Politics and History: Volume 64, Number 3, 2018, pp.391-406 She edited and annotated his posthumous collection Poesies, published (in French) in 1931.\u2018Poet in Exile\u2019 Sydney Morning Herald 20 January 1964 p1 Wolla Meranda was also a painter, and would include portraits of her characters in each of her books. She also contributed art to sundry other publications, such as A. G. Stephens' Commemorative Ode for the Opening of the Commonwealth Parliament published in 1927. A portrait by her of 'The Bookfellow' - presumably, Stephens himself - was a finalist in the Archibald Prize in 1922. ==Death and legacy== Wolla Meranda died at the age of 87 on 12 May 1951. Her tombstone records her pen name rather than any of the names she used amongst her friends or family during her lifetime. In 1989 Christine Karlsen published a biographical booklet, Gert: A Lady Ahead of her Time.Christine Karlsen, Gert: A Lady Ahead of Her Time Brewongle, Descendants of the Poyitt Family, 1989 Poyitt Street, Franklin, ACT was named in her honour in 2008.Public Place Names (Franklin) Determination 2008 (No 3), ACT government On 5 May 2019, Wolla Meranda was added as a \u2018Pillar of Bathurst\u2019, commemorating her as a community member who played a role in that city's history. ==Bibliography== *Pavots de la nuit : roman de m\u0153urs Australiennes (with Iann Karmor) (1922) *Poppies of the Night (1930) *Villa of the Isles (1930) *Light and Outer Darkness (1935) *As editor: **Po\u00e9sies de Julien de Sanary (1931) ==References== Category:Australian women novelists Category:Australian women journalists Category:1863 births Category:1951 deaths Category:19th-century Australian women writers Category:19th-century Australian women artists Category:20th-century Australian women artists Category:20th-century Australian women writers Category:19th-century Australian journalists Category:20th-century Australian journalists Category:19th-century Australian novelists Category:20th-century Australian novelists Category:People from Bathurst, New South Wales Category:Artists from New South Wales Category:Writers from New South Wales Category:20th-century Australian painters Category:19th-century Australian painters Category:Australian portrait painters Category:Australian schoolteachers Category:20th-century Australian poets Category:Australian women poets ",
