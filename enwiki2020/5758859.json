Augusta Read Thomas & Bernard Rands: Two Thoughts About The Piano AXIS by Augusta Read Thomas - IMPROMPTU NO. 3 by Bernard Rands \"Two Thoughts About The Piano was inspired by - and is a response to - Elliott Carter's Cat\u00e9naires, from his Two Thoughts About the Piano. My work is entirely original and does not quote from or share music in common with Mr. Carter\u2019s work\".\u2014 Augusta Read Thomas \"Augusta then composed a series of about thirteen chords that serve as a potent seed and source embryo for both her work and Bernard\u2019s work... Each in our own way, we used these chords as the harmonic structure of our respective pieces without any further collaboration... Bernard also analyzed the note succession of the Carter and the order in which each pitch occurs until all twelve have arrived. He then composed his IMPROMPTU #3 using the rich harmonies referred to above in the slow sections and the pitch ordering in the alternating fast sections.\" AXIS by Augusta Read Thomas and IMPROMPTU NO. 3 by Bernard Rands have been performed as separate works, and together as a single work.
