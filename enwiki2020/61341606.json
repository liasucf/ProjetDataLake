He was the youngest of the Sondermayer family, son of surgeon Colonel Dr Roman Sondermajer, founder and director of the Serbian Army Medical Service, and of Stanislava \u0110uri\u0107 Sondermayer, volunteer nurse in both Balkan wars, daughter of General Dimitrije \u0110uri\u0107 and grand-daughter of Dimitrije Mati\u0107. His siblings Tadija and Vladimir, were both junior officers at the outbreak of the war, having both served in the Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 (Vladimir only 4 years older than Stanislav had been decorated with a silver medal for courage) while his sister Jadviga was a volunteer nurse. == War service and death == When war broke out on 12 July 1914, the men were preparing to go to the front following the Austro-Hungarian invasion; Stanislav eager to join the army to defend his homeland stood before his father seeking a blessing to go but his father refused as Stanislav was still too young. Stanislav ran away from home to the border, he was taken in by a local volunteer group somewhere near \u0160abac; an experienced rider, he managed to enter the service in the Third Cavalry Regiment on July 16 under the command of Colonel Peter Savatic. He participated in the Battle of Cer where he was fatally wounded on August 5, during a charge on the Austro-Hungarian corps near the village of Dobri\u0107, exactly one month before his sixteenth birthday. == Legacy == 254x254px After the battle the women from the village of Bogosavac found his body and brought him back to the village to be buried; a diary wrapped in a handkerchief with Stanislav's notes was found on him. In them, he wrote about the death of his mother, two days after the mobilization, and his feelings from being at the front. His body was buried in the center of the village where a monument was later erected to the young hero. Isidora Sekuli\u0107 wrote the song Tihestrofe, dedicated to Stanislav Sondermajer, while Historian prof. Miodrag Ibrovac, who was also his classmate, wrote: On August 5, 2011, the remains of Stanislav were reburied in Bogosavac, after a memorial prayer service. ==See also== *Roman Sondermajer *Tadija Sondermajer ==References== ===Citations=== ===Sources=== * * == Further reading == *Obituary (in Serbian) *The youngest hero of the Battle of Cer (in Serbian) *Exhibition about Sondermajer family in Loznica (in Serbian) *A little hero (in Serbian) Category:1898 births Category:1914 deaths Category:Serbian military personnel of World War I Category:Royal Serbian Army soldiers Category:People from Belgrade Category:Serbian military personnel killed in World War I ",
