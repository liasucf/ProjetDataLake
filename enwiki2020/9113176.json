    "text": "Etta James Rocks the House is the first live album by American singer Etta James and her fifth album overall. It was recorded live on the nights of September 27 and 28, 1963 at the New Era Club in Nashville, Tennessee and released on December 13, 1963. Hot with the releases of At Last! and The Second Time Around, Etta James Rocks the House became the artist's first recorded live album under Argo Records. The concept was to catch James in a raw and fiery performance outside the recording studio. The album is among her finest live recordings. ==Track listing== #\"Something's Got a Hold on Me\" (Etta James, Leroy Kirkland, Pearl Woods) \u2013 5:02 #\"Baby What You Want Me to Do\" (Jimmy Reed) \u2013 4:14 #\"What'd I Say\" (Ray Charles) \u2013 3:15 #\"Money (That's What I Want)\" (Janie Bradford, Berry Gordy, Jr.) \u2013 3:22 #\"Seven Day Fool\" (Billy Davis, Berry Gordy, Jr., Sonny Woods) \u2013 4:20 #\"Sweet Little Angel\" (Robert McCollum) \u2013 4:14 #\"Ooh Poo Pah Doo\" (Jessie Hill) \u2013 4:04 #\"Woke Up This Morning\" (B.B.
