    "text": "Arcane Shadows is an adventure for the 2nd edition of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game, and released in 1992. The module was written by Bill Slavicsek and published by TSR, Inc. ==Contents== The adventure's packaging is similar to \"previous Dark Sun modules\". It provides useful reference materials for the dungeon master, to include a non-player character table, and extensive maps. It also contains a short work of fiction for context as well as comparatively good artwork related to earlier modules. The contents of the module are as follows: > Arcane Shadows places four to six 5th to 8th level characters in the City- > State of Urik. In this installment, Tyr has been overthrown, and the armies > of Urik have been turned back. The characters receive a summons from the > Veiled Alliance, and are pursued across the desert by templars. During their > flight, they receive aid from a legendary slave tribe, encounter a lost > valley, and try to help the Veiled Alliance finish a ceremony that may set > Athas on the path of rebirth. ==Publication history== Arcane Shadows was preceded by the modules Freedom and Road to Urik, and complements the Prism Pentad works. ==Reception== Berin Kinsman reviewed Arcane Shadows in the March/April 1993 issue of White Wolf Magazine, assessing it as an \"above-par AD&D; module\" that \"still doesn't quite justify the cost\", and rating it a 3 out of 5. He noted that the additional $3\u20134 for Dark Sun modules at the time appeared to only pay for \"fancy packaging\" versus content. However, Kinsman stated that \"Serious [Dark Sun] fans might find this worth a read even if they don't intend to run it.\" ==References== Category:Dark Sun ",
