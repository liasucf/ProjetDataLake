    "text": "Adams v. Texas, 448 U.S. 38 (1980), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held on an 8\u20131 vote that, consistent with its prior opinion in Witherspoon v. Illinois, a Texas requirement that jurors swear an oath that the mandatory imposition of a death sentence would not interfere with their consideration of factual matters such as guilt or innocence during a trial was unconstitutional. The surrounding factual issues (involving defendant Randall Dale Adams) were the subject of a partially autobiographical book of the same name, and were featured in the 1988 movie The Thin Blue Line. ==Further reading== * ==External links== * *Adams v.
