This vulnerability was discovered in early 2000s but did not emerge publicly until 2014 when security researchers from Israeli security firm checkpoint made a public disclosure. The vulnerability still persists in over 1 million devices accessible over internet and total of about 12 million devices. This includes around 200 different router brands. In 2018, the vulnerability again gained traction as the vulnerable firmware was used in medical equipments that could potentially cause life-threatening attacks via IoT. Its severity was highlighted by ICS- CERT in its advisory, thereby. ==References== Category:Firmware Category:Computer security exploits ",
