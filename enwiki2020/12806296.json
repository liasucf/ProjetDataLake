    "text": "\"The Actor\" is the eleventh episode of the HBO comedy series Flight of the Conchords. This episode first aired in the United States on Sunday, August 26, 2007. ==Plot synopsis== The boys play a gig in a club to just a handful of people. After the gig when Bret and Jemaine are at the bar, a \"semi- professional\" actor named Ben introduces himself. He thinks they are a comedy act and that Bret and Jemaine are just playing characters. He offers them his card expressing a wish to work with them in the future. At a post-show debriefing Murray gets depressed about the lack of success he has had promoting the band to record companies. Bret and Jemaine visit Ben at the dry cleaners where he works. They ask him to call Murray posing as a record company executive and let him down gently. Ben calls Murray posing as \"Stefan Gucci\", but after Murray starts begging and crying, he breaks down and agrees to give the band a record deal. Murray and the boys go to dinner with \"Stefan Gucci\". Despite Jemaine's attempts to get them out of the mess, Murray and Bret agree to the two-million dollar deal that Ben offers them. Following the filming of a The Lord of the Rings-themed music video, the boys try to tell Murray about the mistake, but his excited mood causes them to postpone the bad news. They finally get around to telling him the following night after Murray throws them an expensive wrap party. A fuming Murray storms off. Bret and Jemaine visit Ben again to discuss the mess. He gives them an I.O.U. for the money Murray has spent. He tells them he will be able to pay them back soon because he has got a part in a Martin Scorsese movie about a dry cleaner, but they don't believe him. They visit Murray at his office and make up with him. They even manage to cheer him up a little. During the credits, we see Ben playing a scene with John Turturro in the aforementioned film, titled Dry Cleaner. ==Notes== * In the opening nightclub scene, Bret is wearing a T-shirt made from the picture of Sally he embroidered for her in the \"Sally Returns\" episode. * The basic plot of this episode was previously used in the first episode of the Flight of the Conchords radio series. ==Songs== The following songs were featured in this episode: ===\"Cheer Up, Murray\"=== Bret and Jemaine sing \"Cheer Up, Murray\" to Murray after the disappointing concert.
