In 1852, he enrolled in the Montreal School of Medicine and Surgery, but became a priest in 1856. He started teaching at the College of Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocati\u00e8re until he was forced to give up teaching because of ill health. In 1859, he was appointed curate of the parish of La Nativit\u00e9-de- Notre-Dame at Beauport and was free to devote himself entirely to literary pursuits. In 1877, he was awarded a doctorate of history from the Universite Laval, where he would remain as professor. He wrote primarily on New France and its personalities, such as Samuel de Champlain, Louis-Joseph de Montcalm and his aide-de-camp Francis de Gaston, Chevalier de Levis. From 1889 to 1890, he was the president of the Royal Society of Canada. ==Selected bibliography== * P\u00e9lerinage au pays d'\u00c9vang\u00e9line (1855) * Histoire de la M\u00e8re Marie de l'Incarnation (1864) * D\u00e9couverte du tombeau de Champlain (1866) with Laverdiere * Histoire de l'H\u00f4tel-Dieu de Qu\u00e9bec (1878) * Une paroisse canadienne au XVIIe si\u00e8cle (1880) * Histoire de l'asile du Bon-Pasteur de Qu\u00e9bec (1890) * Guerre du Canada: Montcalm et L\u00e9vis (1891, v.1) * Guerre du Canada: Montcalm et L\u00e9vis (1891, v.2) * Les fran\u00e7ais au Canada: Montcalm et L\u00e9vis * Une seconde Acadie (1894) * Les Sulpiciens et les pr\u00eatres des Missions \u00e9trang\u00e8res en Acadie(1897) * \u00c9claircissements sur la question acadienne * Champlain : sa vie et son caract\u00e8re (1898) ==See also== * Francis Parkman * Montcalm and Wolfe ==References== ==External links== * Category:1831 births Category:1904 deaths Category:Canadian historians Category:Canadian male non- fiction writers Category:Canadian Roman Catholic priests Category:Writers from Quebec Category:Canadian writers in French Category:Universit\u00e9 Laval faculty Category:19th-century Roman Catholic priests ",
