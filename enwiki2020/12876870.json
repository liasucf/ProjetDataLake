The park was announced on June 25, 2007, and is notable as the first national park in China to meet International Union for Conservation of Nature standards. It incorporates the Bita Lake Nature Reserve and the Duhu Scenic Area in the Hongshan region. As such they are part of the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas World Heritage Site. Meadow in Pudacuo ==Fauna and flora== A lake in the park The region of this park contains more than 20 percent of the country\u2019s plant species, about one-third of its mammal and bird species and almost 100 endangered species, though it comprises only 0.7 percent of China's land area. It is notably home to vulnerable Black-necked cranes, many rare and beautiful orchids, and Himalayan Yew, a coniferous tree whose extracts are a source of the anticancer drug, paclitaxel. ==Visitor information== Bita Hai Lake at Potatso National Park. Photo taken from near the bus stop before starting the walk around the right side of the lake. The park is about a 50-minute drive from Zhongdian. It has two lakes, a visitor center, several interesting minority villages, lush forests and pasture views. From the visitor center a park bus takes visitors to the first stop, away from where there are several miles of raised wooden walkways around the Shudu Lake (\u5c5e\u90fd\u6e56). The next bus destination is Bita Hai Lake (\u78a7\u5854\u6d77), above sea level. It is surrounded by dense deciduous forests. The bus stops a few feet from a wharf from where visitors can take a boat ride around the lake and to the island in the center. Price for the boat ride is 50 Yuan. It is just over from where the boat disembarks to the bus pick up point. Alternatively, one may walk down the path from the South entrance and hike to and exit the park from the West entrance. Getting to the West entrance requires both a boat and ferry ride. The entire hike can take 4\u20136 hours. Riding horses are also available. Free admission to Xiagei Village is included in the park\u2019s 190 Yuan admission fee. ==See also== *List of national parks of the People's Republic of China ==References== Category:National parks of China Category:Geography of Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Category:World Heritage Sites in China Category:Protected areas established in 2007 Category:Tourist attractions in Yunnan Category:Shangri-La ",
