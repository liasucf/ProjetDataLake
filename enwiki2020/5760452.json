    "text": "Al Goodman (August 12, 1890 in Nikopol, Ukraine \u2013 January 10, 1972 in New York City, New York) was a conductor, songwriter, stage composer, musical director, arranger, and pianist. Graduate of the Baltimore City College and the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore, musician in a nickelodeon, and chorus boy in one of the Milton Aborn's operettas, Goodman was first introduced to musical comedy by the late Earl Carroll, who persuaded him to collaborate in producing his musical, So Long Letty. The success, followed by the hit \"Sinbad,\" which he produced with Al Jolson, led to positions as orchestra conductor for many Broadway productions including the highly successful Flyin\u2019 High, The Student Prince, and Blossom Time. In all, during this period of his career, Goodman directed over 150 first-night performances and became one of the Great White Way's most popular conductors. He was in such demand that it was not uncommon for him to conduct the orchestra of a show for the first few performances, and then hand the baton over to another while he prepared for a new production. In addition to his many assignments as one of RCA Victor's most talented conductors and arrangers, Goodman was kept busy directing the music for various radio network shows including The Ziegfeld Follies of the Air (1932), Palmolive Beauty Box Theater (1935-1937), Your Hit Parade (1935-1938), The Fred Allen Show (1945-1949), and his pet program, The Prudential Family. During television's early years, Al Goodman was tapped to supervise and conduct the music for NBC's variety showcase Colgate Comedy Hour programs done from New York City. Goodman wrote some memorable songs such as \"When Hearts Are Young\", \"Call of Love\" and \"Twilight\". He also worked on several musicals such as The Band Wagon, Good News and Ziegfeld Follies. ==References== *Book: Broadway: An Encyclopedia, by Ken Bloom ==External links== *http://www.playbill.com/person/detail/813/al-goodman * * Category:1890 births Category:1972 deaths Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to the United States Category:Jewish American musicians Category:RCA Victor artists Category:Musicians from New York City Category:Baltimore City College alumni Category:20th-century conductors (music) Category:Songwriters from New York (state) Category:20th-century American composers ",
