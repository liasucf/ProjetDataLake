The Gators side hope to be accepted into the Northern California Rugby Football Union division, needing to play every weekend with a full team, receive a unanimous vote in by all coaches in the division in order to be brought in. After meeting all the requirements thus far, with a current record of 16\u20132 this season, the side is expecting to be inducted into the Division II NCRFU. After a long effort to achieve activation through affiliation with the university as a club sport, competing at Ocean View Park, both the men's and women's sides were able to attain affiliation by 2009. The student-run clubs compete against both university and non-university sides, including the SF Fog, St. Mary's, USF, and Santa Clara. ===Sailing=== In the 1980s, SFSU had a Sailing team that consisted of two Flying Junior FJ Collegiate racing boats made by Vanguard. The boats were kept on a trailer in the \"Corp Yard\", behind the arts building. SFSU sailed as a member of the Pacific Coast Collegiate Sailing Conference Sailing at SFSU was recognized as a \"club sport\". However the team was eligible to compete at the varsity level with other schools in the area and enjoyed strong representation from 1983 to 1988. Collegiate racing at the time had a rule that to race two boats in Varsity, one skipper had to be female. SFSU had a rotation of female skippers throughout the mid-1980s racing seasons. SFSU participated in the \"Northern Series\" which included racing against UC Berkeley (CAL), California State University Maritime Academy (CMA), Stanford University, Sonoma State University, California Polytechnic State University, and UC Davis. ==References== ==External links== * ",
