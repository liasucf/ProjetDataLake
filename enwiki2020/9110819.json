    "text": "Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service (HFRS) is the statutory fire and rescue service for the county of Hampshire, on the south coast of England. The service's chief fire officer is Neil Odin.Statutory FRS/area covered ==History== Until the Second World War, local towns had their own fire services. In 1941, these were combined into the National Fire Service. The Fire Services Act 1947 disbanded the National Fire Service and created county- level fire services. Hampshire Fire Brigade was formed on 4 April 1948. Many meetings and discussions were held prior to the service's creation in 1948 by the Hampshire fire service committees, to discuss who would be appointed the role of chief fire officer and how the service would be structured. With ongoing expansion, the service was under increasing pressure to open a service HQ. The FRS was originally hoping to use and acquire North Hill House in Winchester for usage as the headquarters \u2013 a building still desired by the Admiralty at the time and therefore the service was not allowed to buy it. In May 1948; the admiralty gave up the premises and allowed the service to operate it. However twenty years later in 1968, the service HQ moved to a floor of Ashburton Court, The Castle, Winchester as well as the control room. In 1974, the service absorbed the Southampton and Portsmouth fire services and changed its name to Hampshire Fire Service. In 1997, responsibility for the service was transferred from Hampshire County Council to the newly formed Hampshire Fire and Rescue Authority. Following the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004, the service changed its name to Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service. HFRS are now headquartered in Eastleigh. Since late 2015, it has shared its headquarters with Hampshire Constabulary.http://www.hantsfire.gov.uk/incidents-news-and- events/news/2015/police-begin-groundbreaking-move-to-fire-headquarters/ == Fire Stations/Appliances == {| class=wikitable |- valign=bottom !

Currently, 21 areas have been identified as having a greater need for ambulance cover. Annually, the service attends over 13,000 medical emergencies supporting the ambulance service. The aim of a co-responder is to preserve life until the arrival of either a Rapid Response Vehicle (RRV) or an ambulance. Co-Responder Vehicles are single manned by a specially trained firefighter, who will take the vehicle to his or her workplace/home and will respond from there when alerted to an incident via pager. Each vehicle is equipped with: * Defibrillator * Bag and mask resuscitator * Oxygen * Airways * Suction units * Standard first aid equipment * Entonox (analgesic gas) In addition to co-responding, the service has also rolled out the Immediate Emergency Care (IEC) program which has resulted in all front line fire appliances being equipped with more advanced medical equipment. This includes a defibrillator, Entonox and patient monitoring equipment. As of October 2016, all appliances and front line crews had received the IEC training and equipment. == Operations == === Firefighting cover === HFRS provides fire cover according to a system of four risk categories which have traditionally been used across the UK, where every building is rated for its risk on a scale from 'A' down to 'D'. The risk category determines the minimum number of appliances to be sent in a pre- determined attendance (PDA). Category 'A' includes areas with a high density of large buildings, specific high risk sites, and/or population, such as docklands, ports, oil refineries, fuel storage facilities, hospitals, prisons, and some commercial and industrial complexes and factories. Two fire engines are to arrive within five minutes, and a third within eight minutes. An aerial high-reach appliance is also sent on many 'A' risk PDAs. Category 'B' areas have a medium density of large buildings and/or population, such as multi- storey residential blocks, shops and factories, and will generally be classified as 'B' risk. Two fire engines will be deployed, with the first to arrive within five minutes and the second within eight minutes. Category 'C' covers lower density, suburban areas and detached properties usually found in smaller towns and villages. One fire engine should arrive at a 'C' risk incident within ten minutes, and a second within twenty minutes. Category 'D' covers more rural areas not covered by the first three categories. One fire engine should arrive at 'D' risk incidents within 20 minutes, with any further assistance available on-request by the on-scene officer in charge. HFRS also has fire cover for the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth, including HMNB Portsmouth, and the airports of Southampton and Farnbrough. ==== Mutual assistance ==== The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 gives the UK fire services the ability to call upon other services or fire authorities in what is known as mutual assistance.Fire and Rescue Act 2004 Hampshire Fire and Rescue gives mutual aid to the following services: * Dorset & Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service * Surrey Fire and Rescue Service * Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service * West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service * Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service HFRS also mobilises to support airport firefighters at Southampton Airport and Farnbrough Airport. === Control === HFRS have their own control, stationed in the HQ, they mobilise appliances for Hampshire and Isle of wight. The service uses Networked Fire Services Partnership, so if need be, in spate conditions, mobilise on behalf of Dorset & Wiltshire and Devon & Somerset FRS, and vice versa. ==Future== In 2015, Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service carried out a risk review to determine how to reduce costs to match a \u00a316m funding gap that would develop by 2020 due to funding cuts.http://www.hantsfire.gov.uk/about-us/a-safer-hampshire/the-challenge/ Following a public consultation in late 2015, the final proposals confirmed that none of the 51 fire stations in Hampshire would close and there would be no compulsory redundancies. Costs would be saved by reducing the number of operational firefighters at stations, including allowing some engines to respond to minor incidents with a smaller crew.http://www.hantsfire.gov.uk/EasySiteWeb/GatewayLink.aspx?alId=8716 The second major change was to introduce smaller engines at some stations. Until 2015, all Hampshire engines were a similar size and design.http://www.hantsfire.gov.uk/EasySiteWeb/GatewayLink.aspx?alId=8716 The changes designated three types of fire engine: Enhanced Capability engines, which are similar in size to a traditional fire engine; Intermediate Capability appliances, which are slightly smaller; and First Response Capability appliances, which are much smaller. in 2019, the service scrapped the idea for first response capability appliance due to weight distribution and performance issues, instead would be getting 49 intermediate capability appliances and 24 enhanced capability appliances. (73 new appliances in total) == 3S Fire == 3S fire is wholly owned by Hampshire Fire and Rescue Authority with 100% of all profits being returned to the Authority to assist with running the Fire and Rescue Service. ==See also== *Fire service in the United Kingdom *Fire engine *Fire apparatus *FiReControl *List of British firefighters killed in the line of duty ==References== ==External links== * Category:Fire and rescue services of England Fire ",
