    "text": "The Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia () is the second highest political office in Malaysia. There have been twelve deputy prime ministers since the office was created in 1957. The first Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman, started the convention of appointing a Deputy Prime Minister. The latest former Deputy Prime Minister is Wan Azizah Wan Ismail, in office from May 2018 to the 2020 political crisis in February 2020, who is also the first female officeholder. == Deputy Prime Minister appointment == Although Malaysia has always had a Deputy Prime Minister since independence, a Prime Minister may choose not to appoint a Deputy Prime Minister. The office of Deputy Prime Minister is not provided for in the Constitution of Malaysia. At the same time, a Prime Minister could appoint more than one Deputy Prime Minister, as has occurred before in Singapore. By the practice of the past ruling coalition Barisan Nasional, where the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) was the unofficial leader, the UMNO Deputy President was usually appointed the Deputy Prime Minister by the Prime Minister (who was the UMNO President). In the organisational structure of Barisan Nasional, the President and Deputy President of UMNO were automatically made the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of Barisan Nasional. From 21 May 2018 until 24 February 2020,the ruling coalition - Pakatan Harapan, a coalition of four equal partner parties, the holder of the position of Deputy Prime Minister was decided upon by the coalition's Presidential Council. The postholder was Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah binti Wan Ismail, who was the first female holder of post. == Deaths, resignations and removals from office == Of the twelve previous officeholders, six have stepped up to become Prime Ministers. Of the remaining, one died in office, two resigned, two were removed from office (including one who later became Prime Minister) by the sitting Prime Minister, and two disqualified from office due to defeat in the 2018 general election and collapse of the federal administration in 2020 political crisis. Ismail Abdul Rahman died in office due to massive heart attack in 1973. Musa Hitam resigned from second Mahathir cabinet over differences with Prime Minister over government policy in 1986. Ghafar Baba resigned from his portfolio following UMNO grassroots lost confidence in his leadership and his position as Deputy President of UMNO was challenged by Anwar Ibrahim in the UMNO's top leadership election. Anwar Ibrahim was the first deputy prime minister to be sacked after being accused and subsequently charged with corruption and sodomy in 1998. Muhyiddin Yassin was the second DPM to be removed from office after being dropped from the Cabinet by former Prime Minister Najib Razak in a reshuffle in 2015. He later was sacked from his party. Wan Azizah Wan Ismail was disqualified from office after the seventh Mahathir cabinet was dissolved due to its fall from the federal administration in 2020. == List of Deputy Prime Ministers of Malaysia == Colour key (for political parties): {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! colspan=2| Portrait !Name (Birth\u2013Death) ! colspan=\"3\" |Term of office ! colspan=\"2\" |Political Party |- ! 1 |100px |Abdul Razak Hussein |31 August 1957 |22 September 1970 | | bgcolor=\"\" | | rowspan=\"3\" | Alliance (UMNO) |- ! 2 |100px |Dr. Ismail Abdul Rahman |22 September 1970 |2 August 1973 | | bgcolor=\"\" | |- ! rowspan=2| 3 | rowspan=\"2\" |156x156px | rowspan=\"2\" |Hussein Onn | rowspan=\"2\" |13 August 1973 | rowspan=\"2\" |15 January 1976 | rowspan=\"2\" | | bgcolor=\"\" | |- | bgcolor=\"\" | | rowspan=\"9\" | Barisan Nasional (UMNO) |- ! 4 |150x150px |Dr. Mahathir Mohamad |5 March 1976 |16 July 1981 | | bgcolor=\"\" | |- ! 5 | |Musa Hitam |18 July 1981 |16 March 1986 | | bgcolor=\"\" | |- ! 6 |124x124px |Abdul Ghafar Baba |10 May 1986 |15 October 1993 | | bgcolor=\"\" | |- ! 7 |150x150px |Anwar Ibrahim |1 December 1993 |2 September 1998 | | bgcolor=\"\" | |- ! 8 |156x156px |Abdullah Ahmad Badawi |8 January 1999 |31 October 2003 | | bgcolor=\"\" | |- ! 9 |136x136px |Najib Razak |7 January 2004 |3 April 2009 | | bgcolor=\"\" | |- ! 10 |101x101px |Muhyiddin Yassin |10 April 2009 |29 July 2015 | | bgcolor=\"\" | |- ! 11 |147x147px |Dr. Ahmad Zahid Hamidi |29 July 2015 |10 May 2018 | | bgcolor=\"\" | |- ! 12 |150x150px |Dr. Wan Azizah Wan Ismail |21 May 2018 |24 February 2020 | | bgcolor=\"\" | |Pakatan Harapan (PKR) |} ===Timeline=== ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:12 PlotArea = top:10 bottom:80 right:130 left:20 AlignBars = late DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1957 till:10/05/2020 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:5 start:1957 Colors = id:lightpurple value:lightpurple legend:Perikatan id:darkblue value:darkblue legend:BN id:red value:red legend:PH TextData = pos:(1,25) textcolor:black fontsize:M text: Legend = columns:4 left:150 top:24 columnwidth:100 TextData = pos:(20,27) textcolor:black fontsize:M text:\"Party:\" BarData = bar:Abraisar bar:Isarhu bar:Husonn bar:Mamo bar:Musa bar:Agb bar:Abi bar:Paklah bar:Donation bar:Muh bar:Zahid bar:Wawi PlotData= width:5 align:left fontsize:S shift:(5,-4) anchor:till bar:Abraisar from: 31/07/1957 till: 22/09/1970 color:lightpurple text:\"Abdul Razak Hussein\" fontsize:10 bar:Isarhu from: 22/09/1970 till: 02/08/1973 color:lightpurple text:\"Ismail Abdul Rahman\" fontsize:10 bar:Husonn from: 13/08/1973 till: 31/05/1974 color:lightpurple from: 01/06/1974 till: 15/01/1976 color:darkblue text:\"Hussein Onn\" fontsize:10 bar:Mamo from: 05/03/1976 till: 16/06/1981 color:darkblue text:\"Mahathir Mohamad\" fontsize:10 bar:Musa from: 18/07/1981 till: 16/03/1986 color:darkblue text:\"Musa Hitam\" fontsize:10 bar:Agb from: 10/05/1986 till: 15/10/1993 color:darkblue text:\"Abdul Ghafar Baba\" fontsize:10 bar:Abi from: 01/12/1993 till: 02/09/1998 color:darkblue text:\"Anwar Ibrahim\" fontsize:10 bar:Paklah from: 08/01/1999 till: 31/10/2003 color:darkblue text:\"Abdullah Ahmad Badawi\" fontsize:10 bar:Donation from: 07/01/2004 till: 03/04/2009 color:darkblue text:\"Mohd Najib Abdul Razak\" fontsize:10 bar:Muh from: 10/04/2009 till: 28/07/2015 color:darkblue text:\"Muhyiddin Yassin\" fontsize:10 bar:Zahid from: 29/07/2015 till: 09/05/2018 color:darkblue text:\"Ahmad Zahid Hamidi\" fontsize:10 bar:Wawi from: 21/05/2018 till: 24/02/2020 color:red text:\"Wan Azizah Wan Ismail\" fontsize:10 == Senior Ministers == No Members of Parliament (MPs) have been appointed as the Deputy Prime Minister in the current cabinet under Prime Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin. Instead, he has appointed four senior ministers. They are responsible for helping the Prime Minister coordinate cabinet affairs on economics, security, infrastructure development & education and society. Senior ministers will also assist the Prime Minister in carrying out his duties as Prime Minister including chairing Cabinet meetings during his absence. Thus, with the presence of these senior ministers, there is currently no need for a Deputy Prime Minister to be appointed.
