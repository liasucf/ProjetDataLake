He was the son of Robert de Ros and Sybil de Valoines. Everard de Ros married Rose Trusbut (in 1170 or 1171) with whom he had two sons, the oldest of which, Robert de Ros, became a Magna Carta surety. ==Death== He died 1186; he and his wife (both apparently great benefactors to various religious institutes) are buried in the church of Hunmanby. ==References== Category:1145 births Category:1180s deaths Category:English feudal barons ",
