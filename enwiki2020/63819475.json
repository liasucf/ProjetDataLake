In 1998 and 1999, he finished in the top five finishers at the Ko\u0161ice Peace Marathon with times of 2:17:05 (fifth place) and 2:18:14 (fourth place). Nearly each year from 1995 to 2001, he ran and won the AIMS-certified Bratislava, Slovakia, full or half marathon, clocking 2:18:23 in his best marathon, establishing a presence in the European running community. In 2001, he ran in the Wachau Half Marathon in Krems, Austria, the course of which follows the Danube River and draws strong competition. Keeping with a fast pace from the start, he won the race in 1:04:22, beating out more than 6,000 other runners. The time would stand as a personal best, although he would come close to breaking it at the Carlsbad Half Marathon, when he ran 1:04:40 for a second-place finish behind Ibrahim Mohamed Aden.

He had a breakthrough in America when he came to Baltimore, Maryland in 2005 to race the marathon. Antonenko toed the starting line on a warm morning. He ran with the lead pack as the heat increased, and eventually sped past former Olympian Mindaugas Puk\u0161tas and several international competitors to win the Baltimore Marathon in 2:15:40. After the race, many runners were treated for heat exhaustion 15 runners were taken to emergency rooms. He won $15,000 for the win and became even more widely known in the Ukrainian athletic community.

He won the race and earned the title of \u201cMaster of Sports of International Class.\u201d Then in October, he returned to Baltimore. In a contrast to the year before, the 3,000 contestants lined up to cooler weather: 36 degrees. Antonenko again kept pace with the lead international pack. He remained in third with less than five miles to go, but kicked past Kenyan Wilson Komen as they went through the 23rd mile to secure second place in 2:16:55. 2007 was another big year for Antonenko. He returned to the United States, and decided to run the Twin Cities Marathon again. At 35, he was older than some of the world-class competition.

On race morning, the usually cool northern October air was heating up the 8,106 marathon starters. At the sound of the gun, it was 72 degrees with around 90 percent humidity. The start was slow, and Antonenko bolted at mile 7 as he turned to follow Minnehaha Creek to the Mississippi River. He kept taking water, holding tempo, and increasing a significant lead over the other racers. \u201cI wasn\u2019t certain I could win,\u201d he said afterward. \u201cIt would be unprofessional to have such thoughts.\u201d But he pumped his fists at the finish, crossed in 2:13:54 and won $25,000.
