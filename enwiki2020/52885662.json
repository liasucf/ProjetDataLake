She became known to the wider public through her role in the inquiry into the Murder of Maria Colwell. As an academic, she researched and taught at the University of Oxford, the University of Keele, and the University of Nottingham among other institutions. ==Career== ===Social work=== From 1954 to 1958, Stevenson worked as a child care officer in Devon. She was a social work adviser to the Supplementary Benefits Commission from 1968 to 1970. Her early career was spent specialising in vulnerable children, but she later also worked with vulnerable adults and the elderly. ===Academic career=== In 1961, Stevenson joined the University of Oxford as a lecturer. She was appointed Reader in Applied Social Studies in 1970, an appointment she held until she moved university. From 1970 until her death, she was a Fellow of St Anne's College, Oxford. From 1976 to 1982, she was Professor of Social Policy and Social Work at the University of Keele; she was the university's first female professor. She then moved to the University of Nottingham, where she worked as Professor of Social Work Studies between 1984 and 1994. In 1970, she became the founding editor of the British Journal of Social Work. ===Public service=== Following the Murder of Maria Colwell, Stevenson was appointed as a member of the inquiry into her death; this was the \"first the first major national enquiry into a child death\". It was led by Thomas Gilbert Field-Fisher and they published their findings as Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Care and Supervision Provided in Relation to Maria Colwell in September 1974. From 1973 to 1978, Stevenson was a member of the Royal Commission on Civil Liability. From 1977 to 1983, she was chairwoman of the Advisory Committee on Rent Rebates and Rent Allowances (ACRRRA).

She described the relationships she did have as \"fraught with tension and pain\", and this led her to undergo psychoanalysis. Her parents were Irish Protestants who had moved to England to escape the discrimination they experienced in the newly created Republic of Ireland. As such, their daughter \"remained deeply distrustful of Catholicism\". In her youth she was a Congregationalist but later became agnostic. ==Honours== In 1994 Queen's Birthday Honours, Stevenson was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) \"for the development of social services\". She was made an honorary professor of Kingston University in 2003 and of Hong Kong Polytechnic University in 2004. ==References== ==External links== * Stevenson's personal website Category:1930 births Category:2013 deaths Category:People from Croydon Category:British social workers Category:Women social workers Category:Social work scholars Category:Academics of Keele University Category:Academics of the University of Nottingham Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Fellows of St Anne's College, Oxford Category:Lesbian academics Category:British Congregationalists Category:British agnostics ",
