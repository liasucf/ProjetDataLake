    "text": "Miniopterus newtoni is a species of bat that is endemic to S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe. ==Taxonomy== Miniopterus newtoni was described as a new species in 1889 by Portuguese zoologist Jos\u00e9 Vicente Barbosa du Bocage. The holotype had been collected by Portuguese naturalist Francisco Newton. In the third edition of Mammal Species of the World, Simmons et al. considered M. newtoni as a subspecies of the least long-fingered bat, M. minor. However, in 2007, a mitochondrial DNA analysis rejected the assertion that M. minor and M. newtoni were synonymous. Juste et al. published that M. newtoni and M. minor had a genetic distance significant enough to regard each as separate species. ==Description== It has a forearm length of approximately . ==Range and habitat== M. newtoni is endemic to the nation of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, where it has only been documented on S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 Island. It has been documented in both forested habitat and plantations. ==Conservation== As of 2019, it is evaluated as a data deficient species by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this classification due to the lack of information on its extent of occurrence and threats it may be facing. ==References== Category:Endemic fauna of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 Island Category:Mammals described in 1889 Category:Miniopteridae Category:Bats of Africa ",
