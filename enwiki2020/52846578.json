It formed the terminus of the Coalport Branch Line which ran from Hadley Junction near Oakengates on the LNWR Stafford to Shrewsbury Line. ==History== The station was originally named \u2018Coalport\u2019 at opening on 17 June 1861. It was later renamed \u2018Coalport East\u2019 to avoid confusion with the Severn Valley Railway Coalport station which opened on the opposite bank of the river Severn in 1862. The station was host to a LMS caravan from 1934 to 1939. Coalport East closed to passengers on 6 June 1952, and to freight traffic in 1960. ==References== ;Notes ==Further reading== * Category:Disused railway stations in Shropshire Category:Former London and North Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1952 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1861 Category:1861 establishments in England ",
