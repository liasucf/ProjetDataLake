    "text": "The AI Song Contest () is an international competition based on the Eurovision Song Contest, which features songs that have been composed using artificial intelligence (AI). The inaugural edition took place on 12 May 2020 and was organised by the Dutch broadcaster VPRO, in collaboration with NPO 3FM and NPO Innovation. == Format == Each competing team has to compose a \"Eurovision- like\" song of maximum three minutes using artificial intelligence. Human input is allowed, but the more AI is used, the more points the entry will get from the expert jury. The entries are also evaluated by the public through online ratings. The entry that receives most points wins the competition. == 2020 edition == 210px A total of thirteen teams, representing seven countries in Europe as well as Australia, competed in the inaugural edition of the AI Song Contest in 2020. As there were no pre-qualifying rounds, multiple teams from each country could enter the competition. The contest was won by Uncanny Valley, who represented Australia with the song \"Beautiful the World\". === Presenter === The show was hosted by the Belgian comedian Lieven Scheire. The points from the online voting were announced by the Dutch television presenter Emma Wortelboer, who had been the Netherlands' spokesperson for the Eurovision Song Contest 2019. === Expert panel === The jury consisted of three AI experts, who assessed each entry based on the usage of artificial intelligence in their compositions: * \u2013 Vincent Koops (spokesperson) * \u2013 Anna Huang * \u2013 Ed Newton-Rex === Competing entries === The show took place on 12 May 2020 at 20:30 CEST and was broadcast via a live stream on YouTube.
