    "text": "The Northern Peaks State Trail is a unit of the North Carolina state park system in Ashe and Watauga Counties, North Carolina in the United States. The State Trail is planned as a hiking trail connecting Downtown Boone, Howard Knob County Park, Elk Knob State Park, Three Top Mountain Gameland, Downtown West Jefferson and Mount Jefferson State Natural Area. The trail is a collaboration between local governments and the state, with development coordinated by the North Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation (NCDPR). ==History== In 2008, NCDPR along with the High Country Council of Governments developed a regional trail plan for North Carolina's High Country. A potential trail route along the Northwestern Peaks of the state was identified in the plan. In 2011, the Watauga County Tourism Development Authority published the Boone Area Outdoor Recreation Plan, which included a proposal for a Northern Peaks Trail. In 2017, NCDPR, the Watauga County Tourism Development Authority, Ashe County, the Ashe County Chamber of Commerce, the West Jefferson Tourism Development Authority, the Town of Boone, and High Country Pathways, Inc jointly commissioned a master plan for the Northern Peaks Trail. The master plan concluded the trail was eligible for state trail status and proposed its designation as part of the State Trail System. On July 1, 2019, the North Carolina General Assembly formalized the proposal by establishing Northern Peaks State Trail, and directed NCDPR to coordinate its development. ==References== ==External links== * * Northern Peaks Trail * The Northern Peaks Trail Master Plan * High Country Regional Trails Plan Category:State parks of North Carolina Category:Protected areas of Ashe County, North Carolina Category:Protected areas of Watauga County, North Carolina Category:Protected areas established in 2019 Category:Hiking trails in North Carolina Category:2019 establishments in North Carolina ",
