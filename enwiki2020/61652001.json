Mart\u00ednez later joined Racing de Sants, before signing for FC Barcelona. On 19 October 1941, at the age of 16 years, 10 months and 5 days, Mart\u00ednez became Barcelona's youngest ever player, starting in a 4\u20133 loss against Real Madrid in El Cl\u00e1sico at Real Madrid's Estadio Chamart\u00edn. Mart\u00ednez made six further appearances for Barcelona in the 1941\u201342 La Liga season, before being loaned out to Sabadell in 1942 for two years. Upon his return to Barcelona, manager Josep Samitier rejected an offer from Valencia for Mart\u00ednez, before a meniscus injury halted Mart\u00ednez's progression at the club. In 1945, Mart\u00ednez signed for Gimn\u00e0stic, making 38 league appearances for the club over the course of four seasons. In 1949, Mart\u00ednez left Catalonia to sign for Linense in southern Andaluc\u00eda. Mart\u00ednez stayed with the club for one season, playing 26 times. In 1950, Mart\u00ednez returned to Catalonia, joining Igualada, before signing for Sant Andreu the following year. In 1952, Mart\u00ednez re-signed for Gimn\u00e0stic, making three appearances, before retiring in 1953 at the age of 28 due to injury, after a spell at Santboi\u00e0. ==Personal life== Due to the language policies of Francoist Spain, Mart\u00ednez was also referred to as Vicente, as well as the Catalan name of Vicen\u00e7. On 2 October 2018, Mart\u00ednez died, survived by his two sons Vicen\u00e7 and Llu\u00eds. ==References== Category:1925 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Spanish footballers Category:Footballers from Barcelona Category:Association football defenders Category:FC Barcelona players Category:CE Sabadell FC footballers Category:Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona footballers Category:Real Balomp\u00e9dica Linense footballers Category:UE Sant Andreu footballers Category:FC Santboi\u00e0 players Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players ",
