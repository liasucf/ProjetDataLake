Lakes are alkaline formed from the volcanic debris created when Mount Meru blew its top 250,000 years ago. As the lakes are alkaline, animals do not drink from their waters, but you can spot zebras and birds on their banks. Lakes are the highlights of the Easter section of Arusha National Park, covering the forest of Mount Meru. ==See also== *Wildlife of Tanzania ==References== Category:Lakes of Tanzania Category:Saline lakes of Africa ",
