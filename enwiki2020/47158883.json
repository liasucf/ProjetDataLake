He grew up listening to a wide variety of music, as his father ran a business that acted as a cafe during the daytime and as a bar at night. His father had lived in Europe for many years, so often played music such as the German electronic band Kraftwerk. The business would occasionally hold performances for musicians, such as Japanese folk singer Masato Tomobe. This variety made it feel natural for Yamaguchi to create multi-genre music. Yamaguchi began to play music naturally, learning how to play the guitar after picking up an acoustic guitar that was in his parents home. The first songs he learnt on the guitar were Kaguya-hime/Iruka's 1970 folk song \"Nagoriyuki\" and Takuro Yoshida's \"Kekkon Shiy\u014d yo\" (1972). He was inspired to write lyrics by the large number of second hand books his father bought, such as those of Kenji Miyazawa, Osamu Dazai, Ch\u016bya Nakahara and Yoshiro Ishihara, as well as haiku poets Sant\u014dka Taneda and Sh\u016bji Terayama. In 1998, Yamaguchi formed a band with his high school friends from Sapporo Daiichi High School, called Dutchman, which performed British rock-inspired music. Yamaguchi acted as the band's vocalist and primary songwriter. Yamaguchi and the band were scouted and trained by Victor Entertainment, however the group never formally debuted with Victor. In 2002, the band released Demonstration, an album compiled of seven demos the band recorded between 2000-2002. After six years together, Dutchman broke up due to creative differences, when Yamaguchi tried adding electronic elements into their music, especially on the song \"Mikazuki Sunset\". It was originally performed with a rock sound, but Yamaguchi felt that a purely rock arrangement did not create the imagery he wanted to express, and incorporated dance music. After the band broke up, Yamaguchi kept the name Dutchman for his solo project as a DJ, where he created techno and club music. Yamaguchi had the idea that it would be interesting to mix electronic music with Japanese-style \"folky melodies\". When Yamaguchi was asked to create remix of the song \"Shiranami Top Water\" for the compilation album Music for Pardisco in 2004, he found it difficult to create the entire song by himself. These two reasons led him to ask Dutchman's former guitarist Motoharu Iwadera to start working with him again, and the pair created the band Sakanaction. After three additional members of the band joined, Sakanaction made their major debut in 2007, with the album Go to the Future under the Victor Entertainment sublabel BabeStar Label. After the band's second album Night Fishing (2008), Yamaguchi and the other members of Sakanaction moved to Tokyo in the spring of 2008, and were moved to the main Victor Entertainment artist roster. moving from Hokkaido to Tokyo in the spring of 2008. In 2010, the band had their break-out hit \"Aruku Around\", debuting at number three on Oricon's single charts. Since \"Aruku Around\", the band has seen greater commercial success, with their albums Documentaly (2011) and Sakanaction (2013) both certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. In 2012, Yamaguchi began writing music for dramatic productions, such as the band's single \"Boku to Hana\", which was written specifically for the drama Sanj\u016bnana-sai de Isha ni Natta Boku: Kensh\u016bi Junj\u014d Monogatari.
