    "text": "Andrew Garner (born 8 March 1966) is an English former professional footballer who played in the Football League for Derby County and Blackpool. ==Playing career== Born in Stonebroom, Derbyshire, Garner began his career as an apprentice with Derby County in 1983. He scored some vital goals in the Rams' Division Three promotion season of 1985\u201386. In August 1988, Garner joined Sam Ellis's Blackpool for \u00a375,000. He made his debut on opening day, 27 August, in a 1\u20131 draw at Chester City. Jimmy Mullen took over the manager's seat for 1989\u201390 and moved Garner into a central-midfield position, where he went on to enjoy more success in a partnership with Paul Groves, although he couldn't help the Seasiders avoid relegation to the Football League's basement division. After Blackpool's failure in the Fourth Division playoff final of 1990\u201391, Garner was the subject of intense transfer speculation, and it seemed almost certain that he would leave for pastures new. However, the proposed move fell through and he remained at the club for another season, which saw another Wembley playoff final, this time ending in success for Blackpool. Garner managed to make only seven appearances during the 1992\u201393 season before joining Gresley Rovers. ==Blackpool F.C. Hall of Fame== Garner was inducted into the Hall of Fame at Bloomfield Road, when it was officially opened by former Blackpool player Jimmy Armfield in April 2006. Organised by the Blackpool Supporters Association, Blackpool fans around the world voted on their all-time heroes. Five players from each decade are inducted; Garner is in the 1980s. ==Post-retirement== Garner is now a football coach. He has been the first-team coach at his first club, Derby County. In 2013 Garner followed Nigel Clough to Sheffield United. After mixed results at Sheffield United, Garner would once again follow Nigel Clough and return to previous club Burton Albion in 2015 in a coaching role.. Subsequently, Burton Albion have achieved promotion to the Championship for the first time in their history.. ==Honours== Derby County * Football League Third Division promotion: 1985\u201386 * Football League Second Division champions: 1986\u201387 Blackpool * Football League Fourth Division play-off winner: 1991\u201392 Gresley Rovers * Southern Football League Premier Division champions: 1996\u201397 ==References== ==Further reading== * * ==External links== *Garner at the Blackpool Supporters Association Hall of Fame *Garner's profile at soccerbase.com *\"Andy living dream with full-time Rams role\" \u2013 ThisisDerby.co.uk Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:People from Stonebroom Category:English footballers Category:Derby County F.C. players Category:Blackpool F.C. players Category:Gresley F.C. players Category:Burton Albion F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Southern Football League players Category:Burton Albion F.C. non-playing staff Category:Derby County F.C. non-playing staff Category:Sheffield United F.C. non-playing staff Category:Association football forwards Category:Association football midfielders ",
