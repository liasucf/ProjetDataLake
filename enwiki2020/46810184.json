    "text": "Cuneiform ni. (digitized form ni) Amarna letter EA 367-(titled: \"Pharaoh to a Vassal\"). A common Amarna letter that uses cuneiform ni. The cuneiform sign ni, is a common-use sign of the Amarna letters, the Epic of Gilgamesh, and other cuneiform texts. It has a secondary sub-use in the Amarna letters for addressing the Pharaoh, from the vassal states of Canaan. The address to the Pharaoh is often 'King-Lord-Mine': LUGAL, EN-ia which has many varieties of expression. \"LUGAL\" is Akkadian language for \"\u0160arru\", English \"king\", and EN in Akkadian is b\u0113lu,Parpola, 197l. The Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, Glossary, pp. 119-145, b\u0113lu, \u0161arru, p. 122, p. 141. for \"Lord\", (thus \"King, Lord-Mine\"). In some Amarna letters the sub-use of ni is l\u00ed, for spelling \"b\u0113lu\", be-l\u00ed often 100x24px 100x24px. There are other sub-uses of ni (see Epic of Gilgamesh usage below). It is also found in some Amarna letters, EA 9, and EA 252, for example where ni or l\u00ed is scribed in a \"flourish\" format (an over-lengthened version of the 2-horizontals that construct the sign), similar to tab, 100x24px. In EA 9 especially, there is a 'scribe margin line', both left and right on the clay tablet obverse. For the right margin, some words in the lower paragraphs of the obverse (Para 4-7), some words ending with ni/l\u00ed, have the sign lengthened, and sitting upon the right margin line-(the cuneiform text, in EA 9, reads: left-to-right). ==Epic of Gilgamesh usage== The ni sign usage in the Epic of Gilgamesh is as follows: l\u00ed-(5) times, n\u00e9-(42), ni-(326), \u1e63al-(8), zal-(1), \u00cc-(9) times. \u00cc, the Sumerogram is Akkadian language \"\u0161amnu\", for English \"oil\".Parpola, 197l. The Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, Sign List, pp. 155-165, no. 231, p. 159. Because of its multiple usages in the Epic, ni, or l\u00ed, can be used as a syllabic for \" \"ne\", \"ni\", or \"li\"/\"l\u00ed\", etc. It also can be used as a syllabic for combinations related to: \"sal\", \"\u1e63al\", or \"zal\"; (in Akkadian many consonants, or the 4-vowels, a, e, i, u can be interchanged, for performing the final Akkadian language 'dictionary word'). ==References== *Moran, William L. 1987, 1992.
