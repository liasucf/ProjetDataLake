He showed photographs of Welsh landscapes at the 1877 Photographic Society exhibition. Aerial view showing Stonebridge Road, Stamford Hill, and Seven Sisters Curve, part of the Tottenham and Hampstead Junction Railway, taken from 2000ft. The earliest extant aerial photograph taken in the British Isles. His first balloon ascent was in May 1882, at Alexandra Palace. He made his own device for attaching a camera to the basket below a balloon, allowing him to take pictures looking directly downwards. One of his images, taken from over Stamford Hill, is the earliest extant aerial photograph taken in the British Isles. A print of the same image, An Instantaneous Map Photograph taken from the Car of a Balloon, 2,000 feet high, was shown at the 1882 Photographic Society exhibition. Shadbolt gave public lectures, using magic lantern slides, with the title Balloons and Ballooning, Upward and Onwards. He was secretary of the West Kent Sunday School Union from 1886. == Death == On 29 June 1892, he took a flight in a gas balloon owned by (or which he co-owned with; sources vary) his friend 'Captain' William D. Dale, at Crystal Palace. The balloon ripped during the initial ascent, at around , and though those aboard dropped ballast, the basket crashed to the ground, immediately killing Dale.
