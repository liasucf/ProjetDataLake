    "text": "In enzymology, a dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (NADP+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :5,6-dihydrouracil + NADP+ \\rightleftharpoons uracil + NADPH + H+ Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5,6-dihydrouracil and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are uracil, NADPH, and H+. In humans the enzyme is encoded by the DPYD gene. It is the initial and rate- limiting step in pyrimidine catabolism. It catalyzes the reduction of uracil and thymine. It is also involved in the degradation of the chemotherapeutic drugs 5-fluorouracil and tegafur.. It also participates in beta-alanine metabolism and pantothenate and coa biosynthesis. == Terminology == The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,6-dihydrouracil:NADP+ 5-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include: * dihydrothymine dehydrogenase *dihydrouracil dehydrogenase (NADP+) *4,5-dihydrothymine: oxidoreductase *DPD *DHPDH *dehydrogenase, dihydrouracil (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, phosphate) *DHU dehydrogenase *hydropyrimidine dehydrogenase *dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (NADP+) ==Structural studies== As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and . ==Function== The protein is a pyrimidine catabolic enzyme and the initial and rate-limiting factor in the pathway of uracil and thymidine catabolism. Genetic deficiency of this enzyme results in an error in pyrimidine metabolism associated with thymine-uraciluria and an increased risk of toxicity in cancer patients receiving 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy. == Interactive pathway map == == See also == * Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency, a genetic disorder *Cancer pharmacogenomics == References == == Further reading == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:EC 1.3.1 Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes Category:Enzymes of known structure ",
