    "text": "Frank Sandon (3 June 1890 - 29 May 1979) was a British swimmer. He competed in the men's 100 metre backstroke event at the 1912 Summer Olympics. Sandon studied mathematics at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge finishing as a Wrangler. He joined the Home office but found he was 'too remote from real people' so changed to teaching after World War I. He taught at Highgate School from 1921-1923 and at various grammar schools, becoming headmaster of Plymouth Corporation Grammar School, founded in 1562, for eight years until its closure in 1937. A strong believer in co-education, in 1941 Sandon was appointed headmaster of Millom County Secondary School in Millom, Cumberland. He wrote or contributed to numerous books on statistics. ==References== Category:1890 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Alumni of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge Category:British statisticians Category:British male swimmers Category:Olympic swimmers of Great Britain Category:Swimmers at the 1912 Summer Olympics Category:People from Islington (district) Category:Sportspeople from London ",
