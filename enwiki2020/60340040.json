She is the wife of the former President of Haiti, Michel Martelly. Martelly focused on issues related to public health, healthcare and alleviating malnutrition during her tenure as first lady. ==Biography== ===Early life and marriage=== Martelly was born Sophia Saint-R\u00e9my on October 9, 1965, in New York City in the United States. Her father, Charles Edouard Saint-R\u00e9my, was from Gona\u00efves, and her mother, Mona Lisa Florez, is from Port- au-Prince. The Saint-R\u00e9my family is originally from Gona\u00efves, where Sophia Saint R\u00e9my was raised. The Saint-Remys suffered under the dictatorship of Fran\u00e7ois \"Papa Doc\" Duvalier. Sophia Martelly's grandmother was arrested and detained by Duvalier , while two of her paternal relatives were executed during the Duvalier dictatorship. Sophia Saint-R\u00e9my and her future husband, singer and politician Michel Martelly, had been friends when they were children, but had lived separate lives as young adults. Michel Martelly immigrated to the United States with his American first wife during the 1980s. In 1986, Michel Martelly divorced his first wife and returned to Haiti. Sophia Saint-R\u00e9my and Martelly, who were childhood friends, reunited in 1987, shortly after he moved back to the country. However, when the couple tried to marry, both of their mothers objected based on their skin color: Sophia Martelly has lighter skin, while Michel Martelly has a darker complexion. Sophia Saint-R\u00e9my and Michel Martelly ignored their parents' protests and, instead, moved to Miami, Florida, together later in 1987. The couple married in Miami in a small 1987 wedding ceremony. Michel Martelly worked in construction, while Sophia worked as a word processor. The couple returned to Haiti in 1988. They had four children, Olivier, Alexandre, Yani, and Michel. The Martellys' early marriage was different from Michel Martelly's onstage \"Sweet Mickey\" persona. Michel Martelly instituted a curfew on Sophia and forbid her to chew gum as recently as the late 1990s. Martelly is four years younger than her husband. The couple lived in a condo in Miami Beach, Florida, during the mid-1990s. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1965 births Category:First Ladies and Gentlemen of Haiti Category:Haitian women in politics Category:People from Gona\u00efves fr:Sophia Saint R\u00e9my Martelly ",
