    "text": "The 1955\u201356 season was the 76th season of competitive football in England. ==Overview== Defending league champions Chelsea decided not to compete in the new European Champions Cup, following opposition from the Football League about the participation of English clubs in the competition. The league title is taken by a Manchester United side with an average age of just 22, which finished an incredible 11 points ahead of their nearest contenders, Blackpool and Wolverhampton Wanderers. It was a Manchester double for trophies, with Manchester City winning the FA Cup, with goalkeeper Bert Trautmann famously playing on despite suffering what was later diagnosed as a broken neck in a collision with a Birmingham City player. ==Honours== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !style=\"width:15em\"|Competition!!style=\"width:15em\"|Winner!!style=\"width:15em\"|Runner- up |- |First Division||Manchester United (4)||Blackpool |- |Second Division||Sheffield Wednesday||Leeds United |- |Third Division North||Grimsby Town||Derby County |- |Third Division South||Leyton Orient||Brighton & Hove Albion |- |FA Cup||Manchester City (3)||Birmingham City |- |Charity Shield||Chelsea||Newcastle United |- |Home Championship||colspan=2|Shared by England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland |} Notes = Number in parentheses is the times that club has won that honour. * indicates new record for competition ==Awards== Football Writers' Association * Footballer of the Year \u2013 Bert Trautmann (Manchester City) Top goalscorer * Nat Lofthouse (Bolton Wanderers), 33 ==Football League== ===First Division=== Manchester United won the First Division title by 11 points, featuring a squad of players with an average age of just 22, with manager Matt Busby's emphasis on youth paying dividends and answering the critics who felt that his policy would not be able to maintain United's place among the game's elite. Second place was occupied by Blackpool, with Stanley Matthews still a dominant presence in the team in his 41st year, while Wolves finished third, FA Cup winners Manchester City finished fourth, and Arsenal completed the top five. Birmingham City finished sixth to record their best ever final position. ===Second Division=== Sheffield Wednesday crossed paths with their cross city rivals to return to the First Division by winning the Second Division title, joined by runners-up Leeds United.
