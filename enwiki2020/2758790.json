    "text": "Bradford Interchange is a transport interchange in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, which consists of a railway station and combined bus and coach station adjacent. The Interchange, which was designed in 1962, was hailed as a showpiece of European design and was opened on 14 January 1973. It is served by the majority of bus services in the city centre along with National Express Coaches, while the railway station, which is one of two in the city centre (along with ), is served by Northern and is also the terminus for Grand Central services from London King's Cross. ==Layout and facilities== The bus station concourse at Bradford Interchange The car park and entrance The main entrance with the taxi rank and car park is on a lower level, while the train platforms and bus/coach stops are on a split upper level, both separate with pedestrian access. Downstairs, in the central concourse, there are a few shops, a newsagent, a cafe and sandwich shop and a fast food outlet on the train platforms, where hot drinks are also available. Toilets are located off the main concourse. There is also a British Transport Police office and lost luggage desk, provided for passengers' concern and safety at the railway station, with a separate security and lost-luggage unit for bus travellers, on the bus concourse. A smoking ban is observed in all parts of Bradford interchange, and CCTV is also in operation with security officers and police regularly patrolling the station. The railway station has four platforms and a short bay that was previously used for the Red Star parcels facility. Platform 1 has a run-round facility for locomotive-hauled trains (mainly freight services). The track layout and associated signalling was remodelled during the course of a week-long engineering blockade from 25 October to 3 November 2008, to permit higher speeds on both routes into the station, and also allow trains to approach the station from both Leeds and Halifax simultaneously (something that was not possible with the old track configuration).\"Upgrade for Bradford Interchange\"Railnews article 25 September 2008; Retrieved 19 November 2016 ===Ticket offices=== Bradford Interchange has separate bus and train ticket outlets. The bus and Metro office, which also deals with National Express coach enquiries from a separate desk, is located in the central concourse. The train ticket office is next to the pedestrian entrance to the train platforms and is open seven days a week (except for late evenings). Escalators and lifts link the two levels and there is step-free access to all platforms.Bradford Interchange station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 30 November 2016 ==History== LMS Fairburn 2-6-4T 42072 at Bradford Exchange, 1966-67 Internal view in 1961 Platform view in 1961 Keighley & District, First Bradford Traveller and WYPTE liveried buses. The original railway station, named Bradford Exchange, was opened by the joint efforts of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and the Great Northern Railway on 9 May 1850. In 1867, the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway, which had previously used Bradford Adolphus Street, built a link to the tracks into Exchange station to join the two existing companies; Adolphus Street station was then closed to passenger use. The railway station was completely rebuilt on the same site in 1880 with ten bay platforms and two arched roofs. Constructed of wrought iron, these rested at the outer sides on plain stone walls and classical corinthian style columns down the middle. Glass covered the middle half and timber (inside)/ slate (outside) covered the outer quarters of each span. The four end screens were glazed in a fan pattern with decorative timber outer edging. The dimensions were a length of , a width of for each arch and a height of , track to apex. The railway station never had a formal frontage; instead, passengers entered by an opening in the northwest side. In its 1920s heyday, it served routes to via Ardsley (used by many of the city's through trains to London King's Cross), via and Ossett, & Halifax via Queensbury, via Cleckheaton (the Spen Valley Line) and to Leeds via the Pudsey Loop in addition to the current lines. These however had all closed by the end of 1966 - most having fallen victim to the Beeching Axe. By 1973, the railway station with its 10 platforms was deemed too large and was again rebuilt, this time on a different site slightly further south. The old Exchange station was demolished soon afterwards and was used for a time as a car park; the site now houses Bradford Crown Court and is due to be developed as a 'Justice Quarter' with new Magistrates' and Coroner's Courts. In 1977, a bus station was built alongside, and, in 1983, the station was renamed Bradford Interchange to link buses and trains in a covered environment. The bus station featured a large ridge and furrow design of overall roof, which was subsequently demolished in 1999 to allow for a rebuilding of the bus station, which was opened in 2001. This was paid for partly by the sale of some adjacent land to the south of the site and some now-surplus land on the old bus station site. During the 1970s and 1980s, the station was considered the mainline station for Bradford with express services to London King's Cross, Trans-Pennine services to Liverpool and Newcastle and summer Saturday services to the South-West. The Inter-city services were moved to Forster Square station in 1992 when the line was electrified. The station also had an adjacent Red Star Parcels terminus but, like most other mainline stations following the privatisation of British Rail, it lost this facility during the 1990s. ==Services== ===Bus and coach=== The bus station is managed by Metro. The main operators at the bus station include First West Yorkshire, Arriva Yorkshire and Yorkshire Tiger with other services run by Keighley Bus Company and TLC Travel. National Express Coaches run nationwide from the station, Bharat Coaches run coach services to Derby, Leicester, Slough and Southall and Megabus runs services to Burnley, Halifax, Huddersfield, Skipton and East Midlands Parkway railway station (with train connections to London St Pancras) as part of its Megabusplus service. Local bus services run to many destinations, including Dewsbury, Halifax, Harrogate, Huddersfield, Ilkley, Keighley, Leeds, Otley and Wakefield, as well as services within the Bradford area, such as Shipley. ===Rail=== Bradford Interchange is on the Caldervale Line and is one of the two railway stations serving the city of Bradford. The other station is Forster Square, a 10 minutes walk away. Monday to Saturday during the daytime, services run every 15 minutes between the Interchange and Leeds and hourly onwards to both York and Hull (the latter introduced at the winter 2019 timetable change. On evenings and Sundays, there are usually three services to Leeds each hour with one extended to both York and Hull (though the latter doesn't run on Sundays). In the other direction, there is a train roughly every 15 minutes to Halifax, with two trains an hour continuing to Manchester Victoria (one limited stop, the other serving all stations to Todmorden, then Rochdale only), one to and via and one to Huddersfield (plus one that terminates at Halifax). Since the summer 2019 timetable update, there is now an hourly direct service to and . Sundays, there are three services each hour to Halifax - these continuing to one of Manchester Victoria, Blackpool North via Preston or Huddersfield (hourly to each). Because of the geography of Bradford, the station was built as a terminus, with the lines in a 'Y'-formation, so trains must reverse out of the station to continue their journey. ====London services==== The station now also sees regular services to London King's Cross via Low Moor, Halifax, Brighouse, Mirfield, Wakefield, Pontefract and Doncaster. In January 2009, Grand Central had its application for train paths to run a Bradford Interchange to London service accepted by the Office of Rail Regulation.ORR Track Access Applications Decision for ECML Passenger Services - 28 January 2009 ORR Website; Retrieved 29 January 2009 Four trains per day operate, now that full approval for the service has been granted;Grand Central Rail - Future Developments www.grandcentralrail.co.uk; Retrieved 21 August 2009 these use Class 180 units and started running from 23 May 2010.RAIL issue 641 ==Ongoing improvements== The bus platforms were once more plentiful and originally featured a large 'ridge and furrow' glass roof, but this was demolished in the 1990s, following the sale of some land for an office development. The bus station was completely rebuilt in 2001. Metro are currently considering improvements to the bus and rail platforms, including better access between facilities and pedestrian access between the bus concourse and the rail platforms, to save walking down and up the escalators. The information displays were replaced in early 2009, following a modest facelift in autumn 2008, which included new signage and a repaint. In January 2010, automatic ticket barriers were installed by Northern Rail. Further improvements under the National Station Improvement Plan are proposed, which include refurbished canopies, new flooring, more lighting and CCTV, a new waiting room and extra seating. Under Network Rail's Northern Hub development, the Northern franchise, which commenced in April 2016, will reintroduce services to Liverpool and new services to via Sheffield, Manchester Airport and Chester have been announced.\u00a31.2 billion upgrade for North as Arriva wins Northern and First retains TransPennine Express Clinnick, Richard; Rail Magazine 9 December 2015; Retrieved 17 December 2015 These will form part of the new \"Northern Connect\" network and use new-build DMUs once these have been delivered in 2018.CAF awarded Arriva Rail North rolling stock contract Railway Gazette International 22 January 2016; Retrieved 27 January 2016 Network Rail upgraded the track and signalling infrastructure on the Calder Valley line in October 2018.
