The four abstract painted aluminum totem poles each measure , x x and cover Portland Streetcar catenary poles (poles supporting trolley wires). According to Scharf, \"These four Tiki Totem monikers are a fantasy come true. To realize something of this magnitude is beyond my wildest dreams. I love the way they relate to the Pacific Northwest culture as well as the universal Tiki culture, which extends from the South Pacific through the Northwest and up to Alaska. As I've said before, art should, above all, be fun, and these huge 3D forms translate that perfectly.\" The totems were funded by the Pearl Arts Foundation. The works are part of the collection of the Regional Arts & Culture Council. ==See also== * 2001 in art ==References== ==External links== * * The Deal of the Art: Public Art Comes of Age by John Motley, Metroscape (pg. 29) * Biking, Walking, Transit and More (PDF), City of Portland, Oregon Category:2001 establishments in Oregon Category:2001 sculptures Category:Abstract sculptures in Oregon Category:Aluminum sculptures in Oregon Category:Outdoor sculptures in Portland, Oregon Category:Pearl District, Portland, Oregon Category:Totem poles in the United States ",
