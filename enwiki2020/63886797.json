He died on 7 May 2020 after a 323-day hunger strike, which he had ended two days before. He was married to Sultan G\u00f6k\u00e7ek, who is also a member of Grup Yorum and detained in Silivri Prison. G\u00f6k\u00e7ek was arrested on 1 May 2019 and charged with \"establishing and leading an organisation\". He joined the ongoing hunger strike of other Grup Yorum members in June 2019. The demands of the hunger strikers were that the Turkish government end the suppression of the group, release its members from prison, and allow them to give concerts. On 4 January 2020, he and Helin B\u00f6lek turned their hunger strike into a death fast. On 14 January 2020 the prosecution demanded a life sentence for G\u00f6k\u00e7ek. In February 2020 he was released from prison, but he stayed on hunger strike together with Helin B\u00f6lek in a house in K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckarmutlu, Istanbul. On 5 May 2020 he ended his hunger strike and was transferred to a hospital for treatment. He died on 7 May 2020. The following day, mourners taking part in a ceremony in memory of G\u00f6k\u00e7ek at an Alevi cemevi in the neighbourhood of Sultangazi were halted by the police and dispersed with teargas. The police broke down the gates to the cemevi, detained several members of Grup Yorum, seized the coffin containing G\u00f6k\u00e7ek corpse. He eventually was buried in Kayseri. Members of the ultranationalist Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) took to the streets and have threatened to unearth Ibrahim G\u00f6k\u00e7ek and set his body on fire, as they view him as a terrorist. The protests caused the MHP to close the Grey Wolves offices for a while and dismiss its local chairman. == References == Category:1980 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Place of death missing Category:Place of birth missing Category:Turkish musicians Category:Hunger strikers Category:People who died on hunger strike ",
