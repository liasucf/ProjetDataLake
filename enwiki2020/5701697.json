As of December 31, 2018, it has 513 properties with 40,541 rooms. == History == The chain began as an idea by the former CEO of Marcus Corporation, Steven Marcus to create a limited-service, discount-priced motel chain. The first property, located in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, opened in 1973 and was named Budgetel (the property later became a La Quinta Inn). A prototype hotel was designed in 1984 in the form of a long, linear three or four story boxlike building covered by precast concrete slabs. This design gave the Budgetel hotels a distinctive appearance. Today, however, Baymont properties can have a variety of appearances, and some have been converted from other brands. Each hotel features oversized rooms and interior corridors.Motel in America p. 207-208 Today, Baymont Inn & Suites competes in the lower mid-priced category, along with AmericInn Hotels, La Quinta Inn, and Fairfield Inn by Marriott. This means it has a \"deluxe continental breakfast\", a swimming pool, and \"comfortable accommodations\", but no on-site dining or expansive convention facilities. The name was changed to Baymont Inn in early 1999. In July 2004, Marcus Corporation sold the Baymont chain to the La Quinta Corporation, the Dallas parent of La Quinta Inns and La Quinta Inns & Suites. In November 2005, La Quinta was sold to affiliates of the Blackstone Group for approximately $3.4B. Following that acquisition, Blackstone converted certain Baymont Inns to La Quinta and in March 2006, Blackstone sold the Baymont brand name to what was then the Cendant Hotel Group (since renamed Wyndham Hotels & Resorts). America's Best Franchising revived the Budgetel name in 2008 for a new chain. As of January 2016 there are over 400 Baymont Inns and Suites open in the United States. Former Baymont Inns retained by Blackstone Group have since transitioned to that company's La Quinta Inn brand. Most locations are in the South and the Midwest, with a handful of locations in California. Under the ownership of Wyndham Hotel Group, in 2008 Baymont Inn & Suites launched its new positioning and creative campaign focusing on its claimed \"warm, inviting, and neighborly service\". The new positioning differentiates the brand from fellow competitors within the midscale (without food & beverage) segment by promoting Baymont's \"hometown hospitality\". Entrepreneur listed Baymont as one of the fastest growing franchises in 2016. == References == == External links == * Category:Wyndham brands Category:Companies based in Morris County, New Jersey Category:Hotels in California Category:Economy of the Midwestern United States Category:Economy of the Southeastern United States Category:Hotel chains in the United States Category:Hotels established in 1973 Category:Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey ",
