Leonardi's works in the 1980s include various fill-in issues of The Uncanny X-Men and The New Mutants. He is credited, along with fellow illustrator Mike Zeck, of designing the black-and-white costume to which Spider-Man switched during the 1984 Secret Wars miniseries, and later wore for a time. According to writer Peter David, the costume began as a design by Zeck that Leonardi embellished. The plot that developed as a result of Spider-Man's acquisition of the costume led to the creation of the Spider- Man villain known as VenomDavid, Peter. \"The Wacko Theory\"; Comics Buyer's Guide June 4, 1993; Reprinted in the collection But I Digress (1994); pp. 104\u2013106 although in a 2007 Comic Book Resources story, fan Randy Schueller claims to have devised a version of a black costume for Spider-Man in a story idea that he was paid for.
