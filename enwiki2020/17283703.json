    "text": "Phengite is a series name for dioctahedral micas of composition K(AlMg)2(OH)2(SiAl)4O10 it is common for Mg or Fe2+ to substitute for Al on the Y site and a corresponding increase in Si on the Z site in the mica group formula X2Y4\u20136Z8O20(OH, F)4. Similar to muscovite but with addition of magnesium. It is a non-IMA recognized mineral name representing the series between muscovite and celadonite.Mindat.org Mineralienatlas: Phengit The silica content of phengite has been proposed as a geobarometer for the metamorphism of low grade schists.
