Later, he lectured on Iceland in Norway for a few years (1924\u201327), and became a superintendent of public libraries. His home was fairly near Reykjav\u00edk. His best work concerned portrayals of the simple sturdy seamen and countryfolk of his native region, which are often refreshingly arch in manner. He tended to do this better in short form than long. Hagal\u00edn also did well as a narrator able to capture the living speech and characteristic mode of expression of his characters. Strandb\u00faar is one of his collections of short stories. He also had success in recording and editing biographies of very diverse people, based on first-hand accounts of their own lives. In 1960 he was still alive and working on his autobiography. ==External links== * Etext on Icelandic writers * Category:1898 births Category:1985 deaths Gudmundur G. Hagalin Gudmundur G.
