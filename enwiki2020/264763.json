    "text": "Family Affair is an American sitcom that aired on CBS from September 12, 1966, to March 4, 1971. The series explored the trials of well-to-do engineer and bachelor Bill Davis (Brian Keith) as he attempted to raise his brother's orphaned children in his luxury New York City apartment. Davis's traditional English gentleman's gentleman, Mr. Giles French (Sebastian Cabot), also had adjustments to make as he became saddled with the responsibility of caring for 15-year-old Cissy (Kathy Garver) and the five-year-old twins, Jody (Johnny Whitaker) and Buffy (Anissa Jones). Family Affair ran for 138 episodes in five seasons. The show was created and produced by Edmund Hartmann and Don Fedderson, also known for My Three Sons and The Millionaire. ==Storyline== Indiana native William \"Bill\" Davis is a successful civil engineer who develops major projects all over the world. A wealthy bachelor, Bill lives in a large apartment in Manhattan's Upper East Side, and has a British manservant, Giles French (often called \"Mr. French\" or just \"French\"), as his valet. A year prior to the series, Bill's brother Bob and his wife Mary were killed in a car crash in Indiana, leaving their three children (teenager Cissy, and younger twins Jody and Buffy) orphaned, leaving them split up among family members unwilling or unable to care for them in one household. Bill's other relatives believe that he is the one most capable of supporting them, and so the three are sent to live with him in New York. Consequently, Bill's solitary lifestyle gets turned upside-down. Initially, \"Uncle Bill\" is none too anxious to have the three youngsters living with him, but he soon grows fond of them. Mr. French, who effectively becomes a nanny in addition to his valet duties, is also flustered by the erratic situation at first, but he too develops an affinity for them. Over time, the bachelor, the butler, and the three orphans find themselves becoming a close-knit family. ===Other characters=== When Sebastian Cabot became ill, Giles's brother, Nigel \"Niles\" French (John Williams) was introduced. He worked for the Davis family for nine episodes in 1967, while Giles was said to be touring with the Queen in the Commonwealth countries. In the final season, Bill hired a part-time housekeeper, Emily Turner (Nancy Walker), to assist Mr. French. Various other characters were also seen regularly, including several acquaintances of Mr. French's who are in service (most notably Miss Faversham, played by Heather Angel), colleagues of Bill's, and friends of Cissy's. ==Production== As Don Fedderson's other program, My Three Sons, had done for Fred MacMurray, Family Affair used a 60-day production schedule to accommodate Brian Keith. All of his scenes for the season would be shot in two 30-day blocks, while his co- stars would fill in after the actor's work was completed. This enabled Fedderson to harness actors like Keith and MacMurray into television commitments, while still enabling each to make motion pictures. As a result, each season had a single director for each of the 30-odd scripts. Due to the popularity of the series with girls, Buffy's doll, \"Mrs. Beasley\" (which she often carried with her), was marketed as a Mattel talking toy in the United States. Mattel went on to produce two additional dolls, as well, patterned after Buffy: the \"Tutti\"-sized Buffy and larger \"Small Talk Buffy\" (talking doll), both of which featured accompanying miniature Mrs. Beasley dolls. ==Opening== The theme song was composed by veteran television composer Frank DeVol. The opening featured credits appearing over a kaleidoscopic view of a multicolored array of gems and precious stones, suggesting \"family jewels\". Most of the episodes in the fifth season opened with either Sebastian Cabot or the twins, saying, \"Good evening, so nice of you to join us.\" and closing the episode saying, \"It's been very good of you to watch and we do hope to see you again next week on Family Affair.\" ==Cast== Main cast: Kathy Garver (Cissy), Anissa Jones (Buffy), Johnny Whitaker (Jody), Brian Keith (Bill Davis) & Sebastian Cabot (Mr. Giles French) * Brian Keith as William Sean Roger \"Uncle Bill\" Davis * Sebastian Cabot as Giles French * Kathy Garver as Catherine Allison Rachael \"Cissy\" Patterson Davis * Johnny Whitaker as Jonathan Joshua \"Jody\" Patterson Davis * Anissa Jones as Elizabeth \"Buffy\" Patterson Davis * Heather Angel as Miss Faversham, Mr. French's friend (seasons 1\u20135) * John Williams as Nigel \"Niles\" French (season 1) * Nancy Walker as Emily Turner (season 5) * John Hubbard as Theodore \"Ted\" Gaynor, Bill's business partner (season 1) * Betty Lynn as Miss Lee, Bill's secretary (seasons 1\u20132) * Sherry Alberoni as Sharon James, Cissy's girlfriend (seasons 1\u20133) * Gregg Fedderson (producer Don Fedderson's son) as Gregg Bartlett, Cissy's boyfriend (seasons 2\u20135) * Karl Lukas as Scott \"Scotty\" Parker, the doorman (seasons 1\u20133) ===Notable guest stars=== *John Agar (episode 1.28) *Herbert Anderson (episode 4.1) *Dana Andrews (episode 4.2) *Joan Blondell (episode 2.13) *Lynn Borden *Richard Bull as the apartment manager *Veronica Cartwright (episode 3.27) *Jackie Coogan (episode 2.7) *Henry Corden (episode 1.8) *Brian Donlevy (episode 1.15) *Jamie Farr (episode 3.27) as a hippie *Paul Fix (episode 4.15) *Leif Garrett (episode 5.15) *Linda Kaye Henning (episode 5.9) *Kathy Hilton (episode 5.20) *Sterling Holloway (episode 1.19) as Mr. Frack, the window- washer *James Hong *Clint Howard (episode 5.10) *Martha Hyer (episode 2.14) *Kym Karath (episode 5.22) as Wynn Cartter *Andrea King (episode 1.17) *Patric Knowles (episode 2.3) *Anna Lee (episode 2.3) *June Lockhart (episode 3.5) *Myrna Loy (episode 1.20) as a maid candidate *Keye Luke (episode 1.18) *Ida Lupino (episode 4.12) *Ann McCrea *Lee Meriwether *Erin Moran *Butch Patrick (episode 3.2) *Eve Plumb (episode 3.7) as Eve, a terminally-ill girl *Robert Reed (episode 1.14) as professor Julian Hill *Pippa Scott (episode 2.30) *Doris Singleton (episode 2.29) *Ann Sothern (episode 2.17) *Vic Tayback as a police officer *Joyce Van Patten (episode 5.11) ==Post-series== As discussed by Kathy Garver on the final season's DVD features, the show's cast suffered several deaths, most of which came prematurely: Anissa Jones (who played Buffy) died of a drug overdose (of sleeping pills) in 1976, aged 18.
