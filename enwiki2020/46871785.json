In 1988, during Operation Packer, 72 Battery supplied air cover at the Chambinga Gorge near Cyuito Cuanavale in Angola. ===Command Affiliation=== Initially the regiment was assigned to 7 South African Infantry Division, but with the raising of 9 Division, it was transferred to the new organisation. ==Regimental Symbols== ===Previous Dress Insignia=== SADF era 7 Light Anti Aircraft Regiment insignia ==Officers Commanding== * Cmdt.
