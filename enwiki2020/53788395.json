    "text": "MIBE is a synthetic, nonsteroidal antiestrogen that acts as a dual antagonist of the ER\u03b1 and the GPER. It was found to prevent estradiol-induced proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, an action that was mediated via inhibition of both receptors. The drug was synthesized in 2012. It has been suggested that drugs like MIBE might be superior agents in the treatment of breast cancer compared to current antiestrogens like tamoxifen and fulvestrant, which are antagonistic at the ER\u03b1 but were found in 2005 to be GPER agonists. ==References== Category:Antiestrogens Category:GPER antagonists Category:Enones Category:Esters Category:Indole ethers at the benzene ring ",
