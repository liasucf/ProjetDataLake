Many on the list have also been inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association ARIA Hall of Fame. A Grammy Award (originally called Gramophone Award) \u2013 or Grammy \u2013 is an accolade by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to recognise outstanding achievement in the music industry. The first Grammy Awards ceremony was held on 4 May 1959, and it was set up to honour musical accomplishments by performers for the year 1958. Australian musicians and performers have produced a wide variety of popular music which has been commercially successful on the international scene. However, success at the Grammy Awards has been quite rare for Australian musicians. The first Australian to win a Grammy was Joan Sutherland in 1961. The most successful Australians are The Bee Gees, Olivia Newton-John and Keith Urban who have won 4 Grammy Awards each. ==Categories== === Record of the Year === Record of the Year is awarded to the performer and the production team of a single song. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
