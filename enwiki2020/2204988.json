In April 2001, Six Continents bought the UK-based Posthouse Hotels business from Compass Group for \u00a3810 million, and during the following year re-branded the 79 hotels to Holiday Inn. In 2003 it de-merged into a pubs business, Mitchells & Butlers, and the remaining hotels and soft drinks business of Britvic, were renamed as InterContinental Hotels Group. ==Brands and companies== Six Continents owned, managed or franchised the hotel brands InterContinental, Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn, Holiday Inn Express, and Staybridge Suites. Its pubs and restaurants included All Bar One, Browns, Edward's, Ember Inns, Harvester, Hollywood Bowl, It's A Scream, O'Neill's, Toby Carvery and Vintage Inns. ==References== Category:Defunct companies based in London Category:Hospitality companies established in 2000 Category:Companies formerly listed on the London Stock Exchange Category:Hospitality companies disestablished in 2003 Category:British companies established in 2000 Category;British companies disestablished in 2003 ",
