    "text": "Lambert Darchis (baptised 31 July 1625; died 25 February 1699) was an arts patron from Li\u00e8ge. He is also thought to have been an ecclesiastic, but according to some sources his ordination has never been confirmed. == Life == Son of Jacques Darchis and Marguerite Froidmont, he was baptised in the church of Notre-Dame aux Fonts in Li\u00e8ge. From 1646 to his death he worked in Rome for the Roman Curia. His will was proven on 22 October 1696 and funded the creation of the 'fondation Lambert-Darchis', which granted travel bursaries to young artists, art restorers, art historians, engravers, composers and would- be ecclesiologists who had been born or were living in the city of Li\u00e9ge or the surrounding diocese.
