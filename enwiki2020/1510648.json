    "text": "Don Quixote is Canadian singer Gordon Lightfoot's 8th original album, released in 1972 on the Reprise Records Label. The album reached #42 on the Billboard album chart. The album contains little innovation on Lightfoot's trademark folk sound, although it is notable for containing Lightfoot's third seafaring song, \"Christian Island (Georgian Bay)\" (his first two being \"Marie Christine\" from Back Here on Earth and \"Ballad of Yarmouth Castle\" from Sunday Concert). Lightfoot would continually revisit nautical themes over the next ten years. Don Quixote also contains a rare Lightfoot foray into the protest song genre in the form of the longest track on the album, \"The Patriot's Dream\", a ballad describing the enthusiasm of soldiers on a troop train \"riding off to glory in the spring of their years\", followed by the pathos of a woman receiving news that her husband's aircraft had been shot down in combat. \"Beautiful\" was released as a single and peaked at #58 on the Billboard singles chart. On February 13, 1988, Lightfoot performed \"Alberta Bound\" in McMahon Stadium during the Opening Ceremonies for the 1988 Winter Olympics held in Calgary, Alberta. ==Track listing== All compositions by Lightfoot except as indicated. ===Side 1=== #\"Don Quixote\" \u2013 3:41 #\"Christian Island (Georgian Bay)\" \u2013 4:02 #\"Alberta Bound\" \u2013 3:07 #\"Looking at the Rain\" \u2013 3:40 #\"Ordinary Man\" \u2013 3:19 #\"Brave Mountaineers\" \u2013 3:36 ===Side 2=== #\"Ode to Big Blue\" \u2013 4:48 #\"Second Cup of Coffee\" \u2013 3:03 #\"Beautiful\" \u2013 3:23 #\"On Susan's Floor\" (Shel Silverstein, Vince Matthews) \u2013 2:58 #\"The Patriot's Dream\" \u2013 6:04 == Personnel == * Gordon Lighfoot - 6- & 12-string guitar * Red Shea - hi-string guitar, classical guitar, dobro * Terry Clements - lead acoustic guitar * Rick Haynes - bass * Ry Cooder - mandolin * Bob Thompson - string arrangements \"Don Quixote\" and \"The Patriot's Dream\" * Nick DeCaro - all other string arrangements ==Chart positions== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Chart !Position |- |rowspan=3|1972 |Canadian RPM 100 |1 |- |US Billboard 200 |42 |- |- |UK |44 |- |} ==References== ==External links== *Album lyrics and chords Category:Gordon Lightfoot albums Category:1972 albums Category:Albums produced by Lenny Waronker Category:Reprise Records albums Category:Works based on Don Quixote ",
