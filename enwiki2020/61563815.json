    "text": "Praobdellidae is a family of hematophagous leeches which live on the mucous membranes of mammals. These are internal parasites that enter the body through natural orifices (usually nasal cavities and pharynx, more rarely the lower respiratory tract, anus, urethra, and vagina), and cause hirudiniases. These species are characterized by a reduced number of teeth, and a posterior sucker larger than the previous one. The latter may be involved in fixation on moist surfaces such as mucous membranes. == Bibliography == == Notes and references == == External links == Category:Leeches Category:Annelid families ",
