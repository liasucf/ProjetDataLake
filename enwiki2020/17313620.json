Barron Park Elementary School was added in 1998, and Terman Middle School was reopened in 2001. In 2013 the district had 12,268 students.

As a result, steps have been taken to limit access to the tracks. Attempts have since been made to try to improve the emotional health of students attending the schools. , cluster suicide has remained a problem in the district's high schools. In February 2016, a team of suicide prevention specialists from Epidemiologic Assistance (Epi-Aids) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) paid a two-week visit to the area to determine risk factors. In July 2016, the Epi-Aids team released preliminary findings. == High schools == === Gunn High School === Gunn High School Henry M. Gunn High School is one of two public high schools in Palo Alto.

Founded in 1898, its enrollment today is over 1700 students. \"Paly\", as the school is known locally, draws high-achieving and scholastically-minded students due to the demographics of its location in the heart of Silicon Valley and its proximity to Stanford University. In 2002 Newsweek ranked it among the top 200 public high schools, based on test scores. In 2007 U.S. News & World Report ranked it #85 out of over 18,000 public high schools.

The Paly Girls Varsity Volleyball team won back-to-back state championships in 2010 and 2011. Palo Alto High School also received a multimillion-dollar performing arts center, officially opening on October 1, 2016. == Middle schools == === Greene Middle School === Greene Middle School Frank S. Greene Middle School, formerly David S. Jordan Middle School, is located at 750 N. California Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94303. The school mascot is the jaguar. The 2018\u201319 school year had 1,050 students in attendance. The student population was 54% male and 46% female. Its racial makeup was 40% Caucasian, 30% Asian, 14% Hispanic, 2% African American, and 13% Other (including multiple races). Named after Stanford University president David Starr Jordan, Jordan Middle School was founded in 1937. It was closed in 1985 due to lack of enrollment in the district, then reopened in 1991 after remodeling. A bond was approved by the city of Palo Alto in 1995 to allow for further technological upgrades to the school. The school mascot from 1937\u20131985 was a dolphin. When Jordan reopened in 1991, the students voted to have the jaguar become the mascot. In 1999, the students voted to have the dolphin returned to its status as co-mascot with the jaguar. Due to Jordan's involvement in eugenics, the school was renamed Frank Greene Middle School beginning in the 2018\u20132019 school year, after venture capitalist Frank S. Greene Jr. === J. L. Stanford Middle School === J. L. Stanford Middle School Jane Lathrop Stanford Middle School, formerly Ray Lyman Wilbur Junior High School and known locally as JLS, is located at 480 East Meadow Dr., Palo Alto, CA 94306. The school mascot is the panther. The 2018\u201319 school year had 1,137 students in attendance. The student population was 54% male and 46% female. Its racial makeup was 44% Asian, 32% Caucasian, 12% Hispanic, 1% African American, and 11% Other (including multiple races). The land that Jane Lathrop Stanford Middle School and the adjoining Fairmeadow Elementary School now sit on were once owned by three farmers. The farmers sold their land to real estate developer Joseph Eichler, who later donated the land to the district. Founded in 1953, the school was originally named after Ray Lyman Wilbur, one of the early presidents of Stanford University. After Jordan Middle School closed due to lack of enrollment in 1985, the two schools were merged at the Wilbur school location and it was renamed Jane Lathrop Stanford after Jane Stanford, the wife of Stanford University founder Leland Stanford. === Fletcher Middle School === Fletcher Middle School Ellen T. Fletcher Middle School, formerly Terman Middle School, is located at 655 Arastradero Road in Palo Alto. The school mascot is the tiger. The 2018\u201319 school year had 668 students in attendance. The student population was 54% male and 46% female. Its racial makeup was 38% Asian, 30% White, 16% Hispanic, 12% Two or More Races, 1% Black and 1% Native Hawaiian/ Pacific Islander. The original name of the school located on the site was Terman Junior High School (named after Lewis Madison Terman), unrelated to the school currently at the site. It was closed in 1978 due to declining enrollment in the district. The district placed a new middle school named Terman Middle School at the site in 1999 to deal with rising enrollment. The first school year was 2001\u20132002. The new school was named after both Terman and his son Frederick Terman, a Silicon Valley pioneer. The relocation was met with great controversy by local residents as the district sought to potentially overtake the land by eminent domain from the residing Jewish Community Center. As a result, land from the Cubberley Community Center was instead traded for the land the district needed at Terman. The JCC continued to lease district land at Cubberley until it made other plans. Beginning in the 2018\u20132019 school year the school was renamed Ellen T. Fletcher Middle School after a Palo Alto city councilwoman because the elder Terman, like David Starr Jordan, espoused eugenics. == Elementary schools == * Addison Elementary School, named after the adjacent street which takes its name from the author Joseph Addison. * Barron Park Elementary School * Duveneck Elementary School (formerly Green Gables) * El Carmelo Elementary School * Escondido Elementary School * Fairmeadow Elementary School * Juana Briones Elementary School (formerly Loma Vista) * Hoover Elementary School (formerly located on Middlefield Road at Hoover Park, also formerly located at current Barron Park Elementary site) * Lucille M.
