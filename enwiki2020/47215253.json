    "text": "Murder Creek is a tributary of the lower Conecuh River. It is primarily located in Conecuh County, Alabama. ==Origin of name== Excerpt from Albert James Pickett's History of Alabama, and Incidentally of Georgia and Mississippi, from the Earliest Period (1851): > 1788: About this time, a bloody transaction occurred in the territory of the > present county of Conecuh. During the revolutionary war, Colonel McGillivray > formed an acquaintance with many conspicuous royalists, and, among others, > with Colonel Kirkland, of South Carolina. That person was at McGillivray's > house, upon the Coosa, in 1788, with his son, his nephew, and several other > gentlemen. They were on their way to Pensacola, where they intended to > procure passports, and settle in the Spanish province of Louisiana. When > they determined to leave his hospitable abode, McGillivray sent his servant > [slave] to guide them to Pensacola. The presence of this servant would > assure the Indians that they were friends, for it was dangerous to travel > without the Chieftain's protection. Colonel Kirkland and his party had much > silver in their saddle-bags. Arriving within a mile of a large creek, which > flows into the Conecuh, they met a pack-horse party, about sunset, going up > to the nation. They had been to Pensacola, on a trading expedition. This > party consisted of a Hillabee Indian, who had murdered so many men, that he > was called Istillicha, the Man-slayer\u2014a desperate white man, who had fled > from the States for the crime of murder, and whom, on account of his > activity and ferocity, the Indians called the Cat\u2014and a blood-thirsty negro, > named Bob, the property of Sullivan, a Creek trader of the Hillabees. As > soon as Colonel Kirkland and his party were out of sight, these scoundrels > formed an encampment. The former went on, crossed the creek, and encamped a > short distance from the ford, by the side of the trading path. Placing their > saddle-bags under their heads, and reclining their guns against a tree, > Kirkland and his party fell asleep. At midnight, the bloody wretches from > the other side, cautiously came over, and, seizing the guns of Kirkland and > his men, killed every one of them, except three negroes, one of whom was the > servant of the great Chieftain, as before stated. Dividing the booty, the > murderers proceeded to the Creek nation, and, when the horrid affair became > known, Colonel McGillivray sent persons in pursuit of them. Cat was > arrested; but the others escaped. Milfort was directed to convey the > scoundrel to the spot where he had shed the blood of these men, and there to > hang him, until he was dead. Upon the journey to that point, Milfort kept > him well pinioned, and, every night, secured his legs in temporary stocks, > made by cutting notches in pine logs, and clamping them together. Reaching > the creek where poor Kirkland and his men were murdered, Cat was suspended > to the limb of a tree, the roots of which were still stained with the blood > of the unfortunate colonel and his companions. While he was dangling in the > air, and kicking in the last agonies, the Frenchman stopped his motions with > a pistol ball. Such is the origin of the name \"Murder Creek. In counter > narration, the Native American peoples who attacked the travelers most > likely only did so to defend the enslaved people owned by the murdered > travelers. Because of these Native Americans, three enslaved people became > free men.\" ==References== Category:Geography of Conecuh County, Alabama Category:Rivers of Alabama ",
