    "text": "Marguerite-Anne-Rose Delorme (10 September 1876 - 26 July 1946) was a French painter known for her Orientalist and genre paintings. ==Biography== Delorme was born on September 10, 1876 in Lun\u00e9ville, France into an upper middle class family. Her father, Edmond Delorme, was a military doctor and would later found the museum of Lun\u00e9ville. She showed an early interest in art. Her early paintings depicted themes of the family environment. She also found inspirations in Brittany where she spent the summer with the Merson family. She studied under Rapha\u00ebl Collin, Paul Leroy and Luc-Olivier Merson in their private workshops, but was unable to enter the Ecole de Beaux Artes which at the time did not accept female artists. In 1897, Delorme became a member of the Soci\u00e9taire des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais where she exhibited her paintings, winning Honorable Mention in 1897 and Medal of Third Class in 1901. In 1905, she won a scholarship which allowed her to travel to Italy. This trip introduced her to different light conditions which had an influence on her style. During the first world war, Delorme began painting the Senegalese riflemen encountered in the \"wintering camps\". These works were presented in 1921 and she won the Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Transatlantique Prize. Following this, she found inspiration in North African themes by travelling Morocco, where she journeyed around the entire country painting scenes of everyday life. Delorme died July 26, 1946 in Lille, France. Her work has been in the public domain since January 1, 2017. ==Legacy== In 2013 the Mus\u00e9e du ch\u00e2teau des Lumi\u00e8res held a retrospective of Delorme's work. ==Gallery== File:Tableau 2 Marguerite Delorme.jpg File:Tableau 1 Marguerite Delorme.jpg ==See also== * List of Orientalist artists * Orientalism == References == ==External links== * ==Further reading== Marguerite Delorme, 1876-1946: vers les lumi\u00e8res du Sud by Astrid Mallick, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-Fran\u00e7oise Crassous, Aziza Doudou Category:1876 births Category:1946 deaths Category:People from Lun\u00e9ville Category:19th-century French painters Category:20th-century French painters Category:French women painters Category:Orientalist painters Category:20th-century French women artists Category:19th-century French women artists ",
