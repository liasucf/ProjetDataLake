He also holds bests of 10.17 seconds for the 100 metres and 6.69 seconds for the indoor 60 metres. He represented his country at the 1996 Summer Olympics and competed for Belgium at four consecutive World Championships in Athletics from 1995 to 2001. He helped set a 4\u00d7100 metres relay national record on his final appearance at that competition. He was a four-time participant at the IAAF World Indoor Championships and a four-time medallist at the lower league European Cup meetings. He won 19 national titles in sprint events, combining indoor and outdoors. After his retirement, he admitted to doping during his career in his autobiography.

He remained among the Belgian elite the following year but failed to make an impact internationally, being eliminated in the heats stage at both the 1999 IAAF World Indoor Championships and the 1999 World Championships in Athletics. After a curtailed 2000 season, he returned in 2001 in strong form by winning the 60 m Belgian title in a new best of 6.70 seconds.

He was the national champion indoors in the short sprint, but did not translate these performances to the outdoor season, in which his best outing was a third-place finish in the 100 m at the Belgian Championships. Better performances came in 2006. He was the over-35 category winner of the 60 m at the World Masters Athletics Indoor Championships and claimed a 100 m individual and relay double at the European Cup 1st League.WORLD MASTERS (VETERANS) INDOOR CHAMPIONSHIPS.

Passing his mid-thirties, he ran at European Cup meetings for Belgium in 2007 and 2008 but did not medal. He brought his career to a close with a high by taking the 100 m title at the 2008 Belgian Championships.
