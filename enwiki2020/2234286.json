    "text": "Prelusive is the 2002 independent debut EP by Australian singer\u2013songwriter Sarah Blasko. A video was made for \"Your Way\", and the song received a great deal of airplay on youth radio station Triple J. The EP is called 'Prelusive' \"because that means introductory, from the word 'Prelude', which is a musical term meaning a short, independent composition\" said Blasko in a 2003 interview. \"And so I thought that word really fit because [the EP] is relatively short- only six songs, and it\u2019s independent, and it\u2019s a composition, or a number of compositions.\" The EP was re-released by Sarah's new label Dew Process (UMA DEW90062) on March 31, 2003. ==Track listing== #\"Your Way\" \u2013 4:04 #\"Will You Ever Know\" \u2013 3:45 #\"Be Tonight\" \u2013 4:59 #\"Sweet Surrender\" \u2013 4:24 #\"Follow The Sun\" \u2013 4:16 #\"New Religion\" \u2013 4:51 *Tracks 1 & 2 written by Sarah Blasko & Nicholas Schneider, 3 & 6 written by Sarah Blasko and tracks 4 & 5 written by Sarah Blasko and Hugh Wilson. ==Studio crew== * Sarah Blasko - vox, guitar, keyboards * Nicholas Schneider - guitar, keyboards, programming, flute * Willem New - bass * Jeff De Araujo - drums * Hugh Wilson - keyboards, guitar *Mixed by Steve Francis, mastered by Adam McElnea. ==External links== *Sarah Blasko's official site *Sarah Blasko fan site *Sarah Blasko Forum *Dew Process Records (Australia) *Low Altitude Records (United States) Category:2002 debut EPs Category:Sarah Blasko albums ",
