    "text": "Kerry Elizabeth Schott (born 20 September 1944) is an Australian executive who has had roles in the business and government sectors. She was managing director and CEO of Sydney Water from 2006\u20132011. She is currently chair of Moorebank Intermodal Company Ltd, a Director of NBN Co and a member of the Infrastructure Australia Board. == Early life == Schott graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with first class Honours from the University of New England, undertook a Masters of Arts at the University of British Columbia, and a doctorate in pure mathematics at Nuffield College, Oxford. == Career == Her early career included investment banking for Deutsche Bank and Whitlam Turnbull. Schott has also had roles as visiting professor at Oxford and Princeton Universities, senior NSW Treasury official, chair of the Environmental Protection Authority, adviser to the Reserve Bank of Australia and Trade Practices Commissioner. During her time as CEO of Sydney Water, Schott opposed a proposal by Australian Water Holdings (AWH) for a public- private partnership. The Independent Commission Against Corruption later heard that this proposal was part of a scheme by Eddie Obeid that would earn the Obeids up to $60 million through their secret stake in AWH. Due to Schott's opposition, Obeid lobbied Phil Costa, water minister at the time to \"sack the bitch\", but she was retained with the minister later describing her performance as \"nothing short of excellent\". She continued to stand up against the alleged corruption around her, warning Arthur Sinodinos (acting AWH chairman), that the people at AWH were dishonest. In 2014, Schott chaired a panel that reviewed NSW electoral funding. The outcome ruled out full public funding of election campaigns, an option that had been favoured by the Premier Mike Baird and opposition leader John Robertson. In 2015, Schott oversaw the sale of the Vales Point Power Station to a company owned by Trevor St Baker and Brian Flannery, for $1 million. == Recognition == In 2014 Schott accepted an Honorary Doctor of Science in Economics from the University of Sydney, which was conferred on 1 November 2014. == References == Category:Living people Category:Australian chief executives Category:Australian women in business Category:University of New England (Australia) alumni Category:University of British Columbia alumni Category:Alumni of Nuffield College, Oxford Category:1944 births Category:NBN Co people Category:Sydney Water ",
