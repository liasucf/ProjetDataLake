    "text": "Pantai Seri Kenangan - literally, the \"unforgettable beach\" - is in Kuala Tutong in Tutong District. A popular recreation area just five-minutes drive from Tutong town, the beach's appeal is the effect created by a narrow spit of land that separates the mirror-smooth Tutong River from the ruffled waters of south China Sea. Chalets, restaurant, huts, a playground and food stall are available. A little further along, the road passes the village of Kuala Tutong sheltered amidst a forest of coconut palms, to reach the old jetty. Until the Tutong Bridge was constructed in 1959, a ferry had to be used to travel between the southern district centers of Brunei and Bandar Seri Bagawan. Pantai Seri Kenangan or Seri Kenangan Beach is the nearest beach to Tutong town. Category:Tutong District ",
