Clayton in 1990. ==Host== Its type host is the Northern white-faced owl (Ptilopsis leucotis). ==Distribution== The type location is Ndola, Zambia. ==Etymology== It was named after Gary Larson, creator of the syndicated cartoon The Far Side. In a letter to Larson, Clayton praised the cartoonist for \"the enormous contribution that my colleagues and I feel you have made to biology through your cartoons.\" In his book The Prehistory of the Far Side, Larson stated, \"I considered this an extreme honor. Besides, I knew no one was going to write and ask to name a new species of swan after me. You have to grab these opportunities when they come along.\" Clayton wrote he honored Larson \"in appreciation of the unique light he has shed on the workings of nature.\" == See also == * List of organisms named after famous people * Thagomizer == References == == External links == * Curiosities of Biological Nomenclature Category:Insects described in 1990 Category:The Far Side Category:Lice Category:Parasites of birds Category:Insects of Zambia ",
