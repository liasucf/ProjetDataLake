    "text": "The Suntory Cup is a defunct invitational men's tennis tournament that was held at the Yoyogi National Stadium in Tokyo, Japan from 1978 to 1986. The indoor tournament was played in April each year and consisted of a four-man draw. The event was not recognized as an official tournament by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) or the International Tennis Federation (ITF) but still attracted the world's leading players due to the financial rewards. Jimmy Connors won the event a record four times. The 1983 edition was noteworthy as it was Bj\u00f6rn Borg's last tournament before his retirement. ==Results== ===Singles=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !style=\"width:40px\"|Year !style=\"width:100px\"|Prize Money !style=\"width:200px\"|Champions !style=\"width:200px\"|Runners-up !style=\"width:140px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |- |1978 || || Bj\u00f6rn Borg || Jimmy Connors || 6\u20131, 6\u20132 |- | style=\"background:#efefef\" | 1979 || colspan=4 align=center style=\"background:#ededed\" | Tournament not held |- |1980 || $250,000 || Jimmy Connors || John McEnroe || 7\u20135, 6\u20133 |- |1981 || $250,000 || Jimmy Connors || John McEnroe || 6\u20134, 7\u20136 |- |1982 || $250,000 || Bj\u00f6rn Borg || Guillermo Vilas || 6\u20131, 6\u20132 |- |1983 || $300,000 || Jimmy Connors || Bj\u00f6rn Borg || 6\u20133, 6\u20134 |- |1984 || $250,000 || Ivan Lendl || John McEnroe || 6\u20134, 3\u20136, 6\u20132 |- |1985 || $250,000 || Ivan Lendl || John McEnroe || 6\u20134, 6\u20132 |- |1986 || $250,000 || Jimmy Connors || Mats Wilander || 6\u20134, 6\u20130 |} ==Draws== ===1978=== ===1980=== ===1981=== ===1982=== ===1983=== ===1984=== ===1985=== ===1986=== ==See also== * Tokyo Indoor ==Notes== ==References== Category:Carpet court tennis tournaments Category:Defunct tennis tournaments in Japan Category:Exhibition tennis tournaments Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1978 Category:Recurring sporting events disestablished in 1986 Category:1978 establishments in Japan Category:1986 disestablishments in Japan ",
