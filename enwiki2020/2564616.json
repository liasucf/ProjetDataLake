    "text": "Minding the Store is a 2005 reality TV show starring Pauly Shore. The show recounted Shore's efforts to revitalize his acting career and run the family business, The Comedy Store. Shore was helped by his staff, which included manager Dean Gelber, talent booker Tommy Morris, and handyman Marlon Hernandez. The show featured several comics, including Tommy Chong, Jay London, Marc Hatchell and Ari Shaffir. The first season featured ten episodes, including Shore organizing a roster of \"hot girl\" comedians, learning jousting at Medieval Times, and a roast of Shore while he sat on a gold throne complete with a red toilet seat. Shore and TBS claimed that if anyone did not laugh while viewing the show that they would receive a dollar if they wrote to the network to ask for one. No person that wrote to request the dollar is believed to have ever received one and many were said to have been marked as \"return to sender.\" The show was canceled after its short run.
