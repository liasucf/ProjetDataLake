    "text": "Fluorine etching is a printmaking technique developed by a circle of artists working in Cracow and Warsaw in the first two decades of the twentieth century. It is likely that both the detrimental effects on the health of engravers and the fragility of the material resulted in this technique being abandoned.Waldemar Deluga, \u2018Fluorine Etching in Cracow, Warsaw and Vilnius, 1901\u201320\u2019, Print Quarterly, xxxvi, no. 2, June 2019, pp. 162\u201368. ==History== The novel way of printmaking known as fluorine etching was developed by the Polish chemist Tadeusz Estreicher (1871\u20131952) in the early years of the twentieth century. Commercial glass-makers everywhere had been using etching as a standard decoration for drinking and other glasses since the mid- nineteenth century as a cheaper alternative to engraving. Toxic hydrofluoric acid was also used to mark glass tubes used in science laboratories. For fluorine etching, however, as first described in 1912 by Hieronim Wilder, a normal glass plate was coated with colophony (a solid resin obtained from certain types of conifers), followed by the artist etching a design into it, which was then treated with hydrofluoric acid.H. Wilder, Grafika. Drzeworyt, miedzioryt, litografia. Wskaz\u00f3wki dla bibliotekarzy i mi\u0142o\u015bnik\u00f3w sztuki, Lw\u00f3w, 1912, p. 37. The glass plate was inked, wiped and printed using a rolling press in the same way as a traditional etched copperplate, with the printer carefully avoiding the danger of the glass breaking under the pressure of the rollers. The glass easily shattered, which may have been why not many prints in this technique were made or have survived. A glass matrix had previously been used in France for clich\u00e9-verres by Fran\u00e7ois Millet, Camille Corot and Charles Daubigny, among others. In this method, instead of etching an image, a drawing was made with a needle on a glass panel coated with collodion, a chemical used in classical photography. The composition was then exposed to light on a photosensitive paper, as in a photographic process.[G. Monnier and M. Servot], \u2018Quelques termes propres aux techniques de la gravure\u2019, in Hommage \u00e0 Corot : Peintures et dessins des collections fran\u00e7aises, Paris, 1975 p. 178. == Current uses == Estreicher suggested to a friend of his, the Polish painter Stanis\u0142aw Wyspia\u0144ski (1869\u20131907), the idea of applying the technique used to mark glass tubes to a glass plate for artistic purposes. Wyspia\u0144ski developed many compositions in this technique, dubbed fluorine etching, but now only five are known, of which three are represented in Polish collections. This unusual printmaking technique was met with interest among other Polish artists working in Cracow and Warsaw, such as Ferdynand Ruszczyc (1870\u20131936), Ewa Aszer-Librowicz (1883\u20131943) \u2013 sister of the Jewish architect and artist Jerzy Aszer (1884\u20131944) \u2013 Janina Bobi\u0144ska (1894\u20131973), Boles\u0142aw Czarkowski (1873\u20131937), Mikalojus Konstantinas \u010ciurlionis (1875\u20131911), Ignacja Johnowa (1867\u20131953), Jadwiga Kernbaum\u00f3wna (life dates unknown, but in 1912 she was a member of the Association Jung Art), Eugeniusz Morawski-D\u0105browa (1871\u20131948), Maria P\u0142onowska (1878\u20131955), Emilia Wysocka (1888\u20131973) and Zygmunt Kami\u0144ski (1888\u20131969).For Aszer-Librowicz, see K. Prochaska, J\u00f3zef Kramsztyk: Pasjans rodzinny, towarzyski, literacki i naukowy, Warsaw, 2018, pp. 116\u201319. Another artist fascinated by the new technique was Leon Wycz\u00f3\u0142kowski (1852\u20131936), who, as mentioned in his memoirs, made his first fluorine etching, a self-portrait in five colours, in May 1904.L. Wyczo\u0142kowski, Listy i wspomnienia, edited by M. Twardowska, Wroc\u0142aw, 1960, p. 110. The print is signed and dated L. Wycz\u00f3\u0142. / 1904. M. Treter, Grafika Leona Wycz\u00f3\u0142kowskiego, Cracow, 1925, p. 19.\u2018Graphics\u2019, http://ciurlionis.eu/en/graphics/. The last artist to use the fluorine etching technique was Stanis\u0142aw D\u0105browski (1882\u20131973), by whom two prints of 1920, today kept in the National Library in Warsaw, are known. ==References== Category:History of printing Category:Fluorine Category:Etching ",
