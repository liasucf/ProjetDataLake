Known as \"Mr Lachlan\" he was \"a man of undissembled piety, great integrity, and remarkable for his zeal, sacred eloquence, and usefulness.\" As the parish minister, he submitted an Account of the Parish of Lochcarron to Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster's Old (or First) Statistical Account of Scotland, published between 1791 and 1799. He appended a poem created for the occasion, Statistical Account of Lochcarron, which Sir John read to the House of Commons. He produced a number of notable poems.
