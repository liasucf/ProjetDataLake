contemporary epic. Evident throughout is a profound imagination, matched only by the poet's ability to create a republic of conscience that is ultimately ours, too\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/02/18/deaf-republic In The New York Times, Parul Sehgal says: \"I was stunned by Ilya Kaminsky's Deaf Republic, lyric poems presented as a play in two acts, set in a country in crisis, inspired both by Odessa, where Kaminsky grew up, and America, where he now lives. It's a book about censorship, political apathy, torture \u2014 \"the nakedness / of the whole nation\" \u2014 but also about tomato sandwiches, the birth of a daughter and the sudden, almost shocking joys of longtime married life.\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/books/critics-roundtable-year-in- books.html In The Guardian, Fiona Benson says: \"I fell hard for Ilya Kaminsky's Deaf Republic. Part folklore, fable, war story and love poem, it imagines an occupied town falling deaf in response to the shooting of a child.
