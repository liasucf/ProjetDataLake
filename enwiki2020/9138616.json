    "text": "Gundoland or Gundeland was the mayor of the palace of Neustria from 613 to his death. According to the Liber Historiae Francorum, he was nobilis, egregius, and industrius: noble, outstanding, and diligent. Gundoland succeeded Landric, possibly his brother, for both were recorded as uncles of Saint Aldegunda. Gundoland was succeeded by Aega on appointment of Dagobert I sometime before this latter's death in 639. Gundoland died sometime before that. He ruled for 26 years. ==Sources== *Medieval Lands Project. Merovingian Nobility. * Category:Mayors of the Palace Category:7th-century deaths Category:Year of birth unknown ",
