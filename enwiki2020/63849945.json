    "text": "The Attack on \u0160abac was attack of the united rebel forces of the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland, forces of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and Pe\u0107anac Chetniks against German forces garrisoned in \u0160abac in Axis-occupied Yugoslavia (modern-day Serbia) in period between 21\u201426 September 1941, during the Uprising in Serbia. The commander of all forces was Chetnik Captain Dragoslav Ra\u010di\u0107, commander of the Chetnik Cer Detachment composed of five companies with about 1,500 soldiers. Ra\u010di\u0107 participated in the battle contrary to instructions of his superior commander Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 who refused to allow Chetniks to attack much stronger and well prepared German garrison in \u0160abac. The Partisan forces of the communist party composed of three detachments with about 1,100 soldiers were commanded by Neboj\u0161a Jerkovi\u0107 while forces of 500 Pe\u0107anac Chetniks were commanded by Bogdan Ili\u0107 \u2013 Cerski. The Axis forces were under supreme command of General Franz B\u00f6hme. The \u0160abac garrison initially had one battalion and one company from 704th and 718th Division reinforced by the 342nd Infantry Division and unknown unit of Croatian Usta\u0161e. The Axis garrison in \u0160abac was aware of rebel plans for attack and was well prepared for defence. The attack began during the night on 22 September and lasted until 26 September, with rebels repeated attacks during the night and retreating in the dawn without being able to defeat German garrison. There are indications that Partisans retreated on 24 September. The rebels failed to capture \u0160abac and retreated from the region of Ma\u010dva until the end of September in front of advancing Axis forces. The casualties of the rebels are unknown, but the German and Croatian retributions were devastating, with 1,130 executed civilians, 21,500 imprisoned and most of the populated places in Ma\u010dva completely burned down. Eventually, at the end of World War II in Yugoslavia, the communist led Partisan forces captured \u0160abac in autumn 1944, killed at least 177 people from \u0160abac in communist purges and established the communist regime which lasted for almost fifty years. == Background == === Emergence of two resistance movements === During the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia the German forces occupied \u0160abac on 13 April 1941.:\"\u0423 \u043d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0459\u0443 13. \u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0426\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0438, \u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u043e\u043a\u0443\u043f\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0443\u0448\u043b\u0430 \u0458\u0435 \u0443 \u0428\u0430\u0431\u0430\u0446\" Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 and group of Yugoslav officers gathered on Ravna gora in May 1941 and marked the beginning of the establishment of Chetnik detachments of Yugoslav Army as the earliest organized resistance movement in Axis occupied Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Communists (illegal political party in Yugoslavia since 1921) decided to start with armed resistance on 4 July 1941, three days after they received an order from the Comintern and a day after Stalin issued his order on 3 July 1941. Dragoslav Ra\u010di\u0107, the commander of all rebel units during the attack on \u0160abac === Preparations for joint attack of both resistance units === On 25 August Ra\u010di\u0107 and Jerkovi\u0107 composed and sent a letter to Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107 asking for his approval for joint action of Chetniks and Partisans against the Axis forces, emphasizing that there is atmosphere of population of the region for united struggle against the occupiers. Mihailovi\u0107 did not approve the attack on \u0160abac since rebel forces were still weak and because the German garrison was well prepared for the attack, emphasizing that it is irrational to capture \u0160abac without being able to capture the territory on the left bank of river Sava. Nevertheless, on 28 August Ra\u010di\u0107 and Jerkovi\u0107 agreed to attack \u0160abac together with Ra\u010di\u0107 being the main commander of all units. On 1 September the Chetnik Cer Detachment and Partisan Podrinje Detachment issued a joint proclamation emphasizing their intention to struggle against the occupying forces together. == Forces== === Rebel forces === The rebel forces were composed of three different factions: * Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland forces * Communist controlled Partisan forces * Chetniks of Kosta Pe\u0107anac Ra\u010di\u0107 was commander of all forces attacking \u0160abac, the Chetniks, the Partisans and detachment of Pe\u0107anac Chetniks commanded by Budimir Ili\u0107 \u2013 Cerski. The deputy commander was Neboj\u0161a Jerkovi\u0107 while political commessair was Danilo Leki\u0107 \u0160panac. The Chetnik forces had about 1,500 soldiers while the communist Partisan forces had about 1,000 soldiers, while Pe\u0107anac Chetniks commanded by Cerski had about 500 men. Two units of the Serbian State Guard were dispatched by General Milan Nedi\u0107 to break the siege of \u0160abac but Ra\u010di\u0107 and Jerkovi\u0107 convinced them to join the rebels. The forces of the Yugoslav Army in the Fatherland consisted of Cer Detachment commanded by Ra\u010di\u0107, and composed of the following companies: * Cer company commanded by the Lieutenant Ratko Teodosijevi\u0107 * \u010coke\u0161ina company * Ma\u010dva company commanded by Lieutenant Nikola Soki\u0107 * Machine gun company commanded by Lieutenant Voja Tufegd\u017ei\u0107 * Prnjavor company * Martinovi\u0107-Ze\u010devi\u0107 unit commanded by Vlada Ze\u010devi\u0107 and Ratko Martinovi\u0107 The communist forces were composed of the following NOP Detachments: Podrinjski (or Ma\u010dvanski), Posavski and Valjevski. === Axis forces === The Axis forces in \u0160abac had 3rd battalion of the 724th Infantry regiment of 704th Division and 5th company of 750th regiment of 718th Division. == Battle == === Besieging \u0160abac === Veselin Misita, commander of Chetnik Jadar Detachment who led the capture of Loznica on 31 August 1941 The joint Chetnik and Partisan forces in other parts of the region of Ma\u010dva started their cooperation and scored several important victories against the Axis forces. In the Battle of Loznica waged on 30 August 1941, the rebels commanded by Chetnik commander Veselin Misita captured Loznica from Axis forces. On 3 September 1941 the rebels captured Bogati\u0107 from Axis occupying forces with both resistance groups claiming credits for this capture. After the Capture of Banja Kovilja\u010da by the rebel forces on 6 September 1941, most of the region around \u0160abac was under rebel control and the town was almost completely blocked by the rebel forces. === Preparation of German forces === To avoid surrender, the German garrisons in U\u017eice and Po\u017eega were retreated from these towns swiftly captured by Chetniks right after the German retreat. On the other hand, already besieged German garrison in \u0160abac organized extensive preparations for rebel attack, including cutting all corn fields and woods around the town, securing their command buildings, preparation of the shelters made of bags with sand, erecting barbwire barricades and securing the entrances to the city. The German forces even destroyed some houses which they thought could serve as barricade for attacking rebels. === Attack on \u0160abac === The exact date for rebel attack on \u0160abac was delayed two times, it was first set for 10 September and then for 17 September, and the rebel leaders agreed on their meeting in \u0160titar held on 19 September 1941 to set the final date for attack on \u0160abac to be 21 September. That was the same day when the popular \u0160abac Fair was traditionally organized on the day of Orthodox religious holiday of the Nativity of Mary. On 21 September 1941 the rebels commanded by Dragoslav Ra\u010di\u0107 attacked \u0160abac. The artillery fire from Be\u0107a's hill in 11pm signaled the beginning of the rebel attack. The rebels planned to cut the German garrison from their retreat route across the bridge on river Sava and capture them all in \u0160abac. During the night the fighting took place on the periferry of the \u0160abac, while only small group of rebels managed to enter the city center, but could not hold it and retreated early in the morning of 22 September together with all other rebel units. The rebels did not repeat their attacks during the day on 22 September. During the night, on 22 September the rebels again attacked \u0160abac, again in 11pm, almost exactly the same way like the night before. The Partisans attacked toward central part of the town known as Kami\u010dak, while Chetniks attacked from army barracks and cemetery near bridge. Although significant parts of the town was captured by the rebels, they failed to defeat German garrison until the dawn when they again retreated, again without repeating the attack during the day on 23 September. Further plans for attack were halted after the arrival of the German 342nd Infantry Division when joint command decided to cancel further attacks and prepare for the defence in their positions. The 342nd Infantry Division, under command of Generalleutnant (Major General) Dr. Walter Hinghofer, entered \u0160abac on 23 September. According to some indications, the Partisans retreated from \u0160abac on 24 September 1941 while Ra\u010di\u0107 and his Chetniks continued with the battle until 26 September 1941. == Retribution and Axis recapture of Ma\u010dva == In the night between 23 and 24 September General Franz B\u00f6hme ordered capture of all male population of \u0160abac of age between 14 and 70 to be imprisoned in the concentration camp north of river Sava. On the same night the units of German army and smaller number of Usta\u0161e forces arrived to \u0160abac to help to execute this order and to clean the region of Ma\u010dva from rebel forces. Until the end of September all territory of Ma\u010dva was again captured by Axis forces with final balance of 1,130 executed and 21,500 imprisoned civilians, while most of populated places were burned. On 4 October 1941 there was the first \"peaceful contact\" between rebels in Serbia and German occupying forces when Captain Ra\u010di\u0107 sent a letter to the commander of the Company of German Infantry Regiment in \u0160abac. == Aftermath == At the end of September and beginning of October, the significant part of the territory of Serbia was under rebel control. It encompassed almost all territory of Western Serbia except German garrisons in \u0160abac, Valjevo and Kraljevo. About one million people lived on the rebel-controlled territory where both resistance movements organized a separate mobilization of the armed units. The German command in Serbia under Franz B\u00f6hme employed additional forces and organized Operation \"Cleansing of the Sava region\":\"NEMA\u010cKA OPERACIJA \u201e \u010cI\u0160\u010cENJA LUKA SAVE \u201c\" which started on 24 September 1941. Until the end of October recaptured all major populated places in this region were reoccupied by the German forces. Because the communist forces began with the second phase of the communist revolution on the territories they controlled (so-called Leftist errors), they antagonized both Chetniks and the local population as well, and were forced to almost completely leave Serbia until the end of 1941. When the conflict between Chetniks and communist-led Partisans began, Vlada Ze\u010devi\u0107 and Ratko Martinovi\u0107 with most of their Chetniks defected to Partisans. At the end of World War II, the German army strategically retreated in front of the advancing Soviet Red Army which allowed Yugoslav communist forces to take control over Axis occupied Serbia, including \u0160abac in Autumn 1944. The Yugoslav communist established their regime in \u0160abac and the rest of Yugoslavia which lasted for almost fifty years. After the regime of communists in Serbia ended, the Government of Serbia and its Ministry of Justice established the commission to research atrocities that were committed by members of the Yugoslav Partisan Movement after they gained control over Serbia in Autumn 1944. According to the report of this commission, out of 55,554 registered victims of communist purges in Serbia, the new communist regime in \u0160abac killed 177 people while 8 people are missing. == Legacy == Monument to Neboj\u0161a Jerkovi\u0107 in Belgrade The post-war communist regime emphasized the role of the communist forces, ignoring the resistance actions of Chetniks during the battle for \u0160abac. The monument to Neboj\u0161a Jerkovi\u0107 was erected in Belgrade while the whole part of the city was named against Neboj\u0161a and his brother Du\u0161an (urban neighborhood Bra\u0107e Jerkovi\u0107) who both died in battle against Axis in 1941, Neboj\u0161a in December 1941 near \u0160abac and Du\u0161an in November 1941 near U\u017eice. == References == == Sources == * * * * * * * * * Category:Battles of World War II involving Chetniks Category:Battles of World War II involving Germany Category:Yugoslavia in World War II Category:1941 in Serbia Category:September 1941 events ",
