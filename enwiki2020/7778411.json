    "text": "Wintu-Nomlaki traditional narratives include myths, legends, tales, and oral histories preserved by the Wintu and Nomlaki people of the western Sacramento Valley in northern California. Winto-Nomalki oral literature is in many respects typical of central California, but it also reflects influences from Northwest Coast, Plateau, and Great Basin regions.
