They were the seventh tier of the German football league system. Until the introduction of the 3. Liga in 2008 it was the sixth tier of the league system, until the introduction of the Regionalligas in 1994 the fifth tier. ==Overview== The seven Bezirksoberligas were introduced in 1988 to create a highest single-division playing level for each of the seven Bezirke. Before that the Bezirksligas were located right below the Landesliga in the pyramid. They were created upon suggestion of the 1. FC Sonthofen. 50 Jahre Bayerischer Fussball-Verband, publisher: Bayerischer Fussball-Verband, year: 1996, page: 100 However, it took this club till 1998 to gain promotion to the Bezirksoberliga Schwaben. The winners of the seven Bezirksoberligas are automatically promoted to their respective Landesliga. The second-placed teams face a series of play-off matches to determine one or two more promotion spots. Teams relegated from the Bezirksoberliga drop into the Bezirksliga of which there are usually two, except Oberbayern where there are three. Only one club has won a Bezirksoberliga four times, the TSV Kottern from Schwaben. The German term \"Bezirksoberliga\" is best translated as \"County Premier League\". The Bezirke are political and administrative units similar to a county in size. With the league reform at the end of the 2011\u201312 season, which includes an expansion of the number of Landesligas from three to five, the Bezirksoberligas were disbanded. Instead, the Bezirksligas took the place of the Bezirksoberligas below the Landesligas once more.Untere Ligen erfahren eine Aufwertung Augsburger Allgemeine, published: 11 April 2011, accessed: 2 May 2011 The clubs from the Bezirksoberligas joined the following leagues:Auf- und Abstiegsregelung der Bayernliga und der Landesligen f\u00fcr das Qualifikationsspieljahr 2011/2012 Bavarian FA website - Regulations for promotion and relegation in 2012, accessed: 16 July 2011 * Champions: Promotion round to the Bayernliga, winners to the Bayernliga, losers to the Landesliga. * Teams placed 2nd to 6th: Directly qualified to the Landesliga. * Teams placed 7th or worse: Between two and six additional Landesliga places, according to the size of the Bezirk, to be determined in a play-off round with the Bezirksliga champions.
