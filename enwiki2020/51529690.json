    "text": "Ballot paper used in the election Parliamentary elections were held in Cuba on 11 March 2018 to elect members of the National Assembly of People's Power. Prior to the elections, President Ra\u00fal Castro declared he would not be seeking a new term, and a new President of the Council of State will be elected by the National Assembly. His deputy, Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, was subsequently elected as the new president. However, Castro remained the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, the most senior position in the country. ==Electoral system== All Cuban citizens who are over the age of 18 years, and possess full political rights for at least five years prior to the election are eligible to partake within the election. 50% of candidates must be nominated by people from the municipality and elected by direct vote in local assemblies, where people decide who they consider to have the qualities to best represent them. The other 50% of candidates are proposed by nominating assemblies which comprise representatives of workers, youth, women, students, and farmers, as well as members of the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution. The final list of candidates, which corresponds to the number of seats to be filled, is drawn up by the National Candidature Commission taking into account criteria such as candidates' merit, patriotism, ethical values, and revolutionary history. Voter requirements are set within article 132 of the Cuban constitution. All voters must be Cuban citizens who have reached the age of 16 years, who have not been declared mentally disabled by a court, and who have not committed a crime. The electoral system is designed to give the winner of the election a majority. To be declared elected, one candidate must obtain more than 50% of the valid votes cast in the constituency in which they are running. If this is not attained, the seat in question remains vacant unless the Council of State decides to hold a second round of voting. ==Results== On 12 March, the Cuba National Election Commission (CNE) released preliminary results. In a press conference, the CNE reported that all 605 candidates had been elected as Deputies to the National Assembly. Selective votes refer to voters who voted for either their National Assembly Deputy, or their Provincial Representative, but not both. {| class=wikitable style=text- align:right !Option !Votes !% !Seats |- |align=left|Full list||5,620,713||80.44||rowspan=2|605 |- |align=left|Selective vote||1,366,328||19.56 |- |align=left|Invalid/blank votes||412,850||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left|Total||7,399,891||100||605 |- |align=left|Registered voters/turnout ||8,639,989||85.65||\u2013 |- |align=left colspan=4|Source: Granma |} ===By province=== {|class=wikitable style=text-align:right !rowspan=2| Province !rowspan=2| Registered voters !colspan=2| Votes cast !colspan=2| Valid votes !colspan=2| Blank !colspan=2| Invalid !colspan=2| Full list !colspan=2| Selective votes |- !Votes !% !Votes !% !Votes !% !Votes !% !Votes !% !Votes !% |- |align=left|Pinar del R\u00edo |452,557 |406,119 |89.74 |379,920 |93.55 |23,006 |5.66 |3,193 |0.79 |305,462 |80.40 |74,458 |19.60 |- |align=left|Artemisa |393,143 |350,063 |89.04 |324,559 |92.71 |18,907 |5.40 |6,597 |1.88 |255,543 |78.74 |69,016 |21.26 |- |align=left|La Habana |1,685,651 |1,339,335 |79.46 |1,249,381 |93.28 |59,786 |4.46 |30,168 |2.25 |927,031 |74.20 |322,350 |25.80 |- |align=left|Mayabeque |296,126 |268,505 |90.67 |250,362 |93.24 |12,775 |4.76 |5,368 |2.00 |204,511 |81.69 |45,851 |18.31 |- |align=left|Matanzas |561,179 |475,331 |84.70 |451,222 |94.93 |17,920 |3.77 |6,189 |1.30 |346,461 |76.78 |104,761 |23.22 |- |align=left|Villa Clara |611,358 |534,310 |87.40 |501,251 |93.81 |25,839 |4.84 |7,220 |1.35 |411,103 |82.02 |90,148 |17.98 |- |align=left|Cienfuegos |311,355 |267,999 |86.08 |248,235 |92.63 |15,199 |5.67 |4,565 |1.70 |190,965 |76.93 |57,270 |23.07 |- |align=left|Sancti Sp\u00edritus |366,885 |327,047 |89.14 |310,411 |94.91 |13,418 |4.10 |3,218 |0.98 |257,337 |82.90 |53,074 |17.10 |- |align=left|Ciego de \u00c1vila |337,785 |287,988 |85.26 |272,968 |94.78 |12,130 |4.21 |2,890 |1.00 |218,873 |80.18 |54,095 |19.82 |- |align=left|Camag\u00fcey |591,944 |504,258 |85.19 |481,600 |95.51 |17,989 |3.57 |4,669 |0.93 |375,618 |77.99 |105,982 |22.01 |- |align=left|Las Tunas |404,948 |353,654 |87.33 |337,536 |95.44 |13,430 |3.80 |2,688 |0.76 |283,174 |83.89 |54,362 |16.11 |- |align=left|Holgu\u00edn |785,047 |668,636 |85.17 |625,983 |93.62 |36,099 |5.40 |6,554 |0.98 |529,379 |84.57 |96,604 |15.43 |- |align=left|Granma |629,155 |555,399 |88.28 |529,381 |95.32 |21,680 |3.90 |4,338 |0.78 |461,487 |87.17 |67,894 |12.83 |- |align=left|Santiago de Cuba |781,000 |683,462 |87.51 |660,473 |96.64 |19,966 |2.92 |3,023 |0.44 |554,642 |83.98 |105,831 |16.02 |- |align=left|Guant\u00e1namo |368,864 |321,155 |87.07 |309,834 |96.47 |9,559 |2.98 |1,762 |0.55 |256,748 |82.87 |53,086 |17.13 |- |align=left|Isla de la Juventud |62,992 |56,630 |89.90 |53,925 |95.22 |2,253 |3.98 |452 |0.80 |42,379 |78.59 |11,546 |21.41 |- |align=left|Total |8,639,989 |7,399,891 |85.65 |6,987,041 |94.42 |319,956 |4.32 |92,894 |1.26 |5,620,713 |80.44 |1,366,328 |19.56 |- |colspan=14 align=left|Source: Granma |} ==Notes== ==References== Category:2018 elections in the Caribbean Category:2018 in Cuba 2018 Category:March 2018 events in North America Category:One-party elections Category:Single-candidate elections ",
