    "text": "Led Zeppelin's 1971 North American Tour was the seventh concert tour of North America by the English rock band. The tour commenced on August 7 and concluded on 17 September 1971. It included two warm-up shows in Montreux, Switzerland. This tour took place just prior to the release of the band's fourth album. The band had hoped to release this album in time for the tour, but various delays prevented this from occurring.Lewis, Dave and Pallett, Simon (1997) Led Zeppelin: The Concert File, London: Omnibus Press. , p. 64. This was the longest break that the band had from touring North America to date, with their last tour there having taken place almost a year previously. During the interim, the hard rock band Grand Funk Railroad had asserted its influence on the American music market, and Led Zeppelin was keen to re-establish their live reputation through this stint of concert performances. The new material from the fourth album which was presented by the band on stage was very well received by audiences, which helped to ensure massive sales of that album when it was eventually released in November 1971. The tour is also notable for the high frequency of crowd disturbances which occurred at the concerts, including those at New York City, Toronto and Boston, as the bootlegs of these concerts attest. Before this tour, Robert Plant shaved off his beard, a style which he and the rest of his bandmates had adopted the year before. John Paul Jones followed suit a month later. However, Jones would later grow a beard in late 1972 and keep it until March 1973, and then have a mustache for part of the 1973 North American Tour, and also have a beard from late 1975 to early 1977. It was on this tour that the notorious \"Folding Chair Incident\" took place. On August 26, at the show in Houston, several fans threw folding chairs at the stage in protest to what were perceived as overpriced tickets. No one was injured, and the show continued without any more interruptions. On this tour, the band grossed $1 million.Chris Welch (1994) Led Zeppelin, London: Orion Books. , p. 65. ==Tour set list== The fairly typical set list for the tour was: #\"Walk Don't Run\" (only on 22 August) #\"Immigrant Song\" (Page, Plant) #\"Heartbreaker\" (Bonham, Page, Plant) #\"Since I've Been Loving You\" (Page, Plant, Jones) #\"Out on the Tiles\" (intro) (Page, Plant, Bonham) / \"Black Dog\" (Page, Plant, Jones) #\"Dazed and Confused\" (Page) #\"Stairway to Heaven\" (Page, Plant) #\"Celebration Day\" (Jones, Page, Plant) #\"That's the Way\" (Page, Plant) #\"Going to California\" (Page, Plant) #\"What Is and What Should Never Be\" (Page, Plant) #\"Moby Dick\" (Page, Jones, Bonham) #\"Whole Lotta Love\" (Bonham, Dixon, Jones, Page, Plant) Encores (variations of the following list): *\"Communication Breakdown\" (Bonham, Jones, Page) *\"Organ Solo\" (Jones) / \"Thank You\" (Page, Plant) *\"Rock and Roll\" (Page, Plant, Jones, Bonham) (On 21 August, 3 September, and 7 September) *\"Weekend\" (Post) (on 21 August only) There were some set list substitutions, variations, and order switches during the tour. ==Tour dates== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! style=\"width:150px;\"| Date ! style=\"width:200px;\"| City ! style=\"width:140px;\"| Country ! style=\"width:220px;\"| Venue |- !colspan=\"4\"|European warm-up shows |- |7 August 1971 | rowspan=\"2\"|Montreux | rowspan=\"2\"|Switzerland | rowspan=\"2\"|Montreux Casino |- |8 August 1971 |- !colspan=\"4\"|North America |- |19 August 1971 | Vancouver | Canada | Pacific Coliseum |- |20 August 1971 | Seattle | rowspan=\"12\" |United States | Seattle Center Coliseum |- |21 August 1971 | rowspan=\"2\"|Inglewood | rowspan=\"2\"|The Forum |- |22 August 1971 |- |23 August 1971 | Fort Worth | Tarrant County Convention Center |- |24 August 1971 | Dallas | Memorial Auditorium |- |26 August 1971 |Houston |Sam Houston Coliseum |- |27 August 1971 | San Antonio | Municipal Auditorium |- |28 August 1971 | St. Louis | St. Louis Arena |- |29 August 1971 | New Orleans | Municipal Auditorium |- |31 August 1971 | Orlando | Orlando Sports Stadium |- |1 September 1971 | Pembroke Pines | Hollywood Sportatorium |- |3 September 1971 | New York City | Madison Square Garden |- |4 September 1971 | Toronto | Canada | Maple Leaf Gardens |- |5 September 1971 | Chicago | rowspan=\"9\"|United States | Chicago Amphitheater |- |6 September 1971 | Boston | Boston Garden |- |9 September 1971 | Hampton | Hampton Coliseum |- |10 September 1971 | Syracuse | Onondaga Veterans Auditorium |- |11 September 1971 | Rochester | War Memorial Auditorium |- |13 September 1971 | rowspan=\"2\"|Berkeley | rowspan=\"2\"|Berkeley Community Theatre |- |14 September 1971 |- |16 September 1971 | rowspan=\"2\"|Honolulu | rowspan=\"2\"|Neal S.
