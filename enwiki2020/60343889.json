He was the prior of the Order of Santo Stefano and thus the palace gained the title of the Palazzo del Priorino. The design is attributed to Jacopo Lafri, although Tigri hypothesizes Bernini.

In 1833 it was bought by Stefano Corsini, who granted in 1892 to the Mantellate nuns.Pistoia e il suo territorio: Pescia e i suoi dintorni: guida del forestiero, by Giuseppe Tigri, Tipografia Cino, Pistoia (1853): page 286.
