The R150 travels east from the Drogheda's Bull Ring to the Meath coastal towns of Bettystown and Laytown, via Mornington. From Laytown the road turns west to Julianstown and crosses the M1 (no junction) en route to Duleek. The Julianstown\u2013Duleek section underwent a major \u20ac20 million improvement project from October 2006 to September 2008, a year longer than scheduled.
