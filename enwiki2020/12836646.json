She was built to the draught of designed by Sir Edward Hunt, though with a modified armament. In 1794 Queen Charlotte was the flagship of Admiral Lord Howe at the Battle of the Glorious First of June, and in 1795 she took part in the Battle of Groix. ==Fate== The Burning of the Queen Charlotte of 110 Guns Lord Keith's flagship off the Harbour of Leghorn, in the Mediterranean, 17 March 1800 At about 6am on 17 March 1800, whilst operating as the flagship of Vice-Admiral Lord Keith, Queen Charlotte was reconnoitering the island of Capraia, in the Tuscan Archipelago, when she caught fire. Keith was not aboard at the time and observed the disaster from the shore. The fire was believed to have resulted from someone having accidentally thrown loose hay on a match tub. Two or three American vessels lying at anchor off Leghorn were able to render assistance, losing several men in the effort as the vessel's guns cooked off in the heat. Captain A. Tod wrote several accounts of the disaster that he gave to sailors to give to the Admiralty should they survive. He himself perished with his ship. The crew was unable to extinguish the flames and at about 11am the ship blew up with the loss of 673 officers and men. ==Citations== ==References== * * Lavery, Brian (2003): The Ship of the Line - Volume 1: The development of the battlefleet 1650-1850.
