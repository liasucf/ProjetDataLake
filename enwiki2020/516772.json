    "text": "A Cuban sandwich () is a variation of a ham and cheese sandwich that likely originated in cafes catering to Cuban workers in Tampa or Key West,\"Sink teeth into quest for best Cuban sandwich\" - The Miami Herald, 15 August 2010 two early Cuban immigrant communities in Florida centered around the cigar industry. Later on, Cuban exiles and expatriates brought it to Miami, where it is also very popular. The sandwich is made with ham, roasted pork, Swiss cheese, pickles, mustard, and sometimes salami on Cuban bread. Salami is included in Tampa, where there is a large Italian population, but is not usually included in South Florida.Cuban Sandwich History, \"What's Cooking America The Cuban sandwich is at the center of a long-running friendly rivalry between Miami and Tampa. As part of that rivalry, the \"Historic Tampa Cuban Sandwich\" was designated the \"signature sandwich of the city of Tampa\" by the Tampa City Council in 2012. ==History== As with Cuban bread, the origin of the Cuban sandwich (sometimes called a \"Cuban mix,\" a \"mixto,\" a \"Cuban pressed sandwich,\" or a \"Cubano\"Tom Scherberger, Cuban Sandwich Wars Inflame Passions in Tampa and Miami, Visit Florida (accessed May 31, 2016).) is murky.Tampa claims the Cuban sandwich as its own, but Miami begs to differ - Tampa Bay Times In the late 1800s and early 1900s, travel between Cuba and Florida was easy, especially from Key West and Tampa, and Cubans frequently sailed back and forth for employment, pleasure, and family visits. Because of this constant and largely undocumented movement of people, culture and ideas, it is impossible to say exactly when or where the Cuban sandwich originated. Some believe that the sandwich was a common lunch food for workers in both the cigar factories and sugar mills of Cuba (especially in big cities such as Havana or Santiago de Cuba) and the cigar factories of Key West by the 1860s. Historian Loy Glenn Westfall states that the sandwich was \"born in Cuba and educated in Key West.\" The cigar industry in Florida shifted to Tampa in the mid-1880s, when the immigrant community of Ybor City was founded by cigar manufacturer Vicente Martinez-Ybor. Tens of thousands of Cuban, Spanish, and Italian workers moved to the area over following decades, jumpstarting the growth of Tampa from a village to a bustling city. The first recorded mentions of a distinct Cuban sandwich survive in descriptions of workers' caf\u00e9s in Ybor City and nearby West Tampa from around 1900, leading other historians to theorize that the sandwich as now constituted first appeared there.\"Tampa history is traced in its sandwich\" - The Tampa Tribune A travel article published by the Mason City Globe Gazette in 1934 said that Tampa's cooking was \"much more distinctive than elsewhere in the state\" and lists Cuban sandwiches (along with Cuban bread) among the city's \"signature foods\". Researcher Andrew Huse states that \"the old 'mixtos' coalesced into something more distinct \u2013 the Cuban sandwiches we know and love \u2013 an original Tampa creation.\" By the 1960s, Cuban sandwiches were also common on Miami cafeteria and restaurant menus, as the city had gained a large influx of Cuban residents after Fidel Castro's 1959 rise to power in their native land. The Communist Revolution caused a wave of Cuban expatriates to settle in other locations as well, and they brought their culture and cuisine with them. Cuban sandwiches and variations thereof are now served in various Cuban exile communities in places such as New York City, New Jersey, Chicago, and Puerto Rico, among others. ==Ingredients== Cuban sandwiches being prepared at La Segunda Central Bakery in Ybor City, Tampa Key West version of a \"Cuban mix\" with lettuce and tomato Although there is some debate as to the contents of a \"true\" Cuban sandwich, most are generally agreed upon. The traditional Cuban sandwich starts with Cuban bread. The loaf is sliced into lengths of 8\u201312 inches (20\u201330 cm), lightly buttered or brushed with olive oil on the crust, and cut in half horizontally. A coat of yellow mustard is spread on the bread. Then sliced roast pork, glazed ham, Swiss cheese, and thinly sliced dill pickles are added in layers. Sometimes the pork is marinated in mojo and slow roasted. The main regional disagreement about the sandwich\u2019s recipe is whether or not to include salami. In Tampa, Genoa salami is traditionally layered with the other meats, probably due to the influence of Italian immigrants who lived side-by-side with Cubans and Spaniards in Ybor City. A 1934 travel article describes a Tampa Cuban sandwich as a \"complete meal\" consisting of ham, lean pork, Swiss cheese, soft salami, dill pickle and a \"liberal moistening of mustard\" served on \"very crisp and crusty\" Cuban bread. These ingredients are reiterated 27 years later in the first and all subsequent editions of The Gasparilla Cookbook (1961), a still-popular collection of Tampa cuisine. Salami is not an ingredient in the South Florida version of the Cuban sandwich, and its inclusion or lack thereof is a major point of contention in the Tampa\u2013Miami sandwich rivalry. Mayonnaise, lettuce, and tomato are possible additions but are frowned upon by traditionalists. When assembled, the sandwich can be toasted in a sandwich press called a plancha, which is similar to a panini press but without grooved surfaces. The plancha both heats and compresses the sandwich, which remains in the press until the bread surface is slightly crispy and the cheese is melted. It is usually cut into diagonal halves before serving. ==Related dishes== A similar sandwich is the medianoche (\"midnight\") sandwich; as the name suggests, the sandwich originated as a late-night snack, likely in the night clubs of Havana. The medianoche contains the same ingredients as the Cuban sandwich, but is smaller and, unlike a Cuban, is served on yellow-colored egg bread (similar to challah), which is softer and sweeter than Cuban bread.Raquel R\u00e1bade Roque, The Cuban Kitchen (Alfred A.

The debate has been covered by several national and international news outlets, and a related content dispute on this Wikipedia article was the topic of a 2007 newspaper column in the Tampa Tribune. During a 2012 flare-up of the debate, the Tampa City Council voted to name the \"Historic Tampa Cuban Sandwich\" as the city's official \"signature sandwich\", leading to several more rounds of banter between public figures in Tampa and Miami. ===Other connections=== *In May 2012, Victor Padilla and Jolie Gonzalez-Padilla organized the first Cuban Sandwich Festival, which was held in Tampa and included the building of the \"World's Longest Cuban Sandwich\" and a competition for the best Cuban sandwich among local and statewide restaurants. The festival has been held annually since, and the competition has grown to include entrants from across Florida, the US, and other countries competing in several categories. The organizers have also held smaller festivals with preliminary sandwich competitions in Miami and Kissimmee, Florida.Cuban Sandwich Festival official website *In the 2014 film Chef starring Jon Favreau, the main character drives across the United States selling Cuban sandwiches (referred to as \"Cubanos\") from a food truck called El Jefe. *In 2016, Christopher Spata, a writer for the Tampa Bay Times, sent press releases to a variety of news organizations and online holiday databases touting a fictional \"National Cuban Sandwich Day\" as an experiment to see if people would celebrate a \"made-up\" food holiday. Several news sources and websites added the date (August 23) to their list of holidays, and the event has since been celebrated in a growing number of locations ever since. Spata's story about his experiment appeared on the front page of the tbt* tabloid newspaper in Tampa and was picked up by national news outlets.Christopher Spata, (23 August 2016).
