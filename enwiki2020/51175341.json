Two years later, he landed his first leading role in a Korean television series. He has played a diverse array of characters in multiple film and television projects ranging from the first doctor to establish a western hospital in 1880s Korea in the period drama Jejungwon, to a diabolical double agent in the Korean blockbuster action series Athena: Goddess of War, to a world-renowned chef who learns about traditional Korean cuisine in the family drama Feast of the Gods.

Returning to English speaking roles, in 2014, he starred in a short film executive produced by Michelle Yeoh entitled Morning Star and the 2015 movie Ktown Cowboys, executive produced by Ken Jeong, which premiered at South by Southwest.
