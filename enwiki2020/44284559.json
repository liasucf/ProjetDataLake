And both versions were also included on the 1994 number-one album release, Innerst i sjelen. ==Background== The duet between Sissel and Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Fire in Your Heart, was recorded in a canteen in Lillehammer before the opening of the 1994 Winter Olympics. Because of the tight schedules of both Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Sissel, they had only a few hours to record this English version of the Olympics anthem before the opening ceremony. When they recorded the song in the canteen, coffee cups and food could still be seen on the tables!Soprano Sissel sings for the love of singing The Boston Globe ==Track listing== ==Charts== In Norway Se ilden lyse reached number-one on VG-lista topp 20 and stayed on this list for nine weeks, with three weeks as number one.http://lista.vg.no/artist/sissel-kyrkjeboe/922 The international single- release, Fire in Your Heart peaked on number nine on Sverigetopplistan - Singles top 60 in Sweden and managed to stay on this list for six weeks.http://swedishcharts.com/weekchart.asp?year=1994&date;=19940311&cat;=s The duet-version with Pl\u00e1cido Domingo peaked on number twenty in Switzerland and on number 26 in Germany.Charts.nz ===Se ilden lyse=== ====Weekly charts==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1994) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"|Denmark (IFPI) | 17 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) | 27 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Norway (VG-lista) | 1 |- |} ===Fire in Your Heart=== ====Weekly charts==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1994) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"|Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) | 9 |- |} ====Year-end charts==== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !scope=\"col\"| Chart (1994) !scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"|Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) | 90 |- |} ===Fire in Your Heart (duet with Pl\u00e1cido Domingo)=== ====Weekly charts==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1994) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"|Germany (Media Control Charts) | 26 |- ! scope=\"row\"|Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade) | 20 |- |} ==References== Category:1994 singles Category:1994 songs Category:Sissel Kyrkjeb\u00f8 songs Category:Pl\u00e1cido Domingo songs Category:Universal Records singles Category:1994 Winter Olympics Category:Number-one singles in Norway Category:Norwegian songs Category:English-language Norwegian songs ",
