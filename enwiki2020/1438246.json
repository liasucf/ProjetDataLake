    "text": "Daniel Oliver, FRS (6 February 1830, Newcastle upon Tyne \u2013 21 December 1916) was an English botanist. He was Librarian of the Herbarium, Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew from 1860\u20131890 and Keeper there from 1864\u20131890, and Professor of Botany at University College, London from 1861\u20131888. In 1864, while at UCL, he published Lessons in Elementary Biology, based upon material left in manuscript by John Stevens Henslow, and illustrated by Henslow's daughter, Anne Henslow Barnard of Cheltenham. With a second edition in 1869 and a third in 1878 this book was reprinted until at least 1891. Oliver regarded this book as suitable for use in schools and for young people remote from the classroom and laboratory. He married in 1861 and was the father of two daughters and a son, Francis Wall Oliver. ==References== ==External links== *Daniel Oliver, Keeper of the Herbarium, Royal Gardens, Kew (1864\u20131890) | Art UK Category:1830 births Category:1916 deaths Category:Academics of University College London Category:English botanists Category:Botanists active in Kew Gardens Category:British pteridologists Category:Botanists with author abbreviations Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Royal Medal winners Category:English librarians Category:Taxon authorities of Hypericum species ",
