St Anne, (Anna Selbdritt), 1490-1500 AD, ArchbM Olomouc Museum ==Background== In the 13th century, Jacobus de Voragine incorporated apocryphal accounts from the Protoevangelium of James regarding the parents of the Blessed Virgin Mary in his Golden Legend. The cult of St. Anne spread rapidly and she became one of the most popular saints of the Latin Church. Saint Anne was recognized as the patroness of grandparents, women in labor, and of miners, Christ being compared to gold, and Mary to silver. Holweck, Frederick. \"St. Anne.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 29 August 2017 Inscriptions on some medieval church bells indicate that Saint Anne was invoked for protection against thunderstorms.Nixon, Virginia. Mary's Mother: Saint Anne in Late Medieval Europe, Penn State Press, 2004, p.133, ==Mother and daughter== The subject of Saint Anne and the Virgin and Child was a popular subject in both painting and sculpture. This was due in part to its universality \"\u2014the love and tension between generations and also between humanity and the divine.\"\"It's a Family Affair\", The Economist The Anna Selbdritt style, popular in northern Germany in the 1500s, demonstrates the medieval focus on the humanity of Jesus.\"Anna Selbdritt Statue\", Diocese of Lexington St. Anne's motherhood of Mary was viewed as mirroring Mary motherhood of Jesus.Welsh, Jennifer. \"The Cult of St. Anne in Medieval and Early Modern Europe\", Routledge, 2016, In 1497, the German Benedictine Abbot Johannes Trithemius, in his De purissima et immaculate conception virginis Marie et de festivitate sancta Annematris eius linked the Immaculate Conception to devotion to St. Anne. While the matter of the Immaculate Conception remained a subject of debate between philosophers and theologians, the depiction of Joachim and Anne Meeting at the Golden Gate was sometimes interpreted as a symbolic representation of the conception of Mary. Anne was revered as the avia Christi (grandmother of Christ), matriarch of the Holy Kinship, a devout lay person and exemplary mother. ==Iconography== Museum M Leuven, Sedes Sapientiae Fourteenth-century images of Saint Anne with the Virgin and Child were often modeled on the earlier Sedes Sapiientiae (Throne of Wisdom) motif. Mary was often shown as a much smaller figure than her mother. As devotion to St. Anne developed 14th century, sometimes a statue of the Madonna and Child was modified to include the additional figure of St. Anne. Anne's traditional colors are green and red, although often she is shown wearing the more sober colors of an older women. The infant Jesus is frequently nude, again emphasizing his humanity. ==Depictions== Italian Renaissance painter Masaccio took up the subject around 1424. Leonardo da Vinci did an oil painting on this theme for the Church of Santissima Annunziata in Florence. Albrecht D\u00fcrer made an oil painting on wood around 1519 on the same subject.\"Virgin and Child with Saint Anne\", The Met Bartholom\u00e4us Bruyn the Elder painted Virgin and Child with Saint Anne, Saint Gereon, and a Donor c. 1520.Virgin and Child with Saint Anne, Saint Gereon, and a Donor, Art Institute Chicago Around 1606 Caravaggio undertook a commission from the Confraternity of Sant' Anna dei Palafrenieri. He depicted the Virgin and Child treading on the head of the serpent, observed by St. Anne, who was the patron saint of the Palafrenieri.\"Madonna and Child with St. Anne\", Caravaggio.org. ==Gallery== File:Leonardo da Vinci - Virgin and Child with St Anne C2RMF retouched.jpg|Leonardo da Vinci, c.1503 File:Egenburg Hauptstr Kirche 017 Hl Anna Selbdritt.jpg|Anna Selbdritt, Egenburg File:Wehr, Kirche - Anna selbdritt (2014-10-01 869).JPG|Anna selbdritt in Wehr around 1450 File:P\u00f6ggstall Pfarrkirche Anna Selbdritt 01.JPG|Anna Selbdritt, Lower Austria 1480 File:MCC-42227 Anna-te-Drie\u00ebn (1).tif|Anna-te-Drie\u00ebn, Netherlands, c.1495 File:Santa Ana, el Ni\u00f1o Jes\u00fas y la Virgen (Benson).jpg|Santa Ana, el Ni\u00f1o Jes\u00fas y la Virgen (Benson), c.1495 File:Cornelis Engebrechtsz. - Virgin and Child with St Anne - WGA7523.jpg|Virgin and Child with St Anne, Cornelis Engebrechtsz, c.1500 File:Saint Anne with the Christ Child, the Virgin, and Saint John the Baptist A29067.jpg|St Anne with Christ Child, the Virgin, and St John the Baptist, Baldung c.1511 ==Byzantine iconography== Annunciation to Anne, 11th-century mosaic, Chora Church, Istanbul, with Joachim seen reclining at upper-right Eastern depictions of the apocryphal narrative mimic the scriptural account of the annunciation of the Angel Gabriel to Mary and take the form of a reclining Agios Joachim beside a double-vesicled fountain or well,11th-century mosaic Daphni monastery Greece depicting annunciation to Anna and Joachim) implying Mary's perpetual virginity flows from the mystery of her Immaculate Conception in the womb of her mother Agia Anna in linear fashion conform with Eastern creedal statements on the procession of the Holy Spirit.
