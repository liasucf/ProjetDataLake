She created the initial product at home, and tested it first with her father and brother. The three decided they had a marketable product and further developed the recipe and packaging. The name \"Red Eye Louie's Vodquila\" came about when the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau rejected their initial proposal of marketing the product under the simple name \"Vodquila\", claiming that the family had created an entirely new product category (vodquila) and therefore needed a more specific brand name for their product. == Product information == Red Eye Louie's Vodquila is currently available in the following sizes: * 700ml glass / 6 pack * 750ml glass/ 6 pack * 750ml glass/ 12 pack * 375ml glass/ 24 pack * 50ml plastic/ 60 pack * 50ml glass / 50 pack 1 liter size bottles are planned in the second quarter of 2016. == Awards == {| class=\"wikitable\" !
