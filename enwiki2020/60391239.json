Completion of the course is one of the requirements for the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM) certification, as well as an acupuncture licensing requirement in most states. ==Course content== The Clean Needle Technique course is a one-day program composed of a lecture portion, a demonstration of practical application, a written exam, and a practical exam. The instruction portion of the course is on the same day as the exam portion. Applicants have only one chance to pass the written exam and two chances to pass the practical exam. The theoretical portion is based on the Clean Needle Technique Manual published by the CCAOM.
