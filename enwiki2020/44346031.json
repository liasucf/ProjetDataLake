A Mirror in the Roadway: Literature and the Real World. Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press, 2005. ==Early life and education== Dickstein was born in New York City to Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9s from Europe. He grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and was raised Orthodox Jewish. Dickstein attended a Yeshiva for 12 years before doing his undergraduate work at Columbia University. During this period Dickstein also attended the Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS) in order to \u201cmodernize\u201d the Hebrew education he had received during his time at the Yeshiva. At JTS, Dickstein studied under Abraham Joshua Heschel. Moving away from Orthodox Judaism, Dickstein dropped out of the Seminary after three and half years, during his final semester of undergraduate work at Columbia.Boynton, Robert. \"Between Generations: A Conversation with Morris Dickstein.\" Minnesota Review 55-56 (2002). Initially thinking he would become a journalist or lawyer, during his sophomore year at Columbia Dickstein read Jacques Barzun\u2019s Teacher in America and Lionel Trilling\u2019s The Liberal Imagination. These works convinced him that he could continue to do professionally what he loved to do as a student\u2014read and write about literature. The Liberal Imagination introduced Dickstein to \u201cliterary criticism as an art and a calling.\u201d Dickstein graduated from Columbia with a B.A. in 1961 and an M.A. from Yale in 1963. From 1963 to 1964 he studied at Clare College, Cambridge, before returning to Yale to receive his PhD in 1967. Harold Bloom directed Dickstein's dissertation, entitled The Divided Self: A Study of Keats\u2019 Poetic Development. ==Teaching career== For the majority of his professional career, Dickstein has taught in the CUNY system, chiefly at Queens College and at CUNY Graduate Center, while maintaining strong ties with Columbia via the school's \u201cSeminar on Theory of Literature\u201d and the \"Seminar on American Studies.\" Additionally, he has served on the board of trustees for the Columbia Daily Spectator since 1977. He founded The Center for the Humanities at CUNY Graduate Center in 1992. He was named \u201cDistinguished Professor of English\u201d by CUNY in 1994. ==Selected works== ===Dancing in the Dark: A Cultural History of the Great Depression=== Published in 2009 by W.W. Norton & Company, Dickstein's cultural history of the U.S. in the 1930s considers the complicated dynamic between art and entertainment in the decade, suggesting that the era produced a wide array of popular culture that shares an interest in how \u201cordinary people lived, how they suffered, interacted, took pleasure in one another, and endured.\u201dDickstein, Morris. Dancing in the Dark: A Cultural History of the Great Depression. New York: W.W. Norton, 2009. p. xiv. A sizable portion of Dancing in the Dark focuses on what is typically thought of as \"escapist\" entertainment from the decade. The book is filled with extended analyses of the decade's most popular sorts of entertainment: the musicals of Busby Berkeley, the performances of Humphrey Bogart, the films of Frank Capra, and the dance routines of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. It also contains lengthy analyses of movements and works that are typically thought of as \"high culture\": the Art Deco movement, the novels of William Faulkner, Orson Welles\u2019 Citizen Kane, and the orchestral pieces of Aaron Copland. Maureen Corrigan at NPR calls Dancing in the Dark \u201ca penetrating work of cultural history\u201d and \u201ca thrill to read\u201d because of Dickstein's \u201czesty voice\u201d and \u201clightly worn erudition.\u201dCorrigan, Maureen. \"A Waltz Through Depression-Era Art and Culture.\" 22 September 2009. Accessed 10 October 2014. The book was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award in Criticism. ===Leopards in the Temple: The Transformation of American Fiction, 1945 \u2013 1970=== Published in 2002 by Harvard University Press, Leopards in the Temple is a collection of essays about post-WWII U.S. fiction, film, and culture. Dickstein's work in this book provides a corrective to the common characterization of the 1950s as a time exclusively of conformity and conservatism. He identifies the \u201cstrong radical undercurrents that led directly to the culture wars of the 1960s\u201d through a close examination of the \u201cstream of outsider figures who would do more than anything else to define the character of postwar writing\u201d:Dickstein, Morris. Leopards in the Temple: The Transformation of American Fiction, 1945-1970. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2002, p. 4. Ralph Ellison, Flannery O\u2019Connor, Norman Mailer, and Jack Kerouac, among others. Authors of popular literary fiction in the 1950s, these writers expressed deeply felt cultural anxieties about conformity, race, technology, and patriarchy, even as the culture-at-large was in the midst of unparalleled economic prosperity. Dickstein points to the popularization of Freud\u2019s theories, and to the Film Noir of the period, in order to deflate the \u201cselective cultural memory\u201d of the 1950s as a time of \u201csunny, even mindless optimism.\u201d The Los Angeles Times writes that Leopards in the Temple is the most \u201clucid and enjoyably written study of postwar American fiction to have come along in years.\u201dSiegel, Lee. \"The Postwar Fate of American Fiction.\" The Los Angeles Times. 26 May 2002.
