This season was Burton's inaugural season in the Football League and saw them finish comfortably in mid-table at 13th, challenging for the play-off places throughout the season. However, there was little success in other competitions. Despite reaching the second round of the FA Cup, 5-1 defeats against Reading and Chesterfield condemned the Brewers to defeat in the opening rounds of the League Cup and Football League Trophy. Paul Peschisolido completed his first full season in management alongside assistant Gary Rowett. Shaun Harrad finished as top goalscorer with 22 goals in all competitions, whilst Tony James was awarded the club's Player of the Year. ==Players== ===First-team squad=== :Squad at end of season ===Out on loan=== ==Squad statistics== ===Goalscorers=== :As of 8 May 2010.
