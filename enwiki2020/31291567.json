    "text": "\"Honey Come Back\" is a song written by Jimmy Webb, and recorded by the American country music artist Glen Campbell. It was released in January 1970 as the second single from his album Try a Little Kindness. The song peaked at number 2 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. It also reached number 1 on the RPM Country Tracks chart in Canada. A video was produced for the song, featuring Campbell sitting by a fireplace composing a letter \u2013 presumably of his thoughts and feelings for his girlfriend, who has left him. The video has aired on Great American Country. ==Versions by other artists== The song was first recorded in 1965 by singer Dorsey Burnette during his stint at Motown's country subsidiary Mel-o-dy. It was not issued at the time and only resurfaced in 2006, when it appeared on the compilation The Complete Motown Recordings 1964-1965.
