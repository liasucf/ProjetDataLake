    "text": "The 1995 Carolina Panthers season was the franchise's inaugural season in the National Football League and the 1st under head coach Dom Capers. They went 7\u20139, the best debut year for any expansion franchise since the NFL's inception. The Panthers would go on to make the playoffs in only their second season in 1996. The Panthers played their first season's home games at Clemson University because Bank of America Stadium was still under construction after a deadline point in 1995 for scheduling Carolina's first set of NFL games. ==Offseason== The Panthers were jokingly called \"Buffalo Bills South\" because of the large number of former Bills on the roster. Quarterback Frank Reich, wide receiver Don Beebe, tight end Pete Metzelaars and linebacker Carlton Bailey had played key roles in the Bills' run of four consecutive Super Bowls earlier in the 1990s and were on the Panthers' inaugural roster. Furthermore, the team's general manager was longtime Bills GM and executive Bill Polian. (See also the 2001 San Diego Chargers season, in which a similar situation arose when John Butler brought several former Bills with him to San Diego after being fired.) ===Expansion draft=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:95%; text-align:center; width:80%\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" | Draft order ! rowspan=\"2\" | Player name ! rowspan=\"2\" | Position ! rowspan=\"2\" | Former NFL team |- !
