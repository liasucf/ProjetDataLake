    "text": "Uakari (, ) is the common name for the New World monkeys of the genus Cacajao. Both the English and scientific names are believed to have originated from indigenous languages. The uakaris are unusual among New World monkeys in that the tail length (15\u201318 cm) is substantially less than their head and body length (40\u201345 cm). Their bodies are covered with long, loose hair but their heads are bald. They have almost no subcutaneous fat, so their bald faces appear almost skull-like. Like their closest relatives the saki monkeys, they have projecting lower incisors. These monkeys have the most striking red facial skin of any primate. Females choose their mates based on how red the male's face is. Evidence suggests that the red facial coloration reflects the health of the primate. The four species of uakari currently recognized are all found in the north-western Amazon basin. The bald uakari, remarkable for its brilliant scarlet complexion,Wolfe, A. (1997) Primates, San Francisco: Chronicle Books, p. 159 is found north of the Amazon River, and south of the Japur\u00e1 River in the Mamirau\u00e1 Sustainable Development Reserve. The black-headed uakari is found north of the Amazon and south of the Rio Negro. The Neblina uakari is found north of the Rio Negro, west of the Rio Maraui\u00e1 and east of the Casiquiare canal. The Arac\u00e1 uakari is currently known only from the Rio Curuduri basin. Uakaris are typically lethargic and silent in zoo conditions, but in the wild they are agile and active, capable of leaps of over 6 meters. They have been observed both in small groups and in larger troops of up to 100. When traveling through the forest they move in the lower branches of the trees, though when foraging they also go up to the canopy. They eat fruit, nuts, buds and leaves. Uakari are found in neotropical Amazon flooded or riparian forests, including Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela. ==Species== There are four species in this genus: * Genus Cacajao ** Bald uakari or red uakari, C. calvus *** Cacajao calvus calvus *** Cacajao calvus ucayalii *** Cacajao calvus rubicundus *** Cacajao calvus novaesi *Black-headed uakari species group ** Golden-backed uakari, Cacajao melanocephalus ** Arac\u00e1 uakari, Cacajao ayresi* ** Neblina uakari, Cacajao hosomi* In 2014 Ferrari et al. proposed an alternative taxonomy which recognizes the Arac\u00e1 uakari as a subspecies of the golden-backed uakari, and also recognized Cacajao ouakary as a separate species. This revision is not universally accepted.
