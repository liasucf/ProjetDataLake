    "text": "AVB-7.62 is a battle rifle designed by Anatoly F. Baryshev that derived from his weapon operating system. It is characterized by significantly reduced recoil. ==Variants== === AB-7.62 and AB-5.45 === It have nearly 2/3 common part that borrowed from the AKM and AK-74. The 5.45 version was not to be interested due to the futility of already low-powered 5.45 cartridges that are not really need to reduce recoil. The weapon externally differs from the AKMS is only in the absence of a gas tube (a carrying handle is installed instead of it) and a different stock design. Due to such small differences, their balancing is almost the same, although the folding butt is undoubtedly more convenient than AKMS's, and but the difference in shooting is significant: the recoil is almost not noticeable, the barrel wasn't be thrown up, its pointing center is maintained, and the direction of shooting is maintained without effort. It's easy to shoot, although the weapon's behavior didn't make much impression. Apparently, because the 7.62 mm assault rifle cartridge is not quite powerful, in order to feel the advantages of the new design, you need to shoot more than one hundred rounds. According to its tactical characteristics, the AB-1(AB-7.62) has almost no difference from the AKM, but it allows the shooter to performing a much more accurate automatic firing at a greater distance than the last. == Derivatives == ===KPB-12.7 and ARGB-85=== ARGB-85 is a 30mm automatic grenade launcher under standard VOG-17 grenades. The KPB-12.7 is based on ARGB-85 and chambered with 12.7\u00d7108mm cartridge. It was not to be interested due to its constructive analogy with the ARGB-85.Still with no recoil - Baryshev Weapon Systems (in Russian) During the test, it shows a very impressive recoil reduction effect made it easily usable by handheld with half of weight to the general AGS-17. Because of Baryshev recoil-reducing operation, this weapon can be fired from the shoulder, but it still has drawbacks that are common with all other Baryshev weapons \u2013 insufficient reliability and inferior accuracy when performing single shots than conventional weapon mechanisms. RAG 30 is its improvement (unlicensed), as its prototype, ammo feeding is supplied from the magazine located on top of the receiver, it is possible to replenish the magazine without removing it. == See also == * AEK-971 * AK-107 * Kord machine gun * AGS-30 * List of Russian weaponry * List of firearms ==References== ==External links== *Modernfirearms *Baryshev rifle video * Still with no recoil - Baryshev Weapon Systems (in Russian). * Demonstration tests in military unit 68665 by the Armed Forces of the Republic of Kazakhstan (in Russian) Category:Assault rifles of the Soviet Union Category:Trial and research firearms of the Soviet Union ",
