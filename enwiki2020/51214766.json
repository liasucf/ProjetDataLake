His name (\"Ti\u00e3o\", a nickname for \"Sebasti\u00e3o\") is in memory of Rio de Janeiro's patron saint, Saint Sebastian (S\u00e3o Sebasti\u00e3o). He was tall and weighed . ==History== Ti\u00e3o started to become popular in the 1980s for his temperament, regarded as constant \"bad mood\" and having the habit of throwing mud and feces on the visitors of the zoo, especially politicians such as Marcello Alencar. Ti\u00e3o became a celebrity in Brazil, when in 1988, the comedians who ran newspapers Casseta Popular and Planeta Di\u00e1rio (who would later join forces as Casseta & Planeta), jokingly created his extra official candidature for mayor as a protest in defence of null voting. At the time, voting was written on papers instead of registered using voting machines. It is estimated that more than 400,000 ballots were cast for him, and he reached third place in an election with 12 candidates. Because of that, he is now on the Guinness World Records as the most voted chimpanzee in the world. As Ti\u00e3o was not a registered candidate, all his ballots were considered as null. In 1996, the voting system in Brazil was changed to electronic machines, so votes could no longer be cast for non- registered candidates. Macaco Ti\u00e3o had always attracted enormous attention and had a special place in the zoo, built especially for him. Nationally famous, various Brazilian newspapers and the French Le Monde reported the news of his death, in December, 23 of 1996. Ti\u00e3o died of diabetes at the age of 34. The city of Rio de Janeiro declared official mourning of three days, with the flags of Rio de Janeiro's Zoo being flown at half-staff. His body was taken to the primate center of the state of Rio de Janeiro (Centro de Primatologia do Estado do Rio de Janeiro - CPRJ), in the Guapimirim city, where his skeleton is preserved. ==References== Category:Animals in politics Category:1988 in Brazil Category:Individual chimpanzees ",
