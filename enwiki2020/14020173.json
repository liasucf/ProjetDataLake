    "text": "The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chamb\u00e9ry, Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne, and Tarentaise (Latin: Archidioecesis Camberiensis, Maruianensis et Tarantasiensis; French: Archidioc\u00e8se de Chamb\u00e9ry, Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne et Tarentaise) is an archdiocese of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic Church in France and a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Lyon. The archepiscopal see is Chamb\u00e9ry Cathedral, located in the city of Chamb\u00e9ry. The archdiocese encompasses the department of Savoie, in the Region of Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes. The current archbishop is Mgr. Philippe Ballot, formerly a priest in Besan\u00e7on. The diocese was created in 1779, from the Diocese of Grenoble, after a complicated earlier history. It became an archdiocese in 1817, even though at that point it was not within French territory. ==History== In 1467, in the ducal chapel built for the Holy Winding-Sheet (Santo Sudario, better known as the Turin Shroud) by Amadeus IX of Savoy, and the Duchess Yolande of France, Pope Paul II erected a chapter directly subject to the Holy See, and his successor Pope Sixtus IV, united this chapter with the deanery of Savoy. In 1515 Pope Leo X published a papal bull making the deanery an archbishopric, but Francis I of France objected, and it was only in 1775 that this deanery was separated from the Diocese of Grenoble by Pope Pius VI, who, in 1779, created it a bishopric with the see at Chamb\u00e9ry. Co-Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Saint-Jean- de-Maurienne The Duchy of Savoy, politically subject to the King of Sardinia, had thenceforth four bishoprics: Chamb\u00e9ry, the diocese of Saint-Jean de Maurienne, diocese of Tarentaise, and Geneva (with residence at the diocese of Annecy). In October, 1792, the commissaries to the Convention formed the constitutional Diocese of Mont-Blanc, with Annecy as the see and Lyons as the metropolitan. The Concordat of 1802 created a Diocese of Chamb\u00e9ry and Geneva, suffragan of the archdiocese of Lyons. A Bull dated 17 July 1817, made Chamb\u00e9ry, once more a city of the Sardinian States, the seat of an archdiocese, with the diocese of Aosta for suffragan; the Dioceses of Annecy (re-established in 1822), Saint-Jean-Maurienne, and Tarentaise (in 1825), soon also became suffragans of Chamb\u00e9ry. After the annexation of Savoy to France, in 1860, this condition continued, except that the Diocese of Aosta was made a suffragan of the archdiocese of Turin. Co-Cathedral of St. Peter in Mo\u00fbtiers The Cistercian Abbey of Hautecombe, founded in 1135, is one of the burial places of the House of Savoy. The relic known as the Holy Winding-Sheet of Christ was kept at Chamb\u00e9ry until 1598, in which year the Duke of Savoy had it transported to Turin, where St. Charles Borromeo wished to venerate it. Notre- Dame de Myans (antedating the twelfth century), where St. Francis de Sales officiated, and Notre-Dame de l'Aumone at Rumilly (thirteenth century), whither Francis I of France went as a pilgrim, are still places of pilgrimage. The Sisters of St. Joseph, an order devoted to teaching and charitable work, were founded at Chamb\u00e9ry in 1812. On 16 December 2002 the Archdiocese of Chamb\u00e9ry became a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Lyon and ceased to be a Metropolitan. ==Bishop== * 1780\u20131793 Michel Conseil ==Archbishops== * 1802\u20131805, Ren\u00e9 des Monstiers (or de Moustier) de M\u00e9rinville, also Bishop of Dijon * 1805\u20131823, Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e-Yves De Solle (or Desolle or Dessole), also bishop of Digne * 1824\u20131827, Fran\u00e7ois-Marie Bigex, also bishop of Pinerolo * 1828\u20131839, Antoine Martinet, also bishop of Tarentaise * 1840\u20131873, Cardinal Alexis Billiet, also bishop of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne * 1873\u20131880, Pierre- Athanase Pichenot, also bishop of Tarbes * 1881\u20131893, Fran\u00e7ois-Albert Leuillieux, also bishop of Carcassonne * 1803\u20131907, Fran\u00e7ois Hautin, also bishop of \u00c9vreux * April\u2013August, 1907, Gustave-Adolphe de P\u00e9lacot, also bishop of Troyes * 1907\u20131914, Cardinal Fran\u00e7ois-Virgile Dubillard, also bishop of Quimper-Cornouailles * 1915\u20131936, Dominique Castellan, also bishop of Digne * 1937\u20131947, Pierre-Marie Durieux, also bishop of Viviers * 1947\u20131966 Louis- Marie-Fernand de Bazelaire de Ruppierre * 1966\u20131985, Andr\u00e9 Bontemps, also bishop of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne * 1985\u20132000, Claude Feidt, also archbishop of Aix * 2000\u20132008, Laurent Ulrich, also archbishop of Lille * 2008\u20132009, Vacant * 2009\u2013 Philippe Ballot, appointed 14 January ==See also== *Catholic Church in France ==References== ==Bibliography== ===Reference works=== * (Use with caution; obsolete) * (in Latin) * (in Latin) * * * * ===Studies=== * * ==External links== *Source Chambery Category:Chamb\u00e9ry Category:1779 establishments in France ",
