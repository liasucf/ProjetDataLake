    "text": "The Rinkeby murder took place on 26 February 2002, when 19-year-old Radu Acsinia was shot to death at Rinkeby station on the Stockholm metro, Sweden. On 23 October 2002, the Svea Court of Appeal in Stockholm found four young men jointly guilty of the murder. The two youngest offenders were each sentenced to four years' youth custody, while the remaining two \u2013 brothers \u00d6nder Yildiz (then aged 20 years) and \u00d6zkan Yildiz (24) \u2013 were given prison terms of 10 years and life respectively. The legal case has attracted much attention and been described by Chancellor of Justice, G\u00f6ran Lambertz, as yet another case that shakes confidence in the judicial system. The Rinkeby Murder Committee \u2013 a volunteer network pressing for a retrial of \u00d6nder and \u00d6zkan Yildiz \u2013 was set up by Olle Schubert and Henrik Westander in 2006.http://www.rinkebymordet.se In June 2009, lawyer Claes Borgstr\u00f6m, representing \u00d6zkan, submitted a petition for a new trial to the Supreme Court of Sweden. It appears that, among other things, a number of eyewitnesses have come forward with information that \u00d6nder and \u00d6zkan Yilmaz were not at the scene of the murder. In 2009 a key prosecution witness also said that he had made false statements about \u00d6nder and \u00d6zkan Yildiz during the trial. On 14 September 2009, the Supreme Court decided that the Office of the Prosecutor-General should express its opinion on the case. The book Three Brothers (2005), by Christian Holm\u00e9n and Dick Sundevall, deals with the Rinkeby murder. == References == Category:2002 in Sweden Category:2000s murders in Sweden Category:2002 crimes in Sweden Category:2002 murders in Europe ",
