On July 25, 2018, Toby shared a video on his Twitter, explaining the meaning behind the song,\"I was on my way to the studio one day to write this song, a song I had in my head but not really in my heart. So, on the drive, I said a really simple prayer. I said, 'Daddy, if You want me to write a song other than this one, will You show me something?' As I continued drivin', my eyes began to open and I could hear Him saying, 'Nah, Toby, I'm not gonna show you somethin'. I'm showing you everything.' Isaiah 43:19 says, 'I am doing a new thing in the land. It's springing forth; do you perceive it?' I walked in the studio that day with a fresh song to write. Yep, a new song in my heart. And I'm gonna fight to keep lookin' for God in everything all day.\" ==Music video== A music video for the single \"Everything\" was released on August 9, 2018. The visual features Toby performing the track around parts of a street in Columbia, Tennessee. One scene with a black car parked in front of a business was filmed in front of Paper Pulleys, Inc. on the corner of Woodland St. and E. 8th St. in Columbia, Tennessee. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Christian AC (Billboard) | 5 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Christian AC Indicator (Billboard) | 2 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Cross Rhythms Annual Chart | 12 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Christian Songs (Billboard) | 23 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Christian Airplay (Billboard) | 31 |- |} ==References== Category:2018 singles Category:2018 songs Category:Songs written by TobyMac Category:Songs written by David Garcia (musician) Category:TobyMac songs ",
