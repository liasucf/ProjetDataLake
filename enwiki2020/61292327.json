Its aim is to ensure medical care in Schleswig-Holstein. == History == The University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein is the result of a merger between the university hospitals in Kiel and L\u00fcbeck in 2003. administrative offices are located in L\u00fcbeck. The UKSH works with the University of Kiel and the University of L\u00fcbeck, whose students in the faculties of medicine and dentistry (only in Kiel) are trained at the UKSH. Both locations have training opportunities for medical professions, such as nurses and medical laboratory scientists. Entrance of building The Faculty of Medicine at the University of Kiel was one of the founding faculties of the university in 1665. There has been a medical facility on the L\u00fcbeck campus since 1912. University hospitals in Schleswig-Holstein are associated with researchers such as Friedrich von Esmarsch, Hans-Gerhard Creutzfeldt and Friedrich Wegener. Renovation of the UKSH building Former building of Kiel Surgery In July 2009, the Schleswig- Holstein state government agreed to make considerable investments in the modernization of the structural infrastructure on the Kiel and L\u00fcbeck campuses. In 2012, the Schleswig-Holstein Landtag cleared the way for a pan- European invitation to bid. To be more precise, this was for building investments, operation for 30 years and an innovative financing model. Investments reached 1.7 billion euros. The hallmarks of the process: The private partner was given responsibility for planning, construction and operation, whilst the State of Schleswig-Holstein remained the owner. Building of University Medical Center Schleswig Holstein in 2019 In 30 September 2014, the Universal Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein and the consortium of bidders signed the structural master plan contract. The BAM/VAMED consortium was awarded the contract. On 30 September 2015, one year after signing the contract, the foundation for the extension building of the existing central clinic in L\u00fcbeck was laid. The cornerstone for the new clinic was laid in March 2016. The roofing ceremony was celebrated in Kiel at the end of April 2017. The first patients are expected to be treated in the new building from the beginning of 2019. The roofing ceremony in L\u00fcbeck was planned for September 2017, and the first patients should Klinikum der Zukunft Main entrance be treated in late 2018. Both locations have an interdisciplinary building with improved infrastructure. Campus of University Medical Center Schleswig Main entrance of the building As a result, the central clinics should run more efficiently. The State of Schleswig-Holstein is helping to pay off old debts. 450 jobs will be created from the new buildings and the company agreement on the Wage Agreement for Public Services in the Federal States replaced. The delay in the new building meant fire protection investments for the old buildings had to be arranged, even though these were planned to be demolished.

More than 2,000 doctors and researchers \u2013 including 342 professors \u2013 and 5,400 nurses work at the UKSH. Every year around 500,000 patients are treated, a quarter of all inpatient cases in Schleswig-Holstein. In 2017, the case mix index was 1.470. If you add the case mix points from both locations, the UKSH would rank second in Germany according to the VUD benchmark. {| class=\"wikitable\" |Unit |Number |- |Departments and institutes |80 |- |Employees \u25cf Doctors \u25cf Researchers \u25cf of which professors \u25cf Nurses |13,594 > 2000 2,600 342 > 5400 |- |Inpatient number per year |500,000 |- |Plan beds |2,500 |} == References == Aachen Category:Hospitals established in 2003 Category:High-tech architecture ",
