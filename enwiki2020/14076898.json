Teams representing 36 countries participated in several levels of competition, with Slovakia making their first appearance in the top Champions Group A, in their fourth tournament since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia and the formation of the separate Czech Republic and Slovakia men's national ice hockey teams. The competition also served as qualifications for group placements in the 1997 competition. The top Championship Group A tournament took place in Austria from 21 April to 5 May 1996, with all games played in Vienna. Twelve teams took part, with the first round split into two groups of six, with the first four from each group advancing to the quarter-finals. The Czech Republic beat Canada in the final to become World Champions for the first time. The final game was tied at two apiece before Martin Proch\u00e1zka scored with nineteen seconds left, followed by an empty net goal to seal the victory.Duplacey page 508 In the bronze medal game, Brian Rolston scored at 4:48 of overtime to win the first medal in 34 years for team USA.Podnieks page 160 The unfortunate Russians, competing in their fifth tournament since being created after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, did not lose a game in regulation time in the entire tournament, but finished fourth. == World Championship Group A (Austria) == === First Round === === Group 1 === {| class=\"wikitable\" ! !

Latvia won at this level for the first time. In their final game, superb goaltending by Art\u016brs Irbe kept them in it, and a late tying goal by O\u013cegs Znaroks sealed the tournament victory. The final game had high drama for the host crowd, the Japanese and Danish teams among them. If the Netherlands were to lose to Poland, they would finish last and be relegated, a tie and Japan would be last, a win and Denmark would be last. A third period goal by Poland sealed Japan's fate. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! ! Team ! Games ! Won ! Drawn ! Lost ! Goal difference ! Points !
