According to the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn he came to power after killing the previous incumbent, F\u00edachu Labrainne, who had killed his father in battle. The province of Munster is named after him. He ruled for 21 years, fighting many battles against the descendants of \u00c9rim\u00f3n, before he was killed by F\u00edachu's son \u00d3engus Olmucaid in the battle of Cl\u00edu.
