    "text": "Ha Dong-kyun (; born June 28, 1980), also known as Ha Dong Qn, is a South Korean singer-songwriter. He debuted in 2002 as a member of the short-lived boy band 7Dayz, before joining the boy band Wanted in 2004. As a solo singer, he has released two albums: Stand Alone (2006) and Another Corner (2008), and three extended plays: Mark (2012), Word (2014), and Polygon (2017). == Career == Dong Qn embarked on his career as a solo singer with the release of his first album Stand Alone in 2006. He has since then released several singles and mini albums such as Another Corner (2008), Mark (2012), and Word (2014). He also gained attention for appearing on the popular South Korean singing competition program I Am a Singer (Season 3, aired in 2015). In 2016, Ha Dong Qn founded the independent record label Mark Planet, under which he then released his new mini album Polygon, consisting of five single tracks, on May 11, 2017. Getting rave reviews for his new album, he held a very successful first solo concert Night: The First on June 4, 2017, and continued advancing his career by participating in a variety of popular music events, such as the Someday Festival in Seoul, the Yoo Jae-ha Music Contest, and several benefit performances for people in need. He successfully put on the second concert of his solo concert series, 02 Night: Secret Room, on December 10, 2017, and has since followed that up with more TV appearances, his participation in the Kim Kwang-seok Memorial Concert series (\uae40\uad11\uc11d \ub2e4\uc2dc\ubd80\ub974\uae30), and other live performances. He released single named \"\uadf8\ub54c \uc6b0\ub9b0\" on April 18, 2019, declaring the release of new album soon. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\" style=\"width:5em;\" | Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Sales |- !
