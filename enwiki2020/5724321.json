Burly, menacing and gravel-voiced, Cramer specialized in villainous roles in many low-budget westerns, but is today best remembered for his several appearances with Laurel and Hardy. He also appeared with W. C. Fields in his short film, The Fatal Glass of Beer, which Mack Sennett produced. He was sometimes billed as Rychard Cramer or Dick Cramer. ==Partial filmography== * The Love Mart (1927) * Sharp Shooters (1928) * The Tiger's Shadow (1928) * Kid Gloves (1929) * The Lost Zeppelin (1929) * Murder on the Roof (1930) * Hell's Island (1930) * Captain of the Guard (1930) * Those Who Dance (1930) * Big Money (1930) * Night Beat (1931) * The Pocatello Kid (1931) * Hell-Bent for Frisco (1931) * Lariats and Six-Shooters (1931) *Is There Justice?
