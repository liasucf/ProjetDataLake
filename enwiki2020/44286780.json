    "text": "is Japanese dumpling made from the meal or flour of the kibi (proso millet) grain. The treat was used by folktale-hero Momotar\u014d (the Peach Boy) to recruit his three beastly retainers, in the commonly known version of the tale. In modern times, this millet dumpling has been confounded with the identically- sounding confection Kibi dango named after Kibi Province (now Okayama Prefecture), even though the latter hardly uses any millet at all. The confectioners continue to market their product by association with the hero Momotar\u014d, and more widely, Okayama residents have engaged in a concerted effort to claim the hero as native to their province. In this context, the millet dumpling's historical association with the Kibi Province has undergone close scrutiny. In particular, Kibitsu Shrine of the region has had ongoing association with serving food by the name kibi dango. Conventionally, kibi dango or kibi mochi uses the sticky variety proso millet known as mochi kibi, rather than the regular (amylose-rich) millet used for creating sweets. ==History== Hero offering millet dumpling to dog, Momotaro, tr. David Tomson (1886) Use of the term kibi dango in the sense of \"millet dumpling\" occurs at least as early as the , in an entry dated 1488 (Ch\u014dky\u014d 2, 3rd month, 19th day) which mentions \"kibi dango\". The Japanese-Portuguese dictionary Nippo Jisho (1603\u201304) also listed \"qibidango\", which it defined as \"millet dumpling\". There had been similar foods in earlier times, though not specifically called kibi dango. Writer in his 1862 essay collection observed that such foods, made out of millet meals or other ground grains undergoing a process of steaming and pounding, and recognizable as dango to his contemporaries, were once called bei (, the same character as mochi) in the olden days. ===Kibitsu Shrine=== The Kibitsu Shrine of the former Kibi Province has an early connection to the millet dumpling, due to the easy pun on the geographic name \"Kibi\" sounding the same as kibi 'millet'. The pun is attested in one waka poem and one haiku dating to the early 17th century, brought to attention by poet and scholar in a treatise written in 1941. The first example, a satirical composed at the shrine by the feudal lord Hosokawa Y\u016bsai (d. 1610) reads \"Since priestess/pestle (kine) is traditional to the gods, I would fain see straightaway pounded into dumplings (the millet of) the Millet Shrine/Kibitsu Shrine (where I am at).\"Kami wa kine ga narawashi nareba mazu tsukite dango ni shitaki Kibitsu Miya kana (\u795e\u306f\u304d\u306d\u304c\u306a\u3089\u306f\u3057\u306a\u308c\u3070\u5148\u3065\u6417\u304d\u3066\u56e3\u5b50\u306b\u3057\u305f\u304d\u5409\u5099\u6d25\u5bae\u304b\u306a). A selection from the , published 1666. The is a tool used in conjunction with a wooden mortar (usu), and it is implicit in the poem that the process required these tools to pound the grain into kibi-dango dumplings.. And it must have been something the shrine served to visitors on some occasions, one source venturing as far as to say that \"it was already being sold at Kibitsu Shrine at the time. A haiku in similar vein, of somewhat later date and also at the same shrine according to Shida, was composed by an obscure poet named of Bitch\u016b Province. The haiku reads \"Oh, mochi-like snow, Japan's number one Kibi dango\", The occurrence here of the line \"Japan's number one kibi dango\" which recurs as a stock phrase in the Momotar\u014d story constituted \"immovable\" proof of an early Momotar\u014d connection in Shida's estimation, but it was based on the underlying convinction that this phrase was ever-present since the earliest inception of the Momotar\u014d legend. That premise was later compromised by , who after examining Edo-period texts of Momotar\u014d concluded that \"Japan's number one\" or even \"millet dumpling\" had not appeared in the tale until decades after this haiku. In later years, more elaborate legends were promoted connecting the shrine, or rather its resident deity Kibitsuhiko-no-mikoto to the kibi dango. The founder of the K\u014deido confection business authored a travel guide in 1895, in which he claimed that Kibitsuhiko rolled with his own hand some kibi dango to give to Emperor Jimmu who stopped at Takayama Palace in Okayama, but that anecdote was purely anachronistic. Later, an amateur historian wrote a 1930 book proposing that the legend of Kibitsuhiko's ogre-slaying was the source of the \"Peach Boy\" or Momotar\u014d folktale, leading to fervent local efforts to localize the hero Momotar\u014d to Kibi Province (Okayama Prefecture). ===Momotar\u014d legend=== In the widely familiar version of Momotar\u014d, the hero spares his traveling rations of \"kibi dango\" to a dog, a pheasant, and a monkey and thereby gains their allegiance. However the scholar Koike compared the various kusaz\u014dshi texts and discovered that early written texts of the Momotar\u014d legend failed to call the rations \"kibi dango\". Versions from the Genroku era (1688\u20131704) has , and other tales antedating \"kibi dango\" have or instead. Moreover, the \"Japan's number one\" brag was unattached to Momotar\u014d's kibi dango until around the Genbun era (1736) as far as Koike could fathom. ==Footnotes== ===Explanatory notes=== ===Citations=== ==References== * * * * Category:Dumplings Category:Wagashi Category:Japanese desserts and sweets Category:Millets ",
