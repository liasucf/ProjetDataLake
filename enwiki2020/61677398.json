It is a single-story brick building, with a portico, supported by brick piers, extending over the area where the fuel pumps were originally located. The portico extends from the portion of the building housing what originally served as the station office, with two automotive service bays to its right. The station was built about 1930, to a corporate design introduced by Gulf Oil in the 1910s, and is painted in that company's colors: white, blue, and orange.
