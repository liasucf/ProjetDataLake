The origin of the song is unknown, and there was a debate whether it was pre-historic or colonial. But its melody is most likely from the 18th century as it was similar to Spanish and Mexican folk songs of the era. The folk song, it presents a woman as its main character and a man as a secondary character. The woman in the song was looking for a missing ring given by her mother and offers her love as a prize for the man who could find it. == In popular culture == The folk song was interpreted by Filipino popular artists such as Lea Salonga in Ryan Cayabyab's Bahaghari album, Freddie Aguilar and Nora Aunor.
