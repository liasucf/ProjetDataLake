    "text": "Radioactive is a 2019 British biographical drama film directed by Marjane Satrapi and starring Rosamund Pike as Marie Curie. The film is based on the 2010 graphic novel by Lauren Redniss. The film premiered as the Closing Night Gala at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival. The film was scheduled to be released in theatres in 2020 but its opening was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was released digitally in the United Kingdom on 15 June 2020 by StudioCanal. ==Synopsis== In 1934, Marie Curie collapses in her laboratory in Paris. As she is rushed to the hospital, she remembers her life. In 1893 she was frequently rejected for funding due to her gender but entered a partnership with Pierre Curie. After Marie discovered polonium and radium, the two fell in love and got married, having two children. Soon, Marie announces the discovery of radioactivity, revolutionizing physics and chemistry. Radium is soon used in a series of commercial products. Pierre takes Marie to a seance where radium is used to attempt to contact the dead, but Marie disapproves of spiritualism and the idea of an afterlife after the death of her mother in Poland. Although Pierre rejects the Legion d'honeur for not nominating Marie and insists that the two jointly share their Nobel Prize in Physics, Marie becomes agitated that he accepted the Prize in Stockholm without her. Soon afterwards Pierre becomes increasingly sick with anemia as a result of his research and is trampled to death by a horse. Although she initially dismisses concerns that her elements are toxic, increasing numbers of people die from serious health conditions after contacting radium. Depressed, she begins an affair with her colleague Paul Langevin. Although she receives Pierre's professorship at the Sorbonne, the French nationalist press reports the details of her affair with Langevin and is harassed by xenophobic mobs due to her Polish origins. She returns to the house where she attended the seance and tearfully begs a woman who was there to try to use radium to contact Pierre. When she receives a Nobel Prize in Chemistry, she defies the committee's instructions not to travel to Stockholm and is greeted enthusiastically. In 1914, when World War I starts, her daughter Irene convinces her to run an X-ray unit on the Western Front in order to save soldiers from dying or being amputated, which they fund by selling her Nobel Prizes to the government. Irene begins dating Frederic Joliot, but Marie disapproves of their relationship because they have been researching artificial radioactivity and warns Irene not to see him or research radioactivity anymore. Although she refuses to obey her, they go to the Western Front together to run the X-ray machine. Scenes of her life are interwoven with scenes depicting the future impact of her discoveries, including external beam radiotherapy at a hospital in Cleveland in 1956, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a nuclear bomb test in Nevada in 1961, and the Chernobyl disaster. As she dies in 1934, she sees visions of these events before awakening in a hospital room. Pierre arrives and they leave the hospital together. The film concludes by stating that the Curies' X-ray unit saved millions of lives during the war, that their research would be used to create radiotherapy, and that the Joliot-Curies would discover artificial radioactivity in 1935. ==Cast== * Rosamund Pike as Marie Curie * Sam Riley as Pierre Curie * Sian Brooke as Bronia Sklodowska * Simon Russell Beale as Gabriel Lippmann * Anya Taylor-Joy as Irene Curie ** Ariella Glaser as young Irene Curie ** Indica Watson as six-year-old Irene Curie * Cara Bossom as \u00c8ve Curie * Aneurin Barnard as Paul Langevin * Katherine Parkinson as Emma Jeanne Desfosses * Tim Woodward as Alexandre Millerand * Jonathan Aris as Hetreed * Mirjam Novak as Nurse Francoise * Corey Johnson as Adam Warner * Demetri Goritsas as Dr. Jenkins * Michael Gould as Judge Clark ==Production== ===Development=== It was announced in February 2017 that Marjane Satrapi would direct a biopic on the life of Marie Curie, with StudioCanal and Working Title Films serving as producers. An \"autumn 2017\" production start was initially foreseen. In May 2017, during the Cannes Film Festival, Rosamund Pike was cast as Curie. ===Filming=== In February 2018, Amazon Studios acquired the US distribution rights to the film, with filming beginning in the Hungarian cities of Budapest and Esztergom the same week. The cast was rounded out by Sam Riley, Anya Taylor-Joy, Aneurin Barnard and Simon Russell Beale a few days later. ==Release== Radioactive premiered as the Closing Night Gala at the Toronto International Film Festival on 14 September 2019. To celebrate International Women's Day, the film's UK premiere took place at the Curzon Mayfair Cinema on 8 March 2020, ahead of its intended 20 March theatrical release, which was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. StudioCanal eventually released the film in the United Kingdom on digital platforms on 15 June 2020 and through video on demand on 6 July, followed by a DVD release on 27 July. In the United States, where the film was originally set to be released theatrically on 24 April 2020 by Amazon Studios, it was released on 24 July 2020 on Prime Video. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 61% based on 131 reviews, with an average rating of 6.02/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Radioactives flawed script and counterproductive storytelling choices are offset by Rosamund Pike's central performance in a sincere tribute to a brilliant scientific mind.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter praised Pike's performance, the pacing and the treatment of the subject. The Independent gave it two stars and criticized the, 'On-the-nose writing that sucks the air out of every scene, as characters ceremoniously announce the film's themes and their personal motivations.' The Guardian panned the film as 'by-the-numbers', criticizing the script and direction, and gave it one star out of five. Kate Taylor of The Globe and Mail concluded \"... the viewer may decide she'd rather read a comic book.\" ===Controversy=== Although the film is actually based on the 2010 graphic novel Radioactive: Marie & Pierre Curie: A Tale of Love and Fallout by Lauren Redniss, it is marketed as a \"biopic\" on Marie Curie. Geraldine McGinty of Cornell University severely criticised the film not just for altering many historical events for dramatic effect, but for misrepresenting her character and that of her husband, e.g. by saying that she stayed home rather than attending the 1905 Nobel ceremony with Pierre, where he belatedly delivered the lecture for their 1903 prize. McGinty said that its misleading analogies, misrepresentation of principal characters, and inappropriate nudity and violence, all make it unsuitable as an educational or biographical source. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2019 films Category:2019 drama films Category:2019 biographical drama films Category:Biographical films about scientists Category:British biographical drama films Category:British films Category:British nonlinear narrative films Category:Films not released in theaters due to the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Films produced by Eric Fellner Category:Films produced by Tim Bevan Category:Films set in the 20th century Category:Films set in 1893 Category:Films set in 1903 Category:Films set in 1934 Category:Films set in Paris Category:Films set in Stockholm Category:Films shot in Budapest Category:Films directed by Marjane Satrapi Category:Cultural depictions of Marie Curie Category:Working Title Films films Category:Films set in 1985 Category:Films set in 1956 Category:Films set in 1961 Category:Films set in 1945 Category:Films about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Category:Films about the Chernobyl disaster Category:Films set in Cleveland Category:Films set in Chernobyl (city) Category:Films set in Hiroshima Category:Films set in Nevada Category:Films set in 1914 Category:Western Front (World War I) films Category:Films about science Category:Films about sexism Category:Films about discrimination Category:Films about the afterlife Category:Films set in Poland ",
