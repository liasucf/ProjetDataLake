    "text": "Commodore Ballroom is a renowned music venue, dance floor and nightclub located on 800 block of Granville Street in Vancouver, British Columbia. The building was built in the Art Deco style of the late 1920s by George Conrad Reifel and designed by architect H.H. Gillingham. Best known for showcasing special performances, the venue is also famous for its sprung dance floor, whose horsehair lining absorbs, rather than reflecting back, some of the impact of dancers' feet. At the time it was installed, only a few venues in the world had similar floors. The general-admission ballroom accommodates approximately 990 guests (including standing room and table seating). The building's street level was built for retail outlets, some of them in their time also notable. Downstairs, below street level, is the Commodore Lanes, a vintage bowling alley and poolroom. ==History== The building opened in December 1929 as the Commodore Cabaret.Commodore Ballroom Celebrates 75 Years With the onset of the Great Depression, the venue briefly closed four months later.
