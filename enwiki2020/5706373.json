    "text": "{| |} The Rolls-Royce Gem is a turboshaft engine developed specifically for the Westland Lynx helicopter in the 1970s. The design started off at de Havilland (hence the name starting with \"G\") and was passed to Bristol Siddeley as the BS.360. When Rolls-Royce bought out the latter in 1966, it became the RS.360.Gunston 1989, p. 155. ==Design and development== The Gem's three-shaft engine configuration is rather unusual for turboshaft/turboprop engines. Basic arrangement is a four-stage axial LP (Low Pressure) compressor, driven by a single stage LP turbine, supercharging a centrifugal HP (High Pressure) compressor, driven by a single stage HP turbine. Power is delivered to the load via a third shaft, connected to a two-stage free (power) turbine. A reverse flow combustor is featured.Rolls-Royce Gem product page The Gem 42 develops at Take-off, Sea Level Static, ISA, but the Maximum Contingency Rating (MCR) is . Until recently all versions of the Lynx have been Gem powered. However, now that Rolls-Royce own Allison, they have been marketing the more modern LHTEC T800, developed jointly with Honeywell. ==Applications== *Agusta A129 Mangusta *Westland Lynx ==Engines on display== *East Midlands Aeropark *Midland Air Museum *The Helicopter Museum (Weston) *111 (Sunderland) Squadron ATC ==Specifications (Gem 42)== Rolls-Royce Gem on display at the Midland Air Museum ==See also== ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== * Gunston, Bill.
