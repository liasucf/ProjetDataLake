    "text": "The eighth season of HaMerotz LaMillion (, lit. The Race to the Million), also known as HaMerotz LaMillion: All Stars, is an Israeli reality television game show based on the American series, The Amazing Race. The eighth installment of the series features 6 new teams of two with a pre-existing relationship and 6 returning teams of two in a race around the world to win \u20aa1,000,000. The season premiered on 6 September 2020 on Reshet 13 and is hosted by Ron Shahar. ==Production== ===Development and filming=== Philippine city of Las Pi\u00f1as was the site of the start of HaMerotz LaMillion: All Stars. While the previous season was filming, rumors circulated that teams from previous seasons would be participating on the subsequent season. On 28 November 2018, before the Season 7 finale was filmed, media outlets spotted the six teams returning to the Race at Ben Gurion Airport. A few days later, production of the season began in the Philippines directly after the conclusion of the previous season with principal filming ending on 29 December 2018. This season is the first time an Amazing Race franchise filmed a second season directly after the filming of another season. This season marks the fourth Race franchise that brought back previous contestants to compete following the original American version, The Amazing Race Vietnam, and The Amazing Race China (The Amazing Race Canada 7, which featured a single viewer-voted returning team, aired after HaMerotz LaMillion 8 was filmed but before it aired). This is also the second season, after the second Chinese season (The Amazing Race Australia 4, which also featured an international Starting Line, was filmed after HaMerotz LaMillion 8 but aired before this season), in which the Starting Line did not take place in the show's host country. ===Casting=== The returning teams and their prior Race placements are: *From Season 4: **Shay Gavriel and Shani Alon, Her Husband's Best Friend, 1st place **Vladimir \"Vova\" Lazarovitch and Alla Aibinder, New Olim & Exes, 4th place *From Season 5: **Ben and Ori Scheflan, Brothers, 6th place **Yael Carmon and Yosiel Neeman, Cousins, 5th place *From Season 6: **Anne Zivi and Yarden Vizel, Best Friends, 5th place **Omer and Neta Barazani, Siblings, 4th place ==Results== The following teams participated in the Race, with their relationships at the time of filming.
