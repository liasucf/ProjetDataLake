    "text": "Mank is an upcoming American biographical drama film directed by David Fincher, based on a script written by his father Jack, and is produced by Ce\u00e1n Chaffin, Douglas Urbanski, and Eric Roth. The plot centers around screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz and his battles with director Orson Welles over screenplay credit for Citizen Kane (1941). The film stars Gary Oldman in the title role, along with Amanda Seyfried, Lily Collins, Arliss Howard, Tom Pelphrey, Sam Troughton, Ferdinand Kingsley, Tuppence Middleton, Tom Burke, and Charles Dance. Fincher's father Jack wrote the script in the 1990s, and David originally intended to film it after he completed The Game (1997). It never came to fruition, and Jack Fincher died in 2003. Eventually, the project was officially announced in July 2019, and filming took place around Los Angeles from November 2019 to February 2020. Mank is scheduled to be released in a limited theatrical release in November 2020, before beginning to stream on Netflix on December 4, 2020. ==Premise== The story centers on the life of Herman J. Mankiewicz as he wrote Citizen Kane, and the problems that arose with Orson Welles during production and leading up to the film's release. ==Cast== * Gary Oldman as Herman J. Mankiewicz * Amanda Seyfried as Marion Davies * Lily Collins as Rita Alexander * Charles Dance as William Randolph Hearst * Arliss Howard as Louis B. Mayer * Tom Pelphrey as Joseph L. Mankiewicz * Sam Troughton as John Houseman * Ferdinand Kingsley as Irving Thalberg * Tuppence Middleton as Sara Mankiewicz * Tom Burke as Orson Welles * Joseph Cross as Charles Lederer * Jamie McShane as Shelly Metcalf * Toby Leonard Moore as David O. Selznick * Monika Grossman as Fraulein Freda * Jeff Harms as Ben Hecht * Leven Rambin as Eve ==Production== Mank was officially announced in July 2019, when David Fincher said he would direct the film, with Gary Oldman set to star. The screenplay was written by Fincher's father, Jack Fincher, prior to his death in 2003. It was originally going to be Fincher\u2019s follow-up to The Game (1997) with Kevin Spacey set to star, but never came to fruition due to Fincher's insistence to shoot in black-and-white. Additional casting was announced in October, with Amanda Seyfried, Lily Collins, Tuppence Middleton, Arliss Howard and Charles Dance among the new cast added. Fincher reunites with much of his usual filmmaking team, including production designer Donald Graham Burt, editor Kirk Baxter, and composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, using only period-authentic instruments. Fincher opted for cinematographer Erik Messerschmidt, with whom he worked on his Netflix series Mindhunter. Filming began on November 1, 2019, in Los Angeles. It also took place in Victorville, California, and wrapped on February 4, 2020. The 120-page draft of the initial script revealed that Jack Fincher closely followed a claim voiced by Pauline Kael in her 1971 New Yorker article Raising Kane that Welles did not deserve screenwriting credit. The article angered many critics, including Welles's friend and fellow filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich who rebutted Kael's claims point by point in \"The Kane Mutiny\", an October 1972 article for Esquire. Her argument was discredited by several film scholars through the years, including Robert L. Carringer in his study of \"The Scripts of Citizen Kane.\" ==Release== Mank is scheduled to be released in a limited theatrical release in November 2020, before beginning to stream on Netflix on December 4, 2020. ==See also== RKO 281, an HBO film based on the documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane. ==References== == External links== * Category:American biographical films Category:American drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by David Fincher Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Upcoming films Category:Upcoming Netflix original films Category:Films scored by Atticus Ross Category:Films scored by Trent Reznor Category:American films Category:Citizen Kane ",
