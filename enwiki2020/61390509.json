It was unveiled in 1918 but is based on an older statuette by Louis Hasselriis. ==Description== Kierkegaard is depicted sitting on a chair in the process of writing something on a sheet of paper with a quill. Next to him are some books. ==History== The monument is based on a statuette created by Louis Hasselriis in 1878, 1879. It was enlarged by the sculptors Carl Aarsleff and H.P. Petersen-Dan and cast in bronze in Lauritz Tasmussen's Bronze Foundry in 1918. ==Other statues of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard== Hasselriis' original plaster statuette is located in the Danish National Gallery. The enlarged plaster copy was part of Aarsleff's private collection and later given to \u00d8stfyns Museum. It was for many years on display in the assembly hall of Nyborg Gymnasium but is now located outside the S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard Auditorium in the University of Copenhagen's Department of Theology in Copenhagen. A second S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard statue in Copoenhagen is located on the exterior of Frederik's Church. It is from 1972 and was created by Knud Nellemose. == References == Category:Monuments and memorials in Copenhagen Category:Outdoor sculptures in Copenhagen Category:Sculptures of men in Denmark Frederik VI Category:Statues in Copenhagen Category:Bronze sculptures in Denmark Category:Sculptures by Louis Hasselriis Category:1884 sculptures Category:1918 establishments in Denmark Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1918 ",
