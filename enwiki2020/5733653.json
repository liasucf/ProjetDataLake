    "text": "The Collected Statutes of the Ming Dynasty or Collected Regulations of the Great Ming () is a five-volume collection of regulations and procedures of the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644). After the original compiler Xu Pu (1429\u20131499) died, the task was taken over by Li Dongyang (1447\u20131516) and Shen Shixing (\u7533\u6642\u884c). The books took 11 year to complete and were published in 1509. A second edition was commissioned in 1576, resulting in the alternative name: Wanli Huidian (\u842c\u66c6\u6703\u5178), which was completed in 1587 and covers the years between 1479 and 1584 under the era name Wanli. The 1587 edition was reproduced as a facsimile in Beijing by the Zhonghua Book Company in 1988. == References == == External links == * http://riccilibrary.usfca.edu/view.aspx?catalogID=948 Category:1587 books Category:Legal history of China Category:Ming dynasty literature ",
