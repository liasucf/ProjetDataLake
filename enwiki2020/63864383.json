Cash Box (October 17, 1965): \"Ike and Tina Turner return to the home of their original hits with this power-packed Sue release dubbed 'Two Is A Couple.' The side is a rollicking, fast-moving pop-r&b; handclapper about a somewhat jealous lass who doesn't want any other female messing around with her fella. 'Tin Top House' is a lyrical, lush- sounding blues weeper with a nostalgic years-back sound.\" == Track listing == == Chart performance == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Chart !Peak position |- |US Cash Box Top 50 R&B; | align=\"center\" |15 |- |US Cash Box Looking Ahead | align=\"center\" |113 |- |US Record World Top 40 R&B; | align=\"center\" |26 |- |US Record World Singles Coming Up | align=\"center\" |112 |} == References == Category:1965 singles Category:1965 songs Category:Ike & Tina Turner songs Category:Songs written by Ike Turner Category:Song recordings produced by Ike Turner Category:Sue Records singles ",
