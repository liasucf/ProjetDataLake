He left school at 16 to work in the Victorian public service, but as soon as he turned 18 he enlisted in the army to fight in World War II.A. K. Macdougall, introduction to Peter Ryan, Lines of Fire: Manning Clark & Other Writings, Clarion Editions, Binalong, 1997, p. 7. He served as an intelligence operative behind enemy lines in New Guinea for eighteen months, much of the time alone. He was awarded the Military Medal and mentioned in despatches.Macdougall, p. 8. His 1959 book Fear Drive My Feet is his famous account of his experiences. On his return to Australia, he served under Alf Conlon at the Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs.Sligo, G. 2012.The Backroom Boys: Conlon and Army's Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs, 1942\u201346, Big Sky Publishing. He studied at the University of Melbourne from 1946, graduating BA with honours. He married in 1947, and worked as a freelance writer, then in advertising, then as Public Relations Manager with ICI in Melbourne.Macdougall, pp. 8-9. He was Director of Melbourne University Press from 1962 to 1989. He wrote about these years in his memoir Final Proof (2010). In the September 1993 edition of Quadrant he wrote an attack on the six-volume History of Australia by Manning Clark, which Melbourne University Press had published between 1962 and 1987.Peter Ryan, \"Manning Clark\", Quadrant, September 1993, pp. 9-22. Among other things he said Clark's history was \"over a million printed English words, probably unrivalled in their power to combine the non sequitur with the anticlimax, and to wring the last drops from a series of foregone conclusions\".Ryan, \"Manning Clark\", p. 22. The article aroused considerable controversy, which Ryan dealt with in a subsequent article in Quadrant in October 1994.Peter Ryan, \"The Charge of the Lightweight Brigade\", Quadrant, October 1994, pp. 10-14. He wrote a monthly column for Quadrant from March 1994 to October 2015. A selection of these columns was published in 2011 under the title It Strikes Me. He died on 13 December 2015 at the age of 92. ==Bibliography== ===Books=== * * * * * * * Black Bonanza: A Landslide of Gold (1991) (on the gold rush at Mount Kare in Papua New Guinea) * Lines of Fire: Manning Clark & Other Writings (1997) * Brief Lives: Biographical Glimpses of Ben Chifley, Paul Hasluck, A.D.
