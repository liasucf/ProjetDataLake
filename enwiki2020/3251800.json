    "text": "Geoffrey Quentin McCaully Hubbard (January 6, 1954 - November 12, 1976), was the son of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard and his third wife, Mary Sue Hubbard. He died at the age of 22 in an apparent suicide. After Ron's eldest son Ron Jr. quit Scientology in 1959, Ron chose Quentin as his successor to lead the organization. Quentin went to sea with Ron when he established the Sea Organization, living on the flagship Apollo and reaching the highest level of auditor training. He disagreed with his father's plans, sometimes saying that he wanted to be a pilot,Atack (1990); pp. 213-214 and in 1974 that he would like to be a dancer. Soon after this, a friend found him in the midst of a suicide attempt. Quentin survived this attempt and was assigned to the Rehabilitation Project Force.Miller (1987); pp. 314 Former Scientologists have said that Quentin was homosexual,Miller (1987); p. 303Miller, Russell (August 27, 1986). \"Interview with Kima Douglas\". Carnegie Mellon University. Oakland, California and that this clearly caused him a great deal of personal torment as Scientology doctrine classified homosexuals as \"sexual pervert[s]\" and \"quite ill physically.\" Another source close to him claims that rumors of his homosexuality were due to his sometimes claiming to be that way in order to discourage women who were interested in him, to protect them from the consequences of his father's disapproval.Pignotti, Monica (August 1989). \"My Nine Lives in Scientology\". Carnegie Mellon University. \"Quentin and I came very close to getting involved sexually, but we didn't because he told me that several years earlier, he had become sexually involved with a young woman and she had been sent off the ship when his father found out. He didn't want to get me into that kind of trouble, so we remained good friends.\" Quentin is described as having had a gentle demeanor, with none of his father's bombast.Atack (1990); p. 214Miller (1987); p. 325 In 1975 the Sea Org moved to shore in Clearwater, Florida. Quentin was assigned to operations there but was often absent. Police discovered him unconscious in his car in Las Vegas on October 28, 1976, without any identifying documents. L. Ron Hubbard was furious at the news, shouting, \"That stupid fucking kid! Look what he's done to me!\"Miller (1987); pp. 344-345 Quentin died two weeks later without having regained consciousness. Although there had been a hose from the car's window to the tailpipe, a test for carbon monoxide was negative.Clark County Coroner. Report of Investigation, Case #1003-76. Mrs. Hubbard told Scientologists that Quentin had died from encephalitis. L. Ron Hubbard is said to have deteriorated rapidly after Quentin's death, becoming dishevelled and increasingly paranoid.Miller (1987); p. 348 ==References== == Further reading == * Coroner's report and death certificate ==External links== Category:1954 births Category:1976 deaths Category:American Scientologists Category:L.
