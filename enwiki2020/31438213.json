    "text": "Join Us is the fifteenth studio album from the rock band They Might Be Giants, released on July 19, 2011. It is the band's first adult album in four years since The Else in 2007. Following the success of their 2009 children's album, Here Comes Science, the band returned to their adult audience with Join Us, an eclectic collection of 18 songs. In an interview with The A.V. Club, Flansburgh commented, \"We probably recorded 30 songs for this album, and the songs that are on album are basically the last 15 or so. There were so many strange misfires at the beginning, just the most mutant songs.\"http://www.avclub.com/article/they-might-be-giants-john- flansburgh-59461 Some of the songs that were left off Join Us were later completed and released on the rarities compilation Album Raises New And Troubling Questions. ==Background== Recording began in March 2009, according to a July 2009 interview with Billboard, wherein John Flansburgh also mentioned that eight songs had already been recorded. An incomplete track listing composed of fourteen songs was revealed on Pitchfork.com on April 5. The track list was updated to include four more songs (\"Canajoharie,\" \"Celebration,\" \"Dog Walker,\" and \"Spoiler Alert\") on the band's Facebook page on April 26. ==Reception== Join Us has garnered fairly positive reviews from critics. It debuted at No. 32 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart and No. 8 on both the Billboard Rock Albums and Billboard Alternative Albums charts. Join Us also debuted at No. 8 on both the Billboard Rock and Billboard Alternative charts. It disappeared from the charts the following week. Join Us appeared at No. 20 on the CMJ Radio 200 on July 25, 2011. It climbed to No. 11 on August 2 and continued its ascension, reaching No. 5 on August 23. It spent 20 weeks on that chart. Two de facto singles emerged: \"Can't Keep Johnny Down\", which was released as a free MP3 on Pitchfork's website on April 5, as well as a promotional CD, and \"You Probably Get That A Lot\", which was promotionally issued in the UK. Music videos were produced for both songs, the former starring Rip Torn, although both tracks failed to chart. Music videos featuring the band were also produced for \"Spoiler Alert\" and \"Cloisonn\u00e9\". The music video for \"When Will You Die\", which featured the construction of a life-size monster hearse by the Office of Paul Sahre, went viral and achieved over 100,000 views total\u2014more than 25,000 in just one month. The artwork for Join Us was also very well-received, and Sahre was nominated for a 2012 Design of the Year Award from the Design Museum. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;They Might Be GiantsJoin Us liner notes. * John Linnell \u2013 lead vocals, backup vocals, keyboards, bass clarinet, accordion, saxophones, programming * John Flansburgh \u2013 lead vocals, backup vocals, guitar, programming * Dan Miller \u2013 lead guitar, keyboards * Danny Weinkauf \u2013 bass, keyboards * Marty Beller \u2013 drums, percussion ;Additional musicians * Stan Harrison \u2013 horn arrangement on track 5; saxophones on tracks 5, 9 and 17; bass flute on track 14 * Curt Ramm \u2013 trumpet on tracks 8, 9, 10, 13 and 17 * Dan Levine \u2013 trombone on tracks 9, 13 and 17 * Mauro Refosco \u2013 percussion on tracks 13 and 15 * David Driver \u2013 lead vocal on track 17 * Michael Cerveris \u2013 lead vocal on track 17 ;Production * Pat Dillett \u2013 producer, engineer * Jon Altschuler \u2013 engineer * Greg Thompson \u2013 engineer * UE Nastasi \u2013 mastering * Paul Sahre \u2013 cover art ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Charts !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- | U.S. Billboard 200 ||align=\"center\"|32 |- | U.S. Billboard Rock Albums ||align=\"center\"|8 |- | U.S. Billboard Digital Albums ||align=\"center\"|9 |- | U.S. Billboard Alternative Albums ||align=\"center\"|8 |- | U.S. Billboard Tastemaker Albums ||align=\"center\"|14 |} ==References== ==External links== * * Join Us article on This Might Be a Wiki Category:2011 albums Category:They Might Be Giants albums Category:Rounder Records albums Category:Idlewild Recordings albums Category:Albums produced by Pat Dillett ",
