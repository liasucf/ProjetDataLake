In March 2018 the dispute gained public attention through social networks \u2013 with the hashtag #YaP\u00e1gameINBA (Pay Me Already, INBA) \u2013 because the staff hired for fees had not received the payments corresponding to January and February of that year, and because this was a recurrent practice of the institute. On Monday, March 26, 2018, the INBA workers hired through Chapter 3000 held a work stoppage at several museums. The protest went viral and attracted the attention of various media outlets after the publication of a tweet from the official account of the Museo Nacional de Arte (MUNAL) denouncing the lack of payment. Later that day, a group of around 70 people demonstrated peacefully outside the Palacio de Bellas Artes, with placards demanding the improvement of their working conditions. Given the media and social pressure, INBA authorities agreed to meet with Chapter 3000 workers. In this meeting, INBA agreed to settle the debts and establish a punctual payment schedule \u2013 a promise which they failed to uphold in May. They also declared themselves incapable of resolving the labor crisis, arguing that the hiring schemes are established by the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit. They also stated that INBA is governed by the Acquisitions, Leases, and Public Sector Services Law and not the .
