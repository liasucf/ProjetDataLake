The district grew from about 1904 to about 1912, with a few infills up to the 1940s. The neighborhood is composed chiefly of frame houses on by lots, with a greater proportion of brick houses near the former brick plant at the edge of the district. About 100 houses are listed as contributing structures. The North Douglas Historic District was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 25, 2002. ==References== ==External links== * North Douglas Historic District at the Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office Category:National Register of Historic Places in Converse County, Wyoming Category:Queen Anne architecture in Wyoming Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1886 ",
