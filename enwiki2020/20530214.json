    "text": "Bathing Buddies is the 18th animated cartoon short subject in the Woody Woodpecker series. Released theatrically on July 1, 1946, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures. ==Plot== Woody is a tenant in a boarding house run by Wally Walrus, but his indoor game of golf quickly gets on the landlord's nerves. Woody decides to take a bath, for which he has to deposit a dime in the water meter in his bathroom. When the coin slips from his fingers and rolls down the drain, he tries an assortment of unusual tricks to get it back, provoking a battle of wills with Wally as he tries to take his own bath. Woody's last move is to stuff dynamite into the plumbing pipes, demolishing the house but freeing his dime at last. ==Notes== * Bathing Buddies was the first Woody cartoon directed by veteran animator Dick Lundy, who had previously worked at Walt Disney Productions. * Wally Walrus is shown in a new, tuskless character design and speaks without his usual Swedish accent. * One of the items in the Rules for Roomers list is No Opium Smoking. ==References== *Cooke, Jon, Komorowski, Thad, Shakarian, Pietro, and Tatay, Jack. \"1946\".
