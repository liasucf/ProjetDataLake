    "text": "In-yer-face theatre is a style of drama that emerged in Great Britain in the 1990s. This term was borrowed by British theatre critic Aleks Sierz as the title of his book, In-Yer-Face Theatre: British Drama Today, first published by Faber and Faber in March 2001.Aleks Sierz, In-Yer-Face Theatre: British Drama Today (London: Faber and Faber, 2001). An adjunct faculty member in Boston University's London graduate journalism programme, and co-editor of TheatreVoice,Boston University International Programs: Academic faculty including a brief biography of Aleks Sierz. Sierz uses in-yer-face theatre to describe work by young playwrights who present vulgar, shocking, and confrontational material on stage as a means of involving and affecting their audiences. According to Sierz, \"The big three of in-yer-face theatre are Sarah Kane, Mark Ravenhill and Anthony Neilson\"; in listing 14 \"Other hot shots\" in \"Who?\" on his website, Sierz adds the following qualification: \"Of course, some writers wrote one or two in-yer-face plays and then moved on. Like all categories, this one can't hope to completely grasp the ever-changing reality of the explosive new writing scene.\"Aleks Sierz, \"Who?\", In-Yer-Face Theatre website. Retrieved 9 June 2008. ==Literary-cultural origins== Simon Gray employs the colloquial slang term in your face to describe contemporary theatre dialogue in his play Japes, which premiered in London, in early February 2001.See Lizzie Loveridge, Review of Japes, CurtainUp, 8 February 2001. In the play, Michael Cartts, a middle-aged author, rages against a new kind of writing that he describes as \"in your face\". After watching a new play by a young playwright, Cartts describes the stage characters as follows: Appropriating the slang British spelling used by the band In Yer Face, extending the theatrical contexts exposed in Gray's play Japes, and, as the OED observes, employing the more-frequently-hyphenated adjectival form, Sierz used in yer face in his category \"in-yer-face theatre\" as defined in his book of that title. ==Process of critical categorising== The process of appropriating and applying such a pre-existing phrase or concept to describe new theatrical works provides a critical means of \"categorizing\" or \"labelling\", and some critics have stated, \"pigeonholing\", or \"domesticating\" (\"taming\") them.Susan Hollis Merritt, Pinter in Play: Critical Strategies and the Plays of Harold Pinter (1990; Durham and London: Duke UP, 1995) 5, 9, 225\u201328, 326, citing Wardle. The creation of in-yer-face theatre parallels the history of more-prevalently accepted literary-critical coinages by critics like Martin Esslin (Theatre of the Absurd), who extended the existential philosophical concept of the Absurd to drama and theatre in his 1961 book of that title,Martin Esslin, The Theatre of the Absurd, 3rd ed. With a new foreword by the author (1961; New York: Vintage [Knopf], 2004). and Irving Wardle (Comedy of menace), who borrowed the phrase from the subtitle of The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace, by David Campton, in 1958 reviews of productions of Campton's play and of The Birthday Party, by Harold Pinter, applying Campton's subtitle to Pinter's work.Irving Wardle, \"The Birthday Party\", Encore 5 (July\u2013Aug. 1958): 39\u201340; rpt. in The Encore Reader: A Chronicle of the New Drama, ed. Charles Marowitz, Tom Milne, and Owen Hale (London: Methuen, 1965) 76\u201378 (reissued as: New Theatre Voices of the Fifties and Sixties [London: Eyre Methuen, 1981]); \"Comedy of Menace\", Encore 5 (Sept\u2013Oct. 1958): 28\u201333; rpt. in The Encore Reader and New Theatre Voices 86\u201391.Michael Billington, Harold Pinter (1996; London: Faber & Faber, 2007) 106. In-yer-face theatre has often been mistakenly categorised as being a 'movement' which Sierz has disputed: ==2002 conference on \"in-yer-face theatre\"== \"In-yer-face theatre\" was debated at a two-day conference at the University of the West of England, held in 2002, at which Sierz was a keynote speaker.\"News 2002: 'Shocking' Plays have Academic Appeal,\" press release, University of the West of England, 30 August 2002. Sierz's own report on the conference is archived on his website.Aleks Sierz, Archive 2: Conference Reports: University of the West of England 2002. In-Yer-Face Theatre website, inyerface-theatre.com. Retrieved 9 June 2008. In summarising the results of the conference, co-conveners Graham Saunders and Rebecca D'Mont\u00e9 observe that Sierz acknowledged that by 2002 \"in-yer-face theatre\" had already become an historical phenomenon (a trend of the past; hence, pass\u00e9), going on to state: Another conference report, published by Writernet, states: \"to be shackled to a specific era or genre places a responsibility on a play and creates expectations before a reading or performance. In essence, it disrupts the artistic integrity through preconceived notions of a play because of a simplified label. Plays and playwrights risk being annexed or 'ghetto-ised' when given a superficial monolithic focus.\"\"In-Yer-Face? British Drama in the 1990s\", University of the West of England, Bristol, 6\u20137 September 2002, Writernet 2003. Retrieved 9 June 2008. (Conference report posted on writernet.co.uk, in both HTML and PDF versions). Writernet adds: \"This problem was reflected in number of papers from all over the world, which primarily explored the works of Sarah Kane and Mark Ravenhill through theoretical lenses of postmodernism, metaphysical theatre, Artaud's Theatre of Cruelty, and Lacan. Through no fault of the organizers \u2013 this was apparently an accurate reflection of the conference submissions.\" Yet, this report observes also that, \"In his own defense, Sierz stipulated that 'in-yer-face' was not a movement, but an 'arena' or 'a sensibility',\" and that \"In-yer-face theatre describes only a part of the body of works during the 1990s.\" It notices, moreover, that Sierz \"accepted the limitations of his book and the label, acknowledging it as both London-centric and limited in its scope.\" Nevertheless, it cites \"Max Stafford-Clark (founder of Out of Joint and Joint Stock theatre companies and ex-artistic director of the Royal Court Theatre and the Traverse in Edinburgh),\" who, \"when asked about plays in the 1990s,\" reportedly observed that \"Everybody\u2019s looking at the same view, so the paintings are bound to have similarities.\"Quoting from an interview with Elaine Aston, in Caryl Churchill (Plymouth: Northcote House Publishers, 1997) 5. ==Notable people associated with in-yer-face theatre== :Sources: Aleks SierzAleks Sierz, \"Still In-Yer-Face?
