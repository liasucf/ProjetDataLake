    "text": "The Rag Trade is a British television sitcom broadcast by the BBC between 1961 and 1963 and by LWT between 1977 and 1978. The scripts were by Ronald Wolfe and Ronald Chesney, who later wrote Wild, Wild Women, Meet the Wife and On the Buses. Wild, Wild Women was a period variation of The Rag Trade. ==Synopsis== The action centred on a fictional small clothing workshop (the title is a reference to the textile industry), Fenner's Fashions in London. Although run by Harold Fenner (Peter Jones) and the foreman and pattern cutter Reg Turner (Reg Varney), the female workers are led by militant shop steward Paddy Fleming (Miriam Karlin), ever ready to strike, with the catchphrase \"Everybody out!\" Other cast members included Sheila Hancock (as Carole Taylor), Esma Cannon (as Lily Swann), Wanda Ventham (as Shirley) in series 2 and Barbara Windsor (as Gloria, during series 1, who later returned as Judy in series 3) replacing Sheila Hancock. In 1975, a colour pilot was made, with only Peter Jones reprising his role, this colour pilot featured a young Tony Robinson (replacing Reg Varney), Gaye Brown (briefly replacing Karlin), Jumoke Debayo, Diane Langton, Annabel Leventon, Jamila Massey, Mollie Maureen (replacing Esma Cannon) and Trixie Scales. The theme tune for this colour pilot was performed by Alex Welsh and his Band, however, this was never transmitted, as the BBC rejected the colour revival of the series. Two years later, the series was later revived by ITV company LWT, with Jones and Karlin reprising their roles. The 1977\u201378 version ran for two series, most of the scripts being based on the BBC episodes from the 1960s, and featured Anna Karen (reprising her role as Olive from On the Buses) and future EastEnders star Gillian Taylforth as factory workers. The theme tune for the LWT series was written and performed by Lynsey de Paul and released as a track on an album of T.V. themes that also featured another de Paul penned theme Hi Summer. In 1990 the series was remade as the series Fredrikssons Fabrikk by NRK in Norway, it ran for three seasons (1990\u201393) (17 half hours and one 45min special) and spawned a film version Fredrikssons Fabrikk \u2013 The Movie in 1994 with a script credited to Chesney and Wolfe, and Norwegian series writer Andreas Markusson. ==Cast== ===1961\u201363=== * Peter Jones as Harold Fenner * Miriam Karlin as Paddy Fleming * Reg Varney as Reg Turner * Esma Cannon as Lily Swann (series 1\u20132) * Sheila Hancock as Carole Taylor (series 1\u20132) * Barbara Windsor as Gloria (series 1) and Judy (series 3) * Ann Beach as Brenda (series 1) * Rita Smythe as Rita (series 1) * Wanda Ventham as Shirley (series 2\u20133) * Patricia Denys as Betty (series 3) * Stella Tanner as Olive (series 3) * Carmel Cryan as Gloria (series 3) * Amanda Reiss as Janet (series 3) * Irene Handl as Mrs Turner (series 3) ===1977\u201378=== * Peter Jones as Harold Fenner * Miriam Karlin as Paddy Fleming * Anna Karen as Olive Rudge * Christopher Beeny as Tony * Gillian Taylforth as Lyn * Diane Langton as Kathy * Deddie Davies as Mabel * Lucita Lijertwood as Jojo * Rowena Cooper as Mrs Fenner (series 1) * Joy Stewart as Mrs Fenner (series 2) ==TV episodes== On original transmission many episodes of the original BBC TV series of The Rag Trade were not given titles, so some are from production notes and repeat screenings. ===Original BBC TV series=== Series 1 (1961) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:94%;\" |- !

The first series of the original BBC TV version of the show is complete, whilst the second series remains incomplete, as two episodes remain missing. Only one of the 13 episodes of the third (and final) BBC TV series (1963) currently exists - \u201cBaby Dolls\u201d, which was confirmed to have been unearthed by Philip Morris of TIEA and returned to the BBC in 2018. ==DVD release== The 8 (out of the 10) existing episodes of the first series (broadcast in 1961) were released on DVD (DD Home Entertainment) in March 2006, followed by the 11 existing episodes of the second series (broadcast in 1962), released on DVD 7 months later in October 2006. A Box Set consisting all the remaining episodes from the first two series of the show, was later released (through Simply Media DVD) on 23 October 2017. All the episodes of both colour series 4 and 5 of the (1977\u201378) LWT version of the series, including the 1977 Christmas special, have been released on DVD by Network. ==See also== * Never Mind the Quality, Feel the Width \u2013 ITV sitcom ==References== ==External links== * * * * * * Category:1961 British television series debuts Category:1978 British television series endings Category:1960s British sitcoms Category:1960s British workplace comedy television series Category:BBC television sitcoms Category:1970s British sitcoms Category:1970s British workplace comedy television series Category:Black-and-white British television shows Category:English-language television shows Category:ITV sitcoms Category:London in fiction Category:Lost BBC episodes Category:London Weekend Television shows Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:On the Buses no:Fredrikssons fabrikk sv:Fredrikssons fabrik ",
