    "text": "The Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe (MCPFE, synonym of the Helsinki Process, and, from November 2009, of FOREST EUROPEPress Release Oslo, 26 November 2009) is a pan-European ministerial level voluntary political process for the promotion of sustainable management of European forests. Through this process, guidelines, Criteria & Indicators of Sustainable Forest Management and other instruments for the promotion of sustainable forest management (SFM) are developed. The process is based on the Ministerial Conferences that have been convened with an interval of 3 to 5 years. These Conferences represent the highest decision-making body of the process, as well as its most important event. At Ministerial Conferences, the ministers responsible for forests in Europe take decisions on issues of highest political and social relevance regarding forests and forestry through decisions and resolutions. Between ministerial conferences, the Expert Level Meeting (ELM) is a decision-making body of FOREST EUROPE. On top of that, ad hoc Round Table Meetings, Working Groups, Seminars and Workshops are being established to work on specific subjects of scientific, technical or political nature. FOREST EUROPE also has its supportive structures, namely the General Coordinating Committee (GCC) that coordinates the FOREST EUROPE work and advises the Liaison Unit on implementation of FOREST EUROPE decisions and on strategic developments. The Liaison Unit is the support office of the process. It organises and carries out all FOREST EUROPE meetings and prepares reports and necessary documentation for the meetings. The Liaison Unit is located in the country which holds the chairmanship of FOREST EUROPE \u2013 currently in Zvolen, Slovakia, under the name of Liaison Unit Bratislava. ==Ministerial Conferences and commitments== From 1990, seven (plus one extraordinary) Ministerial Conferences on the Protection of Forests in Europe have taken place. The next Ministerial Conference is scheduled to take place in Bratislava in October 2020. At every Conference, a joint political declaration is agreed and different resolutions are adopted, in order to develop common strategies for its 46 signatory countries and the European Union on how to protect and sustainably manage forests. ===Strasbourg (1990)=== * Strasbourg Resolution S1 \"Monitoring of Forest Ecosystems\"Strasbourg Resolution S1 \"Monitoring of Forest Ecosystems\" * Strasbourg Resolution S2 \"Genetic Resources\"Strasbourg Resolution S2 \"Genetic Resources\" * Strasbourg Resolution S3 \"Data Bank on Forest Fires\"Strasbourg Resolution S3 \"Data Bank on Forest Fires\" * Strasbourg Resolution S4 \"Adapting the Management of Mountain Forests\"Strasbourg Resolution S4 \"Adapting the Management of Mountain Forests\" * Strasbourg Resolution S5 \"Research on Tree Physiology\"Strasbourg Resolution S5 \"Research on Tree Physiology\" * Strasbourg Resolution S6 \"Research into Forest Ecosystems\"Strasbourg Resolution S6 \"Research into Forest Ecosystems\" ===Helsinki (1993)=== * Helsinki Resolution H1 \"General Guidelines for the Sustainable Management of Forests in Europe\"Helsinki Resolution H1 \"General Guidelines for the Sustainable Management of Forests in Europe\" * Helsinki Resolution H2 \"General Guidelines for the Conservation of the Biodiversity\"Helsinki Resolution H2 \"General Guidelines for the Conservation of the Biodiversity\" * Helsinki Resolution H3 \"Cooperation with Countries with Economies in Transition\"Helsinki Resolution H3 \"Cooperation with Countries with Economies in Transition\" * Helsinki Resolution H4 \"Adaptation of Forests in Europe to Climate Change\"Helsinki Resolution H4 \"Adaptation of Forests in Europe to Climate Change\" ===Lisbon (1998)=== * Lisbon Resolution L1 \"Socio- Economic Aspects of Sustainable Forest Management\"Lisbon Resolution L1 \"Socio- Economic Aspects of Sustainable Forest Management\" * Lisbon Resolution L2 \"Pan-European Criteria, Indicators and PEOLG for Sustainable Forest Management\"Lisbon Resolution L2 \"Pan-European Criteria, Indicators and PEOLG for Sustainable Forest Management\" ===Vienna (2003)=== * Vienna Resolution Forest V1 \"Cross-Sectoral Co-operation and NFPs\"Vienna Resolution Forest V1 \"Cross-Sectoral Co-operation and NFPs\" * Vienna Resolution Forest V2 \"Economic Viability of SFM\"Vienna Resolution Forest V2 \"Economic Viability of SFM\" * Vienna Resolution Forest V3 \"Social and Cultural Dimension of SFM\"Vienna Resolution Forest V3 \"Social and Cultural Dimension of SFM\" * Vienna Resolution Forest V4 \"Forest Biological Diversity\"Vienna Resolution Forest V4 \"Forest Biological Diversity\" * Vienna Resolution Forest V5 \"Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Europe\"Vienna Resolution Forest V5 \"Climate Change and Sustainable Forest Management in Europe\" ===Warsaw (2007)=== * Warsaw Resolution W1 \"Forest, Wood and Energy\"Warsaw Resolution W1 \"Forest, Wood and Energy\" * Warsaw Resolution W2 \"Forest and Water\"Warsaw Resolution W2 \"Forest and Water\" ===Oslo (2011)=== In the Oslo Ministerial Conference ministers adopted a decision (the so-called Oslo Ministerial Decision: European Forests 2020) and agreed on a mandate to launch negotiations on a Legally Binding Agreement on Forests in Europe.https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/european-forests-growing- good-news-for-climate-report-2299514.html * Oslo Ministerial Decision: European Forests 2020Oslo Ministerial Decision: European Forests 2020 * Oslo Ministerial Mandate for Negotiating a Legally Binding Agreement on Forests in EuropeOslo Ministerial Mandate for Negotiating a Contract|Legally Binding Agreement ===Madrid (2015)=== Two FOREST EUROPE Ministerial Conferences were held in Madrid in October 2015: the 7th Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe, and a FOREST EUROPE Extraordinary Ministerial Conference that received the results of the work of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee for a Legally Binding Agreement on Forests in Europe.

At these meetings, the ministers in charge of forest related issues in the pan-European region commit themselves and endorse decisions on forests a forestry related issues. Between Ministerial Conferences the FOREST EUROPE process works through different follow up mechanisms (see following points). ===Expert Level Meetings=== The Expert Level Meeting (ELM) is the FOREST EUROPE decision-making body between the Ministerial Conferences. Delegates from the signatory countries, the observer countries and observer organizations of the FOREST EUROPE process gather in these Expert Level Meetings to take decisions on the implementation of the resolutions and commitments taken during the Ministerial Conferences, as well as the preparations of upcoming Conferences. The ELM meets once or twice a year depending on its needs. ===Round Table Meetings=== The Round Table Meetings are a platform for information and opinion exchange. The meetings provide guidance on the implementation of the FOREST EUROPE decisions and resolutions, as well as the strategic development of the process. ===Working groups, seminars and workshops=== FOREST EUROPE working groups, seminars and workshops are organized to deal with and debate about specific scientific, technical or political topics related t forests. FOREST EUROPE delegates, as well as nominated experts take part in these meetings, the outcomes of which are always presented to the subsequent Expert Level Meeting. === General Coordinating Committee === The General Coordinating Committee (GCC) coordinates the work of FOREST EUROPE. It is currently composed of representatives from 5 of the FOREST EUROPE signatory countries, but the number of countries represented in the GCC has changed over time. The GCC is also the financing body of the FOREST EUROPE process and the Liaison Unit and its activities. It is also in charge of advising the Liaison Unit about the implementation of FOREST EUROPE decisions and strategic developments. The first two Ministerial Conferences on the Protection of Forests in Europe were jointly organized by France and Finland and then Finland and Portugal, on their own initiative. At the second Ministerial Conference, held in Helsinki, the participants recognized the continuity and guiding of the follow-up of the process in hands of a co-chairmanship and placed a structure of cooperation in the form of the GCC. The committee, on a voluntary basis and regionally balanced, was first constituted by three countries and broadened to five countries afterwards. The following countries have been a member of the GCC since the beginning of the Ministerial Conference process: France, Finland, Portugal, Austria, Poland, Norway, Spain, Slovak Republic, Germany, Turkey and, since the 7th FOREST EUROPE Ministerial Conference. In accordance with the established practice of FOREST EUROPE, one of the countries represented in the GCC is always the host country of the previous Ministerial Conference, other is the country which holds the chairmanship of the process and will convene the next Ministerial Conference, and the other three are countries which will succeed in the line of chairing FOREST EUROPE. At present, the GCC is constituted by Spain (host country of the last Ministerial Conference), Slovak Republic (host country of the next Ministerial Conference), Turkey, Germany and Sweden, which replaced Norway in the GCC at the 7th FOREST EUROPE Miniterial Conference. The chairmanship of the process was taken over from Spain at the Madrid conference by the Slovak Republic, which will host the next FOREST EUROPE Ministerial Conference. In accordance with the established practice of FOREST EUROPE, the General Coordinating Committee consists of the country which holds the chairmanship of the process and will convene the next Ministerial Conference (Slovakia), the country which organised the previous Ministerial Conference (Spain) and three more countries which will succeed in the line of chairing FOREST EUROPE. ===Liaison Unit=== The Liaison Unit is the support office of the FOREST EUROPE process. It organises and carries out all FOREST EUROPE meetings and prepares the reports and all the necessary documentation for the meetings. The Liaison Unit is located in the country which holds the chairmanship of FOREST EUROPE \u2013 currently in Zvolen, Slovakia, under the name of Liaison Unit Bratislava. ==Notes== ==References== * Barbati, A.
