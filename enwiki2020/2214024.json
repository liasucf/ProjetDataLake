Marthe, Saskatchewan, to French Canadians Leopold Fafard and Julienne Cantin. Fafard is a descendant of Jacques Goulet. He received a B.F.A from the University of Manitoba in 1966 and a M.F.A. from Pennsylvania State University in 1968. From 1968 to 1974, he taught sculpture at the University of Saskatchewan, Regina Campus (now the University of Regina). He was a visiting lecturer at the University of California, Davis in 1980-1981. He received several awards throughout his professional career including being named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1981, the Architectural Institute of Canada Allied Arts Award in 1987, the Saskatchewan Order of Merit in 2002, the National Prix Montfort in 2003, and the Lieutenant Governor's Saskatchewan Centennial Medal for the Arts in 2005. He also received Honorary Doctorate Degrees from the University of Regina (1989) and University of Manitoba (2007). Fafard met Ric Gomez and David Gilhooly in 1968 when he arrived at the Regina School of Art to teach pottery and sculpture. They introduced him to Funk art and under their influence, he began making figures in clay. Throughout his career, Fafard sculpted with plaster, clay, and bronze, which was his primary medium in the 1980s. His work was heavily influenced by his Saskatchewan surroundings, and ranged in size from handheld to larger than life-sized. In 1985 he opened the Julienne Atelier foundry in Pense, Saskatchewan, where he was based for the majority of his working years. Fafard's works have been shown internationally in countries including the United States, Great Britain, France and Japan. His art was featured on a series of postage stamps issued by Canada Post in 2012. The National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa installed his colourful Running Horses (2007) in 2011 adjacent to the Sussex Drive entrance. He died at his home outside of Lumsden, Saskatchewan on March 16, 2019 from stomach cancer at the age of 76.https://www.nsnews.com/saskatchewan-sculptor-joe-fafard-known-for-cows- horses-and-buffalo-dies-at-76-1.23666102 ==Public works== File:Urban cows.jpg|Joe Fafard's sculptural work, \"The Pasture\" (1985), Toronto Dominion Centre, Toronto, Ontario Canada File:Joe_Fafard_The_Pasture_01.jpg|Joe Fafard's sculptural work, \"The Pasture\" (1985), Toronto Dominion Centre, Toronto, Ontario Canada File:Edmonton Paskwamostos.jpg|Joe Fafard's sculptural work, Paskwamostos, outside of Shaw Conference Centre, Edmonton, Alberta File:Joe Fafard - Nurture Nature 01.jpg|Joe Fafard's sculptural work, Nurture Nature (1993), east side of Hart House, Toronto, Ontario Canada File:Fafard horses Ottawa.jpeg|Joe Fafard's sculptural work, Running Horses at the National Gallery of Canada Ottawa, Ontario Canada * Oskana-Ka-Ashteki (Cree for Bones that are piled together), 800 block of Scarth Street in downtown Regina, Saskatchewan (1998) * Claudia, along avenue de Mus\u00e9e entrance of Michal and Renata Hornstein Pavilion, Montreal Museum of Fine Arts (2003) ==Awards== * Officer of the Order of Canada, 1981 * Medal in Allied Arts, Royal Architectural Institute of Canada, 1987 * Honorary Doctorate Degree, University of Regina, 1989 http://awards.usask.ca/faculty/recipients/fafard.php * Saskatchewan Order of Merit, 2002 * National Prix Montfort, 2003 * Lieutenant Governor's Saskatchewan Centennial Medal for the Arts, 2005 * CTV Citizen of the Year in 2006 http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=53845ed6-b0bd-4620-8518-f48cab72eb54 * Honorary Doctorate Degree, University of Manitoba, 2007 http://www.umanitoba.ca/admin/governance/senate/hdr/851.html * Saskatchewan Arts Board Lifetime Achievement Award, 2007 http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/lifetime-achievement-award-for- sask-sculptor-fafard-1.649496 == See also == ==References== === Bibliography === * ==External links== * Official site * Joe Fafard at JVGallery.ca * I Don't Have to Work that Big, an NFB documentary * Canada Post - Joe Fafard * University of Regina Archives and Special Collections.
