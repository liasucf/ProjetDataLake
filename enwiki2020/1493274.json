Eisenhower Fellowships selected Mollenhoff as a USA Eisenhower Fellow in 1960. In 1965, Mollenhoff published Despoilers of Democracy, which provided details of corruption associated with Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B.

In 1969 he served for a year as Special Counsel to President Richard Nixon, after which he became the Registers Washington bureau chief.
