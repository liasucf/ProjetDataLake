De Martino was born in Naples on 3 or 13 January 1870, and studied at the Reale Istituto di Belle Arti there, under Gioacchino Toma and Stanislao Lista. He spent some time in Paris, where he made small groups of figures. In 1900 he won a prize at the Salon de Paris for a bronze of a fisherman. After his return to Naples his work tended towards social realism. He died in Naples on 3 March 1935. ==References== Category:1870 births Category:1935 deaths Category:People from Naples Category:19th-century Italian sculptors Category:Italian male sculptors Category:20th-century Italian sculptors ",
