    "text": "My Date with a Vampire III is a 2004 Hong Kong television series produced by ATV as a sequel to My Date with a Vampire (1998) and My Date with a Vampire II (2000), but with a new story line that is different from the first two seasons. The series starred many cast members from the first two seasons. Like the first two seasons, My Date with a Vampire III also blends aspects of the Chinese \"hopping\" corpses of jiangshi fiction with those of western vampires, while injecting elements of Chinese mythology, eschatology and time travel, with more focus on Chinese mythology in this season as compared to the first two. ==Plot== At the end of My Date with a Vampire II, set in early 2001, Fong Tin-yau, Ma Siu-ling, and their allies succeeded in preventing the goddess N\u00fcwa from destroying the world. Three years later, another eschatological event is about to happen. In ancient times, Fuxi, the King of Humankind, desired to create a paradise called the \"Eternal Country\" in the human world. However, that brought him into conflict with his lover, the goddess Yaochi Shengmu (Holy Mother of the Shining Lake), because the latter's mission is to bring death and disease upon humankind. Fuxi eventually broke up with Yaochi Shengmu and started a new relationship with the maiden Chang'e. However, he lost Chang'e when she flew to the Moon after consuming a magic pill from Yaochi Shengmu. Fuxi blamed Yaochi Shengmu for separating him and Chang'e, and fought with his ex-lover. The Elders of the Pangu clan intervened by putting Yaochi Shengmu under custody in Heaven while Fuxi remains in the human world. Fong Tin-yau and Ma Siu-ling are living happily in Heaven after their success in 2001. However, in 2004, Yaochi Shengmu breaks free and introduces a deadly virus to wipe out the entire Pangu clan. Fong is infected by the virus and is on the verge of dying, but he manages to transport Ma back to the human realm. Ma has to find ways to stop an imminent clash between Fuxi and Yaochi Shengmu because that could bring about the end of the world. Upon returning to the human world, Ma travels back in time to the Song dynasty to find Fong's previous incarnation, Jim-tau (Arrowhead), and brings him back to present-day Hong Kong. At the same time, she meets her family members \u2014 her parents Ma Dai-lung and Tong Gam-bo, and her twin brother Ma Siu-fu \u2014 whom she has never seen before. She also encounters a strange girl called Fong Tin-ngai, who turns out to be her daughter from the future. She is eventually reunited with Fong Tin-yau again. Just as relations between Fuxi and Yaochi Shengmu start to improve, and the situation becomes more stable, Fong Tin-yau, Ma Siu-ling, and their allies are confronted by Destiny, the entity that controls and dictates the fates of all beings in the universe. They need to overcome Destiny in order to change the fate of the world. ==Vampires== See My Date with a Vampire#Vampires for a description of the vampires depicted in this television series. ==Cast== * Eric Wan as Fong Tin-Yau (), the protagonist. At the end of My Date with a Vampire II, he left for Heaven with Ma Siu-ling and they lived happily there. However, three years later, Yaochi Shengmu breaks free and introduces a deadly virus to wipe out the entire Pangu clan. Infected by the virus, Fong is on the verge of dying but he manages to send Ma Siu-ling back to the human world. He reappears later again to reunite with Ma Siu-ling and prevent Yaochi Shengmu and Fuxi from ending the world. ** Eric Wan also portrayed Arrowhead (), a warrior serving under the general Yue Fei. He is actually Fong Tin-yau's previous incarnation. During a battle in Zhuxian Town, Ma Siu-ling suddenly shows up, helps Arrowhead and his comrades defeat evil supernatural forces, and then brings Arrowhead with her back to present-day Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, Jim-tau assumes Fong Tin-yau's identity and starts a relationship with Ma Siu-ling. When the real Fong Tin-yau returns and when the universe is under threat by Destiny, Arrowhead sacrifices himself by entering Hell to help the souls of the damned redeem themselves. He succeeds in his noble quest and eventually becomes one of the Ma family\u2019s guardian deities. * Joey Meng as Ma Siu-ling (), Fong Tin-Yau's lover. In this season, she becomes a vampire after Fong Tin-ngai accidentally bit her. As her genetic composition is incompatible with the \u201cvampire gene\u201d because the Ma family is supposed to hunt down and destroy vampires, she turns into a vampire of a special breed that are even more powerful than first-generation vampires. At the same time, her original identity as the \"good\" Ma Siu-ling is overtaken by her darker personality, which is reflected in her new vampire identity, and she starts harming people. Arrowhead enters her mind through hypnosis in an attempt to reawaken her \"good\" identity, who is being trapped in an illusion, and help her regain control of herself. She succeeds in keeping her dark personality under control and reunites with Fong Tin-yau later. * Kenneth Chan as Yuen- ngan Bat-po (), a general of the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty. When he is mortally wounded in Zhuxian Town, his sister uses her magic powers to release the Holy Peach Tree sown by Yaochi Shengmu, in the hope that he will survive if he consumes a Holy Peach. However, the Holy Peach Tree turns out to be a curse planted by Yaochi Shengmu, whose aim is to destroy the world by making vampires multiply and going around killing people. Yuen-ngan becomes a vampire after consuming a Holy Peach, loses control of himself, and starts biting his men and turning them into \"zombie\" vampires. The remaining Song and Jin soldiers put aside their conflict for the time being and team up to fight the vampires but none of them survived the battle. Yuen-ngan regrets his actions when he finally regains control of himself, but by then, he has received orders from the Jin emperor to clear Zhuxian Town of enemy forces. He faces Ngok Ngan-ping in battle and reluctantly kills her. As he is now an undying vampire, he lives on for over 800 years and moves to present-day Hong Kong, where he changes his name to \"Yuen Bat-po\" (). He remains deeply embattled over what happened in Zhuxian Town and constantly hopes to meet Ngok Ngan-ping again. * Mark Cheng as Fuxi, the King of Humankind (). As the first man to exist in the world, he has been authorised by the Pangu Elders to oversee the affairs of the human world. He aims to create a paradise called \"Eternal Country\" in the human world and strives hard to achieve this goal. However, this brings him into conflict with his lover, Yaochi Shengmu, whose task is to bring death and disease upon humankind. Later, it is revealed that Houyi (), the legendary archer who shot down nine suns, is actually one of Fuxi's many alter egos. After living for thousands of years, Fuxi decides to lead the life of a normal man so he suppresses his immortality and powers. He adopts a new name, \"Yam Hei\" (), and becomes a teacher in Hong Kong. However, the reappearance of Yaochi Shengmu causes him to revive his true identity. * Alice Chan as Yaochi Shengmu (), a goddess in charge of bringing death and disease upon humankind. She falls in love with Fuxi, but his feelings for her grow weaker as he gets more romantically attracted to Chang'e, whom she becomes extremely jealous of. After engaging Fuxi in a fight over Chang'e's flight to the Moon, Yaochi Shengmu is taken back to Heaven and placed under custody by the Pangu Elders. However, in 2004, she escapes and unleashes a deadly virus to wipe out the Pangu clan, after which she returns to the human world to find Fuxi in the hope of rekindling their past romance. In the human world, she disguises herself as a romance writer called \"Yiu Ging\" (). * Ruco Chan as Ho Yau-kau (), Ho Ying-kau's younger brother. Like his elder brother, he once studied supernatural arts under the tutelage of the Ma and Mou families and was said to be a genius. However, he was banished from his school after attempting to use a forbidden spell to bring his dead lover, June, back to life. After that, he finds a set of mystical books, which he uses to predict people\u2019s futures, and becomes a fortune teller under the alias \"Mr. Tin-yat\" (). At one point, he is possessed by the entity called \"Destiny\" (), which dictates the fates of all beings in the universe. Under the influence of Destiny, he goes around attempting to manipulate others\u2019 fates and forcing them to yield to him. * Pinky Cheung as Yuen-ngan Mo-lui (), Yuen-ngan Bat- po's younger sister and a sorceress.

Later, when Yuen-ngan Mo-lui is dying, in desperation, X agrees to yield to Destiny and becomes manipulated by Destiny to do the latter\u2019s bidding. Whenever he reveals anything about Destiny, he loses control of himself and harms his close friends and loved ones. * Teresa Mak as Mou Yau (), a descendant of Mou Siu-fong (the protagonist in Vampire Expert). She and Ma Siu-ling were mentored by Ho Ying-kau, who would choose one of them to be the successor to the Mou and Ma clans, whose mission is to eliminate all evil supernatural beings in the world. Ma Siu-ling was chosen eventually so Mou Yau passed on her powers to Ma and left Hong Kong to study abroad. Many years later, she returns to Hong Kong and serves in the police force, where she leads the ghostbusting SDU squad. She joins Fong Tin-yau, Ma Siu-ling and the others in their quest to stop Yaochi Shengmu and Fuxi from ending the world. * Cheung Kwok-kuen as Fuk-sang (), the boy vampire who accompanied Fong Tin-yau in the first two seasons. At the end of the second season, he was granted his wish to be a vampire no more, so he is now a normal boy. He becomes the manager of Waiting Bar, using Ma's name in her absence. He is also a student in Fuxi's school. * Kylie Kwok as Fong Tin-ngai (), Fong Tin-yau and Ma Siu-ling's daughter from the post-apocalyptic future. Her father sends her back in time to 2004 in the hope that she can meet her mother and help to prevent the eschatological events from taking place. Like her father, she is also a vampire. At one point, when she lost control of herself, she bit Ma Siu-ling and caused her mother to become a vampire. She has a crush on Sky, who was the first person she met after travelling back in time to 2004. When her parents decide to confront Destiny and attempt to change the future, she disintegrates and is forever erased from the memories of those who had knowledge of her existence. * Ricky Chan as Ma Siu-fu (), Ma Siu-ling's twin brother. He starts a romance with Chang'e and is unaware that she has actually been going around killing people when she cannot control her bloodlust. Later in the series, he is revealed to be the reincarnation of the bodhisattva Ksitigarbha (), who presides over the Underworld and relentlessly tries to help the souls of the damned get out of Hell. He helps the protagonists in their quest to stop Yaochi Shengmu and Fuxi from ending the world. * Tats Lau as Ma Dai-lung (), Ma Siu-ling and Ma Siu-fu's father. He has extraordinarily strong willpower and the ability to create miracles with his willpower. When he first started a romance with his future wife, Tong Gam- bo, she got into a fatal accident and was on the verge of dying. However, by playing a song he specially composed for her, he managed to create a miracle: Ksitigarbha was so touched by Ma's love for Tong that he allowed Tong to continue living for one year. When his wife eventually dies in childbirth, Ma is instructed by Ksitigarbha to raise Siu-fu and Siu-ling away from each other and to never tell them about their parents, or else Siu-fu will die. Ma disguises himself as a fortune teller and watches his son grow up. Before his death, he is reunited with his family and breaks the truth to his children. * Mango Wong as Tong Gam-bo (), Ma Dai-lung's wife and the mother of Ma Siu-ling and Ma Siu-fu. She dies in childbirth. However, before she died, Fuxi, who is touched by Ma Dai-lung's love for her, bites her and turns her into a vampire. After her death, she is assigned to take over the duties of Meng Po in the Underworld. When Ma Siu-ling becomes a vampire and loses control of herself, Tong shows up and gives her daughter a potion, which makes Ma forget her past and hence suppress her vampire identity. Just before Ma Dai-lung\u2019s death, she returns from the Underworld to briefly reunite with her family. * Asuka Higuchi as Chang'e (), Fuxi's second lover. Once, when she was dying, Fuxi pleaded with Yaochi Shengmu to save her, so Yaochi Shengmu gave Chang'e a magic pill. However, the magic pill's effect was too strong for Chang'e to bear, so she overcame gravity and flew to the Moon while Fuxi looked on helplessly after failing to stop her from flying away. Fuxi mistakenly believed that Yaochi Shengmu gave Chang'e the magic pill because she wanted to separate him and Chang'e. This resulted in a fight between Fuxi and Yaochi Shengmu. Later, in 2004, Chang'e is approached by Destiny, who sends her back to the human world and manipulates her to help him spread an unknown virus that would cause infected beings to lose their senses. Chang'e becomes a vampire and goes around killing people when she cannot control her bloodlust.

After his death, he is chosen to be an Underworld Guardian, whose task is to escort the souls of the dead to the Underworld. He is also renamed Nick. At one point, Ho Ying-kau passes on his position as Ksitigarbha's surrogate to Nick because he is travelling to the human world to help Ho Yau-kau break free of Destiny's control.
