In 2013 the Reserve Bank of India authorized the company's use of the MobiKwik wallet, and in May 2016 the company began providing small loans to consumers as part of its service.

In November 2016, the company reported having 1.5 million merchants using its service and a user base of 55 million customers. ==History== MobiKwik founder Bipin Singh (second from right) at the 2016 Rise Conference MobiKwik was founded in 2009 by husband and wife team Bipin Preet Singh and Upasana Taku. Singh, a 2002 graduate of IIT Delhi, saw an opportunity to improve mobile recharge options. He seeded the company with USD$250 thousand of his own money, developed the website and payment options, and rented office space in Dwarka, Delhi. The initial service was a website with a closed wallet facility, but over the years, MobiKwik extended their service to mobile apps. The company initially partnered with online merchants to make their wallet available as a payment option on e-commerce sites. The company employs over 325 people, operating in three segments including consumer payments, fintech, and payment gateway. ==Overview== MobiKwik launched an e-wallet system in 2012 that enabled users to deposit money online to use for bill payments and other features. MobiKwik provides financial services including loan, accident insurance, life insurance, fire insurance, IMPS money transfer, credit card bill payment, mutual funds, and DTH recharge. They also introduced the feature of sending and receiving money via a mobile app. In September 2014, Express Computer reported how MobiKwik was partnering with GoDaddy and other international companies to help them comply with Indian payment regulations.
