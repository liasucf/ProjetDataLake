    "text": "The Jekyll and Hyde Tour (stylized as the Jekyll + Hyde Tour) was the fifth headlining concert tour by American country music group the Zac Brown Band, in support of their fourth studio album Jekyll + Hyde (2015). The tour began on May 1, 2015 in Nashville, Tennessee and finished on December 11 that year in Grand Rapids, Michigan. This was the sixteenth ranked tour of 2015 and grossed $45.2 million in revenue. ==Background== Zac Brown Band announced the tour in March 2015. Nine of the shows will take place at baseball parks including historic stadiums such as Fenway Park and Wrigley Field. A London date was announced in May 2015. $1 from every ticket sold goes to Brown's \"Camp Southern Ground\", a camp that gives kids \"including those with social and emotional problems, a chance to go away to camp.\" ==Concert synopsis and production== The shows last for two and a half hours, and the stage is a three-story tier, and LED screens. The band played twenty-six numbers including most of the tracks off Jekyll + Hyde, past favorites, and covers of \"Kashmir (song)\" by Led Zeppelin, \"Let It Be\" by The Beatles, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen, \"Under the Bridge\" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers and \"Enter Sandman\" by Metallica. Not only are there country music elements in the show but there is also EDM, rock and pop. At the end of \"Dress Blues\" the video screen shows a flag-folding ceremony for a veteran. Photos of \"Camp Southern Ground\" is displayed on the screens during \"Remedy\" During \"Junkyard\" a fifteen-foot dragon controlled by the leg work of the band, wound its way around the stage. The kickoff show in Nashville had guest appearances from, Jewel, Kid Rock, B\u00e9la Fleck and Drake White. ==Opening acts== *Gregg Allman *The Avett Brothers *Big Head Todd & The Monsters *Jason Isbell *Muddy Magnolias *Elliot Root *Marc Scibilia *Drake White ==Setlist== #\"Homegrown\" #\"Knee Deep\" #\"One Day\" #\"Remedy\" #\"As She's Walking Away\" #\"Dress Blues\" #\"Mango Tree\" #\"Young and Wild\" #\"Castaway\" #\"Sweet Annie\" #\"Love the One You're With\" #\"Let It Be\" #\"I'll Be Your Man (Song for a Daughter)\" #\"Colder Weather\" #\"Keep Me in Mind\" #\"Wildfire\" #\"Bittersweet\" #\"Toes\" #\"Day for the Dead\" #\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" #\"Lovin' You Easy\" #\"Free\"/\"Into the Mystic\" #\"Beautiful Drug\" #\"Chicken Fried\" ;Encore # * \"Junkyard\" # * \"Tomorrow Never Comes\" Source: ==Tour dates== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of concerts, showing date, city, country, venue, opening acts, attendance, and gross revenue |- !
