    "text": "The Rendiconti di Matematica e delle sue Applicazioni (Reports on Mathematics and its applications) is an open access peer-reviewed mathematics journal, jointly published by the \"Guido Castelnuovo\" Department of Mathematics of the Sapienza University of Rome and by the Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica Francesco Severi,See and . established in 1913., . The Journal started his publications a year after, in 1914, and his first director was Vito Volterra.According to the Journal \"Historical Notes\" (2016): see also . It publishes research articles in pure and applied mathematics, without imposing restrictions on the length of the work: for this reason, the submission of surveys, articles of foundational nature and doctoral dissertations is also encouraged.See the journal editorial policy statement at the journal home page (2016). As in every peer reviewed journal, every article is refereed, and the journal adheres to the EMS Code of Practice.(Journal home page (2016). The journal is abstracted and indexed by Mathematical Reviews, Zentralblatt MATH and Scopus. ==Historical notes== ===Foundation and the first four series=== The journal was founded in 1913 as the press organ of the \"Seminario Matematico della Facolt\u00e0 di Scienze della Reale Uninversit\u00e0 di Roma\": its first director (Editor in chief) was Vito Volterra, who held this position from its foundation to the year 1921. The direction passed to Guido Castelnuovo who held it from 1921 to 1922:. with the beginning of and during the publishing of the whole second and third series of the journal, from 1922 to 1935 Federigo Enriques was the director.. During fourth series of the journal, at the starting of which it underwent its first name change, the direction passed to Gaetano Scorza, who held it until his death in 1939. ===The INdAM and its influence=== The founding of the Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica in 1939, under the decisive influence of Francesco Severi,According to and , who also who precisely states that:-\"Proprio in quell'anno 1939\u20131940, Severi aveva costituito l'Istituto di Alta Matematica\" (). had important consequences on the \"Rendiconti del Seminario Matematico\". On 23 November 1939, during its first meeting, the Scientific Council\"\" . of the then newborn institute,The members of the council were Francesco Severi (the president), Luigi Fantappi\u00e8, Giulio Krall as members of the institute, Enrico Bompiani and Mauro Picone as member chosen by the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Rome . considering the need of a means to publish the results of the research done by the members and the students working at the institute,. decided to merge the needed means and the already existing journal in one single entity, giving birth to the \"Rendiconti di Matematica e delle sue Applicazioni\". Entrusted with this double function the fifth series of the journal, from the first volume published in 1940. to the first issue of the fourth volume published in 1943,. included a section listing the programs of the INdAM courses of the current academic year\"Programmi dei corsi...\" (): see . as well as section listing the research problems proposed by the lecturers currently working at the institute.\"Problemi, risultati e discussioni (lavori di seminario)\" (): see and also the description of the activities at the INdAM in the early 1940s given by . ===Timeline of Journal series and editors in chief=== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !

This is a monographic fascicle published on the \"Bollettino della Unione Matematica Italiana\", describing the history of the \"Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica Francesco Severi\" from its foundation in 1939 to 2003: it was written by Gino Roghi and includes a presentation by Salvatore Coen and a preface by Corrado De Concini.
