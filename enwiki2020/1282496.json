Baking problems solved. Woodhead Pub Ltd, p. 261. . The characteristic cake layers resembling growth rings. ==History== The origins of baumkuchen are a matter of controversy. The State of Bavaria claims that baumkuchen has been created since at least the 19th century in Bavaria. Another line of thought suggests that this cake had its beginnings as a Hungarian wedding cake, that is, a derivative of the oldest Hungarian pastry k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs (chimney cake). A recipe for baumkuchen appears in Ein new Kochbuch (literally \"A New Cookbook\"), published in 1581, the first cookbook written for professional chefs by Marx Rumpolt.Alan Davidson and Tom Jaine (2006). The Oxford companion to food. Oxford University Press, USA, 2006. p. 805 . Marx Rumpolt had previously worked as a chef in Hungary and Bohemia. In 1682, a rural medic working for Johann Sigismund Elsholtz prepared a similar dessert. Aside from the above mentioned recent history, baumkuchen was already known in Ancient Greece and the latter Rome. The Roman conquerors brought the method for baking cakes on logs over an open fire to what is today Germany and its surroundings. ==Characteristics== Baking demonstration in Germany, here: application of the couverture chocolate.

The recipe can be varied by adding other ingredients, such as ground nuts, honey, marzipan, nougat and rum or brandy, to the batter or filling.

These pieces are typically coated in chocolate and sold individually. ===Schichttorte=== A simpler horizontally layered version of the cake is called a \"Schichttorte\". It is baked without a spit, which results in horizontal layers instead of circular rings. The Schichttorte is more like a conventional cake in shape and can be baked in a conventional home oven that has a broiler inside, whereas the traditional spit version requires special equipment normally not available in an average home. Compared to the spit variant, the Schichttorte's cross section is less reminiscent of tree rings. ==In Japan== Baumkuchen is one of the most popular pastries in Japan, where it is called .

Continued success allowed him to move to Yokohama and open a bakery, but its destruction in the 1923 Great Kant\u014d earthquake caused him to move his operations to Kobe, where he stayed until his death just before the end of World War II.
