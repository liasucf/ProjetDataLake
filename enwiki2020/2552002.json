It had 1886 inhabitants as of 31 December 2017. A large industrial area extending into Saxony and including the site of a large power plant is known by the same name. On 26 May 2006, construction work started on the world's first -free coal power plant in the Schwarze Pumpe industrial district. The plant is based on a concept called carbon capture and storage, which means that carbon emissions will be captured and compressed to th their original volume, liquefying the gas. It will then be forced 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) below the soil into porous rock where it is believed that it will remain for thousands of years without exacerbating global warming. The project, which has cost some 70 million Euros, was funded entirely by the Swedish company Vattenfall AB and went into service on 9 September 2008. The power plant was a pilot project to serve as a prototype for future full-scale power plants. Vattenfall stopped carbon capture R&D; at the plant in 2014 because they found that \"its costs and the energy it requires make the technology unviable\". ==Sons and daughters of the town== * Johann Agricola (1530-1590), Protestant theologian of the 16th century * Otto Ostrowski (1883-1963), politician (SPD), Lord Mayor of Berlin 1946/1947 * Erwin Strittmatter (1912-1994), writer * Joachim Teege (1925-1969), actor and cabaret artist * Dirk Meier (born 1964), cyclist * Sebastian Piersig (born 1984), slalom-canoeist, participant Olympia 2008 in Beijing ==References== == External links == * * Category:Localities in Spree-Nei\u00dfe Category:Localities in Lower Lusatia Category:Province of Brandenburg Category:Bezirk Cottbus ",
