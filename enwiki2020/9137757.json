The station is owned and operated by Cumulus Media. WQLH's studios are located on Victoria Street in Green Bay, while its transmitter is located near Suamico. The station launched in 1967 as WDUZ-FM on 98.3 with 3000 watts and a minimal antenna height of 77' (and would later move to 98.5) (a sister station to WDUZ) and aired a beautiful music format until January 1990. At that time, the station shifted to a soft adult contemporary format as \"Light 98.5 WQLH\" (meaning \"Quality Light Hits\"). The format would evolve into a more modern (and more upbeat) hot adult contemporary playlist by the mid-1990s (with the station being rebranded as \"98.5 Mix FM\"), eventually adopting the \"Star 98\" branding in December 1999, when the station was purchased by Cumulus Media. Star 98 begins a \"Totally 80's Weekend\" Friday at 5pm. They are known for playing \"30 minutes commercial free\" music, as well as an \"All 80's Lunch\". Steve Davis & Laura McKenna comprise the morning show, which airs Monday through Friday from 5:30am to 9:00am(CST). Bill Rabeor provides the news during the morning show. Stix Franklin is the mid-day host and Jimmy Clark hosts the afternoon drive. Cumulus swapped WQLH and four other Green Bay stations to Clear Channel in 2009 in exchange for two Cincinnati radio stations; however, Cumulus continued to operate the stations. In August 2013, Clear Channel reached a deal to sell the five stations back to Cumulus. ==References== ==External links== * * QLH Category:Hot adult contemporary radio stations in the United States Category:Cumulus Media radio stations ",
