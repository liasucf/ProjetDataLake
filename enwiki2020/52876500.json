    "text": "United States gubernatorial elections were held 6 November 1962 in 35 states, concurrent with the House and Senate elections. In Minnesota, the governor was elected to a 4-year term for the first time, instead of a 2-year term. In North Dakota, this was the last election on a 2-year cycle, before switching to a 4-year term for governors. The Democratic and Republican parties each gained seven governorships from the other party, leaving the overall partisan balance unchanged. == Results == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! State !!
