    "text": "Ryhall is a village and civil parish in the county of Rutland in the East Midlands of England. It is situated close to the eastern boundary of the county, about 2 miles (3 km) north of Stamford. The parish includes the hamlet of Belmesthorpe. ==History== Nave of the church There is an early thirteenth- century parish church, dedicated to St John the Evangelist. The exterior has a number of interesting carved figures. The southern entrance has a porch with a room over it, originally for the priest, now called the Parvis Room. Saint Tibba, patron saint of falconers, is believed to have lived in Ryhall in the 7th century. She was buried here, but in the 11th century her relics were translated to Peterborough Abbey, now Peterborough Cathedral, by Abbot \u00c6lfsige (1006-1042). The society is now known as Peterborough Museum SocietyA History of the County of Rutland: Volume 2, Page, W. (ed.), 1935. British History Online. Retrieved 16 March 2010 According to legend, St Tibba was a niece of King Penda of Mercia.Rollason, D.W., The Mildrith Legend A Study in Early Medieval Hagiography in England, Leicester University Press, 1982 (e.g. p. 115, in Medieval Latin). The remains of a small hermitage associated with the saint can be seen on the west side of the north aisle of church. A 19th- century book refers to a holy well dedicated to Saint Tibba, though the location cannot now be identified, and there is similar doubt about the location of a well said to have been dedicated to Tibba's alleged relative, St Ebba. For the relationship between St Tibba and St Ebba (\"Domne Eafe\"), see e.g. Rollason, D.W., The Mildrith Legend A Study in Early Medieval Hagiography in England, Leicester University Press, 1982, p.77. The route of the Stamford and Essendine railway passed through the parish, on embankments still clearly visible today. It included a station called \"Ryhall & Belmisthorpe\", located in Belmesthorpe. The line opened in 1856 but closed a century later in 1959. ==Community== Village sign In 2011 Ryhall had a population of 1,614, making it one of the largest villages in Rutland. It is bounded to its west by the A6121 main road from Stamford to Bourne and on the other three sides by the River Gwash, although some development has spilled over the river to the north and out along the Essendine road. Ryhall has a Church of England Academy School, with an attendance, in 2003, of 170 pupils aged 4 to 11. The village also has a post office/village shop, Methodist Chapel, library and two public houses, The Wicked Witch and The Green Dragon. The former Fordham's supermarket of the 1960s-70s was a kitchen showroom, which closed in 2016. ===Sport=== The football club, Ryhall United F.C. re-formed during the 2009-10 season and are currently playing in the Peterborough and District Football League Division 1.
