    "text": "Khadimou Rassoul Cheikh Fall (born September 10, 1998), better known as Sheck Wes, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and model. He is best known for his 2017 song \"Mo Bamba\", which became popular in 2018. Wes is jointly signed to Travis Scott's Cactus Jack and Kanye West's GOOD Music record labels, under the aegis of Interscope Records. == Early life== Khadimou Fall was born on September 10, 1998 in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City to parents of Senegalese descent. Wes was raised in a Muslim household. At age 5, Wes and his mother moved to Milwaukee, where he lived for 9 years. At 14, Wes moved back to New York. Fall began making music at age 11, to relieve stress due to his troubled childhood as he was raised in a hostile environment. While in high school, basketball became a major extracurricular pursuit, but he attracted interest from a fashion talent scout, leading him to skipping a playoff game to participate in the Madison Square Garden unveiling of the Yeezy Season 3 collection. == Career == On February 2, 2018, Fall signed to Kanye West's GOOD Music and Travis Scott's Cactus Jack Records label alongside Interscope. Fall made a guest appearance on Scott's fourth studio album Astroworld on the song \"No Bystanders\" alongside American rapper Juice WRLD. On October 2, Fall announced his debut studio album titled Mudboy which was released just three days after. On March 19, Fall released a new single under the Cactus Jack label called \"YKTS\". In January 2019, Fall was part of the opening act for Eminem's concert in Hawaii alongside fellow American rapper Logic. On July 18, Fall released the singles \"Sadio Mane\", and \"Losing My Mind\". On December 27, Fall was heavily featured on the song \"Gang Gang\" from the Cactus Jack compilation album JackBoys. == Controversies == On January 31, 2019, Ridge Productions claimed Fall had refused to pay for the video for his forthcoming single \"Mudboy.\" Ridge Productions posted the original edit of the video, with substituted audio mocking Fall and his crew for reneging on their agreement. In February 2019, Fall was accused of stalking and domestic abuse by his former partner, the singer Justine Skye. Fall was removed from an advertising campaign for Major League Soccer in response to the allegations. Skye was subsequently reported to have requested a restraining order against Fall. Fall has denied the allegations and no charges were ever brought forward. On May 21, 2020, Fall was arrested on drug and gun charges in New York. He was later released. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of studio albums, with selected details ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:9em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:22em;\"| Album details ! colspan=\"6\" scope=\"col\" | Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Certifications ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Sales |- !style=\"width:3em; font- size:90%\"|US !style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\"|US R&B;/HH !style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\"|US Rap !style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\"|BEL (FL) !style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\"|CAN !style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\"|NLD |- ! scope=\"row\"| Mudboy | * Released: October 5, 2018 * Label: Cactus Jack, GOOD, Interscope * Format: Digital download, streaming | 17 |11 |11 |115|| 19 |121 | * RIAA: Gold *MC: Gold | * US: 500,000 |} ===Collaborative albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ List of collaborative albums, with selected details ! rowspan=\"2\" |Title ! rowspan=\"2\" |Album details ! colspan=\"5\" |Peak chart positions |- ! style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\"|US !style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\"|AUS !style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\"|BEL (FL) !style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\"|CAN !style=\"width:3em; font- size:90%\"|NZ |- ! scope=\"row\" |JackBoys (with Travis Scott, Don Toliver, Chase B, and Luxury Tax as JackBoys) | * Released: December 27, 2019 * Label: Cactus Jack, Epic * Formats: CD, LP, cassette, digital download, streaming |1 |5 |19 |1 |5 |} ===Singles=== ==== As lead artist ==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+List of singles as lead artist, with selected chart positions, showing year released and album name ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20em;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2em;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"6\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12em;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Certifications ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:14em;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\"| US ! style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\"| US R&B;/HH ! style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\"| AUS ! style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\"| CAN ! style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\" |NZ Hot ! style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\"| UK |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Live Sheck Wes\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2017 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014|| \u2014 | | rowspan=\"2\"| Mudboy |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Mo Bamba\" | 6 || 2 || 29 || 5 || 36|| 26 | *RIAA: 5\u00d7 Platinum *MC: 3\u00d7 Platinum *RMNZ: Gold *SNEP: Gold |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Do That\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2018 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014|| \u2014 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Chippi Chippi\" | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014|| \u2014 | |Mudboy |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Enzo\" | rowspan=\"5\" | 2019 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || 21|| \u2014 | | Carte Blanche |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Sadio Mane\" | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014|| \u2014 | | rowspan=\"3\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Losing My Mind\" | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014|| \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"YKTS\" | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014|| \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Gang Gang\" |48 |22 |63 |40 |2 |52 | * RIAA: Gold |JackBoys |- | colspan=\"14\" style=\"font- size:90%\" | \"\u2014\" denotes a recording that did not chart or was not released in that territory. |} ==== As featured artist ==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !
