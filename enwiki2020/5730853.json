    "text": "Jefferson Street is a station on the BMT Canarsie Line of the New York City Subway. Located in Bushwick, Brooklyn at the intersection of Jefferson Street and Wyckoff Avenue, it is served by the L train at all times. ==History== Jefferson Street opened on July 14, 1928, as part of an extension of the Canarsie Line. This extension connected Montrose Avenue, which had opened four years earlier, to Broadway Junction, which was the western end of the already- operating elevated line to Canarsie. In 2019, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced that this station would become ADA-accessible as part of the agency's 2020\u20132024 Capital Program. ==Station layout== Mezzanine Entrance at Starr Street and Wyckoff Avenue This underground station has two side platforms and two tracks. The northbound platform is long, while the southbound platform is long, and both platforms are wide. The mosaic tile bands on both platforms are predominantly blue and brown with yellow and tan accents. There is a full frieze of icons with correct details. The colors, however, shift from the earth tones found in the original design to more pastel shades of rose, slate blue, yellow and peach. Some of the background tile is mottled. This is handmade work with all of the proper elements, including randomly cut and set tiles in the center. \"J\" tablets on a blue background run along the trim line at regular intervals. The station's name tablets read \"JEFFERSON ST.\" in gold serif lettering on a blue/dark red background, yellow inner border, and green outer border. There are also directional signs in gold serif lettering on blue/dark red background and yellow/green border. Blue i-beam columns run along both platforms at regular intervals with alternating ones having the standard black station name plate in white lettering. New tile was installed at the Canarsie-bound platform in the summer of 2000. ===Exits=== This station's full-time fare control area is at the extreme east (railroad south) end. A double-width staircase from each platform goes up to a waiting area/crossover, where a turnstile provides entrance/exit from the station. Outside fare control, there is a token booth and four staircases going up to all corners of Starr Street and Wyckoff Avenue. Both platforms have a same-level, unstaffed fare control area at the opposite end. One exit-only turnstile and one High Entry/Exit Turnstile lead to an enclosed staircase going up to a small brick building on either western corners of Jefferson Street and Wyckoff Avenue. The Manhattan-bound building is on the northwest corner while the Canarsie-bound building is on the southwest one. == References == == External links == * Station Reporter \u2014 * The Subway Nut \u2014 Jefferson Street Pictures * Jefferson Street entrance from Google Maps Street View * Starr Street entrance from Google Maps Street View * Platforms from Google Maps Street View Category:BMT Canarsie Line stations Category:New York City Subway stations in Brooklyn Category:New York City Subway stations located underground Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1928 Category:1928 establishments in New York (state) Category:Bushwick, Brooklyn ",
