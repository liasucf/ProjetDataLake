    "text": "The Ghost Building in Denver, Colorado, United States is literally a ghost of its former self. Originally built at 15th and Glenarm Streets in 1889 for real estate developer Allen M. Ghost by architect William A. Lang, better known for designing the Molly Brown House. When this building, listed in the National Register of Historic Places #78000847, was threatened with demolition in the 1970s, a Denver architect Brian T. Congleton proposed disassembling the facade and reassembling it elsewhere. Ghost Building at its current location After nearly a decade in storage, Brown-Schrepferman reassembled this historic building on the corner of 18th and Stout in downtown Denver in 1984. The building was reconstructed using the original details and stone facade, around a modern steel structure. The current manifestation of the building is not listed in the National Register of Historic Places. == References == Category:Historic buildings and structures in the United States Category:Buildings and structures in Denver Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1889 Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1984 Category:1889 establishments in Colorado Category:1984 establishments in Colorado ",
