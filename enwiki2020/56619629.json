    "text": "The Pr\u00fcmerburg is a ruined hill castle on a roughly 30-metre-high lias- sandstone rock on the upper edge of the valley of the Pr\u00fcm in the municipality of Pr\u00fcmzurlay in the county of Bitburg-Pr\u00fcm in the German state of Rhineland- Palatinate. == History == The Pr\u00fcmerburg, a fief of the counts and dukes of Luxembourg, is first recorded in 1337, but was probably built in the 12th century. In the immediate vicinity there was an earlier prehistorical hillfort (Wallburgen). The castle's features include the remains of a pentagonal bergfried. The Pr\u00fcmerburg is believed to have burned down in 1658. In 1337, Walter of Meysenburg is the first recorded vassal. In 1351, Godfrey of Meysenburg and his wife, Catharina of Homburg, were the enfeofees, later Pr\u00fcmzurlay, like Clerf, went to the lords of Brandenburg (a side line of the counts of Vianden). Subsequently there is evidence that the von Vinstingen and von Haracourt families (both by marriage) were vassals.Eiflia illustrata, Vol. 3, p. 492 (online) A line of the von der Heyden family bought the Lordship of Pr\u00fcmerburg in the Early Modern Period, along with Niederweis and Stolzemburg.Eiflia illustrata, Bd. 3, S. 174 (online) To the northwest in the valley, the castle chapel, the Late Gothic former Chapel of St. Nicholas, has survived. == References == == Literature == * Bernd Altmann, Hans Caspary: Kulturdenkm\u00e4ler in Rheinland-Pfalz.
