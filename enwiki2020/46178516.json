Hume provided a local alternative for housing finance, something that was becoming increasingly difficult for prospective home owners to find because of regulatory rationing. Hume officially changed its name to Hume Bank on 1 July 2014 after seeking approval from its customers and the governing body APRA in 2013. The name change reflects the banking products and services Hume now offers.
