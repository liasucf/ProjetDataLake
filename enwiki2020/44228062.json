Van de Riet received his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in computer science at the University of Amsterdam in 1968 under supervision of Adriaan van Wijngaarden for the thesis, entitled \"ALGOL 60 as Formula Manipulation Language.\" In 1970, he was appointed Professor Information Systems at the VU University Amsterdam, where he retired August 2000. Among his Ph.D. students were Peter Apers (1982), Martin L. Kersten (1985), Frank Dignum (1989), Roel Wieringa (1990) and Frances Brazier (1991). Van de Riet was editor of Europe of Data and Knowledge Engineering journal and member of the Editorial Board of the Information Systems Journal. His research interests were in the field of \"database and Knowledge bases; the use of Linguistics; Security and Privacy problems; and computational auditing.\"Reinder Pieter van de Riet (1939). at gplsi.dlsi.ua.es.
