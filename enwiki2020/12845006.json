It is a spin-off series of the popular Blue's Clues series, and was created by Traci Paige Johnson and Angela Santomero. The show started as short segments on Blue's Clues episodes in Season 6. In March 2015, the entire series was made available as part of the Noggin app. ==Premise== The series centers around the title character and host of the show, Blue, a happy-go-lucky female blue puppy who talks and loves to sing, dance, and play with her new friends. Blue often interacts with her friends including Sprinkles, Blue's shy little brother who was introduced in the second season as the co-host, Roar E. Saurus (or simply Roary), an orange dinosaur who likes to practice roaring, Frederica, a purple doll who likes to pretend it's her birthday, and Polka Dots, a sea-foam plush toy who creates puzzles for others to solve. Together, they go on adventures, solve different problems, and use their imaginations. ==Characters== ===Main=== *Blue (puppeteered by Leslie Carrara-Rudolph; season 1, Noel MacNeal; season 2, and voiced by Victoria Pontecorvo) \u2013 The title character and hostess of the show.
