Faulkner revealed that she would be departing the show when Boyde reprised his role of James Willmott-Brown and made her final appearance on 28 December 2017.

During their stay, they become friendly with Emine Osman (Pelin Ahmet), Rayif Osman (Billy Hassan) and Murat Osman (Eddie Izzet). They return for a guest appearance following James's release from prison in January 1992. In April 2017, she returns to Walford under the alias Fi Browning as a business consultant employed by Grafton Hill, the new freeholders of The Queen Victoria, in an attempt to understand and improve the business. Upon arriving at Albert Square, she finds Lady Di wandering the square alone and whilst trying to locate her owner is accused by Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) of dognapping. Fi and Shirley meet again shortly later when Fi enters The Vic just as Shirley opens a bottle of champagne, which accidentally soaks Fi. Fi dries herself and introduces herself to the workforce, immediately telling Shirley and Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan) they have too many staff and need to cut back. The Carters think Woody should leave, Fi insists that Grafton Hill want him to remain, so acting bar manager Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean) and barmaid Tracey (Jane Slaughter) are ultimately sacked, leaving Tracey devastated. Fi returns to The Vic during a celebration of Tracey's time working there, but she wonders why they are prolonging Tracey's agony, though Shirley says it is bringing in customers. Tracey does not turn up, though, and the customers decide to boycott the pub until she is reinstated. Fi meets The Vic landlord, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer), when he returns from Bulgaria. Mick later has a meeting with Fi and she tells him that The Vic is a good pub and that it has charm, just like him, and she says that they need a permanent replacement for Whitney Carter (Shona McGarty), who has left. Fi later suggests to Mick that they should have more younger staff to boost customers and suggests a two-for-one Father's Day meal for the Vic. Fi and Shirley clash over their ideas for the Father's Day meal. Fi arrives when Mick is preparing for his wife Linda Carter's (Kellie Bright) 40th birthday party, and is serving customers when Linda arrives. Linda does not know who she is, but when she finds out, Linda accuses Fi of sacking Tracey but Fi tells Linda that she wants to improve the pub. Linda tells Mick that she does not trust Fi. The following day, Fi brings in craft ale beers for a special event later in the week, which Fi and Mick sample. Fi, Mick and Shirley then conduct interviews for a new staff member, and although Tracey applies, Mick chooses Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner), which Fi agrees with. Fi tells Mick that Shirley should be sacked as she is stealing from the till and taking drinks without paying. Mick reluctantly agrees and when Fi leaves the Vic, it is revealed that she and Max Branning (Jake Wood) are in a relationship and she is in on his revenge plan, allowing him to have sex with council worker Carmel Kazemi (Bonnie Langford) to access council documents. Fi overhears Carmel talking to Linda about the council. She then watches Max get more information about the council from Carmel and Denise Fox (Diane Parish). She then follows Max to the bathroom where they have sex in a toilet stall which was overheard by Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell). When Max tells Fi that he feels guilty about using Carmel, Fi tells him that he needs a backbone. Fi accuses Shirley of taking \u00a3200 from the till but Mick confesses that it was him who had taken \u00a3200 to pay Whitney. When Linda gives Keanu Taylor (Danny Walters) a trial shift, Fi is not impressed and she sends him home. Linda then confronts Fi and she confides in Fi about the breakdown of her relationship with Mick. Fi tells Linda that she hopes that her and Linda would be friends and that she knows what Linda is going through. Fi becomes annoyed with the Carters when they begin to undermine her by giving Tracey her job back, bringing back Ladies night, and refusing to get rid of the piano. When Fi decides to attend Ladies night she questions Carmel about her relationship with Max, and attempts to bond with the other ladies by buying them all Champagne, and later congratulates Linda on the evening. Fi helps to plan for the Walford in Bloom event on the square, and later becomes upset when Max chooses to cancel plans with her in order to go to a council party with Carmel instead. Mick is suspicious when Fi begins acting strangely and ordering wine in the middle of the day. After being questioned, she reveals that it is the anniversary of her mother's death which she later explains was a suicide. She tells Mick about the day that she went home and found her mother's body and he applauds her for being brave enough to share such a personal story with him. Fi misreads the signals and attempts to kiss Mick who gently rebuffs her. She then calls Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre) to arrange a meet-up. When Fi makes a speech at Walford In Bloom, she is drunk and she stumbles through her speech. Fi continues to open up about her past with Mick at her home and they have a heart to heart but despite telling Mick that her father has died, she secretly calls him. 25 years later, James anonymously lays flowers addressed to Kathy at a memorial for her step-grandson Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell). The following day, James meets with his children \u2014 Fi, who turns out to be Sophie, Luke (now Adam Astill) and Josh \u2014 and Fi's uncle Hugo Browning (Simon Williams), before introducing himself to Fi's partner, Max. The Carters are given a \u00a360,000 repair bill for The Vic and Fi pretends to defend the Carters in front of Luke. Fi promises James that she will get the sealed bids from Max and Luke promises to persuade Jay Brown (Jamie Borthwick) to sell the car lot land, though Luke doubts Fi's abilities. When Max contemplates getting the sealed bids from Carmel's work laptop, he phones James, refusing to go through with it. Max meets up with James, Fi and Luke and tells them that he doesn't want Carmel to be involved in their plan any longer. Fi turns up to see Max at Carmel's house, where they have sex. However, unbeknownst to Max, Fi accesses Carmel's computer and steals the sealed bids. When James finds out about Max and Fi's relationship, Fi presents him with the sealed bids to earn James's approval, declaring her and Max are a fling. A disappointed Max ends his relationship with Fi, despite her telling him she wants to be with him. When the Carters are given a 5-week deadline to pay the bill, Fi gives the Carter's the option of selling the leasehold, but they refuse. After Hugo insults them about their personal lives and handling of the business over the course of the year, the Carters realise only Fi could have told him the information, realising she's been lying to them about her intentions for months. Linda throws a drink in Fi's face before her and Hugo are ejected from the pub. When Carmel is suspended from her job pending investigation because of sealed bids being accessed by an unknown person, Max contacts Fi and tells her what has happened. Fi and Max make amends and suggests to her that she takes \u00a310,000 off the repairs bill to get the Carters on her side. The Carters accept her help to raise the money. Fi catches Luke throttling Josh and breaks them up and Josh is hurt that Fi is in on Project Dagmar whilst he is excluded. When Carmel finds a ring at her house left behind by Max, she thinks Max will propose and invites people to The Vic. Fi finds out that the Carters have raised \u00a350,000 and when Max arrive, the pair kiss and Carmel is devastated whilst people turn on Max. James, Luke and Hugo later arrive and James tells them they own Grafton Hill. They serve the Carters with an eviction notice, putting up the money owed to the original amount \u00a360,000. James reveals that they plan to turn their obtained buildings into luxury flats. When Max proposes to Fi, James and Luke reveal that they have used him as they have doubted his loyalty and burn his cheque. Kathy confronts Fi over what James did to her and about all the women James has destroyed, including her own mother. Whilst James and Fi attend a press launch, Josh downloads files that can get the development stopped and Lauren gets arresting when she stages a protest at the launch to hold James and Fi up. When James returns, Lauren contacts Josh and James demands the downloaded files, so Josh decides to quit his job. Fi tries to get Josh to return, but he tells Fi that James has ruined and controls their lives just like with their mothers. When Fi attempts to question James over why he never allowed Josh's mother Wendy to get a job or why Elizabeth committed suicide, James pushes her to the ground. Fi asks Kathy about the rape and her version causes Fi to be physically sick. When James shows Fi documents that could ruin him, Fi says she believes he did rape Kathy, causing James to throw her out. After reconciling with Max and confiding in him her inability to see her father for who he is until too late, Fi sneaks into James' office, trashes it and steals most of the documents. James suffers a heart attack while trying to destroy the remaining evidence pointing to him before the police arrest him and Fi threatens Hugo with the files into signing the company deeds to her. Fi visits Mick and Linda and offers them a chance to buy back the freehold for the Vic for \u00a3150,000. Linda rejects this offer, calling it unrealistic and telling her that her family will get their comeuppance. Fi agrees and leaves Walford after visiting Kathy with a letter giving her the cafe back. Fi visits James in hospital, telling him she is not going to keep on trying to get his approval as she wanted his love. As James reaches out for Fi, she tells staff that she is not his daughter and walks out on him for good. Off-screen, Fi later agrees to give The Vic back to Mick and Linda in exchange for a diamond ring, worth \u00a3200,000. Fi is described as a \"no-nonsense but sophisticated business woman with strength and vulnerability.\" Executive producer Sean O'Connor said, \"I'm really thrilled that we have been able to tempt Lisa Faulkner back to TV drama and back to the BBC. She's an extremely accomplished and hugely popular actress and we're very excited to have her in Albert Square. Fi Browning is something of a departure for EastEnders; a no-nonsense but sophisticated business woman with strength and vulnerability. But does she have an agenda? And who\u2014or what\u2014has she set her sights on?\" In August 2017, Faulkner was longlisted for Best Bad Girl at the Inside Soap Awards, while the revelation that Fi is associated with Max was longlisted for Best Shock Twist. She did not progress to the viewer-voted shortlist. William Boyde reprised his role as James Willmott-Brown after a 25-year absence in September 2017 and Fi was revealed to be his daughter Sophie. Faulkner enjoyed working with Boyde and described him as \"lovely\". Faulkner was told about Fi's real identity upon meeting the show bosses and found the story and Fi's background \"so exciting\". She felt she could not reject the role, although she was ordered not to inform anyone about Fi's identity. The actress revealed that at the conclusion of the storyline, which she said had \"a beginning, middle and end\", Fi would be leaving the serial. ==Luke Browning== Luke Browning (also Willmott-Brown), played by Henry Power in 1987, an uncredited actor in 1992, and Adam Astill in 2017, first appeared in the episode broadcast on 31 March 1987.

Luke phones James and tells him that Phil is unaware. Kathy confides in Ian that James is back and Ian tells Phil. Phil visits James and realises Luke is James's son when he sees a photo of them. Phil tells Kathy that Luke is James's son and Phil fails to warn Luke off Ben. Ben is angry with Phil for what he did and when Kathy tries to get Ben and Phil to make up, Kathy tells Ben that Phil was protecting him as James raped her. After struggling to process what he is told, Ben is determined to hurt James, but Kathy orders Ben to keep out of it as it happened to her and not him.

This plan fails due to Angie, who happily informs Reg where Den keeps all the pub's bookwork, just to spite her husband. Den is forced to sell his car to pay off some of his debt. Later in the year, Sparrow joins Den in one of Ali (Nejdet Salih) and Mehmet Osman's (Haluk Bilginer) notorious after-hours card games.

Rod is first seen in Albert Square in July 1987 as an acquaintance of fellow punk, Mary Smith (Linda Davidson). Rod is a greasy layabout, but underneath his scruffy appearance there is a kind-hearted, genuine guy, who will go out of his way to help anyone in need. ==Darren Roberts== Darren Roberts, played by Gary McDonald, is the brother of Carmel Roberts (Judith Jacob). He arrives in Walford in July 1987 along with his son Junior (Aaron Carrington) and young daughter, Aisha (Aisha Jacob), who have different mothers. Darren has fallen out with his wife Darleen, and manages to persuade his sister to allow him and his children to move in with her at number 3b Albert Square. Darren had attended school with Nick Cotton (John Altman), Graham Clark (Gary Webster) and Rod Norman (Christopher McHallem), none known for their law-abiding tendencies, and just like his wayward contemporaries, Darren also regularly dabbles on the wrong side of the law. Darren sets up various dodgy deals. He makes an enemy out of Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) for selling stolen goods on his patch; he gets involved in pornographic video laundering; instigates a counterfeit money ring; starts renting out an abandoned flat to squatters for a weekly fee; and holds a 'cultural evening' in the community centre, which is a front for a porn film screening and stripper \u2013 Dot Cotton (June Brown) accidentally wanders in and faints. He gets on the wrong side of Brad Williams (Jonathan Stratt), a member of the gangster organisation known as The Firm. Darren wants membership into the gang, but after several attempts to gain favour, Brad warns him off by beating him. Darren goes on to con Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) and Barry Clark (Gary Hailes). Darren provides them with equipment for a mobile disco, but the equipment turns out to be hired and further hire purchase payments are still owed. Soon after, the hire purchase men turn up and take back all the disco gear. When Carmel finds out, she throws Darren out of her flat, after which, he disappears in July 1988, abandoning his two children in the process. Days before his departure, Darren is questioned about the torching of The Dagmar, following Kathy Beale's (Gillian Taylforth) rape, and he purposefully implicates Den Watts as the culprit. Den, who is working for The Firm, is eventually forced to take the blame and is arrested for the deed. Joanne Francis (Pamela Salem) and Gregory Mantel (Pavel Douglas), two members of The Firm, who are watching Darren. They later reveal that Darren had moved in with a girl, whose boyfriend then puts him in hospital. He never returns to Albert Square to claim his children, and according to Joanne Francis (Pamela Salem), he relocated to Brixton. However, in 1989, Darren's accomplice Vince Johnson (Hepburn Graham) arrives in Walford. Vince regularly liaises with Darren by phone, and both are responsible for conning Frank Butcher (Mike Reid) in a motor scam. ==Junior Roberts== Junior Roberts, played by Aaron Carrington, is a young tearaway, who idolises his wayward father. He is often getting into trouble and mischief around Albert Square. Junior is the son of Darren Roberts (Gary McDonald), and he arrives in Walford along with his young sister Aisha (Aisha Jacob) in July 1987. The Roberts clan come to live with Junior's aunt, Carmel (Judith Jacob), at number 3b Albert Square. Junior proceeds to cause havoc around the Square, getting into trouble for stealing, graffitiing the square, playing truant, and gives everyone a fright when he runs away from home and almost gets into a car with a stranger. Junior finds himself a girlfriend in 1988, Melody (Lyanne Compton), who is equally as troublesome. The two begin a scam where they steal dogs from people and then return them for a reward. They also manage to spark up a feud with the Karim children, with both sides swapping racist insults at each other. Darren, a petty criminal, is not the best role-model for his impressionable son, and he is often unable to curtail his deviance. Junior idolises Darren and so he is devastated in July 1988 when his father abandons him and his sister and disappears without a word to anyone. Junior is forced to move away from Walford and go and live with his Grandparents, but he shows up regularly to visit Carmel and gets into more trouble, such as stealing Colin Russell's (Michael Cashman) CD collection and then selling them on to Rod Norman (Christopher McHallem) for a profit. This act even leads to him getting arrested after Colin's boyfriend, Guido (Nicholas Donovan), decides to teach him a lesson and informs the police. He gets off with a warning, but continues to make trouble for himself when he persuades Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) to buy him alcohol, and is witnessed drinking by Dot Cotton (June Brown). Dot is appalled to see an underage boy getting drunk, and she promptly informs Carmel. By 1989 Junior has become so troublesome that his elderly, sickly grandparents can no longer cope and Carmel is instructed to take both her brother's children in again. This is met unfavourably by Carmel's new husband Matthew Jackson (Steven Hartley), who freely admits that he dislikes Junior immensely. Matthew and Junior argue regularly and this puts a severe strain on Carmel's marital relationship. Junior's dislike for Matthew stems from the fact that he rightly suspects him of abusing his aunt. Junior tries to put a stop to Matthew's violence by informing various members of his family about the abuse he'd witnessed, but despite their best efforts Carmel refuses to take their help and denies that anything untoward is occurring. Things reach a head in July 1989, when Junior, in an attempt to protect his aunt from Matthew's rage, stabs him with a kitchen knife. Matthew is rushed to hospital, and Junior finds it difficult to come to terms with what he has done. Carmel eventually manages to reassure him that what he did was in self-defence and he is not to blame. The following month Carmel's father dies, and so the Robertses all leave Walford to tend to Junior's grieving grandmother. Junior is not pleased with this and makes an ill-fated attempt to run away from home with Melody, but he only manages to get as far as the front door before Carmel discovers his plan and forces him to leave with her instead. Over the following months Junior shows up in Walford regularly to visit Melody and Vince Johnson (Hepburn Graham), a friend of his father. His last appearance is October 1989 when he attends a Halloween party in the Square. ==Aisha Roberts== Aisha Roberts is played by Aisha Jacob, who is the real life daughter of Judith Jacob, the actress who played her on-screen aunt, Carmel Jackson.\"Judith Jacob looks back on Carmel \" Walford Gazette.

Darren is an irresponsible parent and the care of the young toddler is left mainly to Carmel and Junior \u2013 who is forced to take and collect Aisha from nursery school, making him miss school himself. In July 1988, Darren abandons both his children and leaves Walford without a word to anyone. Aisha is then sent away from Walford to live with her grandparents. However, the following year, she is sent back to Carmel, much to the annoyance of her abusive husband, Matthew Jackson (Steven Hartley). Matthew finds caring for Aisha a chore and gets annoyed with her for crying, wandering into his bedroom constantly and making his flat a mess. Eventually Carmel and Matthew's marriage comes to an end after Junior stabs Matthew in self-defence. In August 1989 Aisha's grandfather dies, and so the entire Roberts family move away from Walford to tend to Aisha's grieving grandmother. ==Donna Ludlow== Donna Ludlow, played by Matilda Ziegler between 1987 and 1989, is the daughter of Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth). Donna was put up for adoption at a young age, and in August 1987 she arrives in Walford to make contact with her long-lost mother. Donna is a troubled individual who is desperate for attention, but she is shunned by almost all who encounter her. After she finds out she was conceived from rape and then rejected by Kathy, Donna sets herself on a path of self-destruction. In April 1989, she takes a drug overdose and chokes to death on her own vomit. ==Frank Butcher== Frank Butcher, played by Mike Reid, makes his first appearance on-screen as a guest character in 1987 but, due to a positive viewer reception, he is reintroduced in 1988 as a regular character.

He promises to feature Den Watts (Leslie Grantham) in the documentary, but James Wilmott-Brown (William Boyde) diverts his attention, and introduces Hunter to his chief barmaid Angie Watts (Anita Dobson), and tries to get the documentary focused on his wine bar, The Dagmar. Wilmott- Brown introduces Hunter to Colin Russell (Michael Cashman), as one of the new breed of people in Albert Square, and Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard), as one of the older type of people in the square.

He is first seen in October 1987, when Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), who is sick of being made to choose sides between her rowing parents, seeks solace at the church. Over subsequent chats, Sharon soon begins to feel comfortable enough around Duncan to start relaying her problems and she is overjoyed to finally find someone that listens to her for a change. Over the following months, Sharon finds herself leaning on Duncan more and more and she soon begins to feel attracted towards him, feelings that are reciprocated by Duncan. By the end of the year, the two start a relationship, much to the shock of Sharon's parents, Den (Leslie Grantham) and Angie (Anita Dobson). Sharon seems to have fallen in love and in December she asks Duncan if they can get engaged. Duncan tries to win Den over by informing him of his admirable intentions towards Sharon, and hinting that marriage is a definite possibility in the not too distant future. Den is pessimistic however, and sets about trying to upset the relationship by persuading his employee, Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler), to flirt with Duncan outrageously, knowing full well that Sharon will catch them in the act. The plan works, and Sharon is furious to see Duncan sharing a drink with Donna, but unfortunately for Den, their row is short-lived and they patch things up soon enough. Later in the year, Duncan sparks up a friendship with Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt), who regularly accompanies him to youth help groups. This eventually leads to Lofty's departure when Duncan sets him up with a job as a handyman in a children's home away from the Square. In late 1988, cracks starts to show in Duncan and Sharon's relationship, mainly because Sharon starts to begrudge the amount of time Duncan spends on his Christian duties and the many Bible readings he attends with the devout Christian, Dot Cotton (June Brown). She also begins to grow tired of Duncan's inability to have fun and she starts to ponder whether they are really suited to each other after all. Things reach a climax after Duncan persuades Sharon and her best friend Michelle (Susan Tully) to house a homeless Donna in their flat. Malicious Donna subsequently tries to come between the friends, and when asked to leave, she refuses and claims tenants rights.

Gerry threatens to sue the Dagmar, until Angie's daughter Sharon (Letitia Dean) makes him see how humiliated he would feel to stand up in court and confess to being beaten by a woman. Gerry never returns to the Dagmar again. ==Alan McIntyre== Alan McIntyre, played by Pip Miller, first appears in December 1987 as the downstairs neighbour to Sue (Sandy Ratcliff) and Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih).

When the noise continues, the Osmans go down to Alan's flat and threaten to complain to the landlord to make him stop, only to find out that Alan is their landlord and that he'd bought their flat. Things then proceed to get infinitely worse for the Osmans at the hands of Alan, when their flat is broken into and their carpet is defecated on. Ali and Alan have several fights and Alan often resorts to racial insults. During one such argument, Roly, Den Watts' (Leslie Grantham) poodle slips his leash and bites Alan in the arm.

He allows Donna Ludlow (Matilda Ziegler) to have first choice of one of the flats in exchange for sex.
