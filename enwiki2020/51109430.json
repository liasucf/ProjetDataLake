    "text": "Schmilco is the tenth studio album by Chicago-based alternative rock band Wilco and was released on September 9, 2016. Wilco announced the album on July 19, 2016, and released two songs, \"Locator\" and \"If I Ever Was a Child\". The album's announcement came a little more than a year after their previous studio album, Star Wars. ==Background and release== In February 2016, Jeff Tweedy first mentioned in an interview that Wilco would be releasing an album in 2016, though did not go into detail. During his solo benefit shows in Chicago later in May, Tweedy said they had finished the new record, but the band wasn't sure they wanted to release it yet. In July 2016, Wilco released \"Locator\" from the album to commemorate the one year anniversary of Star Wars and then announced Schmilco several days later, in addition to releasing \"If I Ever Was a Child\" and \"Someone to Lose\". In September several days before the release, Wilco had \"I Heard Schmilco\" events at record stores to promote the album across the country where people could listen to the album and then buy it on vinyl. The album's name is a nod to the Harry Nilsson album Nilsson Schmilsson. The artwork was created by illustrator Joan Cornell\u00e0 in collaboration with Stefania Lusini. On the album, Tweedy tells stories of himself, his family, and his history. ==Critical reception== ===Accolades=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |+Accolades for Schmilco |- !scope=\"col\"| Publication !scope=\"col\"| Accolade !scope=\"col\"| Year !scope=\"col\"| Rank |- !scope=\"row\"| Consequence of Sound | Top 50 Albums of 2016 | 2016 | 16 |- !scope=\"row\"| Mojo | The 50 Best Albums of 2016 | 2016 | 36 |- !scope=\"row\"| Paste | The 50 Best Albums of 2016 | 2016 | 26 |- !scope=\"row\"| Rolling Stone | 50 Best Albums of 2016 | 2016 | 41 |} ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Wilco * Nels Cline \u2013 guitar * Mikael Jorgensen \u2013 keyboard * Glenn Kotche \u2013 drums * Pat Sansone \u2013 guitar, keyboard * John Stirratt \u2013 bass guitar * Jeff Tweedy \u2013 lead vocals, guitar, production Additional personnel *Joan Cornell\u00e0 \u2013 cover art * Mark Greenberg \u2013 engineering *Bob Ludwig \u2013 mastering *Tom Schick \u2013 production * Spencer Tweedy \u2013 drums ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+Weekly sales chart performance for Schmilco |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |+Annual sales chart performance for Schmilco |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Belgian Albums (Ultratop Flanders) | 200 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top Rock Albums (Billboard) | 71 |} ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2016 albums Category:Wilco albums Category:Albums produced by Jeff Tweedy Category:DBpm Records albums ",
