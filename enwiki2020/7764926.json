    "text": "The Lieutenant Governor is a constitutional officer of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The lieutenant governor is elected for a four-year term in the same year as the governor. Each party picks a candidate for lieutenant governor independently of the gubernatorial primary. The winners of the party primaries are then teamed together as a single ticket for the fall general election. Democrat John Fetterman is the incumbent lieutenant governor. The lieutenant governor presides in the Senate and is first in the line of succession to the governor; in the event the governor dies, resigns, or otherwise leaves office, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. The office of lieutenant governor was created by the Constitution of 1873. As with the governor's position, the Constitution of 1968 made the lieutenant governor eligible to succeed himself or herself for one additional four-year term. The position's only official duties are serving as president of the state senate and chairing the Board of Pardons and the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Council. Lieutenant governors often work on additional projects and have a full schedule of community and speaking events. Pennsylvania is the only state that provides a residence (the \"State House\" at Fort Indiantown Gap) for its lieutenant governor. Constructed in 1940 and previously the governor's \"summer residence\", it became available for Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor in 1968 when the current governor's residence was completed in Harrisburg. ==List of lieutenant governors== ;Parties {| class=\"wikitable\" !#!!Name!!Term!!Governor(s) served under!!Party |- |1 |John Latta |1875\u20131879 ||John F.
