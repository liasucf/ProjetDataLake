    "text": "Charles-Eug\u00e8ne Delaunay (9 April 1816 - 5 August 1872) was a French astronomer and mathematician. His lunar motion studies were important in advancing both the theory of planetary motion and mathematics. ==Life== Born in Lusigny-sur- Barse, France, to Jacques\u2010Hubert Delaunay and Catherine Choiselat, Delaunay studied under Jean-Baptiste Biot at the Sorbonne. He worked on the mechanics of the Moon as a special case of the three-body problem. He published two volumes on the topic, each of 900 pages in length, in 1860 and 1867. The work hints at chaos in the system, and clearly demonstrates the problem of so- called \"small denominators\" in perturbation theory. His infinite series expression for finding the position of the Moon converged too slowly to be of practical use but was a catalyst in the development of functional analysisO'Connor & Edmund and computer algebra.R. Pavelle, M. Rothstein and J. Fitch, \"Computer Algebra\", Scientific American, 245 (6), pp.102-113 (December 1981) Delaunay became director of the Paris Observatory in 1870 but drowned in a boating accident near Cherbourg, France two years later. He was followed by Jean Claude Bouquet at the Academy.
