Until the 19th century it was a \"fold\" settlement, inhabited by serfs. The 20th century was characterized by a high rate of emigration, which has led to an aging population. One part of its settlement (Pusztaszentp\u00e9ter) is now extinct. In the area of today's village, to the west of Als\u00f3cs\u00f6de, was the village of Szentm\u00e1rton. Traces of the church, which was destroyed in the early 1600s and of the Pauline monastery here, are still visible today and are marked by a plaque. According to Schematism of 1852, the denominational distribution of Cs\u00f6de was as follows: 93 Reformed, 62 Catholic. The village also included two completely deserted settlements. At that time there were 18 Catholics and 12 Reformed people in P\u00e1cod, and 11 Catholics lived in Szentm\u00e1rton Major.
