    "text": "Dnevnik () is a business-oriented Bulgarian daily newspaper, that is published Monday - Friday in Sofia since 2001. Until early 2005, it was printed in broadsheet format, the last Bulgarian daily to use the large format. It adopted a compact format after research in 2005 found that more than 50% of the readers would prefer a smaller, thicker paper. Dnevnik's main editorial line is that the state should intervene less, and that business should have more freedom. Like the influential business and politics weekly Capital, it is published by Sofia-based Economedia. German publishing group Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group was the owner of a 50 per cent stake in Economedia, but the Bulgarian owners of Economedia bought the shares back in November 2007. With a print-run of between 12,000 and 15,000, Dnevnik claimed 6,000 paid subscribers, distributed between 2,000 and 5,000 copies free-of- charge and sold about 5,000 copies at newsstands, the publisher's figures showed, adding that each copy had about five readers.
