    "text": "The 2015 Dodge City Law season is the team's second season as a professional indoor football franchise and first as a member of Champions Indoor Football (CIF) in the 2015 season. The team is owned and operated by Ricky Bertz. The Law play their home games at the United Wireless Arena in Dodge City, Kansas, under the direction of head coach Sean Ponder. ==Season summary== The Law's announced schedule for the 2015 season was disrupted when the New Mexico Stars abruptly postponed their entry into the league on February 21, just one week before the season began. On March 3, the Albuquerque-based Duke City Gladiators were announced as a late entry into the league, partially replacing the Stars in the CIF schedule with a plan to play 11 games in 2015. The team's March 14 game was delayed one day to accommodate a high school basketball tournament that relocated to Dodge City. ==Off-field moves== The Law earned an 8\u20134 record in 2014 as an expansion team in the Champions Professional Indoor Football League. They lost to the Wichita Wild in the league championship semi-finals. After the season ended, the CPIFL announced it was merging with teams from other leagues to form Champions Indoor Football. ==Awards and honors== Each week of the regular season, the CIF names league-wide Players of the Week in offensive, defensive, and special teams categories. For Week 5, the CIF named quarterback Joshua Floyd as the Offensive Player of the Week and defensive linesman Marquis George as the Defensive Player of the Week. For Week 8, the CIF named kick returner Dominique Carson as one of two Special Teams Players of the Week. On June 6, the CIF announced the winners of its year-end awards. The Dodge City Law were named Franchise of the Year, honored for Game Operations of the Year, saw owner/general manager Ricky Bertz named Executive of the Year, and had kick returner Dominique Carson sharing the Special Teams Players of the Year honors. ==Schedule== Key: ===Pre-season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40\" | Week ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" | Day ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" | Date ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Kickoff ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Opponent ! colspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Results ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"240\" | Location |- ! width=\"120\" | Score ! width=\"60\" | Record |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 1 | Sunday | February 22 | 5:00pm | 4-State Fusion | W 55\u20130 | 1\u20130 | United Wireless Arena |} ===Regular season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40\" | Week ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" | Day ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" | Date ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Kickoff ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"200\" | Opponent ! colspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Results ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"250\" | Location |- ! width=\"120\" | Score ! width=\"60\" | Record |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 1 | Saturday | March 7 | 7:00pm | Amarillo Venom | L 63\u201368 | 0\u20131 | United Wireless Arena |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 2 | Sunday | March 15 | 7:00pm | Sioux City Bandits | W 51\u201339 | 1\u20131 | United Wireless Arena |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 3 | Saturday | March 21 | 7:00pm | at San Angelo Bandits | W 47\u201345 | 2\u20131 | Foster Communications Coliseum |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 4 | Saturday | March 28 | 7:00pm | Texas Revolution | W 55\u201352 | 3\u20131 | United Wireless Arena |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 5 | Saturday | April 4 | 7:05pm | at Salina Bombers | W 47\u201343 | 4\u20131 | Bicentennial Center |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 6 | Saturday | April 11 | 7:00pm | at Duke City Gladiators | W 47\u201343 | 5\u20131 | Tingley Coliseum |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 7 | Saturday | April 18 | 7:00pm | Omaha Beef | W 69\u201345 | 6\u20131 | United Wireless Arena |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 8 | Saturday | April 25 | 6:00pm | at Amarillo Venom | L 43\u201344 | 6\u20132 | Amarillo Civic Center |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 9 | Saturday | May 2 | 7:00pm | Salina Bombers | L 48\u201355 | 6\u20133 | United Wireless Arena |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 10 | Friday | May 8 | 7:00pm | at Wichita Force | L 49\u201352 | 6\u20134 | Intrust Bank Arena |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" ! 11 | colSpan=7 | BYE |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 12 | Friday | May 22 | 7:00pm | at Omaha Beef | W 64\u201339 | 7\u20134 | Ralston Arena |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" ! 13 | colSpan=7 | BYE |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 14 | Saturday | June 6 | 7:00pm | Sioux City Bandits | L 52\u201353 | 7\u20135 | United Wireless Arena |} Rescheduled after the New Mexico Stars withdrew from the league on February 22, 2015.
