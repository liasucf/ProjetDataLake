It was added to the candidate pool after several of the board members attended a performance of the musical the night before the voting deadline and was selected as the winner by at least three- quarters of the board members. Jury chairman Charles McNulty publicly criticized the Board for its \"geographic myopia\" and \"failure to appreciate new directions in playwriting\" for overlooking the three plays that were not running on Broadway at the time of the Award in favor of one that was. ==References== ==External links== * * \"2010 Pulitzer Prizes for Journalism\".
