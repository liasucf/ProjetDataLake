Charlie's former friend Heston Carter (Owen Brennan) tries to defend Charlie's behaviour at first, but when he sees it firsthand, Heston is appalled. It is revealed that at his former workplace, he sexually assaulted a receptionist, and blackmailed both her and the Practice Manager to stay quiet. Under the influence of Lyme disease, Julia Parsons (Diane Keen) mistakes Charlie for her ex-husband, and takes advantage by having sex with her. When it is discovered, Heston punches him, and Charlie is thrown out by his wife. He is then dismissed from The Mill, and reported to the medical board. ==Will Duncan== Will Duncan, portrayed by Richard Mylan, first appeared on 5 March 2010, and made his last appearance on 14 May 2010.
