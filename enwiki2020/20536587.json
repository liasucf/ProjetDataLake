    "text": "Joseph Curry (1887 \u2013 1 April 1936) was an English footballer who played at full-back for Manchester United and Southampton in the early 20th century. ==Football career== Born in Newcastle upon Tyne, Curry started his career at Scotswood, before joining Manchester United in February 1908. Over the next three years, he spent most of the time in the reserves, but made a total of 14 first-team appearances. Curry joined Southampton from Manchester United in May 1911. He found few opportunities to break into the first team as the Saints struggled near the foot of the Southern League First Division and was used as cover for Jim McAlpine. Even when he did manage to play, he had a propensity to get injured and struggled to get fit. After a frustrating season, he retired from the professional game and returned to his native north-east where he turned out occasionally for West Stanley. ==References== Category:1887 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Newcastle upon Tyne Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Southern Football League players Category:English Football League players Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:Southampton F.C. players Category:West Stanley F.C. players Category:Scotswood F.C. players ",
