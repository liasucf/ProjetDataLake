    "text": "Ambulacraria, or Coelomopora, is a clade of invertebrate phyla that includes echinoderms and hemichordates; a member of this group is called an ambulacrarian. Phylogenetic analysis suggests the echinoderms and hemichordates separated around 533 million years ago.Sea Cucumber Genome Imparts Insight on Genes Linked to Organ Regeneration The Ambulacraria are part of the deuterostomes, a larger clade that also includes the Chordata, Vetulicolia and Saccorhytus. The two living clades with representative organisms are: * Echinodermata (sea stars, sea urchins, brittle stars, sea cucumbers, feather stars, sea lilies, etc.) * Hemichordata (acorn worms, Pterobranchia, and possibly graptolites) (These together sometimes are called the lower deuterostomes.) The group Xenoturbellida (two species of worm-like animals) had previously been considered to be in this clade but is now considered to be placed more basally among metazoans. Fossil taxa that may lie on the stem lineage: * Superphylum Ambulacraria ** unranked clade Cambroernida *** \u2020 unranked clade = Eldoniida **** \u2020 Stellostomites Caron, Conway Morris & Shu, 2010 **** \u2020 Velumbrella? *** \u2020 Herpetogaster Caron, Conway Morris & Shu, 2010 \\- with one species: \u2020 Herpetogaster collinsi Caron, Conway Morris & Shu, 2010 *** \u2020 Rotadisciidae **** \u2020 Seputus? Murray, J & MacGabhann ==Ontogeny== As for many animals, the egg cell of any extant ambulacrarian by cell division evolves to a blastula (\"cell ball\"), which evolves to a triploblast (\"three- layered\") gastrula. The gastrula then evolves to a dipleurula larva form, which is specific for the ambulacraria. This, in its turn, is developed in various different kinds of larvae for different taxa of ambulacrarians. It has been suggested that the adult form of the last common ancestor of the ambulacrarians was anatomically similar to the dipleurula larvae, whence this hypothetic ancestor sometimes also is called dipleurula. == References == Category:Deuterostome taxonomy Category:Ediacaran first appearances Category:Superphyla ",
