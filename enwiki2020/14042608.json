Describing the album in his 2009 book The Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band - Jollity Farm, Bob Carruthers says of \"I Predict a Riot\": \"Hard to predict the plot of this one, as Mr Spear and Mr Edmonson are let loose on this Kaiser Chiefs classic. Planned and unplanned studio incursions by Mexicans, Wurzels, that bloody chicken clarinet and HM constabulary.\"Carruthers, B. and Christie, D.
