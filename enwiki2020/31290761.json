In 1995 Dessau released an extended track remix of the song \"Suffer\" for the Fascist Communist Revolutionaries compilation and their self-titled second album for Mausoleum. The band covered Paul Dresser's \"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\" and released it on Fifth Colmn's World War Underground compilation in 1996 and again on the 1998 Coolidge 50 compilation. In 1999 the band released a cover of \"Revenge\" by Ministry on Another Prick in the Wall - A Tribute to Ministry - Volume 2 by Invisible Records.
