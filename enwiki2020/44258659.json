    "text": "Hits for Kids is the official debut album by Dutch singer and multi- instrumentalist Jett Rebel and his second studio album. The album was scheduled for release on October 31, 2014, through Sony Music Entertainment, but Rebel decided to release it the day before on various streaming services , on October 30, 2014. Pineapple Morning was the first and only single released on October 30, 2014. ==Recording== Rebel got help from Tony Platt in making essential choices. The renowned producer/mixer Tony Platt gave the necessary advice and did the mix in his Platinum Tones studio in London. Hits for Kids was recorded in Soesterberg in his former old house and home studio. Rebel played all the instruments himself. Hits for kids was the last record Rebel recorded digitally. In Wisseloordstudio's some parts have been replaced by Rebel in cooperation with Platt. Like for example the drums. Rebel wanted to record with two mics. Also the guitars of some of the songs have been re- recorded.\" There they have, for example, a '55 Les Paul Goldtop and those beautiful old Strats. I've done a few acoustics and sometimes you can hear that Goldtop. You really hear that, a guitar that sounds expensive and rich and beautiful, both clean and totally driven. And I also used some very nice bass guitars. Hammond organ, grand piano, and a few tracks re-sung by beautiful, old vintage mics.\"https://www.gitarist.nl/nieuws/artikel/26-14009/jett-rebel-the-outtakes The name of the album does not refer to it being songs for children to listen to, but rather as memorable catchy sounds with childlike impulsiveness, as he states. The cover of the album was designed by Soesja Leugs. The songs Gwen and Goosebumps Galore were performed on September 8, 2017 by Jett Rebel together with the Dutch Noordpool Orkest (orchestra) at the Prinsengrachtconcert in Meppel. ==Videos== A music video for \"Pineapple Morning\", the first track on the album, was released one day prior to the release of the album, on October 30, 2014.
