    "text": "Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re in 1925 Pierre-Georges Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re (; 1883-1943) was a pioneer of aeronautics. Born in Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre, he studied in the \u00c9cole Centrale Paris and, during the First World War, started a business in aeronautics. He directed plants that made planes and opened the first airlines that operated from France to Africa and South America. Pierre-Georges Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re was the founder of the aeronautical industry in Toulouse. As the son of the owner of a sawmill in Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre in the Pyrenees, he took an early interest in technology. In 1903, after an outstanding secondary school career he began his degree at the Parisian Ecole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures. On returning to the Pyrenees he modernized his father's firm, specializing in the manufacture of railway wagons. Thus, during the First World War, the profits from government contracts allowed him to set up a large, modern factory in the Toulouse suburb of Montaudran. Before doing so, he had also produced a rush order of 600 Salmson aircraft, which the army urgently needed. Having become an aeronautical enthusiast, he decided to create the company Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des lignes Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re (later known as A\u00e9ropostale), carrying mail from France to Morocco, Senegal and South America - the first aircraft being flown by such well-known pilots as Mermoz and Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. Finally, he started manufacturing aircraft in his own name, and notably the great seaplanes such as the Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re 631. The Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re company still exists in 2014. ==References== Reference: Jean-Marc Olivier, \"Lat\u00e9co\u00e8re, un industriel visionnaire\", in Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es patrimoine, hors-s\u00e9rie n\u00b0 2, \"Toulouse des avions et des hommes\", November 2010, pp. 14\u201325.
