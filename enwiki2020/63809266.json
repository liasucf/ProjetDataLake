    "text": "', provisional designation ', is a sub-kilometer near-Earth asteroid and a potentially hazardous object of the Apollo group. It was discovered by astronomers of the LINEAR program at the Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site near Socorro, New Mexico. is a contact binary object consisting of two distinct lobes, as seen in radar images from various observatories including Arecibo and Goldstone in January 2015. == Close approaches == Radar images of taken by the Goldstone Radar on 9 January 2015 In January 2015, approached Earth within a distance of . During the encounter, was observed by radar from the Arecibo, Green Bank, and Goldstone observatories. In January 2016, has made another close approach at a distance of , several times closer than the encounter in 2015. The Minor Planet Center has classified as a potentially hazardous asteroid due to its large size and small Earth minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) of 0.03 AU. == Physical characteristics == was discovered in May 1999 by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) program at the Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site near Socorro, New Mexico. Most properties of have been determined through photometry, spectroscopy, infrared radiometry, and radar imaging. Binzel et al. (2001) have found that has a spectral class of an Xk-type asteroid. Thermal infrared observations using the WISE spacecraft by Mainzer et al. (2011) and the Spitzer Space Telescope by Mueller et al. (2011) give a diameter of . Warner et al. (2014, 2015) suggest that has a highly elongated shape due to its large light curve amplitude of 0.9 magnitudes. Based on 's large brightness changes, they measured a rotation period of 6.54 hours. In January 2015, radar imaging by the Arecibo Observatory and the Green Bank Observatory confirmed 's elongated shape and provided delay-Doppler images used to obtain a preliminary estimate of a 3D model for its shape. The radar data reveal an apparent concavity and suggest that is a contact binary. == References == == External links == * Goldstone Radar Observations Planning: 1999 JV6, 2001 WL15, and Toro, JPL Asteroid Radar Research * 3D model of the asteroid * * * 085990 085990 085990 085990 085990 Category:Astronomical objects discovered in 1999 ",
