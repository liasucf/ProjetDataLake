This track is under the jurisdiction of Northeast Frontier Railway. ==History== === Cooch Behar State Railway === The Cooch Behar State Railway (CBSR) was a narrow gauge railway line that was built between Jayanti in the current Alipurduar district of West Bengal, India to Lalmonirhat in the current Lalmonirhat district in Bangladesh before partition between 1893-1898. The line originated from Jayanti near the foothills of Eastern Himalayas and went via Alipurduar, Cooch Behar, Dinhata and Gitaldaha to finally join the narrow gauge track of Kaunia\u2013Dharlla State Railway at Mogalhat. This line was later brought by Eastern Bengal Railway in 1899. === Eastern Bengal Railway === The Kaunia-Dharlla state railway was constructed as a narrow gauge line from Teesta Railway junction to Mogalhat on 1882 by EBR. As a part of linking with the Katihar-Raiganj-Dinajpur-Parbatipur-Rangpur-Kaunia main metre gauge line the Kaunia-Mogalhat-Gitaldaha NG section was converted to metre gauge from 1901-02. The 25 km long Gitaldaha-Golakganj section was built as a part of the main metre gauge line on 1902 via Bamanhat & Sonahat. This metre gauge line was further extended to Amingaon via Fakiragram & Kokrajhar on 1906. The Jayanti-Gitaldaha junction section was converted to metre gauge on 1910. === Post Partition === With the partition of India on 1947, the Assam links to Bengal were snapped. Further the Gitaldaha-Mogalhat rail transit point became defunct as the railway bridge over Dharla river was washed away in floods. The Alipurduar-Bamanhat section and Fakiragram-Golakganj sections were cutoff as well and became isolated metre gauge sections. As a part of the Assam Link project a 229 km line was constructed between Kishanganj and Fakiragram in 1948. Thus these 2 sections became branch lines. ==Gauge Conversion== The Alipurduar-Bamanhat branch line was converted from metre gauge to broad gauge and was reopened to public on 2007. A new station called the New Gitaldaha station was built to be used instead of the old Gitaldaha junction. The Fakiragram-Golakganj-Dhubri section was converted from metre gauge to broad gauge during 2010. Golakgunj was linked with New Cooch Behar with a new line on 2012 as a part of the New Maynaguri-Jogighopa project. ==References== Category:5 ft 6 in gauge railways in India Category:Rail transport in West Bengal ",
