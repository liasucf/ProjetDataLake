    "text": "Nicholas P. Restifo (born July 24, 1960) is an American immunologist, physician and educator in cancer immunotherapy. Until July 2019, he was a tenured senior investigator in the intramural National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health at Bethesda, Maryland.Nicholas is now the executive vice president of research at Lyell based in San Francisco. Dr. Restifo has been a pioneer in the use of T cell-based immunotherapy. ==Early life and education== Dr. Restifo was born in Columbus, Ohio. He grew up in a small town, Amherst, Ohio, and went to high school in Lorain, Ohio. He completed his undergraduate education with honors at the Johns Hopkins University and obtained his medical degree from New York University School of Medicine. He first joined the National Cancer Institute, NIH in Bethesda, Maryland in 1989. He was recruited from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where he worked in the laboratory of Murray Brennan, the former chairman of Surgery. He became a principal investigator https://ccr.cancer.gov/Surgery-Branch/nicholas-p-restifo?qt- staff_profile_tabs=3#qt-staff_profile_tabs in 1993 and has authored or co- authored more than 300 papers and book chapters on cancer immunotherapy. ==Research== Dr. Restifo's most recent efforts include a focus on how elements \u2013 literally from the periodic table \u2013 influence cancer immunity. These include work on how oxygen can inhibit anti-tumor immunity and how potassium ions from dying cancer cells can shut down the anti-tumor response.Eil, R, et al. Ionic immune suppression within the tumour microenvironment limits T cell effector function. Nature. 2016 Sep 14. doi: 10.1038/nature19364. [Epub ahead of print] Successful treatment of patients with cancer is the goal of his laboratory, and his therapeutic approaches employ adoptive T cell transfer, gene modification and cellular reprogramming. Basic aspects of tumor and T cell immunology inform novel therapeutic interventions in the clinic. Restifo and his research team have made contributions to the fields of adoptive cell transfer tumor immune-escape, virally encoded cancer vaccines, adoptive cell transfer for the treatment of cancer, and the biology of self/tumor-reactive T cells, with an emphasis on memory CD8+ T cells. ==See also== *Cytotoxic T cell *interleukin 15 *memory t cell *Cish ==References== Category:Living people Category:American immunologists Category:Johns Hopkins University alumni Category:New York University alumni Category:Cancer researchers Category:1960 births ",
