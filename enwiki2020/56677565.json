    "text": "Sarah Chadwick (born August 1, 2001) is an American activist against gun violence and one of the leaders of the Never Again MSD activist movement. ==Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting== On the day of the shooting, she described how she saw dozens of police cars arriving at the scene, while some of her friends were texting her from classrooms near the gunshots. In a televised interview, she stated that \"never again should a child be afraid to go to school.\" ==Activism== A report in the Washington Post described her and fellow student Jaclyn Corin as \"fierce\" and particularly skilled at social media, effectively generating \"8.7 times to volume of online conversations than the celebrities,\" according to a marketing analysis of the tweets of the Parkland students. She had a Twitter following of 150,000 people as of February 24, 2018. She has used satire and sarcasm to advance her agenda against gun violence. She is opposed to the National Rifle Association as well as politicians who get funding from the NRA. According to a report in the New York Times, Chadwick has been particularly effective in tweets to mock pro-gun politicians such as Marco Rubio: When President Trump offered condolences, she shot back with a tweet that went viral with 4,300 comments before it was removed: When NRA spokesperson Dana Loesch posted a video saying that \"your time is up\", Chadwick posted a video response, using the hourglass meme: ==Personal life== Chadwick identifies as a lesbian, telling Teen Vogue sister magazine Them, \"I'm gay, so I'm a lesbian.\" The Huffington Post described Chadwick and fellow Never Again MSD co-founder Emma Gonz\u00e1lez as \"part of the LGBTQ family\". She is also pro-choice. ==See also== * 2018 United States gun violence protests * Never Again MSD ==References== ==External links== * Video response to Dana Loesch Category:2001 births Category:Living people Category:American shooting survivors Category:Crime witnesses Category:Activists from Florida Category:American child activists Category:American founders Category:American gun control activists Category:LGBT people from Florida Category:People from Parkland, Florida Category:Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Category:American abortion- rights activists Category:People from Margate, Florida Category:21st-century American women Category:Lesbians Category:Gun politics in the United States ",
