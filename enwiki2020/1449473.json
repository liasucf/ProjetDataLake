In December 2000, he moved abroad and signed with German club Hamburger SV: his debut came on 10 December by playing 90 minutes in a 2\u20131 home win against FC Energie Cottbus, and 16 of his 17 appearances in that season were complete, but the team could only rank 13th and 11th the following campaign, with respectively 58 and 57 goals conceded. In 2002\u201303 Ujfalu\u0161i helped Hamburg finish in fourth position, but the team fared worse in the following season (again conceding in the region of 50 Bundesliga goals). Subsequently, he signed with ACF Fiorentina, freshly returned to Serie A after successfully emerging from a bankruptcy situation. ===Atl\u00e9tico Madrid=== Ujfalu\u0161i playing for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 2009. After nearly 150 official appearances for the Viola (albeit without silverware), being mainly used as a centre back by coach Cesare Prandelli, Ujfalu\u0161i joined Atl\u00e9tico Madrid as a free agent, helping the capital team repeat its fourth position in La Liga in his debut season, subsequently qualifying for the 2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League. In the 2009\u201310 league campaign Atl\u00e9tico only finished ninth, but won the newly created UEFA Europa League, with Ujfalu\u0161i appearing in eight complete matches in the latter competition. On 19 September 2010, during injury time of a 1\u20132 league loss against FC Barcelona at the Vicente Calder\u00f3n Stadium, he made a late challenge on Lionel Messi, injuring his right ankle. The defender received a straight red card for his foul, and was subsequently banned for two games by the Spanish League's disciplinary committee; he was an undisputed starter during the season \u2013 mostly as right- back \u2013 as the Colchoneros finished seventh and qualified to the Europa League. ===Galatasaray=== On 20 June 2011, aged 33, Ujfalu\u0161i signed for S\u00fcper Lig club Galatasaray, for a \u20ac2 million transfer fee. He was an undisputed starter in his first season, being sent off in the final game of the campaign, a 0\u20130 away draw against Fenerbah\u00e7e SK, as Gala won a record-equalling 18th league title. Ujfalu\u0161i left Galatasaray at the end of 2012\u201313, after a lengthy injury. He retired in December at the age of 35, after a few months back in his homeland with AC Sparta Prague. On 18 December 2013 Ujfalu\u0161i returned to Galatasaray, being appointed director of football. He left his post in June of the following year. ==International career== Ujfalu\u0161i with the Czech Republic national team (2009).
