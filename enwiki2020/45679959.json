    "text": "Euroland was a Dutch variety store chain. It currently has 34 branches across the country. ==History== In 1997, the first 2.50 Shop opened its doors, selling everything for \u01922.50. In 2001, the similar shop called Knaakland (\"knaak\" was a \u01922.50 coin) was bought by the 2.50 Shop chain. Both shops kept their original name until the introduction of the euro, less than a year later. Both shops were rebranded to Euroland, using a logo similar to that of Knaakland, and initially selling everything for a euro. As the assortment expanded, the initial \u20ac1-only policy was dropped, and other, more expensive goods appeared. Later on however, everything displayed on the side walls was on sale for \u20ac1 with more expensive goods occupying the middle of the store. This partitioning was intended to avoid confusion. The chain went bankrupt in 2017.https://www.nu.nl/ondernemen/4475643/geen-doorstart-winkelketen- euroland.html ==See also== * Action * Zeeman (chain store) * Poundland * Family Dollar ==References== Category:Retail companies established in 1997 Category:Variety stores ",
