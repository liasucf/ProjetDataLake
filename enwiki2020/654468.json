    "text": "Maricao () is the second-least populous municipality of Puerto Rico; it is located at the western edge of the Cordillera Central. It is a small town set around a small plaza in hilly terrain, north of San Germ\u00e1n, Sabana Grande and Yauco; south of Las Mar\u00edas and Lares, southeast of Mayag\u00fcez, and west of Adjuntas. Maricao is spread over 6 barrios and Maricao barrio-pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). The town borders the Maricao Fish Hatchery, a collection of tanks and ponds in a garden setting, where some 25,000 fish are raised yearly to stock farm fishponds and island lakes. The hatchery is part of the Maricao State Forest, also known as Monte del Estado. Though of dryer vegetation than the other mountain forest, Maricao is home to large number of bird species. Its stone observation tower provides far-flung views to the coast and the Mona Passage. Maricao has a 2000 census population of 6,449. It has a land area of 37.1 square miles (96.87 km2). ==History== Hacienda Juanita in Maricao Maricao was founded on April 1, 1874 when Bernardo Collado, Juli\u00e1n Ayala, Francisco M. Sojo, Napole\u00f3n Pietri and Leoncio S. Mart\u00ednez requested the Provincial Deputation authorization to establish an official town. It originally belonged to the district of San Germ\u00e1n, but they alleged the roads were too long and almost impassable. Their request made references to a parish already established in 1866. During the 19th century coffee boom, Maricao and other regions surged economically. When the spurt of coffee in the island ended by the start of the 20th century, the economic conditions deteriorated again. Many of the old plantation houses have been turned into museums to stimulate the tourism industry. While Puerto Rico still has a niche in the gourmet coffee market, the large scale coffee growing which built Maricao is no longer economically feasible. ===Hurricane Maria=== Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Maricao. In some areas of Maricao there were more than 25 landslides per square mile due to the significant amount of rainfall. Elderly were especially affected. ==Geography== Maricao is mildly mountainous and belongs to the Western portion of the Cordillera Central. ===Barrios=== Subdivisions of Maricao. Like all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Maricao is subdivided into barrios. The municipal buildings, central square and large Catholic church are located in a barrio referred to as . #Bucarabones #Indiera Alta #Indiera Baja #Indiera Fr\u00eda #Maricao Afuera #Maricao barrio-pueblo #Montoso ===Sectors=== Barrios (which are like minor civil divisions) and subbarrios, in turn, are further subdivided into smaller local populated place areas/units called sectores (sectors in English). The types of sectores may vary, from normally sector to urbanizaci\u00f3n to reparto to barriada to residencial, among others. ===Special Communities=== Of the 742 places on the list of , the following barrios, communities, sectors, or neighborhoods were in Maricao: Llanadas, El 30 (Sector Los Mercados) in Indiera Alta, La Cuchilla, Los Cuadros-Montoso, and Villa Esperanza. ==Culture== ===Tourism=== Coffee tree atop the Maricao mountains Due to its importance as a coffee producer in the past, some of Maricao's coffee haciendas were turned into museums or guest houses: Hacienda Delicias and Hacienda Juanita, which has since closed. Other places for tourists to visit are the Bamb\u00faa Recreational Center and the Maricao Fish Nursery. Some natural spots to visit are the Monte del Estado forest reserve, the Prieto Lake and the Salto de Curet (a waterfall). ===Festivals and events=== in Maricao in 2014 Maricao celebrates its patron saint festival in June. The is a religious and cultural celebration that generally features parades, games, artisans, amusement rides, regional food, and live entertainment. Known locally as the , the End of Coffee Harvest Festival is celebrated on President's Day weekend in February. It celebrates the tradition wherein the Hacienda owners would provide a feast for their workers at the end of the coffee harvest. The festival was founded in 1977 by then mayor, Vicente Byron. Other festivals and events celebrated in Maricao include: * Indigenous Day Festival - April - celebrated in the Indiera barrios of Maricao * Homage to Mothers \u2013 May * Youth Festival \u2013 July * New Year's Eve \u2013 December ==Economy== Multi-crop farm in Maricao For decades, Maricao's economy has relied on agriculture, specifically coffee plantations. Fruits and vegetables are also grown in the town. Currently only one factory is established in Maricao, Fenwal Blood Technologies. Devices and materials that are used in blood donation, transfusion, transportation and storage are produced there. Tourism has also played an important role in the town's economy. For two decades, this municipality has had the highest level of children living in poverty in Puerto Rico. == Demographics == According to the 2000 census, Maricao is the second least populous municipality in Puerto Rico, above the island municipality of Culebra, with 6,449 inhabitants. The population of the town has decreased during the past decades perhaps due to the decline in coffee production and the deteriorating economy. In 1899, the population was 8,312. The current population density is 174.2 people per square mile (67.0/km2). As a whole, Puerto Rico is mainly made up of people from a Creole (born on the Island of European descent) or Spanish and European descent, with small groups of African and Asian people. Statistics taken from the 2000 census shows that 90.3% of Maricae\u00f1os have Spanish or White origin, 3.0% are black, 0.2% are Amerindian etc. The majority of the local population are partly descended from pre Columbian indigenous inhabitants. There is a general consensus in Puerto Rico that the barrios of Indieras in Maricao have the most people of indigenous origin in Puerto Rico.Mart\u00ednez Cruzado, Juan C. (2002).

It consists of a green cloth, with the three usual dimensions of the municipal flags of Puerto Rico, crossing from an end to another a yellow band with three points. The color green symbolizes the vegetation of the municipality and the yellow band symbolizes the mountains of the region. ===Coat of arms=== In a silver field, resides an inverted \"V\"-shaped green band. Contained in the band are five golden huts. To either side and below the band are a total of three Maricao (Byrsonima spicata) tree branches with flowers. Surrounding the shield below and to either side are two coffee tree branches. Above it is placed a gold mural crown with three towers outlined in black with green doors and windows. ===Name=== The origin of its name has two versions. It is said to come from the name of the Maricao tree (Byrsonima spicata) which has yellow flowers and grows in the region. The second version is a legend about a Ta\u00edno woman called Mar\u00eda that, during the Spanish colonization, fell in love with a Spanish soldier. She informed him of an attack planned by her tribe and the Spanish took the offensive. Mar\u00eda was then taken prisoner by her people and tried for treason. As was the tradition, she was tied to a tree and sacrificed. Allegedly \"cao\" means \"sacrifice\" so, Maricao means \"Mar\u00eda's sacrifice\". ==Education== Kids gathering information on display about Endangered Species at a school in Maricao on May 4, 2012 Maricao has several public and private schools distributed through several regions. Public education is handled by the Puerto Rico Department of Education. ==Transportation== There is no direct highway connection to Maricao.
