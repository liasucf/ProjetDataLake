He was advised by a saint, Baqi Shah, to settle across the Chenab River near the fort of Raja Kaladhv. The fort was surrounded by a dense forest and it was later settled by Hafiz Hayat when he aided people with his spiritual aura. Though the exact dates are unknown but according to one tradition it was at the time of Emperor Jahangir when the saint contributed his entire land holding to the then state for the cause of education.
