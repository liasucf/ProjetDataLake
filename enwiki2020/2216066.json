Another major race is the Harris Clash held at the Deer Creek Speedway in Spring Valley, Minnesota which was developed as a race with somewhat of an emphasis on chassis manufacturers. The IMCA Super Nationals is the biggest event held by IMCA. It happens once a year during the first week of September. This event has the most IMCA drivers in one event. == History == The 1963 and 1964 IMCA champion, Dick Hutcherson, was not eligible for the 1965 NASCAR Grand National Series Rookie of the Year, which he won nine times and finished second in the standings; it was given to Sam McQuagg. NASCAR's rookie standards have since changed to being based only on the NASCAR Cup Series. In 1979, IMCA held its first IMCA Modified race at the Benton County, Iowa Speedway. ==Images== File:IMCA Northern Sport Modifieds Luxemburg Speedway 2012.jpg|Northern Sport Modifieds File:IMCA Modifieds Luxemburg Speedway May 2012.jpg|IMCA Modifieds File:IMCA Stock Cars Luxemburg Speedway May 2012.jpg|IMCA Stock Cars ==References== *International Motor Contest Association ==External links== *Official IMCA website *Official IMCA.TV Live Broadcast website *Riivet - The Official Platform for IMCA Live Broadcast Website Category:Auto racing organizations in the United States Category:Stock car racing ",
