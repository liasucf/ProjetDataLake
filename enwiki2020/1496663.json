    "text": "Tonight is the sixteenth studio album by English singer-songwriter David Bowie, released on 24 September 1984 by EMI America Records. The follow-up to his most commercially successful album Let's Dance (1983), it was written and recorded in mid-1984 at Le Studio in Morin-Heights, Quebec, Canada following the conclusion of the Serious Moonlight Tour. Much of the album's sound is the same as its predecessor's, due to Bowie's effort to retain the new audience that he had recently acquired. The album was produced by Bowie, Derek Bramble and Hugh Padgham. Much of Bowie's creative process was the exact same as Let's Dance. Like its predecessor, Bowie played no instruments on Tonight, instead offering little creative input to the musicians during the sessions. He also recorded multiple demos of the tracks beforehand, something collaborator Carlos Alomar recalled that he rarely did previously. Three songs, including the title track, were covers of Iggy Pop songs, who was present during most of the sessions and co-writer on multiple tracks. The title track features singer Tina Turner. Supported by the singles \"Loving the Alien\", \"Blue Jean\" and the title track, Tonight was a commercial success, reaching number one on the UK Albums Chart. It was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). However, it received mostly poor reviews from music critics, with most noting its lack of creativity. Bowie would express dissatisfaction with it in later years, calling it not one of his stronger efforts. Bowie did not tour in support of the album, and only performed \"Loving the Alien\" and \"Blue Jean\" on subsequent tours. The album was remastered in 2018 as part of the box set Loving the Alien (1983\u20131988). ==Production== David Bowie worked on Tonight after completing his Serious Moonlight Tour in support of his previous album Let's Dance. He did not have much luck writing while on tour, so he described the process of recording the album Tonight this way: Bowie purposefully sought to keep the sound of the band he had used on the previous album and tour, feeling that the new fans he had accumulated would expect to hear the same thing on the new album that they'd heard before, hence the inclusion of the \"Borneo Horns\" players on the album. Like Let's Dance, but unlike most previous Bowie albums, Bowie played no instruments on the record, and in fact he delegated almost all responsibility for the music played to his musicians, only occasionally offering critical input. Bowie brought in Derek Bramble and Hugh Padgham to produce the record, the former receiving the nod from Bowie due to some of the demos he'd recently produced for English female singer Jaki Graham. As with Let's Dance, Bowie prepared for the album by recording some demos beforehand, this time showing up with 8 of the 9 songs that would appear on the album. This surprised collaborator Carlos Alomar, who said \"it was the first time in the eleven years that I've been with the damn man that he's brought in anything.\" Iggy Pop spent a good deal of time in the studio with Bowie and the band while the album was being recorded, stating \"I worked extensively on that album. There's a lot more work there than is reflected in just the simple co-writing credit for two songs and some of the old stuff.\" When asked why Bowie included so much Pop-written material on the album, Pop could only guess. \"I think he just wanted the songs heard more,\" a sentiment Bowie would mirror when covering Pop's \"Bang Bang\" on his next album, Never Let Me Down.Amsterdam Glass Spider Press Conference, 30 March 1987 ==Composition== Some of the demo tracks were not yet named, but they were numbered, called simply \"1,\" \"2\" and \"3.\" \"1\" would turn into the \"irreligious\" album track \"Loving the Alien\". Bowie described \"Loving the Alien\" as a very personal bit of writing that he did not feel fit in with the rest of the album because it is such a dark song amidst lighter fare. He said, \"\"Alien\" came about because of my feeling that so much history is wrong - as is being rediscovered all the time - and that we base so much on the wrong knowledge that we've gleaned.\" Bowie cut the demo for the song in Montreux, Switzerland, with a guitarist and a drummer he had drafted from a local Swiss band. Demo songs \"2\" and \"3\" were not finished for the album, much to Padgham's regret. He said: Three songs were covers of older Iggy Pop songs: \"Don't Look Down\", \"Tonight\" and \"Neighborhood Threat\", the latter of which stands out as a track Bowie wished he had not done, with him later calling it \"disastrous\". \"That's one I wish I'd never touched, or at least touched it differently. It went totally wrong. It sounded so tight and compromised, and it was such a gas doing it. It was the wrong band to do it with -- wonderful band, but it wasn't quite right for that song.\" \"Tumble and Twirl\", co-written with Pop, recounts the pair's exploits while vacationing in the Indonesian islands Bali and Java after Bowie's previous tour had ended. \"Don't Look Down\", which was one of Bowie's returns to a reggae-style track (after Lodger's \"Yassassin\"), perplexed Bowie: \"I tried it every which way. I tried it jazz-rock, I tried it as a march, and then I just hit on an old ska- sounding beat, and it picked up life. Taking energy away from the musical side reinforced the lyrics and gave them their own energy. I think working with Derek Bramble helped because he played propper reggae bass lines.\" For \"Tonight\", the title track and the other reggae-style track on the album, Bowie eliminated Pop's original spoken word introduction, calling it an \"idiosyncratic thing\" of Pop's that \"seemed not part of my vocabulary. ... I guess [removing the spoken introduction] changed the whole sentiment around. It still has that same barren feeling, but it's out of that specific area that I'm not at home in.\" Pop approved of Bowie's changes. For the vocals to the song, Bowie and Tina Turner sang face-to-face, although Bowie went back and re-recorded the first verse after deciding to sing his part in a higher octave. \"Dancing with the Big Boys\", which Bowie also co-wrote with Pop, was written and recorded in eight hours as they egged each other on. In what was described as an \"exhilarating rush\", Bowie and Pop \"went in [to the studio] with a few bottles of beer and would virtually bellow out anything that came into their heads,\" said Padgham. \"And I just recorded it all.\" The song is about the \"little guy\" being crushed by \"oppressive corporate structures.\" The lyrics were taken from a backlog of unused lyrics; the line \"this dot marks your location\" was a reference to a \"lengthy irritating stay\" at a New York Hotel (Bowie had been looking at the hotel room's fire escape map), and \"Your family is a football team\" was a reference to the immigrant families working in New York; \"the whole family [has] to work together for survival.\" The track elicited this from Bowie: ==Singles and videos== Three singles were released from the album: \"Tonight\", \"Blue Jean\" and \"Loving the Alien\". \"Blue Jean\" in turn spawned several videos, including an \"elaborate\" 20-minute-long collaboration with Julien Temple which was described as more of a \"minifilm\" than a video, and represented Bowie's interest in making actual movies. ==Critical reception== Despite some positive reviews of the album,\"Learning to love the Alien: Bowie haunts a calculated, kaleidoscopic seance\" by Timothy White, Musician magazine, December 1984, pages 98-99 other reviewers criticised it for lacking creativity. Padgham, who co-produced the album, also said that it was less innovative than other Bowie albums. An article for Melody Maker later dismissed Tonight as \"rotten\".\"Bowie: Boys Keep Swinging,\" Melody Maker magazine, 24 March 1990, pp 24-26 AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine called it \"one of the weakest albums Bowie ever recorded\" and wrote that \"none of the material equals the songs on Let's Dance\", although he made an exception for \"Blue Jean\". The New Rolling Stone Album Guide described Tonight as \"an expensive quickie padded with lame covers\". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stated in a retrospective of Bowie's career in 2016: \"Let\u2019s Dance... had its moments ... Tonight, however, did not\". Bowie would later distance himself from the album, acknowledging that it was not one of his stronger efforts.Mary Campbell for the Associated Press, 6 August 1993 In 1989 when working with Tin Machine, he mused \"There's stuff on [the album] that I could really kick myself about. When I listen to those demos it's, 'How did it turn out like that?' You should hear \"Loving the Alien\" on demo. It's wonderful on demo. I promise you! (laughs). But on the album, it's ... not as wonderful.\" Despite the general consensus on the album, Stylus Magazine reviewed the album in 2005 as part of its \"On Second Thought\" section and concluded that Tonight, although not a great album, is still a good one: \"it\u2019s a much better album than you think it is, or may have been led to believe. Bowie\u2019s made some subpar records, but this isn't one of them\u2014and frankly, even its failures aren't boring, because, well, it\u2019s an '80s Bowie album, from a decade in which he was wildly inconsistent, but also never dull.\" In 2016, Yo Zushi of the New Statesman also defended the album, writing \"no album that begins with the seven-minute masterpiece 'Loving the Alien' and contains the rocking 'Blue Jean' should have received the drubbing it got\". He also argued \"the TV-special-style cover of the Beach Boys' 'God Only Knows' is as stirring, in its cold, almost Brechtian way, as Station to Station's 'Wild Is the Wind' \u2013 it's like watching Elvis in [Las] Vegas through a sheet of ice.\" ==Live performances== Bowie did not tour for the Tonight album, though tracks from this album were performed on later tours. \"Loving the Alien\" was performed live during Bowie's 1987 Glass Spider Tour and 2003\u20132004 A Reality Tour. \"Blue Jean\" was performed live during the Glass Spider Tour, 1990 Sound+Vision Tour, and A Reality Tour. Bowie also performed \"Dancing with the Big Boys\" during the 1987 Glass Spider Tour, and thought he might perform \"Don't Look Down\" during that tour as well, but that song never made it to the rehearsal stage. ==Track listing== ===LP: EMI DB 1 (UK)=== * Sides one and two were combined as tracks 1\u20139 on CD reissues. ===Reissues=== In 1995, Virgin Records rereleased the album on CD with three bonus tracks, all of them singles from soundtracks Bowie contributed to in the years immediately following the album's release. EMI rereleased the album in 1999 (featuring 24-bit digitally remastered sound and no bonus tracks). In 2018, Tonight was remastered for the Loving the Alien (1983-1988) box set released by Parlophone, with other discs in the set including remixes and b-sides from the album. The album was released in CD and vinyl formats, as part of this compilation and then separately the following year. ====CD: Virgin CDVUS97 (UK)==== ==Personnel== Adapted from the Tonight liner notes. *David Bowie \u2013 vocals *Derek Bramble \u2013 guitar; guitar synthesizer; bass guitar; synthesiser; backing vocals *Carlos Alomar \u2013 guitars *Omar Hakim \u2013 drums *Carmine Rojas \u2013 bass guitar *Mark King \u2013 bass guitar on \"Tumble and Twirl\" (uncredited) *Rob Yale - Fairlight CMI on \"Loving the Alien\", \"Tonight\", and \"God Only Knows\" (Uncredited) *Guy St. Onge \u2013 marimba *Sammy Figueroa \u2013 percussion *Tina Turner \u2013 lead vocals on \"Tonight\" *Iggy Pop \u2013 backing on \"Dancing with the Big Boys\" *Robin Clark \u2013 backing vocals *George Simms \u2013 backing vocals *Curtis King \u2013 backing vocals *The Borneo Horns *Stanley Harrison \u2013 alto saxophone; tenor saxophone *Lenny Pickett \u2013 tenor saxophone; clarinet *Steve Elson \u2013 baritone saxophone *Arif Mardin \u2013 string arrangements; synthesisers *Horns''' *Mark Pender \u2013 flugel horn; trumpet Production *David Bowie \u2013 producer *Derek Bramble \u2013 producer *Hugh Padgham \u2013 producer ===Band equipment=== Carlos Alomar used the following guitars in the recording and production of the album: an Alembic stereo, a Fender Stratocaster, a Kramer, a prototype Steinberger, a C.
