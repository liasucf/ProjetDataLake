    "text": "Bowmanville Foundry Co. Ltd. is a foundry located in Bowmanville, Ontario, Canada. The company was established in 1901 by Christian Rehder, who managed the business until his death in 1941, when his son Ernie took over. After Ernie passed away in 1978 his sons Tom and Lawrence took over, with some technical guidance from Ernie's oldest son Ned, who did not work at the factory but was a highly respected metallurgist. The company was sold in 1988 to people outside of the family. The company has a long history in the manufacture of ductile, gray iron and malleable iron castings. A 2005 book, Iron in the Blood by local authors Helen Bajorek MacDonald and Helen Lewis Schmid, discusses the history of the company in the context of family, community, labour and economic history. The official launch of Iron in the Blood was mentioned in the Ontario Legislature by John O'Toole, the member for Durham.Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Transcript of Debates.
