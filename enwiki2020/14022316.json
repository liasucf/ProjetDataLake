Brown of The New York Times and featured in many business magazines. ==Overview== This book is a business novella using magic as a metaphor to change the readers\u2019 behavior and empower the reader to think out of the box. The author believes that Innovation begins by challenging assumptions. The term, Follow the Other Hand, is derived from a sleight of hand magic trick that reminds people that what they assume to be true is actually a belief. And if they follow that belief they will be misdirected such as in magic. But if they challenge the assumption; in essence, follow the other hand, they will find the secret or a new business solution that did not exist before. The book uses lessons instead of chapters. Each lesson ends with instructions for a magic trick supporting the premise of that lesson. ==Case Histories== The book includes business case histories of companies large and small that challenge the assumptions of their competitors to create successful products and services.
