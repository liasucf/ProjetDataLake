    "text": "Mannes School of Music is a music conservatory in The New School, a private research university in New York City. In the fall of 2015, Mannes moved from its previous location on Manhattan's Upper West Side to join the rest of the New School campus in Arnhold Hall at 55 W. 13th Street. == History == Mannes School of Music (2016) Originally called The David Mannes Music School, it was founded in 1916 by David Mannes, concertmaster of the New York Symphony Orchestra, and his wife Clara Damrosch, sister of Walter Damrosch, then conductor of that orchestra and Frank Damrosch. The Damrosch and Mannes families were perhaps the most important music families in America at that time, with David Mannes emerging as one of the first American born violin recitalists to achieve significant status. David Mannes was the director of the Third Street Music School Settlement as well as founder of Colored Music Settlement School, all prior to founding the Mannes School. The School was originally housed on East 70th Street (later occupied by the Dalcroze School), a larger campus was created out of three brownstones on East 74th Street, in Manhattan's Upper East Side. After 1938, the school was known as the Mannes Music School, in recognition of the broader course of study that expanded the school well beyond that of a community music school, including the three-year Artist Diploma. When Clara died in 1948, their son Leopold Mannes became president, endowing the school with his fortune from co-inventing Kodachrome film. In 1953 the school began offering a bachelor of science degree and changed its name to the Mannes College of Music. In 1960 it merged with the Chatham Square Music School. In 1984 the school moved to larger quarters on West 85th Street. In 1989 Mannes joined The New School, whose five schools include Parsons School of Design, Eugene Lang College, and School of Drama. In 2005, the New School administration changed the name to Mannes College: the New School for Music. In 2015, the university renamed it Mannes School of Music, and moved it to Arnhold Hall in the West Village. It is now part of the College of Performing Arts at The New School, which also includes the School of Drama and the School of Jazz and Contemporary Music. The College of Performing Arts, including Mannes Prep, has a total of 1,450 students. The students in any of the three schools of the College of Performing Arts can take courses in the three schools (Drama, Jazz, Mannes), no matter which school they are directly enrolled in, expanding the opportunities for self- directed study. == Academics == Two academic divisions constitute the conservatory: * College: the academic spine of the school, conferring undergraduate and graduate degrees and diplomas * Preparatory: pre-college training for children and adolescents The Techniques of Music program is the foundation for academic musical study in the two divisions at Mannes, encompassing the range of elementary to advanced music theory and aural skills and analysis classes. Music theory was taught at Mannes from its inception, with David Mannes hiring important figures such as Ernest Bloch and Rosario Scalero to teach theory and composition. in 1931 Hans Weisse was hired, one of the leading students of Heinrich Schenker.Historical information is derived from annual Mannes catalogs. Over the following nine years, Weisse promoted not just the study of Schenkerian analysis but the incorporation of it into the musical life of the school, including performance and composition. Because of his association with the school, Schenker's publication Five Graphic Music Analyses (F\u00fcnf Urlinie-Tafeln) was published jointly by his regular publisher, Universal Edition and the David Mannes School in 1932.As indicated on the cover of the publication's first edition. In 1940, Weisse died unexpectedly and was replaced by Felix Salzer. Salzer, also a student of Schenker, built upon Weisse's foundation by reorganizing the theory program into the Techniques of Music department. The philosophy behind this move was and is to integrate musicianship, theory, and performance, which was based on Schenker's concept of the role of theory in tonal music.See David Carson Berry, \"Hans Weisse and the Dawn of American Schenkerism,\" Journal of Musicology 20, no. 1 (Winter 2003): 104\u2013156. Salzer's leading student, Carl Schachter, as well as his students, continued and strengthened the department. Today the Mannes program is rapidly evolving and expanding in both the study of performance and theory. Mannes has revised its curriculum to include the incorporation of music technology classes, improvisation ensembles, teaching artistry, arts journalism, film music composition, creative entrepreneurship and more, all tied to a new commitment to contemporary music well beyond the tonal-based approach of Schenker. The Mannes of today includes an ever-increasing number of programs in partnership with its sister conservatory, School of Jazz. == Notable people == === College faculty === *Michael Bacon \u2013 film composition *Ernest Bloch \u2013 composition *Howard Brockway \u2013 piano *William Burden - voice *Semyon Bychkov \u2013 conducting *Joseph Colaneri \u2013 Director of Opera Program *Anthony Coleman \u2013 improvisation *Alfred Cortot \u2013 piano *Robert Cuckson \u2013 composition, theory, analysis *Mario Davidovsky \u2013 composition *Jeremy Denk \u2013 piano *Elaine Douvas \u2013 oboe *Timothy Eddy \u2013 cello *George Enescu \u2013 interpretation *Ruth Falcon \u2013 voice *Vladimir Feltsman \u2013 piano *Allen Forte \u2013 theory *Lillian Fuchs \u2013 violin, chamber music *Felix Galimir \u2013 violin, chamber music *Richard Goode \u2013 piano *Arthur Haas \u2013 harpsichord *David Hayes \u2013 conducting (present Director of Orchestral and Conducting Studies) *Anna Jacobs \u2013 Art of Engagement *Charles Kaufman \u2013 history, theory, President *Chin Kim \u2013 violin *Yakov Kreizberg \u2013 conducting *William Kroll \u2013 violin *Lowell Liebermann \u2013 composition, director of the Mannes American Composers Ensemble *Clara Mannes \u2013 chamber music *David Mannes \u2013 conducting, violin *Leopold Mannes \u2013 theory *Bohuslav Martin\u016f \u2013 composition *Missy Mazzoli \u2013 composition *Frank Miller \u2013 cello *Mitch Miller \u2013 oboe, English horn *Paul Moravec \u2013 composition *Philip Myers \u2013 horn *David Nadien \u2013 violinist *Charles Neidich \u2013 clarinet *Paul Neubauer \u2013 viola *Orin O'Brien \u2013 double bass *Cynthia Phelps \u2013 viola *Erik Ralske \u2013 horn *Nadia Reisenberg \u2013 piano *Todd Reynolds \u2013 violin, director, The Mannes iOrchestra *Lucie Robert \u2013 violin *Jerome Rose \u2013 piano *Jerome Rothenberg - visual art *Richard Rychtarik \u2013 stagecraft *Felix Salzer \u2013 theory *Rosario Scalero \u2013 solfege, theory, composition *Carl Schachter \u2013 theory *Sol Schoenbach \u2013 bassoon *Caroline Shaw \u2013 Co-Director, The New School Chorus *Faye-Ellen Silverman \u2013 music history *George Szell \u2013 composition, instrumentation, theory *Terry Teachout \u2013 arts journalism *Ronald Thomas \u2013 cello, chamber music *Sally Thomas \u2013 violin *Roman Totenberg \u2013 violin *Rosalyn Tureck \u2013 piano *Ronald Turini - piano *William Vacchiano \u2013 trumpet *Vladimir Valjarevic \u2013 piano *Glen Velez \u2013 percussion *Isabelle Vengerova \u2013 piano *Stefan Wolpe \u2013 composition *Jeffrey Zeigler \u2013 cello, chamber music *John Zorn \u2013 Curator, The Stone Workshops at The New School === Alumni === *Edward Aldwell \u2013 pianist and theorist *Burt Bacharach \u2013 composer and pianist *Robert Bass \u2013 conductor *Jeremy Beck \u2013 composer *Johanna Beyer \u2013 composer *Semyon Bychkov \u2013 conductor *Michel Camilo \u2013 pianist and composer *Myung-whun Chung \u2013 conductor and pianist *Kvitka Cisyk \u2013 opera singer, coloratura soprano *Valerie Coleman \u2013 flutist and composer, Imani Winds *Heather Coltman \u2013 pianist;
