    "text": "Brock Pierce (born November 14, 1980) is an American entrepreneur and former actor known for his work in the cryptocurrency industry. As a child actor, he was in Disney films The Mighty Ducks (1992), D2: The Mighty Ducks (1994), and First Kid (1996). He is an independent candidate in the 2020 United States presidential election. == Acting career == Pierce was born in Minnesota, and appeared in commercials as a toddler. His first major role was playing a young Gordon Bombay in The Mighty Ducks (1992). Pierce reprised the role in D2: The Mighty Ducks. He starred as Luke Davenport in First Kid (1996). Pierce had small roles in Little Big League (1994), Ripper Man (1995), Problem Child 3: Junior in Love (1995), Three Wishes (1995), Earth Minus Zero (1996), and The Ride (1997). == Business career == === Digital Entertainment Network === Pierce retired from acting at 17 and joined as a minor partner with Marc Collins-Rector and Chad Schackley in establishing Digital Entertainment Network (DEN), which succeeded in raising $88 million in venture capital. DEN's goal was to deliver original episodic video content over the Internet aimed at niche audiences. DEN was one of a crop of dot-com startups that focused on the creation and delivery of original video content online in the late 1990s prior to wide adoption of broadband internet access. Pierce produced its first show, a pilot for gay teenagers called Chad's World. As an 18-year-old, Pierce was making $250,000 a year and held 1% of the company's shares. DEN was slated for a US$75 million IPO in October 1999, but the IPO was withdrawn in the wake of allegations of sexual assault against Collins- Rector. All three executives subsequently resigned. Layoffs followed in February 2000. While a new executive team led by former Capitol Records President Gary Gersh and former Microsoft executive Greg Carpenter tried to salvage the company and relaunch in May 2000, DEN filed for bankruptcy and shut down in June 2000. ==== Child sexual abuse allegations ==== In 2000, three former DEN employees filed a lawsuit against the founder of DEN, and also named Pierce as a defendant, alleging that they provided the plaintiffs with drugs and pressured them for sex when Pierce and one of the plaintiffs were still teenagers. The three plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed all charges against Pierce without receiving any compensation. Court records show that Pierce paid $21,600 to one of the plaintiff's attorney because said attorney refused to file the order of dismissal requested by his client until the attorney's expenses were reimbursed. None of the accusations against Pierce has ever been corroborated, and the primary plaintiff has been convicted of fraud and has admitted to filing false lawsuits in other sexual abuse cases. === Bitcoin and cryptocurrency === In 2013, Pierce joined brothers Bart and Bradford Stephens in founding venture capital firm Blockchain Capital (BCC) which was reported to have raised $85 million in two venture funds by October 2017. In 2015, Pierce served as a technical consultant for an episode of Silicon Valley. Pierce speaking at the SingularityU summit in 2016 In a February 2018 issue of Forbes magazine Pierce was named in the \"top 20 wealthiest people in crypto\" with an estimated net worth between $700 million and $1.1 billion. Pierce was co-founder of the cryptocurrency Tether with Reeve Collins and Craig Sellars in 2014. Tether surpassed Bitcoin in trading volume with the highest daily and monthly trading volume of any cryptocurrency on the market in 2019. Tether is a so-called stablecoin because it maintains $1 dollar in reserves for each tether issued. In 2020, a court permitted the Attorney General of New York to pursue a claim that Bitfinex, an affiliated exchange, did not disclose the loss of commingled funds. In an interview in July 2020, Pierce said his involvement in Tether ended in 2015 but described Tether as \"one of the most important innovations in currency.\" Pierce was elected Director of the Bitcoin Foundation in May 2014.\"Interview with Brock Pierce,\" Bitcoin Knowledge Podcast, December 21, 2014. Several members of the Bitcoin Foundation resigned over concerns about the directors. The organization announced its insolvency in July 2015. Pierce was co-founder of Block.one, which released EOS.IO software. The ICO raised more than $4 billion, the largest in history. By March 2018, Pierce's role at Block.one had changed to chief strategy officer and he resigned from the company that month to pursue community building. === Internet Gaming Entertainment === In 2001, Pierce founded Internet Gaming Entertainment (IGE), a company which pioneered the MMORPG currency-selling services industry. Between 2004 and 2005, IGE spent more than $25 million buying out seven smaller competitors, including four auction platforms and a number of fan and content sites. In 2005, Pierce estimated that IGE accounted for about 50% of this online market in the U.S., which has about $500 million in annual volume. Pierce brought in Steve Bannon, formerly of Goldman Sachs and Breitbart News, to seek venture capital and a deal was made in February 2006 yielding $60 million of which Pierce took away $20 million for a minority stake. The next year, facing a class-action lawsuit, the company failed, had no assets and Pierce was forced out. Pierce founded ZAM, a network of websites oriented around massively multi-player online role-playing games (MMORPG), such as World of Warcraft, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Rift, EverQuest, etc., in 2003. The ZAM.com network included gaming websites such as ZAM.com, Wowhead, Thottbot, Torhead, and D3DB. === Titan Gaming/Playsino === In 2010, Titan Gaming recruited Pierce to sit on its board along with EA Executive Keith McCurdy. Pierce joined other Southern California angel investors, including MP3.com's Michael Robertson, SOA Software's Eric Pulier and William Quigley and Jim Armstrong of Clearstone Ventures. Also that year, Titan Gaming purchased the rising online gaming network Xfire from Viacom. In October 2011, after Xfire received over $4 million in fresh funding from Intel Capital, Titan Gaming and Xfire cut ties and went their own ways. Titan Gaming and Xfire now operate independently. In late April 2012, Titan Gaming announced that it would be rebranded as Playsino to embark in a complete makeover, with Pierce as the new CEO and $1.5 million of new funding.

It subsequently became an events and community center for the growing blockchain community on the island. After the damage from Hurricane Maria in 2017, Pierce started a conference called Restart Week to encourage entrepreneurs to give back to the community through innovation and philanthropy in different regions of the island. Some residents have questioned how much local business has benefited from the tax incentives meant to kickstart the economy.
