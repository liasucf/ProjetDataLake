    "text": "The Ariakon SIM-5 is a semi-automatic open bolt blow-back marker designed especially for the sport of paintball. It is manufactured by the pneumatics company Ariakon. ==Design== The SIM-5 is part of the SIM series, which is a series of MilSim paintball markers, designed from the ground up by Ariakon. The SIM-5 is designed to imitate the H&K; MP5. The SIM-5 uses iron sights, like its real counterparts, though it may be hard to use with paintball goggles on. The SIM-5 achieved to give the MilSim look that low-end markers would have difficulties matching without extensive modifying. This includes the safety design, receiver shape, cocking handle, and stock installation. The SIM-5 also features the quick barrel removal. As it only requires only one pin to be pulled out before the whole barrel can be removed, thoroughly cleaning the barrel is a lot easier on the field. Though the downside is that this special design is that the barrel cannot have a thread, and makes it harder to get an aftermarket barrel upgrades. Unlike most markers though, Ariakon has incorporated a high-quality barrel as a standard, so barrel upgrades will not be necessary. Ariakon has designed the SIM-5 to be lightweight, and most parts are made of aluminum and plastic. It has been complained about the foregrip, upper receiver, and stock being plastic, are easily broken under harsh conditions, but Ariakon seems to have fixed the fragile stock. ==SIM-5 Pro Elite== The SIM-5 Pro Elites are upgraded with a red/green dot sight and a sight rail, a mock silencer, a retractable stock, and a tactical flash light. ==Features and specifications== * Semi-Automatic\"Owner's Manual Specifications\"Ariakon.com \"Official Website Specifications\"Ariakon.com * Adjustable Sights for Windage & Elevation * Air-Through MP5 Style Magazine * MP5 Style Cocking Lever * Quick Field Stripping Pins * MP5 Style Safety * Double Stack Blow-back operation * Barrel Length: 9 in (229 mm) * Overall Length: 29 in (73.7 cm) * Caliber: 0.68 inches (17.3 mm) * Weight: 4.14 lb (1.9 kg) * Power: CO2, Compressed Air, or Nitrogen ==See also== *Scenario paintball *Ariakon Overlord ==References== ==External links== * Ariakon SIM-5 Basic Official Site * Ariakon SIM-5 Pro Elite Official Site * Ariakon Forum Category:Paintball markers ",
