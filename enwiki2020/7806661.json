In 1964, he followed Lacan into the \u00c9cole Freudienne de Paris, where he remained (with his wife Maud Mannoni) a loyal supporter to the end.E. Roudinesco, Jacques Lacan (1999) p. 293 and 403 Arguably his most well known work, Prospero and Caliban: The Psychology of Colonization, deals with colonization and the psychology of the colonizer and the colonized. Mannoni saw the coloniser, with his \"Prospero complex\" as one in regressive flight from a father complex, using splitting and the scapegoating of the colonised to evade personal problems;V. M. Vaughan ed., The Tempest (1999) Appendix 2 p. 335-9 the colonised as hiding resentment behind dependency.V. M. Vaughan ed., The Tempest (1999) Appendix 2 p. 339 The book was later criticized by writers such as Frantz Fanon for underestimating the socio-materialistic roots of the colonial encounter.P. Nayar, Franz Fanon (2013) p. 37-8 and p. 50 Nevertheless, it was to influence a generation of Shakespeare directors like Jonathan Miller,C. Alexander, Shakespeare and Race (2000) p. 166 who considered that Mannoni \"saw Caliban and Ariel as different forms of black response to white paternalism\".Miller quoted in S. Orgel ed., The Tempest (2008) p. 83 Another of Mannoni's well-known works was \"Clefs pour l'imaginaire ou l'Autre Sc\u00e8ne\", Seuil, 1969. ==English publications== * Prospero and Caliban (1956) * Freud: Theory of the Unconscious. Originally published in French as Freud par lui m\u00eame. \u00c9ditions du Seuil (1968) * 'The Decolonization of Myself' Race, VII 1966:327-35 ==See also== ==References== ==External links== *Postcolonial Studies at Emory Category:Postcolonialism Category:1899 births Category:1989 deaths Category:French psychiatrists Category:French non-fiction writers Category:Analysands of Jacques Lacan Category:French male writers Category:20th-century non-fiction writers ",
