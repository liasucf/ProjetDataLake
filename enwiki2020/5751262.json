In Peru, the treaty was championed by Toledo, and supported to different extents by President-elect Alan Garc\u00eda and candidates Lourdes Flores and Valent\u00edn Paniagua. The 2006 election's runner-up Ollanta Humala has been its most vocal critic. Humala's Union for Peru won 45 of 120 seats in Congress, the largest share by a single party, prompting the debate and ratification of the agreement before the new legislature was sworn in. Some Congressmen-elect interrupted the debate after forcibly entering Congress, in an attempt to stop the agreement ratification. Critics of the Peru TPA say the pact will worsen Peru's problems with child labor and weak labor rights, and expose the country's subsistence farmers to disruptive competition with subsidized U.S. crops. Additionally, critics contend that Dubai Ports World will be able to use its Peruvian subsidiary to obtain rights to operate U.S. ports. Animal rights groups have opposed this legislation due to the possibility of spreading factory farming practices through Latin America, increasing U.S. pork and poultry exports, and mining development that causes deforestation and habitat loss for animals.Tamara Matheson, Alex Ross, and Joseph Martinez, The US-Peru Free Trade Agreement: Protecting Corporate Investors' \"Right\u201d To Exploit The Environment & Animals. Retrieved on December 6, 2007. The most controversial elements of the agreement relate to forestry. Laura Carlsen, of the Center for International Policy, and contributor to Foreign Policy in Focus notes that \"Indigenous organizations warn that this ruling effectively opens up 45 million hectares to foreign investment and timber, oil, and mining exploitation.[Trade Agreement Kills Amazon Indians ]\" Prior to the implementation of the FTA the Peruvian government rolled back existing environmental protections in order to implement the FTA's foreign investor rights provisions to access forestry, mining and other natural resources. This included access to sensitive Amazonian territories over which indigenous communities had control under pre- FTA Peruvian law.Tucker, Todd, and Travis McArthur. \"A Year After Implementation of Peru Free Trade Agreement, U.S. and Peru Left with No New Trade Model.\" Public Citizen, www.citizen.org/sites/default/files/perufta- oneyear.pdf. Protests by indigenous communities in the Amazon against the execution of the free trade agreement, and related new foreign investors accessing rights to indigenous lands, have been deadly. As the opposition for this grew there was a confrontation back in June 2009 near the town of Bagua in the northern province of Amazonas, which according to official reports left a death toll of 34.Paez, Angel. \"PERU: Congress Probes Massacre; Prime Minister to Quit.\" Inter Press Service, Inter Press Service News Ajency, 16 June 2009, www.ipsnews.net/2009/06/peru-congress-probes-massacre-prime- minister-to-quit/. Faced with this widespread unrest, the Peruvian Congress repealed two additional decrees that redefined forest land to permit more logging and mining.Paez, Angel. \"PERU: Govt Partly Backs Down in Standoff with Native Groups.\" Inter Press Service, Inter Press Service News Ajency, 19 June 2009, www.ipsnews.net/2009/06/peru-govt-partly-backs-down-in-standoff-with- native-groups/. The government had made a mistake by failing to consult with indigenous communities before passing 10 decrees that modified Peru's legal and regulatory framework on access to and use of natural resources in the country's Amazon jungle region.Paez, Angel. \"PERU: Govt Partly Backs Down in Standoff with Native Groups.\" Inter Press Service, Inter Press Service News Ajency, 19 June 2009, www.ipsnews.net/2009/06/peru-govt-partly-backs-down-in- standoff-with-native-groups/. The decrees were declared unconstitutional in December 2008 by a multi-party parliamentary commission because they undermined the right of native people to prior consultation with respect to mining projects or other economic activities affecting their communities.Paez, Angel. \"PERU: Govt Partly Backs Down in Standoff with Native Groups.\" Inter Press Service, Inter Press Service News Ajency, 19 June 2009, www.ipsnews.net/2009/06/peru-govt-partly-backs-down-in-standoff-with-native- groups/. Indigenous groups in Peru's Amazon are demanding that their land rights are acknowledged by national government, as well as being able to participate and be consulted on decisions or legislation that could affect them. A majority feel anger towards the fact that they were not consulted about the series of decrees passed by the government after the implementation of the FTA with the US. Between January 2008 and June 2009, the government auctioned 7,700 square miles of land for mining, including forest area that is the ancestral home of the Awajun and Wampis indigenous groups.CooperAcci\u00f3n, Fedepaz and Grufides, \"Informe Observatorio de Conflictos Mineros en el Per\u00fa,\" July 2009, Available at: http://www.muqui.org/observatorio/enero_junio_2009/index.html. In addition to this legal mining, illegal mining in the Peruvian rainforest has skyrocketed since international gold prices have reached new heights (increasing 35 percent since FTA implementation).Jasper, Miranda Louise, and Clare Ribando Seelke. \"Peru: Political Situations, Economic Conditions, and U.S. Relations.\" CRS Report Congress, The Carter Center, 15 Jan. 2008, www.cartercenter.org/resources/pdfs/peace/americas/dialogue- forum/perubriefingbook-3aug2010.pdf. Indigenous land as well as parts of the Amazon rainforest are being lost at an alarming rate because of this activity. In October 2007 the AIDESEP, a Federation Representing 350,000 Indigenous Peoples in Amazon Region, sent a letter to congress and made the following statement: \"The FTA will give incentives for further and irreversible destruction of virgin rainforest, which will in turn increase global warming and displace our communities from their home territories\u2026 Provisions contained in the Peru FTA are directly incentivizing this massive takeover that is threatening our livelihoods and leading to irreversible destruction of virgin rainforest\".Chota, Alberto Pizango. \"Federation Representing 350,000 Indigenous Peoples in Amazon Region Urges Opposition to U.S. \u2013 Peru Free Trade Agreement (FTA).\" AIDESEP Letter, Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Amazon (AIDESEP), 30 Oct. 2007, www.citizen.org/sites/default/files/aidesepletterenglish-spanish.pdf. A cross- party congressional commission, created after the indigenous protests in the Amazon in August 2008, recommended the repeal of two of the laws that opened up communally-owned native lands to private investment. Decree 1015 introduced substantial changes to the decision-making process for community property such that the sale or leasing of communal lands no longer requiring approval by two-thirds of qualified community members, but just a simple majority of those members of the community attending an assembly meeting.Reyes, Anna. \"Legal But Not Legitimate: Legislative Decree 1015 and Others.\" Peru Support Group, 31 July 2008, www.perusupportgroup.org.uk/article-125.html.

In 2008, the indigenous people involved in the Interethnic Associations of the Peruvian Amazon (AIDESEP) demanded that the decrees be repealed. However, when Congress failed to implement the repeal of these decrees that affected indigenous people's rights, new protests began in April 2009. ==See also== * Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement *Rules of Origin *Market access *Free-trade area *Tariffs ==References== ==External links== *U.S. Trade Representative's Site on Peru TPA *Final Text of the United States - Peru Trade Promotion Agreement *Congressional Research Service Report on Andean Free Trade Agreement, including Peru TPA * *Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Report on Peru TPA / AFTA *Heritage Foundation: Congress Should Advance U.S.-Peruvian Free Trade Ties *Rep.
