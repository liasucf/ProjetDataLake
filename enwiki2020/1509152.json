    "text": "Dan Leno as Widow Twankey in Aladdin at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane (1896) A pantomime dame is a traditional role in British pantomime. It is part of the theatrical tradition of travesti portrayal of female characters by male actors in drag. Dame characters are often played either in an extremely camp style, or else by men acting butch in women's clothing. They usually wear heavy make up and big hair, have exaggerated physical features, and perform in an over- the-top style. ==Dame characters== Characters who are played as pantomime dames are often, though not exclusively, older, matronly women. They may be the protagonist's mother, as in Jack and the Beanstalk and Robinson Crusoe, or a nursemaid to the protagonist, as in Sleeping Beauty and Snow White. Although often warm and sympathetic characters, dames may also be employed as comic antagonists, such as with the Ugly Sisters in Cinderella. Although some pantomimes traditionally do not contain standard dame roles, certain productions of those stories add a dame character, for example, in many versions of Peter Pan. Other examples of dame characters include: *Widow Twankey, Aladdin's mother in the pantomime versions of the story *Mother Goose *The nanny or nurse in Babes in the Woods *The cook in Dick Whittington *The queen in Puss in Boots *Goldilocks' mother in Goldilocks and the Three Bears, who runs a circus in many versions of the pantomime. ==Notable pantomime dames== *Peter Alexander \u2013 (born 1952) Notable dame in pantomimes in Yorkshire. *Stanley Baxter \u2013 (born 1926) Award winning Scottish actor and impressionist, famous for his lavish productions, notably at The King's Theatre, Glasgow *Douglas Byng \u2013 (1893\u20131988) A legendary dame who appeared in over 50 pantomimes, Byng was also a noted cabaret and revue artiste.
