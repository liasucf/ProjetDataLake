There is a deep blue streak along the costa from the base to the middle, and two other streaks beneath it from the base to a transverse deep blue spot at two-fifths, the upper interval deep red, the lower orange. There is a transverse dark indigo-blue blotch in the disc beyond the middle, connected with the costal streak, and two small confluent spots between this and the preceding blotch. There is also a series of confluent blackish blotches along the fold throughout, confluent with these markings above and with a dark grey streak along the dorsum from the base to the tornus. A blue-blackish curved transverse shade is found at two-thirds, preceding a discal blotch of ground colour suffused with ferruginous above and marked with blue-blackish on the veins. Beyond this is a ferruginous fascia, marked with blue-blackish streaks on the veins. The terminal yellowish space is somewhat brassy metallic with three transversely placed blue-black dots.
