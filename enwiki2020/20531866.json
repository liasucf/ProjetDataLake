    "text": "The Calamian treeshrew (Tupaia moellendorffi) is a treeshrew species found in the islands of Busuanga and Culion, which are part of the Calamian Islands group in the Philippines. The German zoologist Paul Matschie first described a Calamian treeshrew from Culion that was part of a zoological collection obtained by the Berlin Zoological Museum (in the present day the Natural History Museum, Berlin). He considered it a distinct species as this type specimen differed from the Palawan treeshrew by a slightly shorter muzzle, and a lighter colour of the toes, hair of the tail and chest.Matschie, P.
