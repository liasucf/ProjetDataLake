This museum is the only institution devoted entirely to local history and artifacts. The scope of their collection ranges from colonial to twentieth-century, encompassing manuscripts, textiles, paintings, and ceramics. The museum is made up of permanent and temporary exhibits, research library, and currently owns and operates the local Salisbury Mansion. The library maintains more than 7,000 titles. ==Exhibits== There is one permanent exhibit at the museum in the Fuller Gallery of Industrial History, entitled \"In their shirt sleeves.\" This collection covers the Industrial history of Worcester through recently donated artifacts as well as items the Institution has collected over the decades. Dealing with a time period spanning over a century, the collection really highlights the accomplishment of Worcester locals and the impact their inventions had on the area and beyond. They also have three other exhibit areas that house temporary displays. ==Library== The research library is open to the public for a fee, Tuesday through Saturday 10-4 pm.
