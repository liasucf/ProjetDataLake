The campus is located inside the campus of Adventist Medical Center Manila within the city of Pasay, Metro Manila, Philippines and is run by the hospital. Both the colleges and hospital are run by the Seventh-day Adventist Church of the Philippines. It is a part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system.http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2010/1115/For-real- education-reform-take-a-cue-from-the-Adventists\"the second largest Christian school system in the world has been steadily outperforming the national average \u2013 across all demographics.\" == History == The colleges were first established as a school in 1993. It was incorporated with its parent hospital, the Manila Sanitarium Hospital, upon its establishment, thus adding the hospital name with a \u201cschool of medical arts\u201d (SMA). In its opening year, the college offered five vocational and allied health courses: three-year Associate in Radiologic Technology, two-year Midwifery, two-year Physical Therapy technician, one-year courses in Nursing Assistant and Emergency Medicine Technician. After a year, the college wished to upgrade its Physical Therapy Technician and the Associate in Radiologic Technician into a five-year and four-year Bachelor's degree. The college wrote to the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) asking for the authority to implement the upgrade, which was agreed on, and the upgraded courses were offered in school year 1995-6. In 1995, the college expanded its grounds by constructing a three-storey building with a capacity of six classrooms, five laboratory rooms and two offices. The building was finished in 1996. In 2000 the college introduced two new programs: the six-month Caregiver Program and the four-year B.S. in Nursing degree. The hospital and school were renamed from Manila Sanitarium Hospital to Manila Adventist Medical Center in 2002 and from School of Medical arts to Colleges in 2007. In 2019, the School of Law and Jurisprudence commenced operations. This is the first Adventist law school in the Philippines. ==Courses offered== College of Business *Bachelor of Science in Accountancy *Bachelor of Science in Business Administration **Major in Financial Management **Major in Marketing Management College of Nursing *Bachelor of Science in Nursing College of Allied Health *Bachelor of Science in Midwifery **Diploma in Midwifery *Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy *Bachelor of Science in Physical Therapy *Bachelor of Science in Radiologic Technology *Bachelor of Medical Laboratory Sciences School of Law and Jurisprudence *Doctor of Jurisprudence Senior High School *Academic **Accountancy, Business & Management **Humanities & Social Sciences **Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics ==See also== * List of Seventh-day Adventist colleges and universities * Seventh-day Adventist education ==References== == External links == * Adventist Medical Center Manila Category:Universities and colleges affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church Category:Universities and colleges in Metro Manila Category:Education in Pasay Category:Educational institutions established in 1993 Category:Adventist universities and colleges in the Philippines Category:Nursing schools in the Philippines Category:1993 establishments in the Philippines ",
