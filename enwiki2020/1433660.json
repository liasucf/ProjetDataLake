It is situated approximately 25 km south of Dessau, and 30 km northeast of Halle (Saale). At the end of 2016, it had 40,964 inhabitants.Statistical information ==History and description== Coat of arms Rathaus Bitterfeld Arch Bitterfeld was built by a colony of Flemish immigrants in 1153. It was captured by the landgrave of Meissen in 1476, and belonged thenceforth to Saxony, until it was ceded to Prussia in 1815. By 1900, Bitterfeld station was an important junction of the Berlin\u2013Halle and the Magdeburg\u2013Leipzig railways. The population at that time was 11,839; it manufactured drain-pipes, paper-roofing, and machinery, and had saw mills. There were also several coal mines in the vicinity. Owing to its pleasant situation and accessibility, it had become a favoured residence of business men of Leipzig and Halle. During the East Germany (GDR) years, it gained notoriety for its chemical industry complex which caused remarkably severe pollution, even by GDR standards. On 24 April 1959 it also was a scene for the Bitterfeld Conference, locally known as the \"Bitterfelder Weg\". This conference sought to connect the working class with the artists of the day to form a socialist national culture. In the 21st century Bitterfeld is still an industrial town and it stages the annual United Metal Maniacs metal festival. The former brown-coal open cast mine of Goitzsche, south-east of Bitterfeld, is a source of numerous fossils in Bitterfeld amber. ===Historical population=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+1840 to 1939 !Year !!
