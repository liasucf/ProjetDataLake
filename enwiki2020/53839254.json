    "text": "The Indochinese alcohol monopoly was one of the defining institutions of French colonial rule in Indochina. Catalyzed by a fortuitous convergence of advances pioneered by Albert Calmette, the development of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise des distilleries de l\u2019Indochine (SFDIC) by Auguste Rapha\u00ebl Fontaine, and then Governor General Paul Doumer\u2019s economic development plan in the 1890s, the French were successfully able to displace local Chinese entrepreneurs, establishing a state monopoly in 1897.:5-7 By subverting indigenous production networks and imposing strict controls on the production and sale of alcohol, the colonial state rationalized the alcohol regime as an integral source of revenue for Indochina's economic development.:2 However, while the French administrators intended to generate revenue by taxing alcohol across Indochina, the rudimentary transportation network implied that the monopoly, and its associated systems of repression, was confined to Indochina's lowland areas, mainly Tonkin and northern Annam.:95-96 More importantly, however, the recent revisionist accounts tracing the flows of revenue conversely reveal that it only benefited a select group of French entrepreneurs.:147 Instead, it enabled the colonial state to consolidate its control of the Vietnamese populace by penetrating deeper into the countryside.:151-155 Following partial reforms of the alcohol regime in Tonkin and northern Annam in 1933 led by journalist and politician Ph\u1ea1m Qu\u1ef3nh, the demise of the alcohol monopoly dovetailed with the end of the colonial regime in 1945. == Origins of the Alcohol Monopoly == === Revenue Farms === Owing to the dominance of ethnic Chinese merchants in pre-colonial Vietnam and the nascent colonial state apparatus, initially, the French were compelled to devise co-dependency arrangements with these ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs.:10 These were typified by a plethora of tax farms engaging in the production of commodities such as opium and alcohol in a bid to generate the much-needed revenue to fund the colonial endeavour.:2 Akin to the Indochinese alcohol monopoly, as the next section reveals, these early revenue farms necessitated an extensive, and therefore costly, police force to impede the production of contraband alcohol.:18-19 In turn, this limited the profitability of this co- dependency arrangement for the ethnic Chinese merchants and hence, they began withdrawing from the alcohol market in the 1880s paving the way for the French to capitalize on this lucrative source of revenue.:1497 Albert Calmette === A Fortuitous Convergence: Albert Calmette and the SFDIC === Concurrently in the 1880s, the convergence of scientific advances by bacteriologist Albert Calmette and (then) Governor General Paul Doumer\u2019s economic development plan in the early 1890s catalyzed birth of colonial conglomerates, in turn enabling the development of an alcohol monopoly. ==== Albert Calmette ==== Main page: Albert Calmette Observing that the Chinese had previously monopolized the production of rice liquor, owing in part to their control over the production of a \u201cChinese ferment\u201d, which lent rice alcohol its characteristic taste, coupled with his mentor Louis Pasteur\u2019s advice to conduct research that had commercial applications, Calmette devoted a substantial portion of his short stint at the Pasteur Institute in Saigon to identifying and replicating this agent.:33 :18-19 Drawing on his mentor\u2019s research on wine, Calmette speculated that this crucial ingredient was present in the husk of rice grains.:33 Fortunately, not only was he successful in isolating this microbe, he was also able to double its yield thereby enabling the industrialization and monopolization of the production of rice alcohol.:18-19 ==== The SFDIC & the Birth of the Monopoly ==== Concurrently, in the 1880s, an ambitious young entrepreneur, Auguste Rapha\u00ebl Fontaine, had successfully constructed a large modern distillery having recently secured a monopoly for the production and sale of alcohol in Hanoi \u2014 this subsequently formed the core of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise des distilleries de l\u2019Indochine (SFDIC).:1508-1509 Galvanized by the desire to displace the ethnic Chinese merchants and acquire the substantial revenues, Fontaine\u2019s SFDIC successfully lobbied Calmette for exclusive use of his distillation technique.:580 Collectively, the duo then encouraged the newly elected Governor General Paul Doumer, who fortunately had similarly earmarked alcohol (in addition to opium and salt) in his plan for generating a sustainable fiscal foundation for the colony, to grant Fontaine\u2019s SFDIC a monopoly on the manufacture of alcohol.:580 == Political Economy of the Monopoly == As Fontaine\u2019s factories began producing bottles of tasteless rice alcohol retailing at exorbitantly high prices in the late 1890s, the alcohol regime became increasingly embedded within Indochina\u2019s economic and political fabric.:68 === Economic Imperatives === Declared one of three \u201cbeasts of burden\u201d, in addition to the opium and salt monopolies, Paul Doumer argued that such stable taxation systems was essential to maintaining the fiscal health of the regime, and more importantly, to fund Indochina\u2019s economic development.:2 Echoing the colonial state's convincing justification, earlier scholarship, has therefore simply assumed the monopoly's inherent profitability. Recent scholarship, examining the flows of revenue, however problematizes this oft- held assumption.:133-157 Colonial historian of Vietnam Gerard Sasges, argues that only the earlier revenue farms developed in cooperation with Chinese entrepreneurs were guided by a broader objective of raising revenue.:146-147 Instead, the alcohol monopoly, beginning in 1897, was guided by political objectives. Moreover, he reveals that the monopoly generated little net revenue as the bulk of its revenue was siphoned of by Fontaine's SFDIC and used by the Department of Customs and Monopolies to enforce the monopoly, instead of financing the colonial development project as emphasized in the earlier scholarship. As the subsequent section details, Sasges, emphasizes that the alcohol monopoly was central to consolidating state power since the collection of taxes enabled the French to penetrate deeper into the Vietnamese countryside.:143 === Repression === Paralleling the tax farms administered by the ethnic Chinese merchants in the late 1860s, the alcohol monopoly was similarly dependent on repressive practices of control and surveillance undertaken by the agents from the largest civilian state entity, the Department of Customs and Monopolies. Mainstream political histories emphasize the intrusive and violent systems of control that underpinned the monopoly.:72 :66 These scholars collectively reveal that Customs agents from the Department of Customs and Monopolies would conduct surprise visits, ransacking households in search for evidence of contraband distilling since this undermined the profitability of the regime for Fontaine and his shareholders.:72 :66 === Everyday Resistance === Conversely, the recent socio-political histories spotlighting the views of ordinary Vietnamese reveal how they effectively challenged this defining institution of the French colonial period, demonstrating instead that colonized communities had (some) agency. Factory alcohol was both four times as expensive and a poor-replica of local rice alcohol since Fontaine's factories began using a poorer quality of rice in a bid to remain cost-efficient.:583 Hence, villagers were incentivized to continue distilling in the countryside and local women, who travelled daily to the markets in the city center to sell local produce and other wares, also stealthily transported this locally produced alcohol disguising it in wineskins.:140 In addition, villagers also devised other clever strategies to elude Customs agents and prevent them from conducting raids, taking circuitous routes to the headman's home and then realizing he had gone fishing, for example.:137 Similarly, village leaders also protected fellow villagers from incurring penalties; in one instance, a villager illegally selling alcohol was arrested and her home was accordingly ordered to be sold, but the village authorities evaded this order by cleverly proving that she as one of the village's poorest residents she had no property to her name. However, these clandestine production and distribution networks premised on collaboration not only amongst villagers, but often even with members of the military who not only wanted to benefit from the lucrative trade but also, preferred the indigenous more cheaply priced alcohol. This was, in turn, typified by the arrest of a French commander in 1905 owing to his complicity in alcohol distribution. Hence, a fortunate convergence of consumer demand, profitability, close collaboration and effective distribution methods successfully stymied the realization of an Indochinese alcohol monopoly, in turn exemplified by the colonial states 1912 amnesty for contraband offenses, resulting in the co-existence of a licit and illicit alcohol industry.:142 === Innovative Rhetoric === In addition to everyday resistance, culinary historian Erica Peter's analysis of letters penned by ordinary Vietnamese reveal how they skillfully invoked the burgeoning discourse of taste preferences to defend their production of contraband liquor thereby, galvanizing partial reforms. Owing to the low levels of consumption of factory alcohol, in 1911, the colonial state conducted a survey to understand the reasons for the persistence of contraband distilling.:591 Since the French conceived of taste as a central component of modern life but were producing a product of poor quality that was unacceptable to majority of the population, Peters reveals that the villagers cleverly employed this line of reasoning in their responses in order to defend their local production networks while also criticizing the French for not upholding their modernizing principles.:570 As a result, in 1912, then Governor General Albert Sarraut pressured SFDIC to opt for rice grains of better quality.:594 Hence, Peters's account, akin to Sasges's similarly demonstrates the agency of colonized communities, thereby problematizing the mainstream accounts that emphasize absolute colonial domination. == Reforms and the End of the Monopoly == While mainstream scholars of the monopoly conclude their account expressing that the demise of the alcohol regime expectedly dovetailed with the end of the colonial regime in 1945, it is worth noting, that a little more than a decade earlier in 1933, the skilled journalist, translator and politician Ph\u1ea1m Qu\u1ef3nh, often branded as a traitor, lobbied the then Governor General to dismantle the state-sponsored monopoly on the production of alcohol in Tonkin. Initially disparaging the regime's repressive practices, he subsequently bolstered his claims, by arguing that the growing discontent amongst local Vietnamese would inadvertently engender support for their communist rivals.:18 Convinced, the SFDIC announced that it would allow a proportion of local distilleries to operate in tandem with the SFDIC.:19 While the administrations laws still enabled Fontaine's SPDIC to partially dominate the alcohol market, this partial reform reinforces the agency of local Vietnamese revealing the potential of Indochina's expanding political sphere during the colonial period. == References == Category:Alcohol monopolies ",
