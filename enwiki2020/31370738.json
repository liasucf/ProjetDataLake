These dates and details are based on an article about a signeurial house, A Casa Dos Maias, elaborated by Francisco de Almeida e Sousa and Casimiro S. Ars\u00e9nio, published in the magazine O Tripeiro (S\u00e9rie Nova, Ano IX/9 Junho/Julho). From this article, the property is commonly referred to a sth Casa dos Maias (Residence of the Maias), because (even as the family of Domingos Oliveira Maia occupied the spaces briefly), it was a bourgeoisie period that corresponds to a golden period along Rua das Flores when many families of a social stratification lived in the homes. Francisco de Almeida e Sousa and Casimiro S. Ars\u00e9nio, referred to the opening of the Rua de Santa Catarina das Flores, whose lands were occupied by the bishop's gardens. It was the bishop who determined that for each house constructed along Rua de Santa Catarina be marked with the symbol its authority. The Residence of the Frazzes Bravos, in the document of Lu\u00eds Toledo referred to a mark of Santa Maria and was place on the door. Several years later, the lands were inherited by Lu\u00eds Toledo, his wife and sons, to construct a signeurial home (1528). By 1542, the Mitra Census archive records that the proprietors of the houses along Rua das Flores (the upper houses) were the nobleman Ferraz and another Manuel Bravo. By the 18th century, there was a construction of a chapel, that introduce decorative elements to the facade and other ornamentation authored by Nicolau Nasoni. In the second quarter of 19th century, the building was owned by Domingos de Oliveira Maia. By the mid-19th century. the chapel tile was removed and transferred to the Chapel of Quinta de Vale Abra\u00e3o in Chambres, Lamego by the then-property-owner Maria de Serpa Leit\u00e3o Pimentel. Beginning in 1992, there was an initial study to restore, remodel and expand the building, with further work being completed in 1994. ==Architecture== Detail of the front facade, showing the two register of windows Located in an urban setting, it is flanked by similar constructions on Rua das Flores, alongside various buildings of similar stature and form.
