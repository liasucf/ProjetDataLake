The 42-track album includes tracks from all of Cassar-Daley's studio albums and includes two brand new singles including the opening track \"Wouldn't Change a Thing\" and \"Shadows On the Hill\" from the ABC television series Mystery Road. A national tour to support the album is set to commence in January 2019. In a statement Cassar-Daley said: \"Looking back over this collection of songs across my whole career I can reflect on the great times such as celebrating my first Golden Guitar or ARIA Award and in contrast the periods where I have doubted myself and my music, felt alone. But at the end of the day, I say to myself 'I wouldn't change a thing'.\" ==Reception== Jeff Jenkins from Stack Magazine described the album as \"Heartfelt and honest\" and called Cassar-Daley \"one of the great Australian country writers.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 7 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Country Albums (ARIA) | 43 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Country Albums (ARIA) | 39 |- |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Country ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| Catalogue |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia | 19 October 2018 | CD, LP, digital download, streaming | rowspan=\"2\"| Bloodlines/Liberation Records | BLOOD33 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia | 30 November 2018 | LP | BLOODLP33 |} ==References== Category:2018 greatest hits albums Category:Troy Cassar-Daley albums Category:Liberation Records albums Category:Compilation albums by Australian artists ",
