He emigrated to America in 1910, with a company headed by Gertrude Elliott. He was initially billed as Pat Creighton Hale in the United States. Remaining in the country, he acted in stock theater in Hartford, Indianapolis, and other cities. While starring in Charles Frohman's Broadway production of Indian Summer, Hale was spotted by a representative of the Pathe Film Company. He eventually became known professionally as Creighton Hale, although the derivation of those names remains unknown. His first movie was The Exploits of Elaine (1914). He starred in hit films such as Way Down East, Orphans of the Storm, and The Cat and the Canary. It was thought that in 1923 Hale starred in an early pornographic \"stag\" film On the Beach (a.k.a. Getting His Goat and The Goat Man).The Goat Man (1923), IMDb. Retrieved 16 August 2015. In the film, three nude women agree to have sex with him, but only through a hole in a fence. Photographs of the scene clearly show that the man in the film is not Hale, but is another actor who also wore glasses.Biography with comparison photos of Hale and \"The Goat Man\", UnsungJoe website. Retrieved 16 August 2015. When talkies came about, his career declined. He made several appearances in Hal Roach's Our Gang series (School's Out, Big Ears, Free Wheeling), and also played uncredited bits in major talking films such as Larceny, Inc., The Maltese Falcon, and Casablanca. ==Personal life== His two sons, Creighton Hale Jr. and Robert Lowe Hale, from his first marriage to Victoire Lowe were adopted by Lowe's second husband, actor John Miljan. After his divorce, Hale married Kathleen Bering in Los Angeles in 1931. He died in South Pasadena at age 83 and was buried at Duncans Mills Cemetery in Northern California. ==Selected filmography== * The Million Dollar Mystery (1914) - Gang Member (film debut) * The Stain (1914) - Office Clerk * The Taint (1914) - Walter, Madame Bartlett's Son * The Three of Us (1914) - Clem * The Exploits of Elaine (1914, Serial) - Walter Jameson (Ep. 1, 2, 3, 6) * A Fool There Was (1915) - Minor Role * The New Exploits of Elaine (1915) - Walter Jameson * The Romance of Elaine (1915, Serial) - Reuben Whitcomb * Hazel Kirke (1916) - Pittacus Greene * The Iron Claw (1916, Serial) - Davey * Charity (1916) - Jimmie Fleming (Mary's brother) * Snow White (1916) - Prince Florimond * The Seven Pearls (1917) - Harry Drake * Mrs. Slacker (1918) - Robert Gibbs * For Sale (1918) - Waverly Hamilton * Annexing Bill (1918) - Billy * Waifs (1918) - Fitzjames Powers * His Bonded Wife (1918) - Philip Hazard * The Woman the Germans Shot (1918) - Frank Brooks * The Great Victory (1919) - Conrad Le Brett * Oh, Boy!
