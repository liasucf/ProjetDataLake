    "text": "Motorcade of Generosity is the debut studio album by American alternative rock band Cake. It was recorded at the Pus Cavern studio in Sacramento, California, and released on February 7, 1994 through the Capricorn Records label. == Release == On January 14, 2009 a special limited edition orange vinyl re-issue of the album was made available for purchase on the band's official website, which sold out in two days. == Reception == Motorcade of Generosity has received a mixed-to-favorable response from critics. AllMusic critic Darryl Cater stated that \"Cake's minimalist jams occasionally get repetitive.\" Nevertheless, Cater also noted that \"there are enough standouts here to easily qualify Motorcade as a keeper.\" Music reviewer Robert Christgau described the album as \"unambiguity from the near side of cool.\" In 2005 the song I Bombed Korea was translated into Hebrew and performed by Zeev Tene under the title Beirut (), with Korea replaced by Lebanon. This version was included on the soundtrack of the film Waltz with Bashir. == Track listing == == Personnel == ; Cake * John McCrea \u2013 vocals, guitar * Greg Brown \u2013 guitar, organ * Vince DiFiore \u2013 trumpet * Victor Damiani \u2013 bass * Todd Roper \u2013 drums ; Additional personnel * Frank French \u2013 drums on tracks 5, 8, 10, 11 * Gabriel Nelson \u2013 bass on tracks 5, 8, 10, 11 * Hag \u2013 extra background vocals == References == == External links == * Category:1994 debut albums Category:Cake (band) albums Category:Capricorn Records albums ",
