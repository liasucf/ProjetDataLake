The gravity and effect of martyrdom plays out in the last 10 minutes of the movie, which is by far the only part that manages to incite an emotion.\" Sify gave 2.5 and wrote, \"With an average script, the story meanders along without a definite direction for most parts here. Perhaps the whole effort was to take it to the climax where there is a wafer thin plot.\" The New Indian Express gave 2 out of 5 and wrote, \"barring two notably tense moments in the first half\u2014a daring rescue operation (involving fire) and a fight scene (involving water)\u2014Edakkad Battalion fails to make us feel anything in other segments.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 films Category:2010s Malayalam-language films Category:Malayalam-language films Category:2019 action drama films Category:Indian action drama films Category:Indian Army in films ",
