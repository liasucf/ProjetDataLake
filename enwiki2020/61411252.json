Ag\u00e2h lives alone in an old Ottoman building bearing the name of his deceased spouse, Mebrure, in Beyo\u011flu. One day, his beloved cat M\u00fcnir Bey dies, since Ag\u00e2h forgets to feed him.

Ag\u00e2h can't accept the fact that he has Alzheimer's disease and becomes depressed. One day, when Ag\u00e2h meets his friends at an invitation, he discerns some advantages of his disease and makes a decision which is a turning point. Nevra Elmas is a young and idealist police-officer working in Istanbul Police Headquarters. She is the only female personnel in the Homicide Department but due to her gender, she experiences mobbing by her male co-workers, especially by misogynist Firuz. Her workmates believe that she does not deserve her position in the department and that her assignment is purely and simply due to benevolent sexism. A serial-killer wearing a cat costume shows up in Istanbul. There is a common ground between the victims, Nevra Elmas, and Ag\u00e2h Beyo\u011flu: Kambura, a small and conservative district near to Istanbul. == Cast == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
