Gaudez studied sculpture under the tutelage of Francois Jouffroy at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and in 1870 was a prisoner of war during the Franco-Prussian War. ==Early life and career== Gaudez was born in Lyon, France, on 2 February 1845. He was a pupil of Francois Jouffroy at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1862. He made his debut at the Paris Salon in 1864. Gaudez worked almost exclusively in bronze and he produced a wide array of sculptures, ranging from genre subjects to military and patriotic themes. His earlier work was mostly of a classical nature but in the latter part of his career he produced some sculpture that can be categorized as art nouveau. ===Prisoner of war=== He was a prisoner of war in the Franco- Prussian War in 1870. Having first-hand knowledge of the war, he executed a statue in memory of the French prisoners held in Magdeburg by the Prussian forces. The statue was erected in the city's cemetery. He participated in the Paris Salon of 1878 with the plaster sculpture titled Jupiter's Childhood. ==Death and legacy== Gaudez died in Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, on 23 January 1902.
