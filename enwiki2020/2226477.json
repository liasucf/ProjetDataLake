It merged with State Bank of India on 1 April 2017. ==History== His Highness Bhupinder Singh, Maharaja of Patiala State, founded the Patiala State Bank on 17 November 1917 to foster growth of agriculture, trade and industry. The bank combined the functions of a commercial bank and those of a central bank for the princely state of Patiala. The bank had one branch at Chowk Fort, Patiala, Undivided India. The formation of the Patiala and East Punjab States Union in 1948 led to the bank being reorganized, being brought under the control of the Reserve Bank of India, and being renamed Bank of Patiala. On 1 April 1960 Bank of Patiala became a subsidiary of State Bank of India and was renamed State Bank of Patiala. == Logo and slogan == The logo of the State Bank of Patiala is a blue circle with a small cut in the bottom that depicts perfection and the small man the common man \u2013 being the center of the bank's business.
