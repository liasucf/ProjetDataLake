    "text": "Robert Kristopher Cesternino (born October 20, 1978) is an American reality television and podcasting personality, known for his appearances on both Survivor: The Amazon (2003) and Survivor: All Stars (2004) and his current coverage of reality television on his podcast, Rob Has a Podcast. == Early life == Originally from Wantagh, New York, Cesternino worked as a computer projects coordinator for an insurance general agency. He had been previously employed as a store clerk, a waiter, and a bartender. In 2001, Cesternino graduated from the honors program at the State University of New York at Oswego with a Bachelor of Arts degree in broadcasting. ==Survivor== ===The Amazon=== Cesternino appeared on Survivor: The Amazon in 2003. Originally a member of the all-male Tambaqui tribe, Cesternino cut a number of deals throughout the game, which often resulted in him double-crossing his allies and convincing other tribe members to flip their votes. Cesternino lasted 38 of 39 days but was voted out by Jenna Morasca at the final three. ===All- Stars=== In 2004, he came back to play again in Survivor: All-Stars and was a member of the original Chapera tribe and he was voted out in a blindside led by \"Boston\" Rob Mariano. With all votes against him, he was the third person voted out and finished in 15th place, after fellow Amazon castaway Jenna Morasca quit the game to be with her dying mother. ==Post-Survivor== In May 2013, Cesternino was a guest on the Survivor After Show, hosted by Parvati Shallow. In June of that year, he appeared as a co-host and executive producer of Reality GameMasters, a YouTube show documenting six reality stars competing in a game of Risk. Cesternino was inducted into Xfinity's Survivor \"Hall of Fame\" in 2012, alongside Amanda Kimmel and Ethan Zohn. In addition, both of his seasons were voted by viewers as being among the top 10 greatest seasons of all time - The Amazon was 8th, while All-Stars was 6th. In a 2015 interview shortly before the premiere of the 30th season, Jeff Probst stated that Cesternino, along with Spencer Bledsoe from Survivor: Cagayan and Survivor: Cambodia, was his personal favorite non-winner contestant. ===Rob Has A Podcast=== Cesternino owns and manages his own website entitled Rob Has A Website, which is the home of his podcast series Rob Has A Podcast (RHAP), which has since expanded to include a YouTube channel. The podcast began during 2010, originally covering Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains and the final season of the ABC television drama series Lost. Cesternino also covers a wide range of other reality programs including Big Brother, The Amazing Race, and The Celebrity Apprentice. Cesternino and fellow Survivor alumni Stephen Fishbach, co-host of the RHAP show Survivor Know-It-Alls, were approached to compete together in The Amazing Race 31. The pair showed interest but were forced to decline due to Fishbach's impending wedding. ==Personal life== In August 2010, Cesternino married his longtime girlfriend, Nicole Palmeri. The couple's first child, Dominic James, was born on September 29, 2013. The couple's second child, Anthony Joseph, was born on November 12, 2015. ==References== ==External links== * *Rob Cesternino's Post Show Recaps website * *Rob Cesternino biography for Survivor: The Amazon at CBS.com *Rob Cesternino biography for Survivor: All-Stars at CBS.com Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:American men podcasters Category:American podcasters Category:People from Wantagh, New York Category:People from Los Angeles Category:State University of New York at Oswego alumni Category:Survivor (American TV series) contestants ",
