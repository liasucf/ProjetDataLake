At that time it was the nearest rail head for the two towns Jajpur and Keonjhar. That is how the station came to be known as JajPur Keonjhar Road. The municipality was established in 1963.

Subsequently, additional capacity of 10,000 MT p.a. of Low Carbon Ferro Chrome (LCFC) with slag furnace was created in October 1970. However, due to entry of relatively cheaper South African ferrochrome and general slow down in the demand of LCFC, IDCOL decided to stop the production of LCFC and with minor modifications, converted its slag furnace into reduction furnace in July 1998, so as to produce an additional 6,000 MT p.a. of HCFC. With this, the total installed capacity of the HCFC stood at 18,000 MT p.a. The current installed capacity is 19,000 MT p.a. The rated capacity of the furnaces are 9 MVA and 6.5 MVA. The plant was taken over by IFCAL in April, 2002. The operations at the Ferrochrome plant include mining of chrome ore from open cast mines, beneficiation of ore and smelting. The production process involves reduction of chromium oxide to chromium by electric arc furnace to produce HCFC by further reduction of the metallic oxide with the help of carbon. The plant is located at Jajpur Road in the district of Jajpur, Odisha, and is about 12 km from NH-5 connecting Bhubaneswar and Kolkata. The nearest railway station is Jajpur Keonjhar Road Railway Station which is about 2 km away from the plant and the nearest airport is Bhubaneswar (also the State Capital) about 120 km from the plant. ==References== Category:Cities and towns in Jajapur district ",
