Initially, membership was open to only Europeans, but this opened up to include Indians as well. The club-house is in a colonial style, and was completely renovated in February 2008. The club has a restaurant, bar, accommodation, a health club and conference hall. The members helped develop the modern game of Polo during the later years of the 19th century. ==See also== * List of India's gentlemen's clubs ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Silchar Category:Polo clubs in India ",
