    "text": "Ficus cordata, the Namaqua fig, is a species of fig that occurs in two disjunct populations in Africa, one in the arid southwest of the continent, and a second in the northern subtropics. In the south it is often the largest and most prominent tree, and is virtually restricted to cliff faces and rock outcrops, where it has a rock-splitting habit. ==Subspecies== The subspecies are: * F. c. cordata \u2013 southwestern Africa * F. c. lecardii (Warb.) C.C.Berg \u2013 Senegal to central Africa ==Range and habitat== The nominate subspecies is native to arid western South Africa, Namibia and southwestern Angola, while a second subspecies is native to Africa's northern subtropics. The nominate subspecies is found in fynbos, succulent Karoo and Nama Karoo, while the northern subspecies is found in savannah, up to 1,500 m above sea level. ==Species associations== The nominate subspecies is pollinated by the wasp Platyscapa desertorum Compton.. The wasp Comptoniella vannoorti Wiebes. is an associated non-pollinator that oviposits through the fig wall. The pollinator wasp of the northern subspecies, F. c. lecardii, is as yet unknown. ==Similar species== F. salicifolia, the Wonderboom, is sometimes deemed a third subspecies of Ficus cordata, i.e. F. c. subsp. salicifolia (Vahl) C.C.Berg, but it lacks the yellowish sessile figs of F. cordata, and its range is much to the east.
