He has been described as \"one of Norway's most important artists\" and, following the 2014 publicity about his sculpture, Chair, \"the most famous Norwegian artist since Edvard Munch.\" ==Life and work== Melgaard was born in Sydney to Norwegian parents, raised in Oslo, Norway, and works and lives in New York.fineart.no Early in his career Melgaard created controversial installations referencing subversive subcultures such as S&M; and heavy metal music.press release for A Weekend of Painting: A Novel by Les Super, LeoKoenig.com Currently, his practice consists of an emphasis on expressionistic paintings and drawings, often containing text.Galleri Faurschou Melgaard studied at the Norwegian National Academy of Fine Arts, Rijksakademie in Amsterdam from 1991 to 1992 and at the Jan van Eyck Academie in Maastricht from 1992 to 1993. His first show in New York was in 2000, where he exhibited sculptures of apes engaged in sex acts. Melgaard moved permanently to New York in 2009. In January 2014 his fibreglass artwork, Chair, sparked controversy when a picture was published of it on a fashion website. The chair appeared to be a black woman on her back with the seat cushion supported on her thighs. Magazine owner Dasha Zhukova (who is white) was pictured sitting on the cushion. After angry accusations of racism the picture was withdrawn. Melgaard has created it as a reinterpretation of a similar chair by British pop artist Allen Jones, and intended it to be a comment on gender and racial politics. Gallery director Steven Pollock said \"Acceptance is not the goal and he doesn\u2019t subscribe to the European politically correct attitude of placating cultural expectations. He\u2019s certainly not racist, and used to have a black boyfriend.\" ==Notable exhibitions== 2019 *Naturally Naked, Gary Tatintsian Gallery, Moscow 2013 *\"Bjarne Melgaard\", Astrup Fearnley, Oslo *\"Ignorant Transparencies\", Gavin Brown\u2019s Enterprise, New York 2012 *\"A House to Die In\", Institute of Contemporary Arts, London 2008 *Bjarne Melgaard, Greene Naftali Gallery, New York 2007 *The Glamour Chase, Galleri Faurschou, Copenhagen 2006 *Helter Helter, Galerie Anne De Villepoix, Paris *Les Super, Galerie Guido W.
