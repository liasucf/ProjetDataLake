Kucha coinage was produced in the Kingdom of Kucha, a Buddhist state located in present-day Kucha County, Xinjiang. There are five known types of Kucha cash coins based on the Chinese Wu Zhu's. These coins are usually characterized by their diminutive size and thin shape. They are generally believed to have been produced between the years 265 and 589. == The kingdom == The Kingdom of Kucha was first recorded during the Han dynasty and was later annexed by the Tang. During its existence, it was a prominent player on the Silk Road. From around the third or fourth century, the Kingdom of Kucha began to manufacture the Wu Zhu cash coins inspired by the diminutive and devalued Wu Zhu's of the post-Han dynasty era in Chinese history. It is very likely that the cash coins produced in Kucha predate the Kaiyuan Tongbao (\u958b\u5143\u901a\u5bf3) and that the native production of coins stopped sometime after the year 621 when the Wu Zhu cash coins were discontinued in China proper.The N\u00e1prstek museum XINJIANG CAST CASH IN THE COLLECTION OF THE N\u00c1PRSTEK MUSEUM, PRAGUE. by Ond\u0159ej Klime\u0161 (ANNALS OF THE N\u00c1PRSTEK MUSEUM 25 \u2022 PRAGUE 2004).

These coins are usually characterized by their diminutive size and thin shape. Four types tend to have no inscriptions at all, while one type of coin is the \"Han Gui bilingual Wu Zhu coin\" (\u6f22\u9f9c\u4e8c\u9ad4\u4e94\u9296\u9322, h\u00e0n gu\u012b \u00e8r t\u01d0 w\u01d4 zh\u016b qi\u00e1n) which is characterized by its obverse side resembling Chinese Wu Zhu coins and reverse side featuring a local Kucha script above and below the square center hole.Jen, David Chinese Cash: Identification and Price Guide, 340 p, 2000. As the language of the Kingdom of Kucha isn't well preserved in the modern era, many hypotheses have been suggested about its meaning, including that it is simply a translation of \"Wu Zhu\" or features the name of the Kingdom of Kucha in the Ku\u015bi\u00f1\u00f1e language.Anything Anywhere - CHINA, coins of that western region called Xinjiang/Sinkiang. - Xinjiang means \"new land.\" Formerly known to westerners as \"Chinese Turkestan.\" Approximately 5000 years of history, not particularly well written up in English and perhaps some of the Chinese studies are somewhat politically/ethnically biased.

Cash coins without any inscription cast in this region (\u9f9c\u8332\u7121\u6587\u5c0f\u9285\u9322, qi\u016bc\u00ed w\u00fa w\u00e9n xi\u01ceo t\u00f3ng qi\u00e1n) are generally believed to have been produced between the years 265 and 589. The first variant of these cash coins are round in shape and have a rim around the square centre hole on one side (the other side is rimless). They tend to be thin on the outside and thicker on the inside, and they weigh between 0.4 grams and 1.7 grams with a diameter of 9 to 18 millimetres. The second variant of coin is similar to the aforementioned type but has no inner rim. These cash coins generally ranged from 8 to 13 millimetres in diameter and had a weight of 0.2 to 0.4 grams. The third type of these cash coins are also completely rimless but are square in shape and have a square centre hole. They tend to be very thin with diameters between 8 and 11 millimetres and weigh between 0.2 and 0.5 grams. The final variant are irregularly shaped, diminutive in size, thin, and are cast of poor workmanship. Some are merely five millimetres in diameter and weigh as little as 0.2 grams. The Buddhist monk Xuanzang describes seeing \"small bronze coins\" during his visit to Kucha in the year 630 in his work \"Great Tang Records on the Western Regions\" during the Tang dynasty. These cash coins are likely to have been the inscribed variant, the \"Han Gui bilingual Wu Zhu coin\". == List of cash coins produced by the Kingdom of Kucha == List of cash coins produced by the Kingdom of Kucha: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
