    "text": "Slovene months have standard modern names derived from Latin names, as in most European languages. There are also archaic Slovene month names, mostly of Slavic origin, which exist in both a standardized set as well as many variations. ==Standard modern names== Gravestone with the archaic spelling februvarij 'February' The standard modern Slovene month names are januar, februar, marec, april, maj, junij, julij, avgust, september, oktober, november, and december. When writing dates, they appear after the day and are often represented by Arabic numerals, and sometimes with Roman numerals (e.g., 19. 5. or 19. V. 'May 19th'). Older variants include januvarij 'January', februvarij 'February', and marcij 'March'. ==Standard archaic names== Many of the names in the standardized set of archaic Slovene month names first occur in the \u0160kofja Loka manuscript, written in 1466 by Martin of Loka. Rob with traditional Slovene month names: \"Matia Peterlin. Born 22 January 1784, Died 24 March 1863. Long are the years, but quickly they have run their course.
