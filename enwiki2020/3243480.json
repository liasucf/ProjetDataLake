A praetorium could be a large building, a permanent tent structure, or in some cases even be mobile. === Exterior === Since the praetorium originated as the officer's quarters it could be a tent, but was often a large structure. The important design aspect of the praetorium is not symmetry, but rather proportion of one element to another.Evans, Edith . \"Military Architects and Building Design in Roman Britain\". Britannia 25 (1994): 159\u2013161. The Praetorium was constructed around two open courts, which correspond to the atrium and peristyle of the Roman house. Most praetoriums had areas surrounding them delegated for exercise and drills conducted by the troops.
