As defined by French NGO Sentiers M\u00e9tropolitains, they encourage walkers to discover a metropolitan territory, in several days of hiking. ==Origins== The first official metropolitan trail was the GR2013, a GR footpath around Marseille, launched for Marseille-Provence 2013 European event. ==Development== Besides GR2013, other metropolitan trails have been designed; like \"Inspiral London\", \"Iki Deniz Aras\u0131\u201d (\"Between Two Seas\") in Istanbul, \"Parcours M\u00e9tropolitain du Grand Lyon\", \"Sentier de Randonn\u00e9e P\u00e9riurbaine\" in Bordeaux, or \"Sentieri Metropolitani Milano\". ==Organization== Marseille-based not-for-profit organization Sentiers M\u00e9tropolitains is in charge of the coordination of many trails, including Marseilles, Paris and Avignon.
