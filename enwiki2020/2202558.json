    "text": "The RAMJAC Corporation is a fictional multinational conglomerate, or megacorp, featured in several novels by Kurt Vonnegut. In Vonnegut's 1979 novel, Jailbird, the company at its height owns 19 percent of the United States, twice as large as the next largest conglomerate in the \"Free World\".Vonnegut, Kurt; Jailbird; Delacorte; New York: 1979. Copyrights on Vonnegut's later books are also held by RAMJAC, much like Isaac Asimov's later copyrights are held by Nightfall, Inc. According to Jailbird, RAMJAC was established by Jack Graham, a mining engineer from West Virginia, and then passed on to his widow, known to the world as Mrs. Jack Graham (in reality the former Mary Kathleen O'Looney, the ex-lover of the book's narrator, Walter F. Starbuck). Mrs. Graham ordered her surrogates to \"acquire, acquire, acquire\", instructions which eventually produced the conglomerate's vast holdings. Two years after her death (her will being concealed by Starbuck for that time), it was discovered that she had transferred ownership of RAMJAC to the \"people of the United States\", as part of a misguided attempt to bring about widespread state ownership \u2013 Mrs. Graham had been a Communist since college. The U.S. government immediately began selling off RAMJAC's assets. ==Divisions and holdings of The RAMJAC Corporation== * All in the Family * American Harp Company * Anheuser-Busch * AT&T * Barnum and Bailey Circus * Bergdorf Goodman * Bloomingdale's * Chrysler Air Temp *The Plain Dealer * Colonel Sanders *Diamond Match Company P 171, Vonnegut, K (1979) Jailbird, New York, NY, Dell Publishing * Down Home Records * Dell Publishing * Gulf+Western * Henri Bendel * Hospitality Associates, Ltd., including the Arapahoe Hotel and the Hilton Department * The Illinois Institute of Instruction * Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company * Marlborough Gallery * McDonald's * The New York Times * Peanuts comic strip * Pinkerton Detective Agency * Playboy magazine * Plymouth Cordage Company * Ringling Brothers Circus * The Rosewater Foundation * Sloane's department store * Sesame Street * Tiffany's department store * Transico * Kilgore Trout and Sons * Universal Pictures * Lawrence Welk * Youngstown Steel * Who's Who ==References== Category:Kurt Vonnegut characters Category:Fictional companies ",
