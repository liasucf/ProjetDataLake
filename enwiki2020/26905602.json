In addition to the original two- floor building, the Main Hall, gymnasium, and a number of other classrooms were later added to the west and south of the main block, enclosing a paved area known as the quadrangle. Covered walkways between the newer buildings and the original block were later enclosed with outer walls to protect the children from the weather. In the early 1990s, a Year 5 block was constructed to the far west of the site, replacing huts that had stood on the playing fields for the previous few decades. Playing fields and a tennis court with wire net fence around the perimeter occupied the land between the school buildings and the B1326 Northumbrian Road. The school's main playing field was located to the east of the main site, across the cycle track. Air raid shelters once occupied the side of the field nearest the cycle track. The caretaker's house stood immediately to the north of the Blagdon Arms pub. The buildings were demolished during the Summer of 2014, in preparation for the redevelopment of the site into a housing estate of 34 homes by builder Taylor Wimpey between 2014 and 2016. Two streets are to be built on the site: School Close and Blake Drive, the latter named for Sir Francis Blake. ==Headteachers== * Thomas Wormwell, 1 September 1909 \u2013 6 January 1913 * George Davison, 6 January 1913 \u2013 18 September 1937, died in office * Isaac Baty, 25 April 1938 \u2013 24 March 1961 * William Gowrie, 2 September 1964 \u2013 31 March 1982 * John Elliott, 26 April 1982 \u2013 20 December 1995 * Ronald Stewart, 1 April 1996 \u2013 21 July 2008 ==References== * Stewart, Ronald, Parkside Middle School Cramlington: A brief history of the school according to the log books 1909\u20132008. 2008. ==External links== * OFSTED record 2007 Category:Educational institutions established in 1909 Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 2008 Category:Defunct schools in Northumberland Category:1909 establishments in England Category:2008 disestablishments in England Category:Cramlington ",
