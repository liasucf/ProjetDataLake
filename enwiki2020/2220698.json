Anderlecht, his former team. ==Career== He was nicknamed Polle Gazon (Polle is Paul in Brussels dialect, and Gazon means lawn in Dutch and French) due to the large number of fouls committed on him. In 1964, he played in the Belgium- Netherlands match alongside 10 Anderlecht players after the substitution of goalkeeper Delhasse by Jean-Marie Trappeniers. Van Himst won the Belgian championship 8 times, all of them with Anderlecht, the club for which he started playing his first professional season in 1959\u201360. With Anderlecht, he scored 233 goals in 457 matches (16 seasons). He then played for RWDM (another Brussels club) in 1975\u201376 and for Eendracht Aalst (then in the second division) in the following season. Between 1960 and 1974, Van Himst scored 30 goals (in 81 matches) for the Belgian national team. This performance made him Belgium's second top scorer\u2014along with Bernard Voorhoof\u2014and the 10th most capped player for his country. He made his debut on 19 October 1960 in a match against Sweden and he was part of Belgium's team which qualified for the 1970 World Cup. Van Himst then helped Belgium reach third place at the Euro 1972. As a football manager, Van Himst has worked notably for Anderlecht and the national team which he led to the 1994 FIFA World Cup. == Awards == He holds the record of four times being awarded the Golden Shoe.
