    "text": "Robert Samatan, nicknamed Bob la Science (Toulouse, 16 April 1909 - Antibes, 4 May 1986) was a French rugby union and rugby league footballer. He debuted for T.O.E.C (rugby union), 178 m tall and weighing 76 kg at his debut, later he played at left wing for SU Agen (but also as right wing or number eight). A very powerful player, he is the forerunner of the modern wingers' playing style. The first player to be inspired by his lively and alert techninque was Jean Dauger, who played for Bayonne. On March 1934, dismissed from SU Agen, he was part of the rugby league team of the \"Galia\u2019s Boys\" who made a memorable tour in England under the management and captainship of its creator Jean Galia. His status as a Pioneer (Galia's Boy) did not qualified him as a French International. Opting for rugby league, he integrated the Roanne XIII squad where Max Rousi\u00e9 and Jean Dauger played alongside him in 1938. In 1951, he comanaged the first French tour of a team sport (e.g. France national rugby league team) in Australia and New Zealand. In his civil life, he worked as wholesaler in the alimentar sector. == Biography == In March 1934, Robert Samatan made an interview for L'Auto after switching to rugby league where he denounced the hypocrisy and the shamateurism within the French Rugby Federation since several years. Playing then at the Toulouse lyceum, he received an offer from Annibert (of Stade Toulousain, who later became a member of the French Athletics Federation where he dictated the laws of the full amateurism). Annibert promised him a success at his exams and numerous advantages and Mr. Furst of Stade Toulousain also proposed him 200 francs per month, which convinced Samatan to sign. After some months, his salary quadruplied and numerous clubs offered him a better salary like Quillan and Carcassonne, but it is finally Agen through Mr. Armand Bastoul's intermediary which obtained his signature for 25.000 francs and a situation, which later convinced Maurice Porra to join him at Agen for 1.500 francs per month.Les sensationnelles d\u00e9clarations des joueurs Samatan, Porra, Carr\u00e8re et Fabre sur les proc\u00e9d\u00e9s de certains dirigeats en face des lois de m'amateurisme, l'Auto, le samedi 3 mars 1934. He decided to take part of the creation of a French rugby league team with Jean Galia. Appointed by the latter tocoinvince some players to switch to rugby league, he faced overbids from rugby union clubs which were yet amateur in principle, such as USA Perpignan.Actuellement encore des joueurs sont pay\u00e9s !, Robert Perrier, l'Auto, le dimanche 5 mars 1934. == Rugby union career == * Champion of France (as winger) with SU Agen (1930) * International (10 caps) for France A (1930 -1931) == Rugby league career == * Team honours : ** Winner of the French Cchampionship : 1939 (Roanne).Robert Samatan did not took part at the final. ** Winner of the Lord Derby Cup : 1935 (Lyon-Villeurbanne) et 1938 (Roanne). * Individual honours : ** International in four occasions for France between 1934 and 1936. ** Co-trainer of France (being the first French team of a team sport (France national rugby league team) who made in 1951 a tour (successful and of 2,5 months) in Oceania) (1951-1955). === International Caps === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"float:center; border:1px; font-size:90%; margin-left:1em;\" border=\"1\" ! colspan=\"12\" width=\"1000\" |Robert Samatan international matches |- ! !Date !Venue !Opponent !Result !Competition !Position !Points !Tries !Pen. !Drops |- |1. | April 1934 |Stade Buffalo, Paris, France |England | |? |Wing |? |? |? |? |- |2. | January 1935 |Bordeaux, France |Pays de Galles | |? |Wing |? |? |? |? |- |3. | March 1935 |Stade Buffalo, Paris, France |England | |? |Wing |? |? |? |? |- |4. | December 1936 |Paris, France |Wales | |? |Five-eights |? |? |? |? |} == Notes and references == === Notes === === References === ==External links== *Robert Samatan international statistics at ESPN Scrum *Bob Samatan at rugbyleagueproject.com Category:Dual-code rugby internationals Category:Rugby union wings Category:SU Agen Lot-et-Garonne players Category:France international rugby union players Category:France national rugby league team players Category:Rugby league coaches Category:WikiProject Europe articles Category:WikiProject France articles Category:1909 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Toulouse Category:Rugby league wingers ",
