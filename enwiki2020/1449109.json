    "text": "Andrey Kurkov, Warsaw (Poland), May 19, 2007 Andrey Yuryevich Kurkov (; ; born 23 April 1961 in Leningrad, USSR) is a Ukrainian novelist and an independent thinker who writes in Russian. He is the author of 19 novels, including the bestselling Death and the Penguin, 9 books for children, and about 20 documentary, fiction and TV movie scripts. His work is currently translated into 37 languages, including English, Spanish, Japanese, French, German, Italian, Chinese, Swedish, Persian and Hebrew, and published in 65 countries. Kurkov, who has long been a respected commentator on Ukraine for the international media, notably in Europe and the United States, has written assorted articles for various publications worldwide. His books are full of black humour, post-Soviet reality and elements of surrealism. ==Life and works== Kurkov's father was a test pilot and his mother was a doctor. He started writing at the age of sevenhttps://www.thehindubusinessline.com/blink/read/interview-with-andrey- kurkov/article31307746.ece# when, after the death of two of his three pet hamsters, he wrote a poem about the loneliness of the remaining pet. He also produced poetry about Lenin, purportedly inspired by his Soviet education at the time. Having graduated from the Kiev Foreign Languages Institute, and as a trained Japanese translator Kurkov was assigned military service assisting the KGB. However, he managed to get his papers changed to service with the military police. This offered him a greater degree of freedom during and after his service period. He was assigned a prison guard position in Odessa.https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/blink/read/interview-with-andrey- kurkov/article31307746.ece# It was during this period that Kurkov wrote all of his children's stories. Kurkov's first novel was published two weeks before the fall of the Soviet Union, and in the ensuing social and political turmoil he made the first steps towards self-publishing and distribution. Borrowing money from friends to fund his work he managed to publish independently. While organising distribution around Ukraine, he would also sell copies by hand from stalls on busy streets. Like many successful writers, Kurkov had difficulty getting his first publishing contract. He reportedly received 500 rejections before being accepted, in which time he had written almost eight complete novels. In 2018 he was elected as the President of PEN Ukraine. Later in his career he won acclaim as one of the most successful Ukrainian authors in the post-Soviet era and has featured on European bestseller lists. Kurkov lives in Kievhttps://www.lovereading.co.uk/author/539/Andrey-Kurkov.html with his English wife, Elizabeth, and their three children. ==Bibliography== ;Novels translated to English {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Book name ! scope=\"col\" | ISBN ! scope=\"col\" | Publication year |- |Death and the Penguin | |2001 |- |Penguin Lost | |2005 |- |A Matter of Death and Life | |2005 |- |The Penguin Novels | |2006 |- |The Case of the General's Thumb | |2009 |- |The World of Mr Big Forehead | | |- |The President's Last Love | |2009 |- |The Good Angel of Death | |2010 |- |The Milkman in the Night | |2011 |- |The Gardener from Ochakov | |2013 |- |Ukraine Diaries: Dispatches from Kiev | |2014 |- |The Bickford Fuse | | 2016 |} ;For children *The Adventures of Baby Vacuum Cleaner Gosha * Why No One Pets The Hedgehog illustrator: Tania Goryushina, , 2012. ==References== ==External links== *ABC National Radio - A recent interview *The Ukrainian Observer: Andrey Kurkov: Ukraine's Literary Success *Freedom Lecture: Andrey Kurkov @ De Balie, Amsterdam Category:Ukrainian writers Category:People from Saint Petersburg Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Ukrainian male writers Category:Ukrainian writers in Russian ",
