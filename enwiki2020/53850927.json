Nelson was convicted of child abuse and sentenced to 20 years to life, and assessed $8,192 in various fees and restitution. Madden was convicted of attempting to patronize a prostituted child and attempted sexual assault, and received an indeterminate sentence and had to pay $4,413. Both convictions were overturned on appeal and the petitioners were considered factually innocent.
