The station is owned by the Ana G. M\u00e9ndez University System. WMTJ's studios are located in San Juan, and its transmitter is located in the El Yunque National Forest. The majority of the station's daily programming is from PBS, but it has some locally produced content as well. WMTJ has one full-service satellite: WQTO, virtual channel 40 (digital channel 19), in Ponce. WMTJ's digital signal was not on the air until a couple months before the transition deadline. Digital transmitter deployment for WMTJ had been proven difficult as the transmitter site is located in a remote tropical forest on national park land, requiring USDA Forest Service approvals of any new transmission tower. Due to damage from Hurricane Maria, WMTJ was forced to go off the air September 20, 2017 (the station's website still lists the schedule from September 11 to 17, 2017 with shows no longer on the schedule like Thomas and Friends); on October 16, the Ana G. Mendez University System announced that the station would be shut down indefinitely as part of a larger suspension of non-academic activities at the school. The shutdown left Puerto Rico without a PBS station; fellow public television station WIPR-TV (channel 6) had dropped PBS in 2011. On December 20, WMTJ returned to the air via Liberty Puerto Rico, some of PBS programming can be seen on Channel 3 & 67 and in HD on channels 203 & 267\\. On January 2, 2018, just months after the shutdown, WMTJ resumed regular over-the-air broadcasting operations via WSTE-DT (Teleisla) and can be seen on channel 40.1 from the transmitter located in Aguas Buenas remaining on the air until January 23. On January 24, WMTJ resumed operations with a reduced power of 17.7 kilowatts from El Yunque. On January 1, 2019 WMTJ returned to the air on its digital channel 15 and transmitter power increased to 174 kilowatts. The channel is no longer available on DirecTV in Puerto Rico due to unknown reasons. As of 2019, Sistema TV is one of the minority of the stations to not receive PBS' overhaul branding. ==Local Programming== * Kinema * Tertulia en la Ciudad * Aventura Cientifica * Geoambiente * Charla Deportiva ==Former local programming== * An\u00e1lisis Noticioso * Sistema TV Informa * Sistema TV Investiga * Si a la Cocina * Si a la Cultura * Sin Colores * Del Campo a la Mesa * Jugando Pelota Dura (now on Univisi\u00f3n Puerto Rico) * Bienestar * UNE Vision * Como Coco * Te Veo en Campus * Ruta U ==Digital television== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
