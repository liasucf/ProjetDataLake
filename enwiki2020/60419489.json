    "text": "Tim (stylised in all caps) is the posthumous third studio album by Swedish producer Tim Bergling, known by the stage name Avicii, released on 6 June 2019. It is his first album release following his death on 20 April 2018. It includes the single \"SOS\", which was released on 10 April 2019. It is his third studio album, serving as the follow-up to his 2015 album Stories. All profits from sales of the album will go towards the Tim Bergling Foundation, set up following Avicii's suicide, for mental health awareness. ==Background== Avicii's 3rd album was first mentioned in late 2016 after he signed with Universal Sweden, when it was said that his next album would release in 2017. From July 13 \u2013 August 2, Avicii began sharing teasers for new music and later released Av\u012bci (01) on August 11, 2017 with a total of 6 tracks. In an interview, he stated that (01) was the first of 3 EPs with the full 3rd album releasing alongside the 3rd. Recording for the album resumed in winter 2017. During March 2018, Avicii continued to share updates via Instagram and other streaming sites of different IDs and demos being put together for the album, including what would become \"Hold the Line,\" \"Bad Reputation,\" \"Tough Love,\" \"Ain't A Thing,\" and \"Fades Away,\" amongst other demos.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3rhH9LPVTc Following Avicii's death in April 2018, a representative said the following month that there were \"no plans\" to release any new material in the immediate future. In April 2019, it was announced that collaborators were enlisted to help finish the work on the album. A team of writers and producers made an album described as containing elements of \"psychedelia, Arabian music, sounds of the Caribbean and more\". The album's track listing was chosen from 16 possible songs. On 1 and 2 June 2019, fans were given a chance to listen to the album 4\u20135 days early by going to music cubes in various locations around the world. ==Singles== The first single to promote the album, \"SOS\", was released on 10 April 2019. A \"Fan Memories\" video for SOS, showing quotes from fans about the impact Avicii had on them, was released the same day. \"SOS\" debuted at number one on the singles chart in Sweden on two days of sales. \"Tough Love\" was released as the second single for the album on 9 May 2019. The music video came out on 14 May 2019. \"Tough Love\" samples A.R. Rahman's track \"Banarasiya\" from the movie Raanjhanaa (2013). \"Heaven\" was released as the third single for the album on 6 June 2019. The music video, called a \"tribute video\", which used clips of Avicii in Madagascar (following his final concert), was released on 24 June 2019. \"Fades Away\" was released as the fourth single on 5 December 2019. While the album version features vocals from Noonie Bao, the single version features vocals from Costa Rican singer MishCatt to coincide with the Avicii Tribute Concert for Mental Health Awareness where she performed it live.https://www.amazon.co.uk/Fades-Away-Tribute-Concert- Version/dp/B0824LCDKQ/ ==Critical reception== The album received mixed reviews.
