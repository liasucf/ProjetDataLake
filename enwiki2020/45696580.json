    "text": "Nerd music (or geek music) is the overall category of music collecting the musical genres that grew from nerd culture; different styles that share the same common ground. The earliest example was filk music, from the 1950s onwards, played by fans at science fiction conventions. Towards the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, other styles of music developed. Factors that made this possible were the increasing affordability of equipment, the growth of the internet and the increase in the nerd/geek demographic. ==Events and festivals== The music festival Nerdapalooza (2007\u201313) described itself as \"the first of its kind to invite all genres of the nerd music movement under one roof, including nerd rock, nerdcore hip hop, chiptunes, and video game music.\" Other conventions and events have since hosted nerd music acts of a range of styles. ==References== ==External links== * Geek Bands Wiki Category:Musical subcultures ",
