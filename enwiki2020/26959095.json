    "text": "Ireland was represented by Tina Reynolds, with the song '\"Cross Your Heart\", at the 1974 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 6 April in Brighton, England. \"Cross Your Heart\" was chosen as the Irish entry at the national final on 9 February. For the first time since joining Eurovision in 1965, broadcaster RT\u00c9 pre-selected Reynolds as their performer rather than holding a multi-artist selection. It is generally believed that this was in acknowledgement of Reynolds' co-operation with RT\u00c9 during the well-publicised controversies and disagreements which had dogged Ireland's Eurovision participation in 1973. ==Before Eurovision== === National final === The final was held at the RT\u00c9 studios in Dublin, hosted by Mike Murphy. Reynolds performed eight songs, with the winner chosen by postcard voting.ESC National Finals database 1974 {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center\" ! colspan=\"4\" |Final \u2013 10 February 1974 |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" !
