    "text": "St. Vital () is a provincial electoral division in the Canadian province of Manitoba. ==Historical riding== The original St. Vital riding was established at the time of the province's creation in 1870, as one of twelve \"francophone\" constituencies. It was eliminated in 1879, after a redistribution process which reduced the level of francophone representation in the province. ==List of provincial representatives== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
