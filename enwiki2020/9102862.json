    "text": "The Samborides () or House of Sobies\u0142aw () were a ruling dynasty in the historic region of Pomerelia. They were first documented about 1155 as governors (princeps) in the Eastern Pomeranian lands serving the royal Piast dynasty of Poland, and from 1227 ruled as autonomous princes until 1294, at which time the dynasty died out. The subsequent war for succession between the Polish Piast dynasty, the Imperial Margraviate of Brandenburg and the State of the Teutonic Order resulted in the Teutonic takeover of Gda\u0144sk (Danzig) in 1308. ==Geography== The dynasty's dominion, Pomerelia, roughly corresponded with the area of today's Pomeranian Voivodeship in northern Poland. The Samborides from 1227 used the Medieval Latin title dux Pomeraniae; their Duchy of Pomerelia was therefore referred to as \"Duchy of Pomerania\", even though there was another Duchy of Pomerania to the west, ruled by the House of Griffins, who likewise bore the title \"Dukes of Pomerania\". In Polish usage, the term Pomorze (Pomerania) tends to be associated with the entire strip of land on the Baltic coast between the Vistula river in the east and the Raksa (Recknitz) river in the west. Until the Germanic invasions, the term was used as far west as the Morini). The distinction is achieved by the use of Pomorze Gda\u0144skie (i.e., Pomerania-Danzig) for Pomerelia, and Pomorze Szczeci\u0144skie (i.e., Pomerania-Stettin) for the former Griffin duchy, to whom the title \"Duke of Pomerania\" and the term \"Duchy of Pomerania\" would be used exclusively after the Samborides' extinction. During the rule of Duke Swi\u0119tope\u0142k II, Samboride holdings spread from S\u0142upsk in the west going east across the Vistula River including \u017bu\u0142awy Gda\u0144skie, and in the south bordered the Polish dukedoms of Greater Poland and Kuyavia, the Note\u0107 river being the border. ==Origins== The Polish name \"House of Sobies\u0142aw\" derives from Duke Sobies\u0142aw I, steward for the Piast dukes of Greater Poland in Pomerelia, while \"Samborides\" as used in English and German derives from his probable son and successor, Duke Sambor I. According to traditional historiography the first certain princeps of Pomerelia was Sambor, as the records concerning Sobies\u0142aw I stems from the 15th century Oliwa chronicle of the 15th century seemed not reliable. Polish historians however do not share this reservation and have been using his father as the name for the dynasty. During the conquest of the Pomeranian lands between 1113 and 1121, the Polish duke Boles\u0142aw III Wrymouth about 1116 had installed governors ruling in the Pomerelian lands, probably the ancestors of Sobies\u0142aw I. An affiliation with the Pomeranian dukes Siemosi\u0142 and \u015awi\u0119tobor or a relation with the Polish Piast dynasty has never been conclusively established. The most important duke was Swi\u0119tope\u0142k II who in Kashubian traditional history carries the nickname \"the Great\". Swi\u0119tope\u0142k received Pomerelia as vassaldom from his suzerain, the Polish High Duke Leszek I the White of the Piast dynasty in 1216 or 1217. Perhaps acting in concert with the Piast prince W\u0142adys\u0142aw Odonic of Greater Poland he benefited from his ally action when they had High Duke Leszek I and Duke Henry I the Bearded of Silesia kidnapped and then Leszek murdered during the G\u0105sawa Piast assembly in 1227. As a result, Swi\u0119tope\u0142k declared himself an independent ruler and dux of Pomerania. Swi\u0119tope\u0142k II was the greatest military commander of the dynasty, having defeated various armies of Piast, Prussian, Danish, German and Griffite invaders during his long reign. He was the first Polish (Slavic) ruler who actively was challenged and fought military campaigns against the Teutonic Order and many times aided the pagan Prussians against the Order and Piast princes carrying crusading campaigns against them. His brothers Sambor II and Ratibor ceded some of their holdings to the Teutonic Knights allowing the Order State to get a first important foothold on the right bank of the Vistula River. Swi\u0119tope\u0142k's son and last Samboride ruler M\u00e9stwin II fought various traditional enemies, including the Teutonic Order. As a matter of necessity when fighting for his throne, he pledged feudal homage from a couple of towns to the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg by signing the Treaty of Choszczno in 1269. In 1282 he concluded an inheritance agreement at K\u0119pno with Duke Przemys\u0142 II of Greater Poland, King of Poland from 1295, who upon his death incorporated Pomerelia into the Lands of the Polish Crown. ==Samborides ancestry== #Sobies\u0142aw I (Subislaw I), princeps of Pomerelia about 1155\u20131177/79 ##Sambor I, princeps of Pomerelia 1177/79\u20131205 ###Sobies\u0142aw II (Subislaw II), died about 1217/23, under tutelage ###unidentified son, died young ##M\u00e9stwin I the Peaceful, princeps of Pomerelia 1205\u20131220 ###Miros\u0142awa, \u221e Bogislaw II, Duke of Pomerania ###Swi\u0119tope\u0142k II the Great, princeps of Pomerelia from 1220, Duke of Pomerelia at Gda\u0144sk 1227-1266 ####Euphemia, \u221e Jaromar II, Prince of Rugia ####M\u00e9stwin II, Duke of Pomerelia at \u015awiecie from 1255, last Duke of Pomerelia 1270\u20131294, \u221e Jutta, daughter of Count Dietrich I of Brehna and Wettin #####Katharina, \u221e Duke Pribislaw II of Mecklenburg-Parchim, Lord of Bia\u0142ogard #####Euphemia, \u221e Count Adolph V of Holstein-Segeberg ####John, died 1248 ####unidentified daughter, \u221e unidentified Count of Kevenberg ####Wratis\u0142aw II, Duke of Pomerelia at Gda\u0144sk 1266-1270 ###Jadwiga (Hedwig), \u221e Duke W\u0142adys\u0142aw Odonic of Greater Poland ### Witos\u0142awa, prioress of \u017bukowo Abbey ###Wratis\u0142aw I, Duke of Pomerelia at \u015awiecie 1227-1233 ###Sambor II, Duke of Pomerelia at Lubiszewo (Liebschau) 1233\u20131269, \u221e Mechthild, daughter of Prince Henry Borwin II of Mecklenburg ####Sobies\u0142aw III (Subislaw III), died 1254 ####Margaret Sambiria, \u221e King Christopher I of Denmark ####Gertrude, unmarried ####Euphemia \u221e Duke Boles\u0142aw II the Bald of Silesia ####Salome \u221e Prince Ziemomys\u0142 of Kuyavia ####Jolanta (Jolanthe) ###Ratibor, Duke of Pomerelia at Bia\u0142ogarda 1233-1262 ==See also== * List of Pomeranian duchies and dukes * House of Griffins * Gryfici (\u015awiebodzice) * Gryf coat of arms * Polabian Slavs * Polabian language ==Bibliography== * Rymar E., Rodow\u00f3d ksi\u0105\u017c\u0105t pomorskich, t. 1, Szczecin 1995; Supplement, Gda\u0144sk 2003; \u015aliwi\u0144ski B., Poczet ksi\u0105\u017c\u0105t gda\u0144skich, Gda\u0144sk 1997 Category:Polish royal houses Category:Dukes of Pomerania Category:Polish nobility ",
