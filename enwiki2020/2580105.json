    "text": "93 'til Infinity is the debut album by Souls of Mischief. It was released on September 28, 1993 by Jive. ==Composition== The sound of 93 'til Infinity is characteristic of the distinct style explored by the collective, including a rhyme scheme based on internal rhyme and beats centered around a live bass and obscure jazz and funk samples. 93 'til Infinity was released during a period in which the collective released several critically acclaimed albums (including Del tha Funkee Homosapien's No Need for Alarm and Casual's Fear Itself) and rose to national prominence. 93 'til Infinity met commercial success with its title track and lead single, which reached #72 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also featured singles \"That's When Ya Lost\" and \"Never No More\" which reached the Hot Rap Singles but never charted on The Billboard Hot 100. According to Allmusic author Steve Huey, \"Although the title cut is an underappreciated classic, 93 'til Infinity makes its greatest impression through its stunning consistency, not individual highlights.\" Huey also goes on to remark that 93 'til Infinity is \"one of the most slept-on records of the '90s\". ==Reception== 93 'til Infinity was critically acclaimed for its subject matter, production, and rapping. Although it was not as popular as other West Coast hip hop albums at the time of its release, it received positive acclaim. Suzann Vogel of Philadelphia Weekly praised it: Steve Huey of AllMusic also gives 93 'til Infinity much praise, calling it \"the best single album to come out of Oakland's Hieroglyphics camp\" as well as saying how Souls of Mischief \"completely redefined the art of lyrical technique for the West Coast.\" In 1998, the album was selected as one of The Sources 100 Best Rap Albums. The title track was also included on the compilation remix album Another Late Night: Zero 7, released in 2002. ==Track listing== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|# ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Title ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|Producer(s) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Performer(s) |- |1 |\"Let 'Em Know\" |Domino | *First verse: Opio *Second verse: Tajai *Third verse: A-Plus *Fourth verse: Phesto |- |2 |\"Live and Let Live\" |Domino | *First verse: Opio *Second verse: Tajai *Third verse: A-Plus *Chorus: Phesto |- |3 |\"That's When Ya Lost\" |Del the Funky Homosapien | *First verse: Tajai *Second verse: Phesto *Chorus: Pep Love *Third verse: A-Plus *Fourth verse: Opio |- |4 |\"A Name I Call Myself\" |Del the Funky Homosapien | *First/seventh verse: A-Plus *Second/eighth verse: Tajai *Third/fifth verse: Opio *Fourth/sixth verse: Phesto |- |5 |\"Disseshowedo\" |Domino, Jay Biz | *First verse: Tajai *Second verse: A-Plus *Third verse: Phesto *Fourth verse: Opio |- |6 |\"What a Way to Go Out\" |A-Plus | *First verse: Phesto *Second verse: A-Plus *Third verse: Tajai *Fourth verse: Opio |- |7 |\"Never No More\" |A-Plus | *First verse: Tajai *Second verse: Phesto *Third verse: A-Plus *Fourth verse: Opio |- |8 |\"93 'til Infinity\" |A-Plus | *First/eighth/eleventh verse: Opio *Second/fifth/twelfth verse: A-Plus *Third/seventh/tenth verse: Tajai *Fourth/sixth/ninth verse: Phesto |- |9 |\"Limitations\" |Jay Biz | *First verse: Opio *Second verse: A-Plus *Chorus: Del the Funky Homosapien *Third verse: Tajai *Fourth verse: Casual |- |10 |\"Anything Can Happen\" |A-Plus | *First verse: Tajai *Second verse: Opio *Third verse: Phesto *Fourth verse: A-Plus |- |11 |\"Make Your Mind Up\" |Del the Funky Homosapien | *First verse: A-Plus *Second verse: Opio *Third verse: Tajai |- |12 |\"Batting Practice\" |Casual | *First verse: A-Plus *Second verse: Tajai *Third verse: Opio *Fourth verse: Phesto |- |13 |\"Tell Me Who Profits\" |Domino | *First verse: A-Plus *Second verse: Phesto, Opio *Third verse: Tajai |- |14 |\"Outro\" |Domino | *Souls of Mischief |} ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"| Year !rowspan=\"2\"| Album !colspan=\"2\"| Peak position |- !
