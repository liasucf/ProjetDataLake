It is also a common house plant in cooler climes. King Boudewijn of Belgium was a big devotee of Medinilla. He grew them in the royal conservatories and they were depicted on the bank note of 10,000 Belgian francs.http://www.medinilla.ca/ In temperate zones this plant must be grown under protection all year round, as it does not tolerate temperatures below .
