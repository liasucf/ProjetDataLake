Both Roneys have mouth-watering tones and spin long fluent lines with imperious logic, and their working rhythm sections are fluid and spacious. Add in passing references to hip-hop, strong musical personalities and potent writing ... and a classic tradition springs to life\".Hobart, M. Financial Time Review, April 7, 2012, accessed April 28, 2020 In The Observer, Dave Gelly noted \"No one could call these eight numbers easy listening but they have a concentrated power and moments of quite devastating boldness and originality\".Gelly, D. The Observer Review, April 22, 2012, accessed April 28, 2020 JazzTimes', Philip Booth wrote: \"Old-school funk and fusion? Contemporary R&B;? Straight-ahead jazz? Open-air modal music? ... Roney, joined by his regular bandmates and several guests, touches on several of the stylistic strains mentioned above on Home. It\u2019s chockfull of the leader\u2019s dazzling displays, including the long tones and then quick runs .. there is never a dull moment\".Booth, P.
