    "text": "Water tower in Volkspark Jungfernheide Jungfernheide is a former forest and heathland located in Berlin in the present-day district of Charlottenburg- Nord, a locality of the borough of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf. The Volkspark Jungfernheide (Jungfernheidepark) is located within the former Jungfernheide. With the creation of Greater Berlin in 1920, Charlottenburg was joined with the former districts of Heerstra\u00dfe and Jungfernheide to become the seventh district of Berlin. == Name == Memorial to Karl Ludwig Friedrich von Hinckeldey in the Volkspark Jungfernheide The name of the area is a combination of the word Heide, meaning heath, and Jungfer, meaning \"Young noblewoman\" or \"damsel\" (cf. Junker), from the Benedictine convent that existed in Spandau from 1269 until the 16th century and owned the area. The street Nonnendamm also relates to the nuns of Spandau. == History == === Forest and hunting grounds === The forest and heathland located east of Spandau were used as a royal hunting ground until 1800. In 1823, the forest areas of Charlottenburg and Tegel were designated as an estate (Gutsbezirk). === Military use === Beginning in 1824, the Jungfernheide was used for military drills and shooting grounds. In 1828, the Reinickendorf artillery grounds were relocated here by Frederick William III of Prussia. Barracks were constructed between 1896 and 1901 for the airshipmen battalion Luftschiffer- Batallion Berlin-Jungfernheide.Detailed plans for the airship battalion in the archives of the Architecture Museum of the Technical University of Berlin === Transit connections === The railway station Berlin Jungfernheide station was opened in 1877. In this year, the western section of the Berlin Ringbahn was also completed, which was primarily built for military purposes. S-train service between Jungfernheide and the Berlin Sonnenallee station stopped from 1980 until 1997 due in part to the Berlin Wall. Since reopening, Jungfernheide has served as an important junction in the northwest of Berlin, offering transfers between the Ringbahn, the U7 (Berlin U-Bahn), regional trains, local and express buses to the nearby Tegel Airport. Tegel Airport was built after World War II in the heathland of the Jungfernheide. === Water supply === In 1896, the Jungfernheide waterworks were opened, providing drinking water from Lake Tegel. The plant has been mothballed since 2001. == Jungfernheidepark == Volkspark Jungfernheide with view of the water tower The Volkspark Jungfernheide is located on of land between the Berlin-Spandau Ship Canal and the Heckerdamm, and is bounded to the West by the Jungfernheideweg and to the East by Bundesautobahn 111\\. == References == Category:Pages translated from German Wikipedia Category:Parks in Berlin ",
