    "text": "This Is America, Charlie Brown is an eight-part animated television miniseries that depicts a series of events in American history featuring characters from the Charles M. Schulz comic strip Peanuts. It aired from 1988 to 1989 on CBS. The first four episodes aired as a weekly series in October and November 1988; the final four episodes aired monthly from February to May 1989. Due to the nature of the events portrayed and the historical figures included \u2014 such as the Wright Brothers and George Washington \u2014 many adults were shown in full view along with the Peanuts gang, something that happened rarely in the animated films and specials and in only one early sequence in the comic strip. These adults were drawn in a style similar to It's Only a Game, another comic strip by Schulz that featured adults, as well other productions that were overseen by Peanuts regular Bill Melendez. The series as a whole was not rerun after its initial airing. One episode, \"The Mayflower Voyagers,\" returned to television in 2008 (and has aired each year since) as companion material to pad the 1973 special A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving to a full one-hour time slot. To accommodate the slot, portions of the episode are abridged. ==Music== The series included music by many composers and performers including Peanuts regular Ed Bogas, Dave Brubeck, David Benoit (who would later take over scoring the specials starting with It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown), George Winston, Wynton Marsalis and Dave Grusin. This continued a tradition of using jazz musicians for the musical score; original composer Vince Guaraldi had died in 1976, though several of his music scores were reused, notably his signature tune, \"Linus and Lucy\". This miniseries featured The Winans, Desir\u00e9e Goyette, and Lou Rawls as the singing vocals (Goyette and Rawls had previously worked with Melendez on the Garfield TV specials). ==Cast== ===Regular voice actors=== *Erin Chase: Charlie Brown (first female actress to voice Charlie Brown) *Erica Gayle: Lucy van Pelt *Brittany M.
