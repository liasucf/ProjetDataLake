The resolution states that this was as a result of the lack of unanimity of its permanent members at the council's 834th and 837th meetings which prevented it from exercising its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. ==See also== *List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 101 to 200 (1953\u20131965) ==References== *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org ==External links== * 0129 0129 0129 Category:1958 in Lebanon Category:1958 in Jordan Category:August 1958 events ",
