He is best known for being the concept creator and Director of Scribblenauts as well as the million-seller hit video game Drawn to Life and 5TH Cell's critically acclaimed Lock's Quest, all for the Nintendo DS. Jeremiah is credited as the Director, Lead Designer, Story Writer, Original Concept Creator and Art Director for both Drawn to Life and Lock's Quest. Scribblenauts was the first handheld game ever to win a \"Best of Show Overall\" award (across all platforms) at E3 from IGN, GameSpot and GameSpy. Drawn to Life has since gone on to spawn a franchise involving one sequel, accompanied by a Wii console version, all three titles published by THQ. His previous works for 5th Cell were in mobile games, using both original and licensed work. In 2000, Jeremiah, along with Joseph M. Tringali (co-founder and General Manager of 5TH Cell), co-founded Epix Interactive Studios, a video game developer, in Chicago, Illinois, that was developing Fate, the first announced MMORPG for Microsoft's original Xbox. The project was canceled and the studio shut down in late 2001. == Works == Credited as Director and/or Lead Designer *Mini Poccha (2003) (Mobile): THQ - Additionally credited as: Art Director, Original Concept Creator *Siege (2003) (Mobile): THQ - Additionally credited as: Art Director, Original Concept Creator *SEAL Team 6 (2003) (Mobile): THQ - Additionally credited as: Art Director, Original Concept Creator *Moto GP Manager (2006) (Mobile): THQ *Full Spectrum Warrior: Mobile (2006) (Mobile): THQ *D.N.A (2006) (PC): Merscom - Additionally credited as: Art Director, Original Concept Creator *Drawn to Life (2007) (Nintendo DS): THQ - Additionally credited as: Original Story, Art Director, Original Concept Creator *Lock's Quest (2008) (Nintendo DS): THQ - Additionally credited as: Original Story, Art Director, Original Concept Creator *Drawn to Life: The Next Chapter (2009) (Nintendo DS): THQ - Additionally credited as: Written by and Original Concept Creator *Scribblenauts (2009) (Nintendo DS): Warner Bros.
