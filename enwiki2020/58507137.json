It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. ==History== Edwin Trump was the President of the Trump & Wilmot Bank. He built this house in 1867, reportedly as part of a contest between Trump and his partner, George Wilmot, to see who could build the most lavish home. In 1872, Trump traded the house to local attorney A. U. Wood for a business block in downtown Fenton. ==Description== The Edwin Trump House is a two-story, wood-framed Gothic Revival structure built in a T-shape with multiple gables and dormers. It has a decorative open porch, containing Gothic ornamentation in its bargeboards, which match the bargeboards in the eaves of the gables. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Genesee County, Michigan Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Michigan Category:Houses completed in 1867 ",
