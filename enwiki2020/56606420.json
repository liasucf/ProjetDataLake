    "text": "The 2018 National Women's Soccer League season was the sixth season of the National Women's Soccer League, the top division of women's soccer in the United States. Including the NWSL's two professional predecessors, Women's Professional Soccer (2009\u20132011) and the Women's United Soccer Association (2001\u20132003), it was the twelfth overall season of FIFA and USSF-sanctioned top division women's soccer in the United States. The league is operated by the United States Soccer Federation and receives major financial backing from that body. Further financial backing is provided by the Canadian Soccer Association. Both national federations pay the league salaries of many of their respective national team members in an effort to nurture talent in those nations and take the financial burden off individual clubs. The off-season brought significant changes, with FC Kansas City and the Boston Breakers ceasing operations, while new club Utah Royals FC joined the league. The 2018 season began on March 24, and ended on September 8. Teams once again played 24 regular-season games this year, with the top four teams making a single- elimination playoff. The North Carolina Courage won the NWSL Shield with 15 more points than second place Thorns. The NWSL Playoffs began on September 15 with the two semifinal matches, which were won by the Thorns and the Courage. The NWSL Championship Game was held on September 22 at Providence Park in Portland. The Courage won 3\u20130, becoming the first team to win both the NWSL Shield and the NWSL Championship in the same season. == Teams, stadiums, and personnel == === Stadiums and locations === Two teams, the Dash and Reign, do not make their stadiums' entire capacity available for home games, instead restricting ticket sales at a lower level.

If two or more teams tie in point total, when determining rank and playoff qualification and seeding, the NWSL uses the following tiebreaker rules, going down the list until all teams are ranked. # Head to Head win/loss record between the teams (or points-per-game if more than two teams). # Greater goal difference across the entire season (against all teams, not just tied teams). # Greatest total number of goals scored (against all teams). # Apply #1\u20133 to games played on the road. # Apply #1\u20133 to games played at home. # If teams are still equal, ranking will be determined by a coin toss. NOTE: If two clubs remain tied after another club with the same number of points advances during any step, the tie breaker reverts to step 1 of the two-club format. ==Attendance== ===Average home attendances=== Ranked from highest to lowest average attendance. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;text-align: center;\" |- !Team ! ! ! ! ! |- | Portland Thorns FC || 12 || 203,506 || bgcolor=\"#98fb98\" | 21,144 || bgcolor=\"#98fb98\" | 14,485 || bgcolor=\"#98fb98\" | 16,959 |- | Utah Royals FC || 12 || 113,593 || 19,203 || 7,137 || 9,466 |- | North Carolina Courage || 12 || 61,549 || 9,505 || 3,011 || 5,129 |- | Orlando Pride || 12 || 58,046 || 9,017 || 3,104 || 4,837 |- | Chicago Red Stars || 12 || 48,048 || 13,678 || 2,027 || 4,004 |- | Washington Spirit || 12 || 46,704 || 7,976 || 2,433 || 3,892 |- | Seattle Reign FC || 12 || 45,885 || 5,251 || 3,172 || 3,824 |- | Houston Dash || 12 || 42,859 || 5,846 || 2,376 || 3,572 |- | Sky Blue FC || 12 || 30,372 || bgcolor=\"#ffc0cb\" | 4,086 || bgcolor=\"#ffc0cb\" | 1,913 || bgcolor=\"#ffc0cb\" | 2,531 |- !
