    "text": "Psychographics is a qualitative methodology used to describe traits of humans on psychological attributes. Psychographics have been applied to the study of personality, values, opinions, attitudes, interests, and lifestyles. Because this area of research focuses on activities, interests, and opinions, psychographic factors are sometimes abbreviated to 'AIO variables'. Psychographics are applied to the study of cognitive attributes such as attitudes, interests, opinions, and belief, as well as the study of overt behavior (e.g., activities). Psychographic studies of individuals or communities can be valuable in the fields of marketing, demographics, opinion research, prediction, and social research in general. Psychographic attributes can be contrasted with demographic variables (such as age and gender), behavioral variables (such as purchase data or usage rate), and organizational descriptors (sometimes called firmographic variables), such as industry, number of employees, and functional area. Psychographic methods gained prominence in the 2016 US presidential election and the opposing campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, with the latter using them extensively in microtargeting advertisements to narrow constituencies. ==Psychographic profiling== When a relatively complete profile of a person or group's psychographic make-up is constructed, this is called a \"psychographic profile\". Psychographic profiles are used in market segmentation as well as in advertising. Some categories of psychographic factors used in market segmentation include: * activity, interest, opinion (AIOs) * attitudes *values * behavior Psychographic can also be seen as an equivalent of the concept of \"culture\" when it is used for segmentation at a national level. ==Comparison to demographics== Psychographics is often confused with demographics, where historical generations may be defined both by demographics, such as the years in which a particular generation is born or even the fertility rates of that generation's parents, but also by psychographic variables like attitudes, personality formation, and cultural touchstones. For example, the traditional approaches to defining the Baby Boom Generation or Generation X or Millennials have relied on both demographic variables (classifying individuals based on birth years) and psychographic variables (such as beliefs, attitudes, values and behaviors). Infusionsoft published an article arguing that customer psychographic segmentation is more useful than demographic information. ==See also== *Attitudinal targeting *Behavior modification *Behavioral targeting *Black propaganda *Brainwashing *Consumer analytics *Consumer intelligence *Demographic targeting *Disinformation *Freedom of choice *Geo-targeting *Geodemographic segmentation *Market analysis *Market research *Market segmentation *Marketing *Microsegment *Misinformation *Political warfare *Project MKUltra *Propaganda *Psychometrics *Psychological warfare *Positioning (marketing) *Product differentiation *Segmenting and positioning *Serviceable available market *Subliminal advertising *Targeted advertising *Target audience *Total addressable market *Values Modes ==References== ==External links== * www.netmba.com/marketing/market/segmentation * www.strategicbusinessinsights.com/vals/ustypes.shtml * Lee and Psychography, appendix to Lee the American by Gamaliel Bradford * How to Use Psychographic Data in Online Marketing, by Susan Gilbert Category:Market research Category:Market segmentation Category:Marketing research Category:Political campaign techniques Category:Psychometrics Category:Quantitative marketing research Category:Social research ",
