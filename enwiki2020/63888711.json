    "text": "The Rivi\u00e8re aux Outardes (English: Bustard River) is a tributary of the Chateauguay River. It crosses the municipalities of Hinchinbrooke and Ormstown, in the Le Haut-Saint-Laurent Regional County Municipality, in the administrative region of Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie, in the province of Quebec, in Canada. The surface of the rivi\u00e8re aux Outardes (except the rapids areas) is generally frozen from the beginning of December to the end of March; however, safe circulation on the ice is generally done from the end of December to the beginning of March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation; the spring flood occurs in March or April. == Geography == The main neighboring hydrographic slopes are: * north side: Chateauguay River; * east side: Chateauguay River, Smith Creek; * south side: Rivi\u00e8re aux Outardes Est; * west side: Cluff Creek, Trout River. The course of the \"Rivi\u00e8re aux Outardes\" begins at the confluence of several agricultural streams north of the hamlet Athelstan, east of the Trout River, southeast of the village of Huntingdon, north of the border between Canada and the United States, and south of the route 202. The Rivi\u00e8re aux Outardes flows for 11.8 km to the mouth of the Rivi\u00e8re aux Outardes Est, in Hinchinbrooke; then 6.4 km to its mouth. The Outardes River flows northeast in agricultural areas, more or less in parallel (south side) of Ch\u00e2teauguay River, and gradually approaching it. The confluence of these two rivers is located 270 m upstream from the route 138 bridge spanning the Ch\u00e2teauguay River and 0.8 km upstream from the village bridge of Ormstown spanning the Chateauguay River. The \"Chemin de la rivi\u00e8re aux Outardes\" runs along the Rivi\u00e8re aux Outardes (on the south side), between Mont\u00e9e Rockburn and the mouth. The river segment between the \"Rivi\u00e8re aux Outardes Est\" and the mouth, has six rapids zones. == Toponymy == The toponym \"Rivi\u00e8re aux Outardes\" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec.Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec - Bank of place names - Place name: \"Rivi\u00e8re aux Outardes\". == References == == See also == * Chateauguay River, a stream * Rivi\u00e8re aux Outardes Est, a stream * Ormstown, a municipality * Hinchinbrooke, a municipality * Le Haut-Saint- Laurent Regional County Municipality * List of rivers of Quebec Category:Rivers of Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie Category:Le Haut-Saint-Laurent Regional County Municipality ",
