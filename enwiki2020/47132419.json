It has its source in the Trollheimen mountains on the border of the municipality of Surnadal in M\u00f8re og Romsdal county and the municipality of Oppdal in Tr\u00f8ndelag county. The river heads northwards and, for a time, it forms the border between M\u00f8re og Romsdal and Tr\u00f8ndelag counties. Two reservoirs lie along the course of the river: Lake Fold ( or Follsj\u00f8) and Gray Lake (). The Folda has a catchment area of and is fed by several tributaries: the Rinna, Bulu, and Vind\u00f8la.
