A. Coquerel, as editor of Le Lien, a post which he held till 1870. In 1852 he took part in establishing the Nouvelle Revue de th\u00e9ologie, the first periodical of scientific theology published in France, and in the same year helped to found the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'histoire du protestantisme fran\u00e7ais (Historical Society of French Protestantism). Meanwhile, Coquerel had gained a reputation as a preacher, and especially as the advocate of religious freedom; but his teaching offended to the orthodox party, and on the appearance (1864) of his article on Renan's Vie de J\u00e9sus in the Nouvelle Revue de th\u00e9ologie he was forbidden by the Paris consistory to continue his ministerial functions. He received an address of sympathy from the consistory of Anduze, and a provision was voted for him by the Union Protestante Lib\u00e9rale, to enable him to continue his preaching. He received the cross of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1862. Coquerel died in Fismes (Marne). ==Works== Coquerel's major works were Jean Calas et sa famille (1858); Des Beaux-Arts en Italie (Eng. trans. 1859 by Emily and Edward Higginson); La Saint-Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my (1860); Pr\u00e9cis de l'Eglise r\u00e9form\u00e9e (1862); Le Catholicisme et le protestantisme consid\u00e9r\u00e9s dans leur origine et leur d\u00e9veloppement (1864); Libres \u00e9tudes, and La Conscience et la foi (1867). ==References== ==External links== * Category:1820 births Category:1875 deaths Category:French Protestant theologians Category:19th-century Protestant theologians Category:19th-century French theologians ",
