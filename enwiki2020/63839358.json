    "text": "Wildlife Messengers is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with the purpose of making scientific and educational films, photographs, and audio recordings to promote nature conservation, mainly in countries with lower industrial bases, and to distribute them to national and international audiences. The targeted audiences include government authorities, elementary and middle schools, local indigenous communities, and non-governmental organizations. The organization was started in 2017, after the founding scientists recognized the need for a stronger connection between academic research and public outreach, and a scientific input from nature conservation to filmmaking. Evaluating and publishing the impact of conservation films are among the goals of the non- profit. == History == Before the establishment of Wildlife Messengers, all three co-founders had experiences with connecting media and conservation. They realized that there is a bridge between the scientific work and active conservation activities. Knowledge from scientific research should be conveyed not only to other scientists but also to general audiences and to decision makers in an understandable way. The first common project by Cintia Garai and George Olah was The Macaw Project documentary. This film was translated into many languages (including Spanish, Portuguese, German, Polish, Hungarian), screened in many different countries, and gained much public attention. Through recognizing the power of scientific documentaries and photography, and the effect each has on the broader public, and grounded on their common interest in wildlife conservation using scientific tools and the power of media, Cintia Garai, George Olah, and Robert Carrubba established the non- profit corporation Wildlife Messengers in 2017. == Principles == Wildlife Messengers has the following code of conduct: * CHOOSING \u2018THE RIGHT\u2019 PROJECTS Film projects are chosen based on their importance for conservation and whether a resultant film can actually contribute to decision making and protection. Many of the projects take place in countries with lower industrial bases and concern topics that are not considered \u2018profitable\u2019 by mainstream media. * SCIENTIFIC APPROACH When starting a project, thorough scientific background research is always conducted by reviewing the latest academic and environmental literature surrounding the topic, and by liaising with experts, local communities, decision makers, and other organizations. The aim is to understand as many aspects of a project's contexts as possible. * COMMUNICATIVE CONSERVATION APPROACH The chosen projects are most in need of urgent conservation actions. The aim is to engage and educate viewers about facts and possible solutions surrounding these topics. Films need communicate the conservation facts interestingly. * INCLUSION OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES The participation of local communities is always prioritized during the preparation, filming, and postproduction stages of a project. Collaborative capacity building is one of the goals because it is the local communities that are the most impacted by conservation issues and decisions and their acts affect nature conservation in a direct way. * TOPIC-APPROPRIATE FILMOGRAPHY To transmit the messages of local conservation issues, modern filming techniques are used to deliver great video quality, while videos taken by local people are also advocated. There are times when local footage obtained from a cell phone camera fits the goals better than arriving with a film crew. The aim is to document, but to not disturb. * TARGETING AUDIENCES Messages are targeted and tailored to specific audiences, be it local communities, students, NGOs, or decision makers. The motivation and knowledge of an audience are considered, and also the message hoped to convey. When appropriate, different versions of a film are made to reach different audiences. == References == Category:501(c)(3) organizations Category:Environmental organizations based in the United States ",
