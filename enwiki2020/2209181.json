They were operated by Network SouthEast until 1996, and then by Connex South Eastern until 2003, South Eastern Trains until 2006 and Southeastern to the present day. ==History== Connex South Eastern 465034 in Network SouthEast livery at in July 2003 Connex South Eastern 465020 in Connex livery at Waterloo East in January 2003 South Eastern Trains 465238 at in December 2005 The Network SouthEast sector of British Rail began the planning for the development of the Class 465 Networker in 1988, and invited a tender for 710 of the units to be built.Classes 465 and 466 - Welcome to the Southern E-Group Web Site.

They are mostly used on suburban routes out of London Victoria, Charing Cross, Blackfriars and Cannon Street to destinations in South London and Kent.Our trains Southeastern ==Two manufacturers== The easiest way to tell the two makes apart: The BREL unit on the right features air vents above the windows whilst the Metro Cammell unit on the left does not. Both manufacturers' units look similar in design; the major differences are the lack of aircraft-style overhead air vents on those produced by Metro-Cammell (465/2), and the BREL (465/0) and ABB (465/1) units also feature slightly different dot matrix displays on the front and rear of the train to show the route number and destination, they also have different traction motors with the BREL units having Brush Traction motors whilst the Metro Cammell units have their own traction motors. There are other minor differences in door switches and audible chimes, window shapes and exterior panelling.

A Solid State Traction Converter package controls 3-phase AC Traction motors, which allows for Rheostatic or Regenerative Dynamic braking. Primary braking system is electro-pneumatically actuated disc brakes, which is blended with the Dynamic brakes. Tachometers on every axle of the unit provide for Wheel Slip/Slide Protection. ==Traction equipment replacement== Plans were drawn up in 2007 to improve reliability of the BREL and ABB units (Class 465/0 and 465/1) by the installation of new traction equipment. The new package was developed by Hitachi Rail.Networkers to get Hitachi traction package The Railway Magazine issue 1275 July 2007 page 77 It was retrofitted across all 97 465/0 and 465/1s trains over the course of 2009/2010.Class 465 traction upgrade in full flow The Railway Magazine issue 1304 December 2009 page 79 Brush Traction, the supplier/manufacturer of the original traction equipment, worked as consultants to assist in retro-fitting the new equipment.Networkers get a traction transplant Railway Gazette International 24 January 2008Class 465 Trains With New Hitachi Traction Drive Handed Back to Southeastern as Scheduled Hitachi Rail 30 April 2009 ==Refurbishment== Some Class 465/2 EMUs were given a 'Networker Weald' refresh - one of those treated was 465907 at The interior of the First Class compartment, located in each DMCO vehicle at both front and rear of the train.

They would be replaced on inner suburban services by Class 376s.
