He was also on the books of Sheffield Wednesday, but never played for them in the League. Teammate Baden Powell described him as \"a lanky, tricky sort of player\": After a transfer request produced no offers, Galley joined the police. Galley's younger brothers Maurice and John Galley also played in the Football League. ==References== Category:1930 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Worksop Category:English footballers Category:Association football wingers Category:Sheffield Wednesday F.C. players Category:Darlington F.C. players Category:English Football League players ",
