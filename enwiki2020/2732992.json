S\u00f8rensen in 1907 S\u00f8rensen Biochem Z., 7, 45, 407 1907 is a titration of an amino acid with potassium hydroxide in the presence of formaldehyde.Harry Auterhoff: Lehrbuch der Pharmazeutischen Chemie, 5. Aufl., Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft mbH Stuttgart, 1968. It is used in the determination of protein content in samples.Analytical Chemistry of Foods C.S. James Springer Science & Business Media, 2013Formol titration equation for amino acids in general If instead of an amino acid an ammonium salt is used the reaction product with formaldehyde is hexamethylenetetramine: :\\mathrm{4\\ NH_4^+\\ +\\ 6\\ HCHO\\ +\\ 4\\ H_2O\\longrightarrow\\ (CH_2)_6N_4 +\\ 6\\ H_2O\\ +\\ 4\\ H_3O^+} The liberated hydrochloric acid is then titrated with the base and the amount of ammonium salt used can be determined. With an amino acid the formaldehyde reacts with the amino group to form a methylene amino (R-N=CH2) group. The remaining acidic carboxylic acid group can then again be titrated with base. ==In winemaking== Formol titration is one of the methods used in winemaking to measure yeast assimilable nitrogen needed by wine yeast in order to successfully complete fermentation.B. Zoecklein, K. Fugelsang, B. Gump, F. Nury Wine Analysis and Production pgs 152\u2013163, 340\u2013343, 444\u2013445, 467 Kluwer Academic Publishers, New York (1999) == Accuracy in formol titration == Formol titration equation for prolineThere has been some inaccuracies of the SFT caused by the differences in the basicity of the nitrogen in different amino acids which were explained by S. L. Jodidi. For instances, proline(an imino acid), histidine, and lysine yields too low values compared to the theory. Unlike alpha, monobasic (containing one amino group per molecule) amino acids, these amino (or imino) acids' nitrogens have inconstant basicity, which results in partial reaction with formaldehyde.S. L. Jodidi \"Abnormalities In the Formol Titration Method\" Journal of American Chemical Society 1918 40 (7), 1031-1035 DOI: 10.1021/ja02240a006 In case of tyrosine, the actual results are too high due to the negative hydroxyl group (-OH), which acts as a base. This explanation is supported by the fact that phenylalanine can be accurately titrated.
