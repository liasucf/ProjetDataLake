Bucharest: Editura Geneze, 2004. He came from a Jewish family but converted to Christianity during his university days. During the subsequent decades he lived in Romania, he neither discussed his Jewish background nor adopted an attitude suggesting a rejection of Jewishness.Nicolae Cajal, Hary Kuller, Contribu\u021bia evreilor din Rom\u00e2nia la cultur\u0103 \u0219i civiliza\u021bie, p. 242.

He worked as a doctor in Olteni\u021ba from 1858 to 1859 and in Muscel County from 1859 to 1861. His talent was noticed by Carol Davila, who invited Felix to Bucharest to teach hygienics and public health at the recently established national school of medicine and pharmacy, beginning with the 1861-1862 school year.E. Aburel, Inv\u0103\u021b\u0103m\u00eentul medical \u0219i farmaceutic din Bucure\u0219ti, p. 245.

In 1877-1878, during the Romanian War of Independence, he served as a combat medic, organizing military hospitals in the Turnu M\u0103gurele area.

In 1884, he was vice president of the country's first physicians' congress. In 1898, and again from 1902 to 1904, he was vice president of the Academy's scientific section. In 1884, he was sent into the army reserves with the rank of colonel. Felix is considered the founder of Romania's school of hygiene and public health, a reputation he acquired during his lifetime. He led one of Europe's first hygiene departments and authored the first epidemiology textbook based on Pasteurian principles. ==Notes== Category:1832 births Category:1905 deaths Category:People from Ho\u0159ice (Ji\u010d\u00edn District) Category:People from the Kingdom of Bohemia Category:Czech Jews Category:Converts to Christianity from Judaism Category:Austro-Hungarian emigrants to Romania Category:Naturalised citizens of Romania Category:Romanian people of Czech-Jewish descent Category:Romanian obstetricians Category:Hygienists Category:Romanian military doctors Category:Romanian textbook writers Category:University of Vienna alumni Category:University of Bucharest faculty Category:Titular members of the Romanian Academy Category:Romanian military personnel of the Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878) ",
