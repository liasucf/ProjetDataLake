Mema enjoyed great success there, playing with footballers such as Refik Resmja and Panajot Pano, winning the championship three times and the Republic Cup twice . In 1965, at his father's request, Mema, who at that time was Partizani's most paid player, made a sensational return to 17 N\u00ebntori winning four championships , whom he stayed until 1971, the year in which he decided to end his career. He was able to play with his brother Ali in his second spell, helping the club to win three more league titles. ==Style of play== In his prime, Mema was noted for his acceleration, speed, stamina and work rate. He played as a Defensive midfielder, but nevertheless he also tended to make runs forward, which also made him an attacking threat. ==Personal life== Osman was part of Mema dynasty, a family which has produced several footballers throughout the years. His brothers Haxhi and Ali were both footballers, as well as his nephew and Haxhi's son Sulejman, and Ali's son Ardian, who was also a footballer who played mostly for Tirana and is currently its coach. ==References== ==External links== *Profile at Football Database Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Tirana Category:Albanian footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:KF Tirana players Category:FK Partizani Tirana players Category:Albanian Superliga players ",
