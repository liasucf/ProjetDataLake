    "text": "Charles W. Carter (1870\u20131961) was a Canadian-born mortician and politician in the U.S. territory of Alaska. Carter served as the eighth mayor of Juneau, Alaska, from 1913 to 1914. He was a citizen of Alaska by 1901. In 1947, along with Henry Roden and David Gross, he persuaded the Alaska Territorial Legislature to rename the Pioneers Trust Fund, a regional fund for elderly citizens, to the Pioneer Memorial Fund. Outside politics he owned and operated a funeral home, the Charles W. Carter Mortuary, which he founded in 1916. Charles Charter is buried in Evergreen Cemetery, in Juneau. Carter sold the mortuary business in 1950, which continued to bear his name. The business was acquired by the Fairbanks-based Alaskan Memorial Parks, Inc. in 1964. ==References== ==External links== * Biography at Juneau-Douglas City Museum Category:1870 births Category:1962 deaths Category:Businesspeople from Alaska Category:Funeral directors Category:Mayors of Juneau, Alaska Category:Burials at Evergreen Cemetery (Juneau, Alaska) ",
