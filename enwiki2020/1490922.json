He has lived in Runcorn for the majority of his life, except for the five years he spent in Singapore when his father, Barry Whitbread, was the coach of the Singapore national football team during the late 1990s. While in Singapore, Whitbread attended St Stephen's School and then United World College of South East Asia. ==Club career== ===Liverpool=== While growing up in Runcorn, Whitbread was a fan of Manchester United, but because Liverpool was his father's team of choice, he joined the club's Centre of Excellence at the age of eight, and eventually worked his way through the Academy from under-15s through under-19s before joining the reserve team in 2003. His first match in a Liverpool jersey took place in 2003 in an exhibition match against Thailand during the club's Far East Tour. He came on to the pitch after the start of the second half, replacing Neil Mellor. Whitbread made his first team debut in the 2004\u201305 season, and played a number of games alongside Sami Hyypi\u00e4 in Liverpool's 2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League qualification campaign. He spent much of the season on loan at Millwall. ===Millwall=== After signing for Millwall permanently on a three-year contract in June 2006, he featured frequently in the team's first eleven, starting 18 games for his new club in the 2006\u201307 season, before injuring himself in September 2006. The injury sidelined him for the rest of that season.Millwall FC Over the course of the 2008\u201309 season, Whitbread made 44 appearances, including the League One play-off Final at Wembley Stadium, which Millwall lost 3\u20132 to Scunthorpe United. ===Norwich City=== Whitbread signed for Norwich City on a -year contract on January 8, 2010, making his debut in the 5\u20130 win over Colchester United on January 16 as a substitute for Chris Martin, but featured little thereafter due to an injury. Whitbread was given squad number 6 ahead of the 2010\u201311 season, switching from 31. He played 3 games in pre- season 2010\u201311 before he sustained another injury, which ruled him out of the start of the new league season. Whitbread was expected to return to training near the time of the international break in September, however a further setback kept him out until the new Year. Whitbread returned to full training near Christmas 2010, along with Adam Drury. He made his long-awaited return from injury in a 4\u20132 win over Sheffield United on December 28, 2010, coming on as an 85th-minute substitute for Anthony McNamee. He made his first start of the season in a 1\u20130 victory over league leaders Queens Park Rangers, helping Norwich to a first clean sheet in 10 games. Due to Leon Barnett's hamstring injury, Whitbread developed a centre back partnership with Elliott Ward. He scored his first goal for Norwich in a 1\u20131 draw against Hull City at the KC Stadium on March 19, 2011. Whitbread started in the Canaries' first game back in the Premier League, partnering Ritchie De Laet in a 1\u20131 draw at Wigan Athletic.

He made a return to the Norwich squad on December 3 against Manchester City, featuring as an unused substitute. In the next fixture against Newcastle United, Whitbread was given a start in a 4\u20132 win for Norwich, playing well apart from giving the ball away for Demba Ba's second goal.

He was partnered with Daniel Ayala from the New Year's Eve fixture against Fulham, and this partnership has seen Norwich win two consecutive away matches and three wins out of three in 2012. Whitbread was withdrawn early in the 2\u20130 victory over Bolton Wanderers, along with Daniel Ayala after complaining of a tight hamstring, 20 minutes after Ayala was subbed due to a suspect hamstring tear. He immediately regained his place upon his return to fitness, again at the expense of Leon Barnett in the narrow 2\u20131 defeat to Manchester United.
