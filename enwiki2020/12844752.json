In 2019, a total of 7.5 billion cans of Red Bull were sold worldwide in over 171 countries. The headquarters of Red Bull GmbH are located in Fuschl am See, Austria. ==History== Austrian entrepreneur Dietrich Mateschitz and Thai businessman Chaleo Yoovidhya founded Red Bull GmbH in 1984. While working for German manufacturer Blendax (later acquired by Procter & Gamble) in 1982, Mateschitz traveled to Thailand and met Chaleo, owner of TC Pharmaceutical. He found that the energy drink Krating Daeng, developed by Chaleo's company during the 1970s, helped to ease his jet lag. After seeing market potential in the drink, he partnered with Chaleo in bringing it to Europe. Under their agreement, the partners invested $500,000 each into founding Red Bull GmbH. In return, they would each receive a 49% stake in the company, with the remaining 2% stake going to Chaleo's son Chalerm. They also agreed that Mateschitz would run the company. Between 1984 and 1987, Red Bull GmbH modified the formula for Krating Daeng to better match European tastes by carbonating the beverage and making it less sweet. In 1987, the company introduced their adapted energy drink into Austria under the name Red Bull. It found huge success there by marketing to young professionals. The brand expanded throughout Europe during the early 1990s, exploding into the United States market during 1997, grabbing 75% of the market within a year. The wealth of Red Bull's founders grew with the company's success, and by March 2012, both Chaleo and Mateschitz had estimated net worths of over $5.3 billion each. Expanding its distribution to over 171 countries, the company sold 5.2 billion cans of Red Bull in 2012, making it the world's most-consumed energy drink.Red Bull company history, Red Bull GmbH corporate website ==Red Bull distribution== The Red Bull company also distributes and markets a number of other drinks including Simply Cola, the Carpe Diem range of herbal soft beverages and the Sabai Wine Spritzer (the latter in association with the Thai Siam Winery in Thailand). In 2010 the company won a long-running legal battle with The Bulldog, a chain of cannabis coffee shops. The Bulldog was ordered to cease the sale and distribution of its own brand of energy drink. Azarius, accessed 13 February 2013 ==Marketing== Kirby Chambliss racing in the Red Bull Air Race World Series Initially, Red Bull distributed free cases of the drink to college students in an attempt at viral advertising. This strategy was wildly successful, resulting in the rapid proliferation of sales. Red Bull has since become known for its sleek marketing targeted at young urban professionals through various sports and entertainment-based advertising campaigns. The current motto, \"Red Bull Gives You Wings\" is direct plays on the apparent stimulating properties of the beverage. ===Sport sponsorship=== Since the initial viral campaign, Red Bull's efforts have included sponsoring extreme sport events including cliff diving, BMX, skiing, flying, downhill and free-ride mountain biking and skateboarding. In the 1990s, Red Bull sponsored the rower Xeno M\u00fcller, who won an Olympic gold medal in the single sculls in 1996 . Red Bull also owns and conducts the Flugtag (\"flight day\" in German), a competition where entrants launch themselves off a 10-metre ramp in homemade \"flying machines\" into a body of water (reminiscent of the Birdman Rally); its own version of the soapbox derby called the Red Bull Soap Box Race which was recently held in Cincinnati, Ohio; the Red Bull Crashed ice, a world tour, in the winter extreme sporting event, ice cross downhill, which involves downhill skating in an urban environment, on a track which includes steep turns and high vertical drops.

They also purchased FC Liefering as Salzburg's feeder club. In 2005, Red Bull purchased the MetroStars, a team in Major League Soccer representing New York City, from Anschutz Entertainment Group and renamed the franchise; Red Bull New York is the name of the Red Bull subsidiary that operates the team, while the squad itself is known as the New York Red Bulls. Anschutz Entertainment Group was about to begin building the MetroStars their own stadium, but groundbreaking was delayed a month as AEG completed the sale of the team. The company paid for the team's new stadium, Red Bull Arena, which had its match opener 20 March 2010. In 2007, Red Bull established the lower-division Red Bull Brasil team in the city of Campinas, S\u00e3o Paulo. As the plan to reach the Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A in 10 years failed, Red Bull became owners of S\u00e9rie B side Clube Atl\u00e9tico Bragantino in March 2019 and renamed the team to Red Bull Bragantino.

The company stated that its goal was to reach the country's first division, the Bundesliga, within ten years; this goal was ultimately achieved, with RB Leipzig winning four promotions in seven seasons to secure Bundesliga football starting in 2016\u201317 season. The current Head of Global Football Operations is Oliver Mintzlaff. ====Ice hockey==== The company purchased EC Salzburg, the city's team in the Austrian Hockey League, in 2000 and renamed it Red Bull Salzburg.

The teams consist of mostly college students, who drive specially designed Red Bull \"Racers\". The racers are detailed with the Red Bull logo and most carry an oversized can of Red Bull on their chassis (Suzuki Vitara, MiniCooper, SportTrac, etc.). The METs complete daily missions that include sporting events, businesses, colleges, shopping centres, etc. The Mobile Energy Team is trained to know the properties of the energy drink thoroughly and present them to consumers. ===Promotional aircraft=== DC-6B landing at Salzburg The company uses numerous historic fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft in their promotions including: * Chance-Vought F4U-4 96995 (OE-EAS) (WWII Fighter) * Lockheed P-38L-5LO 44-53254 (N25Y) (WWII Fighter) * North American B-25J-30NC 44-86893 (N6123C) (WWII Bomber) * Douglas DC-6B (OE-LDM) ===Music industry=== The brand is promoted via various music-related activities.

A freestyle competition of hip hop which takes place every year in many Spanish speaking countries. In 2013, it started an artist development program called Red Bull Sound Select. Randy Randall, of No Age, said he was okay working with Red Bull as the company is not owned by a larger company and the branding of the events is relatively low key. In the same year, the Red Bull Amplifier was launched with help from Sidekick Studios. It plans helps to assist digital startups by giving access to its audience, events, and facilities. In return Red Bull gets associated with trendy startups. ==Media== Red Bull Media House is a media company specialized in sport, lifestyle programming, music and games.When a Brand Becomes a Publisher: Inside Red Bull\u2019s Media House \u2013 Dorian Benkoil, Mediashift, 10 November 2014 The company publishes several magazines: The Red Bulletin (lifestyle), Servus (food, health and gardening); Terra Mater (nature, science and history); Bergwelten (alpinism) and Seitenblicke (celebrities).
