The boys are unaware that a trucking war is in progress and that Wallace's trucks are being wrecked and his men killed. Frankie and Jefferson are hired. On one of their hauls, the two are taken prisoners by hijackers from a rival firm. Meanwhile, George Lee (Luke), an undercover agent for the insurance company that is covering Overland's claims, has learned that Pop Wallace is working with Ray Saunders (Mitchell), division superintendent for the insurance company. Saunders has a hold over Wallace and is forcing him to participate against his will. Frankie and Jefferson escape from the hijackers and return to Wallace's garage to find him slugged and unconscious. The boys decide to get the evidence that will clear Wallace before the police move in. With help from friends, the two manage to break into the hijacker's stronghold, but are captured. Saunders has the group loaded into a truck and driven out into the country-side to be murdered. The thug driving the truck breaks the speed limit and the cops are soon on his tail. ==Cast== *Frankie Darro as Frankie O'Malley *Marcia Mae Jones as Patsy Wallace *Jackie Moran as Chick Daly *Keye Luke as George Lee *Mantan Moreland as Jefferson Smith *Robert Homans as Pop Wallace *Irving Mitchell as R.
