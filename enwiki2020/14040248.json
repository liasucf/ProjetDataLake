He finally chose bodybuilding and started competing as an amateur in France. He won his first competition in Spain (under 75 kg-category) and after that he continued to win small prizes until his first participation in the Night of Champions in 1990, which he won. Dorian Yates took second place. On that occasion, Benaziza was nicknamed the \"Killer of Giants\" by Joe Weider. He participated in the prestigious Mr. Olympia contest three times. His last competition was the 1992 Mr. Olympia, where he placed 5th. He did not take time off and participated in a back-to-back competition in the Netherlands, a few weeks later. He was found dead in his hotel room at 6pm on October 4, 1992, shortly after that competition. It was reported that he had earlier complained of sickness and shortness of breath, but refused repeatedly to go to a hospital. It is believed that the cause of his death was that he took an injection provided by an unidentified man to accelerate the process of his preparation shortly before the competition. His death led to the end of the career of his personal friend Steve Brisbois. Benaziza was 33 years old and was the star-spin of the new generation of BodyBuilders.Steve Brisbois: HOW THE DEATH OF MY GOOD FRIEND CHANGED MY WHOLE LIFE AROUND NaturalStrength.com, 19.
