Establishing the chronology of W\u0142oc\u0142awek bishops, (Krak\u00f3w 1894).Fr. Pawe\u0142 Czaplewski, in: Polski s\u0142ownik biograficzny. vol. 1 (Krak\u00f3w, 1935), p. 46. There is not much information about him. He came from a non-fraternal, probably bourgeois family. The first mentions about him, talk about Albierzu as a chaplain of Micha\u0142 the Bishop of W\u0142oc\u0142awek. Around 1250, he became archdeacon. From 1258, he was dean of W\u0142oc\u0142awek. He became the Bishop of W\u0142oc\u0142awek in 1275. The then bishopric of W\u0142oc\u0142awek also included the area of Gda\u0144sk Pomerania. Hence Albierz took part in the settlement of border disputes between the Pomeranian prince M\u015bciwoj II (Mestwin II) and the Teutonic Knights. At the same time, he assured the W\u0142oc\u0142awek bishopric of a number of new princely broadcasts in the archdiocese of the Pomeranian bishopric. The Kujawsko-Pomorskie diocese also had fortunes in the Che\u0142mno land of the Order. Albierz managed to conclude an agreement with the Teutonic Knights on the use of the bishopric of these properties. Albierz died in December 1283. He was buried in either the W\u0142oc\u0142awek cathedral or in the Dominican church in Brest Kujawski. ==References== Category:Year of birth unknown Category:13th-century births Category:1283 deaths Category:13th- century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Medieval Polish nobility Category:13th-century Polish people ",
