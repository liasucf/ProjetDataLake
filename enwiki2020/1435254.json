The cathedral church of the diocese is Rochester Cathedral in the former city of Rochester. The bishop's Latin episcopal signature is: \"(firstname) Roffen\",Debretts Peerage, 1968, p. 945. Roffensis being the genitive case of the Latin name of the see. An ancient diocese, it was established with the authority of King \u00c6thelberht of Kent by Augustine of Canterbury in 604 at the same time as the see of London.Bede, Ecclesiastical History, II.3 Only the adjacent Diocese of Canterbury is older in England. Its establishment was the first part of an unrealised plan conceived by Pope Gregory the Great for Augustine of Canterbury to consecrate 12 bishops in different places and another 12 for the prospective see (later province) of York.Bede, Ecclesiastical History, I.29 The Rochester diocese includes 268 parish churches throughout: *the western part of the county of Kent *the London Borough of Bexley *the London Borough of Bromley; The diocese is subdivided into three archdeaconries: *Archdeaconry of Bromley & Bexley (Archdeacon: Paul Wright) *Archdeaconry of Rochester (Archdeacon: vacant) *Archdeaconry of Tonbridge (Archdeacon: Clive Mansell); The current diocesan boundaries roughly match its pre-19th century extent. On 1 January 1846 parishes in Hertfordshire from the dioceses of Lincoln and of London and Essex (from London diocese) were added to Rochester, while all West Kent parishes except those in the Rochester Deanery were transferred to the Diocese of Canterbury.\"The Dioceses of England...\", p. 34. In May 1877, Essex and Hertfordshire became part of the newly created Diocese of St Albans. On 1 August 1877, the Diocese of Rochester gained some northern parts of Surrey from the Diocese of Winchester which were later transferred to the Diocese of Southwark at its creation in 1905. ==Bishops== :For a list of bishops since 604, see Bishop of Rochester The present diocesan bishop, the Bishop of Rochester, is James Langstaff.
