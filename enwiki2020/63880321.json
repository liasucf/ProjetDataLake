    "text": "Electrify Canada is a partnership formed by Electrify America in cooperation with Volkswagen Group Canada that will build transformative, ultra-fast electric vehicle (EV) direct current (DC) charging infrastructure throughout Canada. == Overview == Electrify Canada's goal is to promote greater Zero- Emission Vehicle (ZEV) adoption by offering an ultra-fast and convenient charging network. This will fuel today's EVs, as well as the rapid growth in EV models expected from many car companies. == Charging with Electrify Canada == Each charging site will have four chargers on average and use the non- proprietary DC fast charging technologies (CCS and CHAdeMO). Charging power will range from 150kW to 350kW, capable of charging the expected longer range, larger battery vehicles that are coming to market and also capable of delivering 50kW charging power to support almost every model of EV on the road today. Electrify Canada opened its first charging station in September 2019, and it plans to have 32 stations open by the end of 2020\u2014many installed at Canadian Tire locations in Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta, and Quebec. Drivers can access the stations by downloading the Electrify Canada app or by using their credit card at the station. The company's website also has a list of locations and indicates which of them have been opened. == See also == * Electrify America == References == ==External links== * Electrify Canada * Electrify America Category:Electric cars Category:Volkswagen Group Category:2018 establishments in Ontario Category:Companies based in Ontario ",
