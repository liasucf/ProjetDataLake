    "text": "Ulmus ismaelis Todzia & Panero is a small tree discovered circa 1997 in southern Mexico by Ismael Calzada in riparian forest along the Mixteco River system in northeastern Oaxaca, where it grows among large boulders in the limestone canyons. The tree has since been found in Honduras and El Salvador.Linares, J. L. (2005). First record of Ulmus ismaelis (Ulmaceae) in Central America. Rev. Mex. Biodiv. vol.76 no.1 M\u00e9xico. Jun. 2005 (in Spanish). The tree is exceptional in its habitat: dry places, sometimes with <500 mm per annum precipitation, and comparatively low altitudes of 450\u2013750 m. ==Description== Rarely growing to > 15 m in height, typically < 10 m with a trunk diameter of 30 cm; the tree has exfoliating orangish bark. The ovate leaves are coriaceoeus, < 9.6 cm in length by 4.6 cm broad, acute at the apex, pinnately veined, on short (2\u20135 mm) petioles; the colour ranges from dull green to light brown. The apetalous flowers are arranged as short racemes on leafless twigs, sparsely clustered on < 7 mm peduncles. The samarae are < 22 \u00d7 13 mm, tapering at the base to a <8 mm stalk, with ciliate margins, and are shed during June and July in Mexico; in Honduras and El Salvador the tree flowers at the time of foliage change, just before the fall of the leaves of the previous season during the months of February and March, and fructifies from March to the end of April, coinciding with the emergence of the new season's leaves.

Seedlings were later disseminated by the arboretum to Butterfly Conservation's main trials site, Great Fontley, Hampshire, UK, and the Escuela Tecnica Superior de Ingenieros de Montes, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Spain. ==Etymology== The species is named for the Mexican botanist and collector Dr Juan Ismael Calzada, who discovered the tree. ==Accessions== ===Europe=== * Grange Farm Arboretum, Lincs., UK. Seedlings germinated 2019. * Butterfly Conservation elm trials plantation, Great Fontley, Hants., UK. One seedling, germinated 2019. ==References== Category:Elm species and varieties Category:Endemic flora of Mexico Category:Trees of Mexico Category:Trees of Oaxaca Category:Trees of El Salvador Category:Trees of Honduras Category:Trees of Central America Category:Ulmus articles missing images ismaelis ",
