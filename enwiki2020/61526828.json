It takes place in 2032, on the 50th anniversary of the Falklands War. == Development == Javier Otaegui serves as the project lead. In 1996 he read in the local newspaper that Conde Entertainment Software had just won an international prize for real-time strategy Regnum, the first Argentinian CD release which sold over 10,000 copies. Otaegui was inspired by this moment, later recalling that he thought \"If someone has already made a game in Argentina, maybe I can do the same\". The game took three years of development and led to Otaegui starting his own company, Sabarasa. He considered it a \"tribute\" to the combatants killed in the war. The gave's development began in March 1996, taking around 3.5 years to complete. During that time the team created their gaming engine and converted it from DOS to DirectX. GarageDeveloper International published the game in English. == Release == In March 2001, LeTemps announced the game was to be released in English in the next few weeks. == Critical reception == Idnes gave it a scathing review. Absolute Games felt the title had no redeeming qualities. JDeJuegos argues it's the first and only attempt from the Argentinian video gaming industry to create an RTS. == Legacy == Its legacy is in being one of the first Argentinian video gaming successes, alongside contemporary titles such as Yo, Mat\u00edas, and Argentum Online. == References == == External links == * BBC audio clip on game development *Interview on page 9 of REPLAY magazine *Main page *Interview at Supleinternet *Juegos Online article == See also == * Cultural impact of the Falklands War Category:1999 video games Category:Falklands War video games Category:Real-time strategy video games Category:Video games developed in Argentina Category:Video games set in South America Category:Video games set in the future Category:Windows games Category:Windows-only games ",
