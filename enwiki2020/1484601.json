As she carves her identity as an artist in an industry where Asian women are not thought of as musical powerhouses or innovators \u2013 Magdalen is a rare force with which to reckon.\" About Fire, the Advocate wrote, \"finely crafted, melodic, piano-based songs that borrow equally from pop, folk, jazz, blues and even punk.\" ==In her own words== Her songs visually portray what she sees as a trained painter while addressing universal themes about identity, spirituality, consciousness, love, loss, and relationships. \"I write completely from the heart,\" she says, \"but also from my cultural heritages and the places I'm from (the southeast, northeast, and west coast). \"One of the problems in our society is a lack of awareness for the wealth of cultural diversity that surrounds us,\" she says. \"I intend to always be defining issues of identity, raising awareness, and bringing communities together through my music, art, and writing. My primary goal as an artist is to help break through the glass ceiling in America so that Asians and other cultural minorities become accepted as artistic and commercial forces in popular music and other artistic mediums.\" Currently, she is working on completing a new book and CD. \"This book and its accompanying CD will be the culmination of many stories, chapters, and tales within the paths that my life has taken,\" she says. \"Throughout my life I have rejected many traditions that were integral to my Chinese heritage, while simultaneously reclaiming others. I did not start out my life knowing what I would become. Rather, the shape and course of my life were composed like a painting or a piece of music, by the flow of events and people I encountered along the way, the choices that I made.\" I've always tried to live my life by listening to my heart and following the Dao.\" She says, \"And I've been fortunate to have some amazing teachers and healers in my life. They've steadied me on my path along the way, given me insights and guidance to help me be my highest self in this lifetime. It's time to share what they have taught me with others \u2013 and that is what this new book and CD will be about\". ===Discography=== ;With ChickPop Records * 1997 Muscle and Bone (EP) * 1998 Evolution * 2001 Fire * 2005 Smashing the Ceiling ==Notes== ==External links== Category:Living people Category:American female singer-songwriters Category:American musicians of Chinese descent Category:Bisexual musicians Category:American singer-songwriters Category:Bisexual women Category:LGBT musicians from the United States Category:LGBT people from Virginia Category:LGBT American people of Asian descent Category:LGBT singers from the United States Category:LGBT songwriters Category:Rhode Island School of Design alumni Category:Berklee College of Music alumni Category:Cornish College of the Arts alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
