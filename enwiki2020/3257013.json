    "text": "Grandborough is a small village and civil parish in Warwickshire, England. The parish includes the hamlets of Calcutt, Grandborough Fields and Woolscott. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 424. Grandborough is in a rural area of eastern Warwickshire, around six miles (10 km) south of Rugby and six miles northwest of Daventry, Northamptonshire. The village is part of the borough of Rugby. Grandborough is about two miles from the nearest main roads and can be reached by country lanes from the A45 to the east, and the A426 to the west. The River Leam flows north of the village. There was a watermill (now a private residence) where the river passed under the road from Woolscott. In times of flood, the river flows over the road creating a ford. A road sign suggests that pedestrians and motorists should \"Use causeway if flooded\". Grandborough's church is dedicated to St Peter. The church spire, and the two tall Wellingtonia trees which flank it, are notable local landmarks. There is also a Primitive Methodist chapel (erected in 1856 and extended in 1991), a village hall (the Benn Memorial Hall, erected in 1897) and a number of old (mostly Victorian) cottages. The village has a pub called the Shoulder of Mutton. In Main Street there is a private house which was formerly a pub called the Royal George. Harrow House, in Woolscott, was formerly a pub called the Old Harrow Inn.\"Away from it all: Grandborough\", Warwickshire and Worcestershire Life, January 1980, pp 56-57. ==History== Grandborough was mentioned in the Domesday Book as Graensburgh. Until the early 20th century the name was spelt as Granborough. Its name was supposed by Eilert Ekwall to come from Anglo-Saxon Gr\u0113nbeorg = \"green rounded hill\", but the Domesday Book form points otherwise. It appears as Granborowe on the Christopher Saxton map of 1637. The former village school still stands. It closed in April 1974Coventry Evening Telegraph, 5 April 1974 and is now a private house. A stone plaque hidden on an east-facing wall has the inscription \"Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it\" and the date 1840. The quotation is taken from the Book of Proverbs, chapter 22, verse 6.Grandborough: Portrait of a Warwickshire Village, Canon Idwal Jones (no date), 32pp The first mention of a post office in the village is the issue in April 1847 of a type of postmark known as an undated circle (with the spelling Granborough).The Undated Circular Marks of the Midland Counties.
