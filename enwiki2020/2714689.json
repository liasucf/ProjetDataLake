    "text": "The Noah's Ark Principle () is a 1984 West German science fiction film written and directed by Roland Emmerich as his thesis at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Fernsehen und Film M\u00fcnchen (HFF). While his fellow students typically raised and spent 20,000 Deutsche Mark for their final work, Emmerich managed to collect a budget of 1,200,000 DM (around US$600,000). This film, shot in color with mono sound, received a rating of 12 in West Germany, and was sold to 20 countries. It was submitted to the 34th Berlin International Film Festival and received some acclaim for technical skill and special effects, but won no prizes. ==Plot summary== The year is 1997, and world peace seems to have come, with most classic weapons of mass destruction having been abandoned. However, orbiting the Earth there is the European/American space station FLORIDA ARKLAB, capable of controlling the weather at any location on the planet underneath. A civil project by nature, it might be abused as an offensive weapon, since it could deliver devastation to any potential adversary simply by creating natural disasters such as storms and floods. The space station soon becomes the central point in rising political tensions between East and West, next stop World War 3 (as indicated by the tagline \"The end of our future has already begun\"). The film follows the main protagonist, Billy Hayes, an astronaut aboard the station, as he wades through a plot of secrecy and sabotage trying to tell friend from foe in the process. ==Cast== ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1984 films Category:1980s science fiction films Category:Films about astronauts Category:Films directed by Roland Emmerich Category:German science fiction films Category:West German films Category:Films set in 1997 Category:Films set in the future Category:1984 directorial debut films ",
