    "text": "Uperodon variegatus, also known as the Eluru dot frog, termite nest frog, variable ramanella, variagated ramanella, white-bellied pug snout frog, or variagated globular frog, is a species of narrow-mouthed frog (family Microhylidae) that is endemic to India. Earlier records from Sri Lanka refer to what is now known as Uperodon rohani. They are seen mostly in the monsoon season when they may enter homes. They are small in size and the variegated markings and the genus characteristic of having pads on the fingertips but not on their toes make them easy to identify. ==Description== This species is small and often can be found indoors in homes. The discs on the fingers are triangular. Toes have rudimentary webbing with two metatarsal tubercles. The tibio-tarsal joint reaches shoulder when the hind leg is held along the body. They breed during the rainy season (April\u2013October) and call during this time. Males call at night while afloat in water. They have a single subgular vocal sac.Ravishankar Dundappa Kanamadi; Channayya Rajashekar Hiremath; Hans Schneider (1993) The advertisement call of the south Indian frog Ramanella variegata (Microhylidae).

India, 1990\u20131991, 42\u201343, 55\u201376. The call has been transcribed as ghauy ghauy. The tadpoles are brown or gray with black spots. Sometimes they have a blue spot on each side of the body. The tadpoles are bottom feeders and metamorphose within a month.Daniel, J. C. (1963) Field Guide to the Amphibians of Western India. Part 2. J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. 60(3):25-37 ==Habitat== They breed in water in dark cavities and are often found in termite mounds or under stones. Recorded mainly from peninsular India including the dry zone being found even in Madras and West Bengal.Deuti, Kaushik (1998) Occurrence of Ramanella variegata (Anura- Microhylidae) in west Bengal with notes on its Distribution in India.
