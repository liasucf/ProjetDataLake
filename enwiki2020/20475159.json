    "text": "Loletta Chu (born 7 September 1958 in Mandalay, Burma) is a Chinese beauty pageant titleholder. She was the winner of the 1977 Miss Hong Kong Pageant. ==Early life== Chu was born in Mandalay, Burma in 1958 into an ethnically Chinese family, with roots in Taishan, Guangdong, China. In 1968 she and her family moved to Hong Kong, where she attended St Teresa School, Hong Kong International School and King George V School. She did some modelling in her teen years. ==Miss Hong Kong== She participated in the 1977 Miss Hong Kong Pageant and became the first candidate to win both the title as well as a second, Miss Photogenic. Coincidentally, ever since Chu won both titles, the winner of the title Miss Photogenic became a good indication of who would eventually be the winner, or runners-up, of the competition. ==Personal life== She is the former wife of the late tycoon and philanthropist Henry Fok's son, Timothy, with whom she has three sons, Kenneth, Eric and Jeremy. Chu and Fok announced their divorce in September 2006, after more than two decades of marriage. She remarried, to Hong Kong real estate billionaire Vincent Lo of Shui On Group, in Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, Singapore in November 2008. ==References== Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Miss Hong Kong winners Category:Hong Kong female models Category:Alumni of King George V School, Hong Kong Category:People from Mandalay Category:Burmese emigrants to Hong Kong Category:Burmese people of Chinese descent Category:Hong Kong people of Taishan descent Category:Burmese people of Taishan descent ",
