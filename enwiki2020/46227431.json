New strepsirrhine primate from the late Eocene of peninsular Thailand (Krabi Basin). American Journal of Physical Anthropology 130:425-434 ==Classification== Muangthanhinius was initially classified as incertae sedis within Adapiformes because Marivaux et al. (2006) noted its distinctness from other named adapiform families. The authors noted its similarity to Bugtilemur, questioning the latter's putative lemuriform affinities. Ni et al. (2016) recovered Muangthanhinius as part of the family Ekgmowechashalidae along with Ekgmowechashala, Bugtilemur, and Gatanthropus.X. Ni, Q. Li, L. Li and K. C. Beard. 2016.
