    "text": "Latin American studies (LAS) is an academic and research field associated with the study of Latin America. The interdisciplinary study is a subfield of area studies, and can be composed of numerous disciplines such as economics, sociology, history, international relations, political science, geography, gender studies, and literature. ==Definition== Latin American studies critically examines the history, culture, international relations, and politics, of Latin America. It is not to be confused with Latino Studies, an academic discipline which studies the experience of people of Hispanic ancestry in the United States. Latin Americanists consider a variety of perspectives and employ diverse research tools in their work. The interdisciplinary disciplines of study varies, depending on the school, association, and academic program. For example, the Latin American Centre of the School of Interdisciplinary Area Studies (SIAS) at the University of Oxford heavily focuses on the social sciences, such as the economics, politics, and development of the region. The Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Arizona also focuses on social sciences with faculty from Anthropology, Geography, Political Science, Sociology, and History an places emphasis on issues related to anti-racism, human rights, security, environment and health. On the other hand, schools like Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies (LLILAS) at The University of Texas at Austin, focus on the humanities; with the language, culture, and history of Latin America as a central component. Others include the study of environment and ecology of the region. Latin American studies is usually quite open and often includes or is closely associated with, for instance, Development studies, Geography, Anthropology, Caribbean studies, and Transatlantic studies. ==History== Latin America has been studied in one way or another ever since Columbus's voyage of 1492. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, scientist explorers such as Alexander von Humboldt published extensively about the region. Towards the end of the nineteenth century and at the turn of the twentieth, within the region itself writers such as Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed and Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3 encouraged a consciousness of regional identity. In 1875, the International Congress of Americanists held its first meeting in Nancy, France, and has met regularly ever since, alternating between venues in Europe and in the Western hemisphere. However, unlike the scholarly organizations of the twentieth century, the ICA does not have an ongoing organization, nor is there a journal of the ICA. The creation of formal and ongoing scholarly organizations focusing on Latin America is a product of the twentieth century. In the US, historians with an interest in Latin American history within the American Historical Association created a group focusing on Latin America. In 1918, they founded The Hispanic American Historical Review, which has published quarterly since that time and has built a reputation as one of the premier scholarly journals.see homepage The Latin Americanists within the AHA created the Conference on Latin American History in 1926, which is now separately incorporated (since 1964), but continues to coordinate its annual meetings with the American Historical Association. In 1936, US Latin Americanists also founded the Handbook of Latin American Studies, with editorial offices in the Hispanic Division of the Library of Congress. In a pre-digital era, the compilation of annotated bibliographic references in the humanities and social science organized by subject and country was a vital tool for scholars in the field.Howard F. Cline, \"The Latin American Studies Association: A Summary Survey with Appendix,\" Latin American Research Review, Vol 2 No. 1, (Autumn, 1966) pp. 57-79.http://salalm.org/Conf/2016/04/panel-11-the-hispanic-division- and-the-handbook-of-latin-american-studies-highlighting-luso-hispanic- collections-in-the-library-of-congress/ accessed 13 August 2016. In 1954 was founded in Paris the Institute of Latin American Studies (IHEAL), by the geographer Pierre Monbeig.About IHEAL, accessed 15 November 2019. With the Cuban Revolution of 1959, the US government began seriously focusing on Latin America as Cuba and the hemisphere was seen to be an integral element of Cold War politics. The Latin American historian who wrote the early history of the founding of the Latin American Studies Association wryly suggested in 1966 that at some future date Latin Americanists should erect a statue to Fidel Castro, the \"remote godfather\" of the field, who instigated a renewed US interest in the region.Howard F. Cline, \"The Latin American Studies Association: A Summary Survey with Appendix,\" Latin American Research Review, Vol. 2, No. 1 (Autumn 1966), p. 64. Interest in Latin American studies increased starting in the 1950s. In the US, Latin American studies (like other area studies) was boosted by the passing of Title VI of the National Defense Education Act (NDEA) of 1958, which provided resources for Centers of Area and International Studies. In the UK, the 1965 \"Parry Report\" provided similar impetus for the establishment of Institutes and Centres of Latin American Studies at Oxford, London, Cambridge, and Liverpool.Jos\u00e9 C. Moya,ed. The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History, New York: Oxford University Press 2011, p. viii. In Canada, York University in Toronto established the first Latin American center, \"in part thanks to the inflow of exiled intellectuals from South America.\"Moya, The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History, p. viii Germany's Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut in Berlin had been founded in 1930, but not until the 1970s did it experience expansion.Moya, The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History, p. viii. ==Associations== * Brazilian Studies Association * Conference on Latin American History (CLAH)http://clah.h-net.org/ * Canadian Association for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (founded 1969)https://www.can-latam.org/ * Consortium of Latin American Studies Programs (CLASP) * Latin American Studies Association (US, founded 1966) * Mid-Atlantic Council of Latin American Studies (US, founded 1979) * Pacific Coast Council of Latin American Studies (PCCLAS) (US)http://www.calstatela.edu/pcclas * Rocky Mountain Council for Latin American Studies (RMCLAS) (US, founded 1954)https://rmclas.org/ * Seminar on the Acquisition of Latin American Library Materials (SALALM), established 1967http://salalm.org/# * Society for Irish Latin American Studies (Ireland, founded 2003) * Society for Latin American Studies (UK), established 1964http://www.slas.org.uk/about/history.htm * Southeast Council of Latin American Studies (US, founded 1953) ==Bibliographic resources== * Handbook of Latin American Studies, established 1936 * Hispanic American Periodicals Index (HAPI) ==Reference works== *Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture ==Journals== *The Americas, established 1944 * Bulletin of Latin American Research, established 1981 * Canadian Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Studies, established 1976https://www.can-latam.org/journal * Colonial Latin American Historical Review, established 1992 * Colonial Latin American Review, established 1992 * European Review of Latin American & Caribbean Studies * The Hispanic American Historical Review, established 1918, published by Conference on Latin American Historyhttp://hahr-online.com/ * Historia Mexicana, established 1951 * Journal of Interamerican Studies and World Affairs * Journal of Latin American Cultural Studies, established 1996 * Journal of Latin American Studies established 1969 * Journal of Politics in Latin AmericaJPLA - open access homepage * Latin American Perspectives, established in 1974 * Latin American Politics and Society * Latin American Research Review (published by the Latin American Studies Association) * The Latin Americanist,\" published by Wiley-Blackwell and the Southeast Council of Latin American Studies * Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos, established 1985 * NACLA Report on the Americas * \u00d1awpa Pacha, Journal of Andean Archaeology, established 1963 * Problems of Latin America * Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Pol\u00edticas y Sociales/Mexican Journal of Political and Social Sciences, established in 1955 ==Programs== * Center for Latin American Studies (CLAS) at Stanford University * Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, Center for Latin American Studies * The University of Texas at Austin - Teresa LozMeano Long Institute of Latin American Studies (LLILAS), Austin, Texas * Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS), New York University * The Institute of Latin American Studies (ILAS), Columbia University * Centre of Latin American Studies, University of Cambridge * Centre of Latin American Studies, University of Oxford * David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies (DRCLAS) at Harvard University * America and Caribbean Studies, The Henry M.
