    "text": "Bromopentafluorobenzene is an organofluorine compound with the formula C6F5Br. It is a colorless liquid that is used to prepare pentafluophenyl compounds. These syntheses typically proceed via the intermediacy of C6F5Li or the Grignard reagent. Illustrative is preparation of tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane:Piers, W.
