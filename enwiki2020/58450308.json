It celebrated its centenary in 1980. == History == Lesser gallery Interior courtyard Built in 1880, the lyc\u00e9e Arago started as a higher primary school (EPS). Schools of this type were created by Fran\u00e7ois Guizot under the law of 1833 to widen secondary education to those children from poorer families. The EPS in Paris particularly were real colleges. All the disciplines usually associated with the royal colleges were offered, apart from Greek and Latin, which were replaced by foreign languages. Students at the \u00e9cole Arago even received calligraphy classes. The Parisian EPS were a great success. They prepared students for schools such as the \u00c9cole de physique et chimie de Paris, the \u00c9cole nationale des Arts et M\u00e9tiers, and the \u00c9cole normale d'instituteurs. The estimated cost for the \u00e9cole Arago was gold francs (1877) just for construction. This cost did not include the cost of the land (belonging to the City of Paris), school furniture, physics equipment, chemistry, collections, models, gym equipment, utilities, and other necessary equipment. At this time, it was considered that this work was undeniably useful. Studies lasted from 32 \u00bd hours in the first year to 48h in the fourth year. The \u00c9cole Arago contributed to the democratisation of education, allowing students to work in industry and commerce, but also in arts and letters, considered as more noble. In 1945, EPS Arago became a municipal college: at this time municipal colleges were the equivalent of lyc\u00e9e with all classes between 6th year and final year, plus coll\u00e8ge Arago offered preparatory classes for the ENSAM. In 1960, due to the reforms of the 5th Republic, the municipal college of Arago became a lyc\u00e9e, managed by the State. In this establishment, teachers have included Charles Veillet-Lavall\u00e9e, Charles Couyba who became a minister and singer (Boukay), Alain Frontier who was a poet and grammarian, \u00c9mile Kahn who was President of the Human Rights League (France), Jean-Jacques Becker, historian, First World War expert, etc. == Secondary education== === Seconds === The lyc\u00e9e consists of around 7 classes of general and technology secondary education: * ISI : Initiation to engineering (30 students) * ISP : IT and production systems (30 students) * MPS : Scientific method and practice * PFEG : Fundamental principles of economics and business (50 students) * SES : Economic and social sciences (70 students) * LS : Literature and society (25 students) * LC : Ancient languages and culture (Latin) (20 students) === First === There are 7 primary classes with a capacity of 35 students each: * ES : Social and economic (2 classes) * S (S.I) : Science + engineering (1 class) * S (SVT) : Science + life science (2 classes) * STMG : Science and technology and business management (2 classes) === Final year === There are 7 classes in the final year with a capacity of 35 students each: * ES : Social and economic (2 classes) * S (S.I) : Science + engineering (1 class) * S (SVT) : Science + life sciences (2 classes) * STG (Mercatique) : Science and business technology + marketing (1 class) * STMG (Gestion et finance) : Science and technology of business + business finance (1 class) === Classes of brevet de technicien sup\u00e9rieur === There is a BTS MUC (Management of commercial units) at the lyc\u00e9e Arago. === Lyc\u00e9e ranking === In 2015, the lyc\u00e9e ranked 87th out of 10 at d\u00e9partemental level in terms of teaching quality, and 1334th and national level.Classement d\u00e9partemental et national du lyc\u00e9e The ranking is based on three criteria: the bac results, the proportion of students who obtain their baccalaur\u00e9at having spent two years at the establishment, and added value (calculated based on social origin of the students, their age, and their national diploma results).M\u00e9thodologie du classement national des lyc\u00e9es fran\u00e7ais == Alumni == (Alphabetical list, non exhaustive) Monument in memory of students who died for France,Le R\u00e9veil, behind which is found a list of students who died during the First and Second World Wars, the sculptor, Paul Roussel, is a former student. * Jean Bellus, illustrator and press cartoonist * \u00c9douard Bled, grammarian laureate of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise * Max Clos, codirector of Figaro * Jean Diwo, founder of T\u00e9l\u00e9 7 jours and journalist for Paris Match * Tch\u00e9ky Karyo, actor * Andr\u00e9 Leroi-Gourhan, prehistorian and member of the Institut * Guy Lux, television presenter * Yves Mirande, playwright * Charles Picquenard, diplomat * Paul Roussel (1867-1928), sculptor.Site consacr\u00e9 au monuments aux morts du lyc\u00e9e Carnot dont il est l'auteur * Raymond Tournon (1870-1919), surveyor, painter, poster artist and illustrator * Zeev GourarierWho\u2019s Who in France : Dictionnaire biographique de personnalit\u00e9s fran\u00e7aises vivant en France et \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger, et de personnalit\u00e9s \u00e9trang\u00e8res r\u00e9sidant en France, 46th edition pour 2015 \u00e9dit\u00e9e en 2014, 2435, , notice \u00ab Gourarier, Z\u00e9ev, Henri \u00bb page 1031.
