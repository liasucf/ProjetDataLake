    "text": "The New Art Gallery Walsall is a modern and contemporary art gallery sited in the centre of the West Midlands town of Walsall, England. It was built with \u00a321 million of public funding, including \u00a315.75 million from the UK National Lottery and additional money from the European Regional Development Fund and City Challenge. The Gallery is funded by Walsall Council and Arts Council England; this funding is further supplemented by its own income generation. Admission is free. Its first Director was Peter Jenkinson. In May 2005, former BALTIC director Stephen Snoddy was appointed as Director. ==Architecture== Designed by the architects Caruso St John after winning an international design competition, it opened in January 2000, replacing the town's old gallery and an arts centre that had been closed by the Council almost a decade earlier. It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 5 May 2000, during her visit to the West Midlands. The New Art Gallery's stark building won several architectural awards and attracted over 237,000 visitors in its opening year. In 2000, the gallery was shortlisted for the prestigious Sterling Architecture Prize. The five-story building is clad in pale terracotta and has a floor area of . The interior of the Gallery features a heavy use of concrete and 75mm thick douglas fir wooden cladding. The public square surrounding the building was designed by Richard Wentworth and Catherine Yass. The Gallery has been seen as an attempt to encourage regeneration in the local area. The architecture has been both praised and criticised, described as \"almost flawless\" by the RIBA and \"extraordinarily good\" by Hugh Pearman but also castigated by John Stewart-Young as an \"architectural indulgence\", an impressive building that lacks consideration of how the wider public will use it. Cited in The essayist Theodore Dalrymple described the interior as resembling both \"a fascist foreign ministry\" and \"a sauna of gigantic proportions\". There have been a number of minor alterations to the building since its opening, including changing of the ground floor retail area into a cafe, and addition of more windows around its entrance. In 2006, Floor 4 of the gallery was transformed from a restaurant area into a new gallery space. The gallery space with 8m high ceiling has enabled the Gallery to present a further programme of exhibitions, in addition to its main temporary exhibition galleries. This has included exhibitions by regional and internationally renowned artists including David Batchelor, Richard Billingham and Leo Fitzmaurice. In 2012, artist Sarah Staton was commissioned to design a new sculpture terrace for the Gallery, opening to the public later that same year the space converted a previously underused area of patio on floor 4. ==Collections== Sorrow The Gallery houses the fixed Garman Ryan Collection of sculptures and paintings by modern masters including a large selection of work by Jacob Epstein and many significant works by European artists including Vincent Van Gogh, Claude Monet, Turner, Corot, Renoir and Constable represented in prints, sketches, drawings, paintings and sculptures.A Shared Vision: The Garman Ryan Collection, by Shelia McGregor, Merrell Publishershttp://www.thenewartgallerywalsall.org.uk/collections-and-library The collection was donated to the people of Walsall in 1973 by Epstein's late wife Kathleen Garman (Lady Epstein) and her friend Sally Ryan. In 2006, the gallery acquired the Epstein Archive, a collection of photographs, manuscripts, sketches and correspondence between Jacob Epstein and his family and friends, patrons, buyers and galleries.
