The first part, \u5730 (pronounced chi, translated as \"earth\") is an installation of phosphorescent rocks with a minimalist layout. During the day the rocks are nondescript. At night, the rocks are illuminated with a black light so they glow. The second part called \u5929 (pronounced ten, translated as \"heaven\") shows the areas of the gallery walls illuminated by the sun covered in gold foil. The third part called \u4eba (pronounced jin, translated as \"human\") are series of glazed ceramics white with blue shading hanging from the ceiling and arranged on a long block of wood.
