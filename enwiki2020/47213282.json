Asad at-Tam\u012bm\u012b or Abdul Wahid Tamimi () was a 9th century saint who belonged to the Junaidia order. He was the son and disciple of Abdul Aziz bin Hars bin Asad al-Tamimi. He was an ardent worshipper and ascetic. ==Biography== Not many details about his early life are known except that he was born in Yemen which is why he was often regarded as \"Yemeni\". His name was Abdul Wahid and he was the son of Shaikh Abdul Aziz Tamimi bin Haris bin Asad. \u2018Tamimi\u2019 was a part of his name as his family belonged to the tribe al-Tamimi of Arabia. He followed the Hanafi school of thought.Gregory Mack, Jurisprudence, in Gerhard B\u00f6wering et al (2012), The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought, Princeton University Press, , p. 289Sunnite Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2014) ==Spiritual career== Abu Al Fazal Abdul Wahid Yemeni Tamimi is often associated with Abu Bakr ShibliLeonard Lewisohn, \"The Heritage of Sufism: Classical Persian Sufism from its origins to Rumi\", the University of Michigan, 1999. pg 53: \"Two Persian Sufis - Mansur Hallaj and Abu Bakr Shibli (d. 945), the latter from Samarqand by origin but born origin in Baghdad\" due to his character. This is probably because he gained beneficence from Abu Bakr Shibli although he took Bayatat the hands of his father Abdul Aziz bin Haris bin Asad al-Tamimi from whom he was given the Sufi khirqa. Muhaddith Shah Waliullah Dehlawi is reported to have said, \u201cAbdul Wahid at-Tamimi wore the Khirqa from both \u2018Abdul Aziz al-Tamimi and Abu Bakr Shibli. This is reflected in many of the authentic chains of spiritual transmission.\u201d Abu Al Fazal Abdul Wahid Yemeni Tamimi spent most of his life guiding people often while travelling.
