Her father was C\u00e9sar de Bourbon, Duke of Vend\u00f4me, legitimised son of King Henry IV of France and his official mistress Gabrielle d'Estr\u00e9es. Her mother was Princess Fran\u00e7oise of Lorraine (1592\u20131669), daughter and heiress of Philippe Emmanuel, Duke of Merc\u0153ur, himself a rival of Henry IV. Her mother was the Duchess of Merc\u0153ur and Penthi\u00e8vre in her own right and was the greatest heiress of her time. Styled as Mademoiselle de Vend\u00f4me prior to marriage, she was the second of three children; she had two brothers, the Frondeur Fran\u00e7ois de Bourbon, Duke of Beaufort and Louis de Bourbon, Duke of Vend\u00f4me whose wife Laura Mancini was a niece of Cardinal Mazarin. They were the parents of Louis Joseph de Bourbon, a very successful military commander and a Marshal of France. On 11 July 1643 at the Louvre, Mademoiselle de Vend\u00f4me married Charles Amadeus of Savoy, Duke of Nemours. The young prince was a member of a cadet branch of the house of Savoy which had settled in France. The young prince was a direct descendant of Philip II, Duke of Savoy as was \u00c9lisabeth. They had two daughters who would marry the heirs to the thrones of Savoy and Portugal, and three sons who died shortly after birth. In 1652 the Duke of Nemours was killed by her brother Fran\u00e7ois, Duke of Beaufort in a duel. \u00c9lisabeth herself died in Paris. She managed to secure the income of the lands of Nemours for her two daughters, but the titles were inherited by other members of the family. In early 1653, she travelled to Scotland where she wed Sir Ewen Cameron of Lochiel, courtier and royalist with whom she had six children. She died in Paris on the 19th May, 1664. ==Issue== #Marie Jeanne of Savoy, Mademoiselle de Nemours (1644\u20131724) married Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy in 1665. #Stillborn daughter #Marie Fran\u00e7oise of Savoy, Mademoiselle d'Aumale (1646\u20131683) married Afonso VI of Portugal in 1666 and afterwards Afonso's brother Pedro II of Portugal. #Prince Joseph of Savoy (1649\u20131649) #Prince Francis of Savoy (1650\u20131650) #Prince Charles Amadeus of Savoy (1651\u20131651) ==Ancestry== ==See also== Category:1614 births Category:1664 deaths Category:17th-century French people Category:People from Paris Elisabeth Category:Duchesses of Aumale Category:Duchesses of Nemours Category:Princesses of Savoy Category:Disease-related deaths in France ",
