Ralph was probably from Varneville aux Gr\u00e8s in Normandy, from which he derived his name.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066\u20131300: Volume 6: York: Treasurers of York Ralph became Treasurer of Rouen sometime between 11 July 1146, the last appearance of his predecessor in office, and 27 September 1146 when Ralph is named as treasurer for the first time. He held the office of treasurer until 1176.Spear Personnel of the Norman Cathedrals p. 219 He acquired the office of Archdeacon of Rouen in 1170, holding the office along with the treasurership of Rouen for a few years.Spear Personnel of the Norman Cathedrals p. 214 After he left the treasurership, Ralph was accused by the cathedral chapter of Rouen of misusing some of the funds of the cathedral, and the dispute dragged on until 1188, when it was heard by a papal commission. Ralph also held offices in England. He was Treasurer of York from 1167 until 1181, and was Archdeacon of the East Riding at about the same time.Greenway Fasti Ecclesiae Anglicanae 1066\u20131300: Volume 6: York: Archdeacons: East Riding Ralph served King Henry II of England as Lord Chancellor from 1173 to 1181.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 84 Ralph was a friend of Arnulf of Lisieux, Bishop of Lisieux, and benefited from Arnulf's intercession with the Bishop of Poitiers. But during Ralph's chancellorship, Ralph was one of the royal officials that urged Arnulf to resign his bishopric.
