    "text": "Sylvio Mendes Campos J\u00fanior (born 12 April 1974), commonly known as Sylvinho (sometimes alternatively spelled Silvinho), is a Brazilian football manager and former player who played as a left back. Having begun his career at Corinthians, he was signed by Arsenal of the Premier League in 1999, and was a popular player in his two seasons at the club. He left for Celta Vigo of La Liga, before joining FC Barcelona in 2004, with whom he won the UEFA Champions League in 2006 and 2009 among other honours. He returned to England to spend his final season as a player with Manchester City in 2009\u201310. ==Club career== ===Corinthians=== Born in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, Sylvinho started his career at Corinthians in 1994. With Tim\u00e3o, Sylvinho won the Copa do Brasil in 1995. He was also victorious with Corinthians in 1998's edition of Brazil's top flight league, the Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A. Slyvinho as well won the Campeonato Paulista in 1995, 1997 & 1999 with Corinthians altogether. ===Arsenal=== Sylvinho in 1999 In 1999, he became the first ever Brazilian player to sign for English club Arsenal, whom he signed for ahead of North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur who had made numerous offers for him. Before long he was first choice at left back, displacing long-time fan-favourite Nigel Winterburn. He had a setback early on in his first season when he missed a penalty in a shootout as Arsenal crashed out of the League Cup to Middlesbrough, and that season finished in similar heartbreak as Arsenal lost 4\u20131 on penalties against Turkish club Galatasaray in the 2000 UEFA Cup Final, although this time he did not take a penalty. During his second season at the club he was displaced by Ashley Cole. His stay only lasted for two years but in his short spell there he gained many friends and admirers and scored several spectacular goals including ones against Sheffield Wednesday, Charlton Athletic and Chelsea. He also scored twice in the Champions League for Arsenal against Sparta Prague and Spartak Moscow. In the 2000\u201301 season, Sylvinho was included in the PFA Team of the Year. ===Celta Vigo=== In 2001, he moved to Celta Vigo, and played there for three years, scoring once in the league against Barcelona on 26 January 2003, his future club. He became a popular figure with the club's fans, helping the team to qualify for the Champions League for the first time in their history during the 2003\u201304 season. Sylvinho obtained a Spanish passport in 2004, granted to him after completing three years' residency in Spain. It allowed him to bypass the non-EU player restrictions in La Liga. ===Barcelona=== In 2004, after a transfer fee of \u20ac2 million, he was signed by FC Barcelona, where he won three domestic leagues, in 2005, 2006 and 2009, as well as the Champions League in 2006 and 2009. After a series of good performances in 2008, he was given an extension until 2009. He played the entire match in Barcelona's 2\u20130 victory over defending champions Manchester United in the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final, ahead of the suspended Eric Abidal, previously having been an unused substitute in the final three years earlier. This was his final game for the Catalan club. ===Manchester City=== Manchester City visited the Camp Nou on 19 August 2009 and, having beaten Barcelona 1\u20130 in a friendly, held discussions about Sylvinho joining them at the end of the month, thereby joining up with countryman Robinho. It was announced on 24 August 2009 that he had signed for City on a free transfer, with a one-year contract. He made his debut against Scunthorpe United in the League Cup. His first league appearance came on 12 December 2009 against Bolton Wanderers, following the absence of an injured Wayne Bridge. He scored his first goal for Manchester City in a 4\u20132 win against Scunthorpe in the FA Cup on 24 January 2010, with a spectacular long range strike. On 8 June 2010, it was announced that Sylvinho's contract had expired and that he would be leaving the club, along with Benjani Mwaruwari, Jack Redshaw, Karl Moore and Martin Petrov. ==International career== After receiving his first international call-up in 1997 under Mario Zagallo for a match against Russia, Sylvinho formed part of Brazil's squad for the CONCACAF Gold Cup of 1998 wherein as they eventually finished in third place, he thus won a bronze medal with the team. He thereafter made his international debut for Brazil in a friendly match against Wales at Cardiff on 23 May 2000, which ended in a 3\u20130 win. Four days later, he played in a friendly match against England in London, which ended in a 1\u20131 draw. He went on to achieve a total of 6 international caps, as a backup to Roberto Carlos at the left-back position. His last appearance with Brazil was on 28 March 2001 in a World Cup qualifier against Ecuador. ==Managerial career== On 7 July 2011, Sylvinho announced he would be retiring from football. He was hired as Cruzeiro's assistant manager on 27 September 2011. On 13 December 2014, he was appointed as Roberto Mancini's assistant coach by Italian club Inter Milan. On 20 July 2016, he joined the Brazil national team as an assistant to Tite. On 9 April 2019, he was appointed as manager of the Brazil national under-23 team ahead of the 2020 Summer Olympics, but did not take charge. ===Lyon=== On 19 May 2019, Sylvinho was announced as the replacement for Bruno G\u00e9n\u00e9sio at Olympique Lyonnais. He was sacked on 7 October 2019. ==Style of play== A quick, reliable, and technically gifted attacking left back, Sylvinho was known in particular for his overlapping runs, as well as his crossing ability with his left foot; he also possessed good tactical awareness, defensive attributes, and concentration, which also enabled him to play as a midfielder, as a wing- back, or even as a winger occasionally. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competitionHistory, soccernet.espn.go.com, accessed 14 November 2007. |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals |- |rowspan=\"6\"|Corinthians |1994\u201395 |rowspan=\"5\"|S\u00e9rie A |20||3||5||1||0||0||25||4 |- |1995\u201396 |32||3||4||2||0||0||36||5 |- |1996\u201397 |22||2||2||0||5||2||29||4 |- |1997\u201398 |34||3||6||3||0||0||40||6 |- |1998\u201399 |28||4||4||1||5||1||37||6 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !136||15||21||7||10||3||167||25 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Arsenal |1999\u20132000 |rowspan=\"2\"|Premier League |31||1||1||0||9||0||41||1 |- |2000\u201301 |24||2||0||0||7||2||31||4 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !55||3||1||0||11||2||72||5 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Celta Vigo |2001\u201302 |rowspan=\"3\"|La Liga |23||0||0||0||2||0||25||0 |- |2002\u201303 |32||1||0||0||3||0||35||1 |- |2003\u201304 |29||0||0||0||9||0||38||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !84||1||0||0||14||0||98||1 |- |rowspan=\"6\"|Barcelona |2004\u201305 |rowspan=\"5\"|La Liga |21||0||0||0||3||0||24||0 |- |2005\u201306 |26||2||3||0||1||0||30||2 |- |2006\u201307 |13||0||3||0||3||0||19||0 |- |2007\u201308 |14||0||4||0||4||0||22||0 |- |2008\u201309 |15||0||8||0||7||1||30||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !89||2||18||0||18||1||125||3 |- |Manchester City |2009\u201310 |Premier League |11||0||5||1||0||0||16||1 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Total !375||21||45||8||53||6||473||35 |} ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by national team and year |- !National team||Year||Apps||Goals |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Brazil |2000||3||0 |- |2001||3||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total||6||0 |} ==Managerial statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=2| Team !rowspan=2| From !rowspan=2| To !colspan=8| Record |- ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |- | Lyon | 24 May 2019 | 7 October 2019 |- ! colspan=3| Career totals |} ==Honours== ===Club=== Corinthians *Campeonato Paulista: 1995, 1997, 1999 *Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A: 1998 *Copa do Brasil: 1995 Arsenal *FA Community Shield: 1999 Barcelona *La Liga: 2004\u201305, 2005\u201306, 2008\u201309 *Copa del Rey: 2008\u201309 *Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a: 2005, 2006 *UEFA Champions League: 2005\u201306, 2008\u201309 ===Country=== Brazil *CONCACAF Gold Cup third place: 1998 ===Individual=== *Premier League PFA Team of the Year: 2000\u201301 ==References== ==External links== * Sylvinho at Official FC Barcelona UK Penya * Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football fullbacks Category:Sport Club Corinthians Paulista players Category:Arsenal F.C. players Category:RC Celta de Vigo players Category:FC Barcelona players Category:Manchester City F.C. players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A players Category:Premier League players Category:La Liga players Category:UEFA Champions League winning players Category:Brazil international footballers Category:1998 CONCACAF Gold Cup players Category:Brazilian expatriate footballers Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in England Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Spain Category:Expatriate footballers in England Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Naturalised citizens of Spain Category:Brazilian football managers Category:Olympique Lyonnais managers Category:Ligue 1 managers Category:Brazilian expatriate football managers Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in France Category:Expatriate football managers in France ",
