It is located in the French-speaking part of the canton in the Jura mountains. ==History== Champoz was first mentioned in 1365 as Champo. The Roman army built an observation post on the mountainside near the present day village. Very little is known about the early history of the village, but throughout its history it was owned by the bailiff of Malleray who was under the authority of the provost of Moutier-Grandval Abbey. In 1499, during the Swabian War, Imperial troops destroyed the village. Both before and after the Protestant Reformation in 1531 it was part of the parish of Chali\u00e8res. This changed in 1746 when it became part of the B\u00e9vilard parish. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Champoz became part of the French D\u00e9partement of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the D\u00e9partement of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Champoz was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. The village is located in the mountains above the Tavannes valley. Because of its location, during the 19th century the roads, railroads and industrialization of the valley bypassed Champoz.
