Voters chose seven representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Connecticut was won by Democratic nominee Barack Obama with a 22.4% margin of victory. Connecticut was 1 of the 6 states that had every county--including traditionally Republican Litchfield County--go for Obama, the others being Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Connecticut has not voted for a Republican presidential nominee since 1988 when the state was carried by George H.W. Bush over Michael Dukakis. ==Primaries== * 2008 Connecticut Democratic presidential primary * 2008 Connecticut Republican presidential primary ==Campaign== ===Predictions=== There were 16 news organizations who made state-by-state predictions of the election.

Barack Obama raised $9,727,617. ===Advertising and visits=== Obama spent $730,335 while McCain spent nothing on the state. Neither campaign visited the state. ==Analysis== Connecticut is a part of New England, an area of the country that has recently turned into a Democratic stronghold. The state went Republican in almost every election from 1952 to 1988, the exceptions being the three that took place in the 1960s. However, Bill Clinton narrowly carried it in 1992, and the state has not been seriously contested since. McCain ceded the state to Obama early on, despite Independent Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman's endorsement. In 2006, Democrats knocked off two incumbent Republicans and picked up two U.S. House seats in CT-02 and CT-05 (Joe Courtney and Chris Murphy, respectively). Although then-Governor M. Jodi Rell and Lieutenant Governor Michael Fedele were both moderate Republicans, all other statewide offices were held by Democrats. Democrats also enjoyed a supermajority status in both chambers of the Connecticut state legislature. In 2008, Democrat Jim Himes defeated incumbent Republican Christopher Shays, who was at the time the only Republican member of the U.S. House from New England, for the U.S. House seat in Connecticut's 4th congressional district. This was largely because Obama carried the district with a staggering 60% of the vote\u2014one of his best performances in a Republican-held district. Shays' defeat meant that for the first time in almost 150 years, there were no Republican Representatives from New England. In no other part of the country is a major political party completely shut out. At the same time at the state level, Democrats picked up 6 seats in the Connecticut House of Representatives and 1 seat in the Connecticut Senate. , this is the last election in which Litchfield County voted for the Democratic candidate. ==Results== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" |- style=\"background:#e9e9e9;\" ! colspan=\"6\" | 2008 United States presidential election in Connecticut |- style=\"background:#eee; text-align:center;\" ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width: 15em\" |Party ! style=\"width: 17em\" |Candidate ! style=\"width: 5em\" |Votes ! style=\"width: 7em\" |Percentage ! style=\"width: 5em\" |Electoral votes |- ! style=\"background:#33f; width:3px;\"| | style=\"width: 130px\" | Democratic | Barack Obama | style=\"text-align:right;\"| 997,773 | style=\"text-align:right;\"| 60.59% | style=\"text-align:right;\"| 7 |- ! style=\"background:#f33; width:3px;\"| | style=\"width: 130px\" | Republican | John McCain | style=\"text- align:right;\"| 629,428 | style=\"text-align:right;\"| 38.22% | style=\"text- align:right;\"| 0 |- ! style=\"background:#ddd; width:3px;\"| | style=\"width: 130px\" | Independent | Ralph Nader | style=\"text-align:right;\"| 19,162 | style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1.16% | style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0 |- ! style=\"background:#D2B48C; width: 3px\" | | style=\"width: 130px\" | Constitution (Write-in) | Chuck Baldwin (Write-in) | style=\"text-align:right;\"| 311 | style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0.02% | style=\"text-align:right;\"| 0 |- ! style=\"background:#0BDA51; width: 3px\" | | style=\"width: 130px\" | Green (Write-in) | Cynthia A.

Connecticut is allocated 7 electors because it has 5 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 7 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all sevenelectoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for president and vice president. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector. The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 15, 2008, to cast their votes for president and vice president. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols. The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All 7 were pledged to Barack Obama and Joe Biden:U. S.
