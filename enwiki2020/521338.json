On July 19, however, he handily defeated his challenger and retained his seat. A chronology of the recall effort: * February 25: The committee \"Recall Dave Hansen\" officially registered with the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board. 13,582 signatures were required by April 26, 2011 to force a recall election. He was considered to be one of the three potentially vulnerable Democratic senators. * April 21: Recall supporters filed about 18,872 signatures with Wisconsin's Government Accountability Board. * June 10: Wisconsin's Government Accountability Board certified the recall election. * July 19: Hansen defeated his recall challenger, Republican David VanderLeest, receiving 66% of the vote. == Committees == * Committee on Agriculture, Small Business and Tourism * Committee on Senate Organization * Committee on Transportation and Veterans Affairs * Committee on Universities and Technical Colleges * Joint Committee on Legislative Organization ==Decision to retire== On January 9, 2020, Hansen announced he would retire after his term ended in January 2021. He cited the desire to spend more time with his wife, young grandchildren and older grandchildren as they start their careers. Hansen said he raised the possibility of retirement during a family get together over the Christmas holiday. He says his family was very supportive of the decision. Hansen said he was proud of bipartisan cooperation to pass legislation covering senior care and the Silver Alert system. But he also lamented the declining trend away from bipartisanship. Senator Hansen's nephew, De Pere alderman Jonathon Hansen has filed to run in his uncle's senate district. ==References== ==External links== * Senator Dave Hansen at the Wisconsin State Legislature ** constituency site * Dave Hansen official campaign site * * Campaign 2008 campaign contributions at Wisconsin Democracy Campaign Category:1947 births Category:County supervisors in Wisconsin Category:Living people Category:Politicians from Green Bay, Wisconsin Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013Green Bay alumni Category:Wisconsin Democrats Category:Wisconsin state senators Category:21st-century American politicians ",
