    "text": "Sushi Pack is a Canadian-American animated children's action-adventure television series created by Tom Ruegger and Nicholas Hollander and produced by DIC Entertainment Corporation and CloudCo, Inc. that aired for two seasons and 52 episodes on the KEWLopolis programming block of CBS from November 3, 2007 to February 28, 2009. The series centers on a fictional superhero team of anthropomorphic sushi (wasabi, salmon egg, crab, tuna and octopus) as they use their wits and emotions to save the world from dastardly villains and educate young children. Quests throughout the series involve learning about friendship, social skills and teamwork. This show, along with DinoSquad, were the final two series produced by DiC before their acquisition with Cookie Jar Entertainment. With this Cookie Jar produced the second and final season. ==Characters== ===Sushi Pack=== * Tako Maki (voiced by Rick Adams) is a blue octopus who is the self-proclaimed leader of the team. He has six long tentacle arms and a fake eye patch and speaks in a British accent. Despite being part of the team, he would rather use his powers of shooting multi- colored ink to be a world-renowned painter than to fight evil. The series hints that he has a crush on Maguro. * Maguro Maki (voiced by Tara Strong) is a purple tuna who is the backbone of the team. She possesses the ability to concentrate intensely, resulting in her gaining psychic powers, including levitation, mind-reading, telekinesis and getting \"in tune with her inner tuna\". * Ikura Maki (voiced by Andrew Francis) is an orange salmon who has the power to shoot sticky fish eggs from his hands and who acts as the grunt of the team. He is usually calm, but tends to feel an urge to compete with his teammates, which causes tension within the group. This also leads him to be the target of whatever lesson the episode is explaining, but by the end of the episode, he has learned his lesson. The series hints that he has a crush on Kani. Ikura also has a fear of bears, including those that don't harm him such as gummy bears. * Kani Maki (voiced by Chiara Zanni) is a tomboyish pink crab whose pigtails are tough crab claws, which she uses to give her foes powerful pinches. She is very grouchy and often claims that other people are \"making me crabby\". In spite of that, she has her fair share of kindness and usually acts as the mechanic of the team. * Wasabi Pow (voiced by Scott McNeil) is a green wasabi creature who is the smallest and speechless member of the Sushi Pack, as well as the brute of the team. A spicy ball of hot mustard, he speaks hot sauce and can only communicate with unintelligible squeaky noises (despite this, his teammates have no trouble understanding him), as well as having the power to shoot fireballs at his foes. ===Legion of Low Tide=== * Titanium Chef (voiced by Adam Behr) is a mean catfish who not only orders the Legion of Low Tide to fight dirty and scheme evil plots, but also manages the sushi bar they live in, mostly using the Book of Cham Chop, which might be inspired by the Necronomicon. * Fugu (voiced by Scott McNeil) is a blowfish who can puff himself up to many times his original size. He mostly acts as the leader of the team like Tako. He has an eye that also functions as a camera, implying that he may be a cyborg. * Toro (voiced by Vincent Tong) is a very fat tuna who is not very smart. He acts as the brute of the team like Wasabi, and is strong but gullible and usually just follows along. * Uni (voiced by Samuel Vincent) is an unstoppable sea urchin with a talent for scheming evil plots. He is one of the Sushi Pack's biggest threats, due to being apparently unbeatable and apparently being the mechanic of the team, like Kani. And he may be insane. He has the ability to shapeshift and speaks in a Jamaican accent. * Unagi (voiced by Brian Dobson) is a mutated electric eel and slimy savage with an eye for detail. Possessing the ability of electrokinesis, he is the grunt of the team like Ikura. He helps the Sushi Pack on occasion. * Mochi Macchiato (voiced by Jeannie Elias) is a mochi ice cream creature who freezes her enemies in their tracks. She is candy coated but cold as ice, as she can freeze anything she touches. She is the backbone of the team like Maguro. In relation to this, she befriended Maguro at one time and later Kani. ===Other characters=== * Ben (voiced by Samuel Vincent) is a close friend of the Sushi Pack, as well as the manager of the doughnut shop where they live. He always gives them advice or suggestions. * Mayor Hack Martin is the mayor of Wharf City who calls on the Sushi Pack during emergencies. * Jenny Flume is the chief of police who usually has something she'd rather be doing than talking to the Sushi Pack. * Satel-Lightning (voiced by Michael Daingerfield) is a mechanical monster created via fusion of a meteor and satellite. He is initially hostile, but ultimately becomes a friend of the Sushi Pack. * Hideki (voiced by Maryke Hendrikse) is Tako's cousin, who is a purple squid. She is very kind and charming to the Sushi Pack. ===Villains=== * Apex * Sir Darkly * Paradoxter * Oleander * The Collector * The Hot Squad * Sugar Jimmy * Baron Von Loudly (voiced by Peter New) * Dr. Naught * General Anesthetic ==Series overview== ==Episodes== ===Season 1 (2007-2008)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto; background:#FFFFFF;\" ! style=\"background:#00bfff; color:#fff; text-align:center;\" |No. overall ! style=\"background:#00bfff; color:#fff; text-align:center;\" |No. in season ! style=\"background:#00bfff; color:#fff; text-align:center;\" |Title ! style=\"background:#00bfff; color:#fff; text-align:center;\" |Original air date ! style=\"background:#00bfff; color:#fff; text-align:center;\" |Prod. code |- | style=\"text-align: center;\" |1-2 | style=\"text-align: center;\" |1-2 | style=\"text-align: center;\" |\"But is it Art?/Wassup Wasabi?\" | style=\"text- align: center;\" |November 3, 2007 | style=\"text-align: center;\" |101-102 |- | colspan=\"6\"|But is it Art?: The famous paintings from the museum \u2014 Boo Boy, Groaning Pizza, Whistler's Goat and The Shrieker \u2014 are stolen and have come to life by The Collector, except for Tako's paintings.
