Elmo is located south of Abilene at the northwest corner of K-15 and K-4. ==History== 1915 Railroad Map of Dickinson County ===Early history=== For many millennia, the Great Plains of North America was inhabited by nomadic Native Americans. From the 16th century to 18th century, the Kingdom of France claimed ownership of large parts of North America. In 1762, after the French and Indian War, France secretly ceded New France to Spain, per the Treaty of Fontainebleau. ===19th century=== In 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France. In 1803, most of the land for modern day Kansas was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile Louisiana Purchase for 2.83 cents per acre. In 1854, the Kansas Territory was organized, then in 1861 Kansas became the 34th U.S. state. In 1857, Dickinson County was established within the Kansas Territory, which included the land for modern day Elmo. Elmo started about one mile from its current location, but the source of the name is unknown. When the Missouri Pacific Railroad was built through the area, the railroad didn't like the Elmo location because it was sloping ground, so it built a station at nearby Banner City (current location of Elmo).Standard Atlas of Dickinson County, Kansas; Geo. A. Ogle & Co; Page 32 of 63; 1901.] The old Elmo post office was moved to Banner City around 1887. The name Banner City already existed in Jackson and Trego counties, so eventually the Elmo name replaced it.Kansas town of Elmo now quiet after a busy past; Lawrence Journal-World; January 16, 2012. The post office was opened in Elmo on December 16, 1884, and remained in operation until it was discontinued on May 6, 1966. The railroad was removed in the 1990s. ===20th century=== In 1899, Elias Sellerds discovered a well-preserved trove of insect fossils about 3 miles south of Elmo in the Lower-Permian Elmo-Limestone member of the Wellington-Formation.A type catalog of Fossil Invertebrates (Arthropoda: Hexapoda) in the Yale Peabody Museum - Postilla 209; Russell D. White; Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University; 1994/1995. In 1925, Frank M. Carpenter begins studying the fossil bed.The Permian Insect Fossils of Elmo, Kansas; Emporia State University; 2000. In 1928, Robert John Tillyard researched the same fossil bed.R. J. Tillyard; Winds of Kansas. The Elmo site has produced tens of thousands of specimens, with more than 150 species of insects described, including large fossils of Meganeuropsis.The entomofauna of the Lower Permian fossil insect beds of Kansas and Oklahoma, USA; Roy J. Beckemeyer1 and Joseph D. Hall; 2007. The site is located on private land and closed to the public.Elmo Fossil Beds; Winds of Kansas. ===21st century=== In 2014, a group of locals adopted the Sesame Street character Elmo as its mascot to be placed on a new sign. ==Geography== Elmo is located at the northwest corner of K-15 and K-4 (also known as 600 Ave in Dickinson County), which is south of Abilene or west of Herington. ==Gallery== * Historic Images of Elmo, Special Photo Collections at Wichita State University Library Image:Welcome to Elmo.jpg|Welcome signage outside Elmo (2016) Image:Elmo church bell.jpg|Stone structure housing a statue and bell at the church (2016) Image:Elmo church statue.jpg|\"Our Lady of the Farmland\" statue (2016) ==See also== * Banner Township, Dickinson County, Kansas (location of Elmo) * Mid-June 1992 tornado outbreak ==Further reading== * Carlton Area History: Carlton - Elmo - Holland, Dickinson County, Kansas; Carlton Book Committee; Bell Books; 1995. ==References== ==External links== * St Columba Catholic Church * Elmo, Kansas, Kansas Ghost Towns * Historic Images of Elmo, Special Photo Collections at Wichita State University Library * Dickinson County Maps: Current, Historic, KDOT Category:Populated places established in 1884 Category:Unincorporated communities in Kansas Category:Unincorporated communities in Dickinson County, Kansas Category:1884 establishments in Kansas ",
