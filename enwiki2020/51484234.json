It is commonly found amongst medium to low trees in shrubland it is restricted to areas near Kalbarri and the lower part of the Murchison River. It grows in calcareous sandy soils. Grevillea trachytheca is used in gardens with dry soils that is suitable in a Mediterranean climate and in coastal areas, it can be used as an informal hedge, border planting or as a windbreak.
