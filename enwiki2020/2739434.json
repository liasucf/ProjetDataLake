He has been active since the mid-1970s and is one of the most successful artists from Trinidad and Tobago. ==Career== Ayoung was born in 1944 at Maraval Road, Port of Spain, Trinidad, one of eleven children to a Chinese Trinidadian father and an Afro-Venezuelan mother.Thompson, Dave (2002) Reggae & Caribbean Music, Backbeat Books, , pp. 81\u201383Guilbault, Jocelyne (2007) Governing Sound: The Cultural Politics of Trinidad's Carnival Musics, University of Chicago Press, , pp. 119\u2013120 As a youth he showed promise as a cricketer, but chose a career in music. He initially worked under the names Wong Ping and the Mighty Arawak, but was renamed 'Crazy' by fellow calypsonian Fred Farrell due to his extravagant performances. Crazy made his solo carnival debut in 1975 with \"The Electrician\", which was also released as a single. He followed this with \"Satan's Coming\" and \"A Great Achievement\", before signing for Eddy Grant's Ice Records label, for which he had his first hit, \"Dustbin Cover\"/\"Listen Joffre Serrette\". The two songs from the single gained him second place at the National Calypso Monarch finals in 1978. Crazy was the first artist to sing a \"Parang Soca\" song (mixing soca and hymnal Latin music) in 1978.Loubon, Michelle (2011) \"Crazy appeals to soca/parang bards: Stop the smut, keep it holy\", Trinidad and Tobago Guardian, 28 November 2011. Retrieved 25 April 2016 His debut album, Crazy's Super Album, was released in 1979 and sold over 35,000 copies in his home country. Crazy acted in the Trinidad All Theatre Productions' shows Cinderama (1980) and Snokone and the Seven Dwens (1981), and in 1982 toured Europe with the company in their re-enactment of carnival's traditional J'Ouvert opening ceremony. In 1982, he finished joint second at Road March with \"Uncle Crazy\". In 1984 he became one of the first soca artists to perform at Reggae Sunsplash. He won Road March in 1985 with \"Suck Meh Soucouyant\", and finished as runner-up in 1989.Clarke, Donald (1998) The Penguin Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Penguin, , p. 706 He pioneered the crossover genre chutney soca with his 1989 Road March entry, \"Nani Wine\", a big hit in North America and the West Indies in 1989. After a relative lack of success in the early 1990s, which included an album recorded with Byron Lee, his fortunes improved in 1997 with the release of the album Still Crazy After 25 Years, the same year finishing third in the Soca Chutney Monarch competition and reaching the final of International Soca Monarch. He continues to feature in major contests, and in 2007 placed 5th at Road March with \"Cold Sweat\".\"Trinidad & Tobago Carnival 2007 Results\", trinisoca.com.

Retrieved 25 April 2016 ==Lyrical content== Crazy's lyrics are often humorous, but have also incorporated political themes. While many of his lyrics have been risqu\u00e9, in 2011, he appealed to parang soca artists to keep lyrics 'holy' in the runup to Christmas. In contrast to the homophobic lyrics of many calypsonians, Crazy's \"Take ah Man\", with its line \"If yuh cyar get ah wooman, take ah man\", was adopted as a gay anthem in Trinidad and Tobago.Crichlow, Wesley (2003) Buller Men and Batty Bwoys: Hidden Men in Toronto and Halifax Black Communities, University of Toronto Press, , p. 62 He wrote \"Stop the Crime\" in response to the murder of state prosecutor Dana Seetahal and general level of crime in Trinidad.Fraser, Mark (2014) \"Crazy sings against crime \", Trinidad Express, 14 May 2014.
