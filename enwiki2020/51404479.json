The result of the election, with the victory of an ardent opponent of slavery, spurred the secession of eleven states and brought about the American Civil War. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !

The election was the only one in history to be decided by the House of Representatives under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution after no candidate secured a majority of the electoral vote. It was also the only presidential election in which the candidate who received a plurality of electoral votes (Andrew Jackson) did not become President, a source of great bitterness for Jackson and his supporters, who proclaimed the election of Adams a corrupt bargain. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !

The popular vote was primarily directed to filling the office of Vice President. The sole electoral vote against Monroe came from William Plumer, an elector from New Hampshire and former United States senator and New Hampshire governor. Plumer cast his electoral ballot for Secretary of State John Quincy Adams. While some accounts claim incorrectly that this was to ensure that George Washington would remain the only American president unanimously chosen by the Electoral College, that was not Plumer's goal. In fact, Plumer simply thought that Monroe was a mediocre president and that Adams would be a better one.Turner (1955) p 253 Plumer also refused to vote for Tompkins for Vice President as \"grossly intemperate\", not having \"that weight of character which his office requires,\" and \"because he grossly neglected his duty\" in his \"only\" official role as President of the Senate by being \"absent nearly three- fourths of the time\";\"Daniel D. Tompkins, 6th Vice President (1817-1825)\" United States Senate web site. Plumer instead voted for Richard Rush. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- ! Year ! Winner (nationally) ! Loser (nationally) !
