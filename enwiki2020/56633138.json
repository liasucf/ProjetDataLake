Wetmore on the ways in Superior, Wisconsin The Superior Shipbuilding Company was originally called the American Steel Barge Company, and based in Duluth, Minnesota. It was founded by Scottish Captain Alexander McDougall who founded it so he could produce his new whaleback ship, this was Whaleback Barge 101. In 1900 McDougall sold his firm to the American Ship Building Company which transferred the company to Superior, Wisconsin and renamed it Superior Shipbuilding Company. After World War One the yard stopped manufacturing ships and instead turned to repair work. They continued repairing ships until 1945 when American Ship Building Company decided to sell it. It was initially known as the Knudsen Brothers Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company. In 1955 it was renamed Fraser Shipyards and still exists today. ==Ships built== ===American Steel Barge Company of Duluth, Minnesota=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |+ |- ! scope=\"col\"|Ship ! scope=\"col\"|In service ! scope=\"col\"|Out of service ! scope=\"col\"|Length (ft) ! scope=\"col\"|Vessel type ! scope=\"col\"|Fate ! scope=\"col\"|Image |- !scope=\"row\"|Whaleback Barge 101 |1888 |December 3, 1908 |178 |Whaleback barge |Foundered 30 miles off Seal Island in the Atlantic ocean with the loss of seven lives. |150px |- !scope\"row\"|Whaleback Barge 102/Sir Joseph Wentworth |1889 |December 15, 1905 |253 |Whaleback barge |Foundered south of Cape Charles with the loss of six lives. |- !scope\"row\"|Whaleback Barge 103/John Scott Russell |1889 |May 23, 1909 |253 |Whaleback barge |Foundered Sandy Hook.
