    "text": "Dinmael was a medieval lordship and cwmwd in north Wales which usually formed a part of the patrimony of the kingdom of Powys. The name, of Old Welsh origin, means \"the King's Fort\" (Din \"fort\" + Mael \"king\") and probably refers to a now forgotten early Welsh fortress. The name survives in the name of a village in the modern county of Conwy; however the modern village is much smaller than the medieval lordship. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Llangwm, Conwy Category:History of Conwy County Borough Category:Cantrefs ",
