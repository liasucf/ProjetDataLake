He converted to Christianity, being baptised by the bishop of Argyropolis, Cyrillianus. Then he gave his fortune to the poor and was devoted to the Church. He was bishop of Byzantium from 230 to 237. Until his tenure, the cathedral was near the sea in the area of present Galata. He built one of the oldest churches in Byzantium, to honour Saint Euphemia. Nicephorus Callistus refers to him in his works as Constantine. His memory is revered on January 25. ==References== ==Sources== *The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople Category:3rd-century Romans Category:3rd- century people from Byzantium Category:Bishops of Byzantium Category:3rd- century Christian saints Category:3rd-century bishops ",
