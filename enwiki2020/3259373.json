It was released on 1 January 1985. \"Ser\u00e1\" was selected as the album's first single and it received a video, shot on May 25, 26 and 27, 1985 at the nightclub Rose Bom Bom, in S\u00e3o Paulo, directed by Toniko Melo.VILLA-LOBOS, Dado. Dado Villa-Lobos:mem\u00f3rias de um legion\u00e1rio. 1\u00aa edi\u00e7\u00e3o - Rio de Janeiro: Mauad X, 2015. p\u00e1g. 107. All tracks were already ready before the album's sessions, except for \"Por Enquanto\". Legi\u00e3o Urbana sold a total of 550,000 copis and, in 2007, the Brazilian edition of Rolling Stone magazine elected Legi\u00e3o Urbana as 40th in the 100 Greatest Brazilian Music Records. The artwork on the album cover was designed by drummer Marcelo Bonf\u00e1. == Background == In the early 1980s, then future leader of Legi\u00e3o Urbana Renato Russo was a friend of the already-established band Os Paralamas do Sucesso. Their debut album, Cinema Mudo, was in production stages and would include \"Qu\u00edmica\", a sng written by Russo. Jorge Davidson, then artistic manager of EMI Odeon, the label via which the album would be released, listened to the track and wanted to know more about Russo and Legi\u00e3o Urbana. After being promoted to artistic director of the national department, Davidson invited Legi\u00e3o Urbana to join the label, being the first band brought by him: == Production and recording == === Pre-production and Renato Rocha's arrival === The band went to Rio de Janeiro and was initially going to record only one single with two songs, but they struggled to find a producer. Marcelo Sussekind (Herva Doce) was the first to be invited (by Davidson), but he refused. They then approached Rick Ferreira, Raul Seixas' session guitarist, but artistic differences between him and the band soon brought an end to their relationship. When they were close to giving up, they received some incentive from Mayrton Bahia, then repertoire manager of EMI-Odeon. He explained them how the music industry worked and how they should behave in the face of a difficulty. Two months later, the band returned to Rio with good news: they would meet Seixas in person, since he was staying at the same hotel they were; they would record a full-length album instead of a single; and they had secured themselves a producer: Jos\u00e9 Emilio Rondeau. Rondeau himself requested EMI to be the album's producer, after learning the band had signed with the company. Their relationship with Rondeau also eroded quickly, however, specially on Bonf\u00e1's behalf. The producer once even got in his car, ready to take off and abandon the album, but Russo and Bonf\u00e1 begged him to stay. In the meantime, the band hired a fourth member: bassist Renato Rocha, who became a member after Russo (also the bassist until then) lost part of his hands movements by trying to slit his own wrists. He would be quite kept to himself initially, doing nothing beyond following Russo's inputs. He did contribute, however, to \"A Dan\u00e7a\"'s arrangement. === Recording === The band wanted to produce a \"simple work, without too many musical adornments and lots of authenticity\". Russo recorded his voice with two valve microphones; one in front of his mouth and the other above it, in order to capture reverberation. Bonf\u00e1's drums were recorded by microphones strategically positioned all over walls and windows of the studio. Rondeau worked to fulfill the band's will to create a sound that was neither too raw, nor too artificial. By editing \"Perdidos no Espa\u00e7o\" with a razor blade and duct tape, he started the trend of editing recording tapes with handicraft- like methods, in a pre-digital era. The final result did not please Russo completely. He wanted the effort to sound as if recorded live, with all members playing together. However, only \"Petr\u00f3leo do Futuro\" reached such standard. \"Gera\u00e7\u00e3o Coca-Cola\" was considered the most important song by the label's executives. However, Davidson only showed them the lyrics, fearing the \"heavy\" and \"contesting\" instrumentation could risk the contract. Actually, EMI-Odeon hoped for some folk; because of that, Davidson suggested the band to be inspired by Bob Seger and recorded the track on acoustic guitars. Many forms were attempted, including humorous versions and versions played as if for a party, but the one that made it to the album was \"less raw, but completely loyal\" to what the band wanted. === Sound === Two years after Legi\u00e3o Urbana's, Russo said: == Reception and legacy == Writing for Allmusic, Alvaro Neder gave the album 2.5 stars and said that \"like many young bands, early on they clearly lacked the confidence to assert their opinions over those of their record company\" while calling \"Ainda \u00e9 Cedo\" \"unquestionably the band's first unmitigated triumph\". In 2014, an instrumental version of \"Por Enquanto\" was used for a Brahma TV ad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. In 2016, the album was re-released as Legi\u00e3o Urbana 30 Anos in a double-album format by Universal Music. One of the discs is the original album and the other is a compilation of re-releases.Ap\u00f3s 30 anos, disco de estreia de Legi\u00e3o Urbana ganha edi\u00e7\u00e3o especial em Folha de S.Paulo - acessado 23 de mar\u00e7o de 2016Legi\u00e3o Urbana 30 Anos em Livraria Folha de S.Paulo - acessado 23 de mar\u00e7o de 2016 ==Track listing== === Legi\u00e3o Urbana 30 Anos (CD 2) === ==Personnel== Legi\u00e3o Urbana * Renato Russo \u2014 vocals, classical guitar, keyboards * Dado Villa-Lobos \u2014 electric guitar, classical guitar, sound effects * Renato Rocha \u2014 bass guitar * Marcelo Bonf\u00e1 \u2014 drums, percussion, glockenspiel Technical personnel * Ricardo Leite - cover == Sales and certifications == {| class=\"wikitable\" !
