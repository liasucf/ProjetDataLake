Whilst he initially served in the National Revolutionary Command Council under Nimeiry, he is best known for his involvement in the 1971 coup d'\u00e9tat attempt, in which he, and other pro-communist members of the Sudanese Armed Forces attempted to overthrow Nimeiry and seize power. Initially successful, after several days the Revolutionary Government collapsed when Nimeiry was freed by loyalist military units. Following the failed coup attempt Atta and the other ringleaders were executed. ==Early life and education== Atta was born on 12 March 1936 in Omdurman in what was then Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. He went on to graduate from high school in 1957, and immediately joined the Sudanese Air Force, graduating from the Air Force Academy as a Second Lieutenant in 1959. ==Military career== He then proceeded to study in the United Kingdom from 1962 to 1963, in West Germany from 1963 to 1964, and in the United Arab Republic and United States in 1965.
