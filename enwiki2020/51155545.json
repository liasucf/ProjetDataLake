He was a wagon-maker by trade, and served as a lieutenant in the 1st Iowa Cavalry during the American Civil War. with Shriver went into farming in the 1870s, and they left this house at that time. He went on to serve as the Clerk of District Court from 1882 to 1887. The Shrivers left Iowa for California in 1890 because of Martha's health. She died there that same year, and William returned to Iowa permanently in 1900. The 1\u00bd-story structure is composed of locally quarried limestone. It features chamfered rustication, two octagon-shaped stone chimneys, cut out bargeboards with a pendant post at the gable peak, and a full-length Greek Revival-style front porch (a later addition). The rear frame addition and porch was built in either the late 19th century, or the early 20th century. The roof dormers are early 20th century additions. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1865 Category:Vernacular architecture in Iowa Category:Houses in Winterset, Iowa Category:National Register of Historic Places in Madison County, Iowa Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa ",
