    "text": "Hypernorms are a concept from Business ethics that applies to principles so fundamental that, by definition, they serve to evaluate lower-order norms, reaching to the root of what is ethical for humanity. They were first proposed by Thomas Donaldson and Thomas W. Dunfee \u201cWhen ethics travel: the promise and peril of global business ethics\u201d by Thomas Donaldson and Thomas W. Dunfee, California Management Review, Summer 1999; 41, 4; ABI/INFORM Global pg. 45 as part of an integrative social contract model of business ethics.Social Contract Theory and Gender Discrimination: Some Reflections on the Donaldson/Dunfee Model Don Mayer; Anita Cava Business Ethics Quarterly, Vol. 5, No. 2, Social Contracts and Business Ethics. (Apr., 1995), pp. 257-270. Donaldson and Dunfee have described hypernorms as: > \"principles so fundamental that they constitute norms by which all others > are to be judged. Hypernorms are discernible in a convergence of religious, > political and philosophical thought. An \"authentic norm\" is one that is > generated within a community's moral free space and which satisfies the > requirements of terms 1 and 2 of the macrosocial contract. Authentic norms > are based upon the attitudes and behaviors of the members of their source > communities. A \"legitimate norm\" is an authentic norm that is compatible > with hypernorms.\"Pr\u00e9cis for Ties that Bind* Thomas Donaldson Thomas W. > Dunfee > http://lgst.wharton.upenn.edu/donaldst/Documents/Summary%20of%20Ties%204tjd%20for%20Personal%20Web%20Page.pdf > & Business & Society Review 105(4) ==References== Category:Business ethics Category:Applied ethics ",
