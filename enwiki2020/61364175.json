It is stationed in the capital of Belgrade to provide musical support to the President of Serbia and the Serbian Government. == History == The band in 1904. In spring 1831 the \"Serbian Prince\u2019s Band\", which was raised that year, became a part of the bodyguard of the Prince of Serbia (then-Milo\u0161 Obrenovi\u0107). The chief of the band was bandmaster Josip Slezinger who was sent to Kragujevac by his brother Jevrem, the chief of the \u0160abac Administrative Centre. Dressed in ornate uniforms, the bands performed during plays in the theatre of Prince Joakim Vujic. During that period many Serbian newspapers and other media organizations published articles in which they compared the band with the most experienced on the European continent, including the French Republican Guard Band and the Band of the Grenadier Guards. In 1899, Serbian composer, conductor, and pedagogue Stanislav Bini\u010dki began collaborating with the Belgrade Military Band and at the beginning of the 20th century, he founded the \"Royal Guard\" band on the basis of the Prince's Band, being the only professional band at that time in the country.http://www.vs.rs/en/article/AF8F3BDCED8211E4ABAB00163E135070/guard- representative-orchestra\u041a\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0438\u045b \u041a\u0440\u0435\u0448\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0438 \u0441\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0438 \u201e\u041c\u0443\u0437\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0458\u0430\u201d \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434 \u0417\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0431 1971. During his time with the band, he introduced its members to a more classical repertoire with pieces such as Franz Schubert's 8th Symphony and Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Slavonic Dances. On 16 May 1945, the Band of the Serbian Guard was re-founded by order of Marshal Josip Broz Tito. It continued the tradition pioneered by partisan bands in popularizing songs and music from the National Liberation War and became a cultural institution that developed a wide artistic culture throughout the Yugoslav People's Army. The task of the band at the time was to perform protocol duties at the highest of bodies in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on behalf of the JNA. With the collapse of the SFRY, the Guard Orchestra remained within its scope of work. Protocol tasks at the highest state level, representation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Serbia and Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia and the Armed Forces both at home and abroad have remained the band's primary responsibility to the Serbian people. == Traditions == 150px A lot of the pieces in the repertoire of the band are written by composer and pedagogue Stanislav Bini\u010dki, who wrote common marches such as the Gardiski mar\u0161, Mar\u0161 na Drinu and the Paradni Mar\u0161. Unlike the rest of the army, the band does not perform the traditional high step and before 1975, the goose step when on parade. === Uniform === Royal blue and black with red trim are the colors used in the full dress uniform worn by its musicians, which are also worn by personnel of the Guards Unit. The Band's musicians, as well as the drum major, wear the peaked cap with this uniform. === Ensembles === In accordance with organizational and forming needs, it was increased and decreased numerically, which also led to the change of its name. As a rule, the best musicians who played on two or more instruments formed part of the band. Thanks to this fact, as well as to the needs indicated, the Band can be organized into the following ensembles: * Concert band * Symphony orchestra * Chamber orchestra * Chamber brass, woodwind or string ensembles * Big band/disco orchestra == Notable activities == *Performed at the opening of the Serbian Ossuary of Belgrade Defenders (1914-1918) at the Belgrade New Cemetery in the presence of Presidents Aleksandar Vucic and Emmanuel Macron on 15 July 2019. During the ceremony, it performed famous songs such as Tamo daleko.http://www.significantcemeteries.org/2019/07/president-emmanuel-macron- visiting-new.html?m=1 *Non-Aligned Movement Summit in 1961 and 1989. *Public holidays in Serbia **Statehood Dayhttp://www.vs.rs/sr_cyr/vesti/883BBC73188311E8A3510050568F6690/promenadni- defilei-vojnih-orkestara-i-prikaz-naoruzanja-po-gradovima **Victory Day *Military parades **\"Parade 85\" on Bulevar kralja Aleksandra **Belgrade Military Parade on Nikola Tesla Boulevard on 16 October 2014, during the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Belgrade. **\"The Defence of Freedom\" Victory Day Parade in the city of Ni\u0161 in Southern and Eastern Serbia. *Military tattoos **Modena International Military Tattoo (2001) **International Military Music Festival at Albertville (2002) **Linz Military Bands Festival (2010) **Bremen Tattoo (2011)http://www.politika.rs/scc/clanak/166209/%D0%94%D1%80%D1%83%D1%88%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE/%D0%93%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B4%D0%B8%D1%98%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3-%D1%83-%D0%91%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%83 *Liege Festival of Military Bands marking the centenary of the outbreak and end of World War I (2014 and 2018)http://www.mod.gov.rs/eng/13017/reprezentativni-orkestar-garde-zadivio- belgiju-13017 *1984 Winter Olympics *Vukov sabor *Arrival ceremonies at the Palace of Serbia *Guards Day *Day of the Serbian Armyhttp://www.mod.gov.rs/cir/10912/promenadni-defilei-vojnih-orkestara- povodom-dana-vojske-10912 == List of conductors == Since its founding in 1945, the director of the Guards Band have been: * Toma\u017e Zajc (1945-1948) * Iso Dracula (1948-1955) * Gvido Uchakar (1956-1963) * Gojko Bo\u0161njak (1963-1972) * Mihailo Petras (1972-1973) (First term) * Franc Klinar (1973-1977) * Mihailo Petras (1977-1984) (Second term) * Ilija Ilijevski (1984-1992) == References == Category:Military bands Category:National symbols of Serbia Category:Military units and formations of Serbia Category:Wind bands Category:Military units and formations established in 1945 Category:Musical groups established in 1945 Category:1945 establishments in Serbia Category:Military units and formations established in 1831 Category:Musical groups established in 1831 Category:1831 establishments in Serbia ",
