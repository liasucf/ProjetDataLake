    "text": "Scow at Grand Canyon The Grand Canyon of the Fraser is a short gorge on the Fraser River in central British Columbia about 30km upstream from the confluence of the Bowron River and about 100km due east of downtown Prince George, British Columbia. Just downstream of the canyon, which pierces a rocky ridge, is a stretch of water called Scow Rapids, where towropes from the gorge's banks dragged vessels and rafts upstream. The canyon is located in the section of the Sugarbowl-Grizzly Den Provincial Park and Protected Area that is about 6km south-southwest of Hutton. This stretch of the river is commonly confused even by journalists with the much more impressive Fraser Canyon, which runs south from the city of Williams Lake to the town of Hope.https://theprovince.com/travel/grand+canyon+north+hidden/10177629/story.html ==History== The canyon head, 106 miles from Fort George via the Fraser,Fort George Herald: 21 Jan 1911; 15 Apr 1911; 20 May 1911; & 3 to 24 Jun 1913 progressed into dangerous rapids.Fort George Herald, 27 May 1911 In 1909, the Nechacco was the first sternwheeler to navigate the treacherous canyon.Fort George Tribune, 25 Jul 1914 During 1912\u201313, railway construction scows negotiated the canyon.
