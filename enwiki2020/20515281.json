Most of the residents, as is common in Nepal, depend on agriculture but in the last few years the trend of going to the gulf countries as workers is increasing. The Town is yet to have any prominent business house but is a growing market with a number of small industries, hotels and shops. Being linked with some major cities Dharan & Itahari of the Sunsari District, this Town holds a very good chance of development. There is one community radio station also, named Sunsari FM\u2026 There are number of schools and a higher secondary school in the Town and almost all the children go to primary school and higher school. But the fraction of students continuing their studies to higher level is somehow not too great because of the low economic status of the people. Most of the residents are Hindu but there is also a small area of Islam people in the village. The village is rich in temples and there is also a mosque and a church. At the time of the 2011 Nepal census it had a population of 85237 . ==Climate== The weather in Barah Municipality is mostly hot. Chakraghatti Pulaha experiences 6 seasons, {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
