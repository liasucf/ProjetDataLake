    "text": "Down to Believing is the eighth studio album by singer/songwriter Allison Moorer. It is her first for new label eOne Nashville and sees her reunited with producer Kenny Greenberg who produced her first two albums. The album was recorded over two years and inspired by events in her personal life during that time including her divorce from Steve Earle and her young son's diagnosis with autism. ==Critical reception== The album earned Moorer some of the best reviews of her career with Uncut Magazine observing that \"Out of the pain and anger, Moorer has fashioned the finest album of her career\" http://www.metacritic.com/music/down-to-believing/allison-moorer while AllMusic wrote it was \"an emotionally raw yet aesthetically fine album. She may have reached into the depths for these songs, but she's delivered us the gift of a burning light.\" Thierry C\u00f4t\u00e9 of Exclaim! wrote that \"even in the rare moments when the production comes dangerously close to generic modern country sheen, Moorer's voice remains a warm, unwavering instrument and the songs are never less than deeply affecting and emotionally resonant.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Chad Cromwell - drums * John Deaderick - keyboards * Dan Dugmore - 12-string electric guitar, steel guitar, mandolin * Fred Eltringham - drums, percussion * Kenny Greenberg - acoustic guitar, electric guitar * Jedd Hughes - acoustic guitar * Jon Conley - banjo, acoustic guitar, mandolin * Brad Jones - upright bass * Tim Lauer - keyboards * Rachel Loy - bass guitar * Tony Lucido - bass guitar * Eamon McLaughlin - strings, string arrangements * Steve Mackey - bass guitar * Allison Moorer - acoustic guitar, piano, tambourine, lead vocals, background vocals * Bryan Owings - drums * Russ Pahl - acoustic guitar, steel guitar * Ben Phillips - drums * Lex Price - bouzouki * Michael Rhodes - bass guitar * Mike Rojas - keyboards ==Chart performance== The album debuted on the Top Country Albums chart at No. 26, and No. 8 on the Heatseeker Albums chart, with 1,600 copies sold for its debut week.
