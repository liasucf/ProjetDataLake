She married on 2 February 1556 in Gera Henry V of Plauen, Burgrave of Meissen (1533\u20131568). The wedding of the financially ailing burgrave was celebrated with splendor: 1,500 guests were there, with 970 horses, 250 of them noblemen.

This treaty led to the loss of Vogtland.Archive for the Saxon History, Volume 10, B. Touchnitz, 1865, p. 140 (digitized) From her marriage, Dorothy Catherine had four sons, all named Henry.
