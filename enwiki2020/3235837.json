    "text": "Hack Kampmann (6 September 1856 \u2013 27 June 1920) was a Danish architct, Royal Inspector of Listed State Buildings in Jutland and professor at the architecture department of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. Marselisborg Palace in Aarhus, built between 1899 and 1902, is among his best known works. Marselisborg Palace in Aarhus == Biography == His parents were Christian Peter Georg Kampmann, a parish priest, and Johanne Marie Schmidt. He entered the architecture department of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1873 and graduated in 1882, receiving the school's prestigious small gold medal (\"Lille guldmedalje\") for the design of a \"Swimming bath in the Italian Renaissance style\". Kampmann went on numerous study trips throughout Europe, paid for by several scholarships, including northern Italy, Greece and Sweden. He also attended the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1882 and worked with professor Jacques Hermant. Back home in Denmark, he became a prolific architect, designing private villas, private art museums, commercial buildings, churches, as well as both small state buildings, such as post offices, and large ones such as royal palaces. Among his major works are the Provincial Archives of Northern Jutland (1890\u201391) in Viborg, Jutland ; the Aarhus Theatre (1898\u20131900); Marselisborg Palace (built 1899\u20131902 as a wedding gift from the people to Crown Prince Christian (later Christian X); the extension to the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen; and the Copenhagen Police Headquarters, Copenhagen (1918\u20131922). Kampmann was initially one of the leading Danish proponents of National Romantic style. However, during the 1920s he adopted the Nordic Classicism style, becoming one of its main initiators. One of his more notable works is one of the culminations of the style, the Police Headquarters in Copenhagen (1918\u201322) (in a team with Aage Rafn, Holger Jacobsen and F. Fredriksen) was among the initiators of 1920s Nordic Classicism. This last building was completed after his death in summer 1920 by his two sons, Christian and Hans J\u00f8rgen Kampmann, together with Rafn. Kampmann also was responsible for a number of building restoration projects, notably Aarhus Cathedral (1907\u201320). As professor of architecture at the architecture department of the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1908 to 1918 he lectured on domestic architecture as well as the great architecture of the world, especially the visual effects of the Greek temple. In his watercolours he managed to capture the overall impression; the characteristic \"wet style\" seen in the watercolours of Aage Rafn, Steen Eiler Rasmussen and Aarne Jacobsen goes back to Kampmann. Kampmann is one of the most influential architects in Danish architectural history.Entry \"Hack Kampmann\", in Simo Paavilainen (ed.), Nordic Classicism 1910\u20131930, Helsinki: Museum of Finnish Architecture, 1982. == Awards == He was made a Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog (1897), awarded Dannebrogsmann (1906) and the King's Medal of Merit in Gold (1900). == Personal life == He was married during 1888 to Johanne Holm (1868\u20131920).
