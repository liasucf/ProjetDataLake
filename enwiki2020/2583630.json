Leicester City Council purchased a 99-year lease of the theatre in 1974. Between 1974 and 2007 the theatre was operated by The Leicester Theatre Trust. The trust vacated the theatre in 2007 when it moved to the newly built Curve Theatre, Leicester in Leicester's Cultural Quarter. The last show held at the Haymarket by the Leicester Theatre Trust was Wizard of Oz starring Helena Blackman and Ceri Dupree in 2006. The theatre was closed in 2007 and remained so for the next 10 years. In June 2016 the management of the theatre was taken over by an organisation known as the Haymarket Consortium who undertook that it would be re-opened as a performance, training and e-sports venue. The theatre was re- opened for performances on 2 March 2017 and a formal opening ceremony took place later that year. The theatre closed again in March 2020, during the Coronavirus pandemic and entered liquidation on 22 May 2020. ==Metal Tree sculpture== The Metal Tree sculpture by Hubert Dalwood, located at the front of the entrance to the Haymarket Theatre, was the only major piece of abstract sculpture in the city centre for many years. It was unveiled in 1974.http://www.haymarketshoppingcentre.com/sculpture/ ==Notable productions== * Oliver! in 1977 directed by Robin Midgley and featuring Roy Hudd * Me and My Girl in 1984 directed by Mike Ockrent and featuring Robert Lindsay, Emma Thompson, and Frank Thornton * Macbeth in 1984 directed by Nancy Meckler and featuring Bernard Hill and Julie Walters * M Butterfly in 1989 directed by John Dexter and featuring Sir Anthony Hopkins * Murders in the Rue Morgue in 1989 directed by Simon Usher * The Ghost of Daniel Lambert in 1981 and featuring Perry Cree * Joseph & The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat in 1973 directed by Robin Midgley and featuring Maynard Williams as Joseph ==Image gallery== File:Leicester Haymarket Theatre exterior.jpg|Red-brick exterior to the theatre File:Leicester Haymarket Theatre interior.jpg|Foyer area demonstrating Brutailst architecture File:Leicester Haymarket Theatre auditorium.jpg|The main auditorium has 901 seats File:Leicester Haymarket Theatre stage.jpg|alt=The main stage is the largest in England|The main stage is the largest in England File:Leicester Haymarket Theatre Metal Tree Sculpture.png|Metal Tree sculpture ==See also== * Curve (theatre) * Little Theatre (Leicester) * Sue Townsend Theatre * De Montfort Hall ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Leicester Category:Theatres in Leicester Category:Culture in Leicestershire ",
