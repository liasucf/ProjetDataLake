Peter and Paul), Milan - 7 December (S. Ambrose). In South Tyrol, the holiday is instead on Whit Monday (which is also a public holiday in North Tyrol and the rest of German-speaking Europe). Public holidays and local saints' days are not transferred when they fall on a weekend. The number of working days given over to public holidays therefore varies year by year.
