    "text": "Alex Cecchetti (Terni, Italy, 1977) is an Italian artist, poet and choreographer based in Paris and London. == Works == \"Alex Cecchetti has developed a unique practice, difficult to classify, that could be called art of avoidance: tactical and poetic, aesthetic and materialistic, its system leads to produce specific situations that can exist both inside and outside the traditional exhibitions. His staging of an invisible choreography, exposing naked body in a public space, hidden even to the artist himself, and whose impossible documentation is the final production of the work, reveals a principle of both discontact and shift that is the actual core of his work voluntarily heterogene in its diverse forms, but united in the method. Collaborative, Alex Cecchetti engages the viewer physically and intellectually, in a concrete experience where his work is perceived as a mental thing and the thought as a form. \"\"La vie mat\u00e9rielle, Yann Chateign\u00e9\", catalogue was published on the occasion of La vie mat\u00e9rielle exhibition, presented at the Fondation d'entreprise Ricard, Paris, 2013 Since 2014 Alex Cecchetti created and curates a program of poetry and science, Voices of Urgency:\"Voices of Urgency\" , Foire internationale d'art contemporain, FIAC, Paris a series of four events in which poetry enters in dialogues with science to play a fundamental role within our society.
