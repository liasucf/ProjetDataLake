The film depicts his intellectual and emotional relationship with an intellectual who leads the life of a simple farmer in a remote village. The story unfolds through the writer's bus journey to visit him. This film never released in theaters. ==Cast== * Murali as Writer VKV * M.G. Soman as Abraham Sir * Karamana Janardhanan Nair as Kariyachan * Anand as Thomaskutty * Asha Jayaram as Molly * Shyama as Molykutty's sister * Aliyar as Man in the bus *Kaveri as Child in the bus ==Critical response== For plumeriamovies Arjun Anand wrote, Yaathrayude Anthyam is the most simplest film of the writer, it almost feels like a stretched out slice-of-life episode. But the filmmaking is quietly engaging. Death is a very melodramatic subject. If his contemporaries, Padmarajan in his Moonnam Pakkam, Lohithadas in Bharatham or Dennis Joseph in Akashadoothu among others, treated death and grief with melodrama and exuberant poignance, KG George\u2019s take on the subject\u2015just like any other work of his\u2015is subdued, objective and intellectual. The profoundness in his writing is not literary like MT/Lohi, it\u2019s rather rational. ==References== ==External links== * *Yaathrayude Anthyam ponders on death and grief through the radical lenses Category:1991 films Category:Indian films Category:1990s Malayalam-language films Category:Films directed by K.
