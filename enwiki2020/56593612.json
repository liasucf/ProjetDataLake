    "text": "Locksmith Animation is a British animation studio founded by Sarah Smith and Julie Lockhart in 2014. It is based in London, England, and claims to be the only high-end computer-animation studio in the UK making computer-animated family films. ==History== The studio was founded in 2014 by Sarah Smith and Julie Lockhart with the financial backing of Elisabeth Murdoch. In April 2014, visual effects/animation studio Double Negative formed a deal with Locksmith where it will provide the computer animation for Locksmith's films. In May 2016, Locksmith formed a production deal with Paramount Pictures, with Paramount acting as the distributor for Locksmith's films to be produced under the Paramount Animation label. The following year, however, Paramount abandoned its deal with Locksmith when Paramount chairman and CEO Brad Grey was replaced by Jim Gianopulos. In September 2017, Locksmith formed a multi- year production deal with 20th Century Fox, which will distribute Locksmith's films under the 20th Century Fox Animation label, with Locksmith aiming to release a film every 12\u201318 months. The first film to be released under the production company will be Ron's Gone Wrong, which is set to be released on April 23, 2021 by 20th Century Studios. In October 2019, while Disney took over 20th Century Animation, Locksmith formed a new multi-year production deal with Warner Bros., which will distribute future Locksmith films under the Warner Animation Group label after the release of Ron's Gone Wrong, which will now be the only Locksmith film to be distributed by 20th Century Studios. ==Productions== ===Feature films=== ====Upcoming films==== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! width=10 | # ! width=275 | Title !! width=100 | Release date !! style=\"width:135px;\" class=\"unsortable\"| !! style=\"text-align:center;\" width=150 | Co-production with !Distributor !! width=20 | Animation service(s) |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1 || style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ron's Gone Wrong || style=\"text-align:right;\"| |||| style=\"text-align:center;\" |20th Century Animation | style=\"text-align:center;\" |20th Century Studios || style=\"text-align:center;\" |DNEG |- |} ==References== Category:British animation studios ==External links== * ",
