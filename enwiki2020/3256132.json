    "text": "Goodbye, Columbus is a 1969 American romantic comedy-drama film starring Richard Benjamin and Ali MacGraw, directed by Larry Peerce and based on the 1959 novella of the same name by Philip Roth. The screenplay, by Arnold Schulman, won the Writers Guild of America Award.. The story's title alludes to a phonograph record played by the brother of MacGraw's character, nostalgically recalling his athletic career at Ohio State in Columbus. The film was essentially MacGraw's film debut, as she had previously had only a \"bit part\" in the previous year's A Lovely Way to Die. ==Plot== Neil Klugman is an intelligent, working-class army veteran and a graduate of Rutgers University who works as a library clerk. He falls for Brenda Patimkin, a wealthy Radcliffe student who is home for the summer. They meet by the swimming pool at Old Oaks Country Club in Purchase, New York, a private club that Neil visits as a guest of his cousin Doris. They face obstacles from Brenda's family (particularly her mother), due to differences in class and assimilation into the American mainstream. Brenda's family are nouveau riche, their money coming from the successful plumbing supply business owned and run by her father. Brenda herself is old enough to remember \"being poor\". Other conflicts include propriety and issues related to premarital sex and the possibility of pregnancy and Mrs. Patimkin's envy of her daughter's youth. After a few dates, Brenda persuades her father to invite Neil to stay with them for two weeks. This angers her mother, who feels that she should have been asked instead. Neil enjoys being able to sneak into Brenda's room at night but has misgivings over her entitled outlook, which is reflected in her spoiled and petulant younger sister, and her naive brother Ron, who misses the hero worship he enjoyed as a star basketball player at Ohio State University. Neil is astonished when Brenda reveals that she does not take birth control pills or use any other precautions to avoid pregnancy. She angrily rejects Neil's concerns. He prepares to leave, but she decides to persuade him to stay by agreeing to get a diaphragm. At the end of his stay, Neil attends Ron's wedding to Harriet, who was his college sweetheart from Ohio. Brenda returns to Radcliffe in the fall, keeping in touch by telephone. She invites Neil to come up to spend a weekend at a Boston hotel. However, once they are in the hotel room, Brenda tells Neil she just received letters telling her that her mother found her diaphragm and that her parents know about their affair. They argue, with Neil asking why she left it to be found unless she wanted it to happen. Siding with her parents, Brenda ends the affair as abruptly as she allowed it to commence. Neil walks out of the hotel, leaving her alone in the room. ==Cast== * Richard Benjamin as Neil Klugman * Ali MacGraw as Brenda Patimkin * Jack Klugman as Ben Patimkin * Nan Martin as Mrs. Ben Patimkin * Michael Meyers as Ron Patimkin * Lori Shelle as Julie Patimkin * Monroe Arnold as Uncle Leo * Kay Cummings as Doris Klugman * Sylvie Strause as Aunt Gladys * Ilona Simon as Gloria Feldman * Royce Wallace as Carlotta, the African- American cook and housekeeper at the Patimkin home. * Mari Gorman as Simp (Laura Simpson Sockaloe) ==Reception== ===Box-office=== The film earned an estimated $10.5 million in rentals at the North American box office, making it one of the most popular movies of the year.\"Big Rental Films of 1969\", Variety, 7 January 1970 p 15. ===Critical response=== Variety magazine lauded the film upon its release, writing, \"This adaptation of Philip Roth's National Book Award-winning novella is sometimes a joy in striking a boisterous mood, and otherwise handling the action. Castwise the feature excels. Richard Benjamin as the boy, a librarian after serving in the army, and Ali MacGraw, making her screen bow as the daughter of wealthy and socially-conscious parents, offer fresh portrayals seasoned with rich humor. Their romance develops swiftly after their meeting at a country-club pool.\"Variety. Staff film review, April 3, 1969. Last accessed: February 19, 2011. The New York Times film critic, Vincent Canby, liked the film but was annoyed that it strayed from Roth's work. Canby wrote: > Thus, at its center, Goodbye, Columbus is sharp and honest.

Critic Dennis Schwartz praised the film as well, writing, \"Philip Roth's prize-winning novella, a scathing satire of a nouveau riche Jewish family, has been brilliantly adapted for the screen by Arnold Schulman (received an Academy nomination) and directed by Larry Peerce (son of the great operatic tenor Jan Peerce). Somehow it slipped under the radar and as far as I'm concerned is both funnier and more perceptive than even The Graduate, an earlier drama about young adults.\"Schwartz, Dennis.
