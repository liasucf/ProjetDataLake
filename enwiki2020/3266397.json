He represented England at under-21 level and played for Saint Kitts and Nevis at full international level. ==Club career== ===West Ham United=== Newton began his career in the academy at West Ham United and signed a professional contract in August 1998, but he did not win a call into the first team squad during the 1998\u201399 season. He had a successful season with the youth team, winning the FA Youth Cup and scoring in both legs of the final. After making his professional debut while on loan to First Division club Portsmouth early in the 1999\u201300 season, Newton made his West Ham United debut on his return to Upton Park, as a substitute for Marc Keller in a 1\u20130 Premier League defeat to Coventry City on 25 September 1999. He made two further substitute appearances during the 1999\u201300 season and understudied right back Trevor Sinclair, but did not appear for the club again and had further spells away on loan during the 2000\u201301 and 2001\u201302 seasons. Out of favour with new manager Glenn Roeder, Newron was released by West Ham at the end of the 2001\u201302 season. ===Peterborough United=== After rejecting a contract with his previous loan club Leyton Orient, Newton joined Second Division club Peterborough United on a free transfer in May 2002. He quickly established himself in the team and made 249 appearances and scored 9 goals during six seasons at London Road and celebrated promotion to League One with the club at the end of the 2007\u201308 season. After dropping down the pecking order following the arrival of Russell Martin at the end of the 2007\u201308 season, Newton's contract was terminated by mutual agreement. He made 249 appearances and scored 9 goals during his . ===Brentford=== In June 2008, Newton joined League Two club Brentford on a one-year contract, effective 1 July 2008. At the start of the 2008\u201309 season, Brentford manager Andy Scott named Newton club captain, but he later lost the captaincy to Kevin O'Connor after a spell out injured. Newton was released by Brentford at the end of the season, having helped the Bees win the League Two title. He made 39 appearances and scored one goal during the season, which came in a 3\u20130 victory over Luton Town on the final day. ===Luton Town=== On 28 May 2009, Newton signed a two-year contract with newly-relegated Conference Premier club Luton Town. Newton made 67 appearances and scored four goals over the over two seasons with the club and was a team which reached the 2011 Conference Premier play-off Final. On 2 June 2011, it was announced that Newton's contract would not be renewed and that he had been released by the club. ===Woking=== On 27 June 2011, Newton signed for Conference South club Woking. Despite briefly retiring during the 2015 off-season, he stayed with the club for five seasons and was a part of the team which finished the 2011\u201312 season as Conference South champions. Newton retired at the end of the 2015\u201316 season, after making 169 appearances and scoring four goals for the club. In his retirement, Newton occasionally played for Sunday League club Downs. == International career == Newton was capped once by England at under-21 level, in a 6\u20131 friendly victory over Georgia in August 2000. In 2004, he was one of three UK-based players to be called up by Saint Kitts and Nevis for the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign. He won seven caps and scored one goal for Saint Kitts and Nevis between 2004 and 2015. == Personal life == After retiring from football, Newton became a London taxi driver. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup ! colspan=\"2\" |Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals !Apps !Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- | rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"center\" |West Ham United |1999\u201300 | rowspan=\"2\" |Premier League |2||0||0||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |1Appearance(s) in UEFA Cup |0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |3||0 |- |2000\u201301 |0 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |0 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |0 |0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !2 !0 !0 !0 !0 !0 !1 !0 ! colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 !3 !0 |- | rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"center\" |Portsmouth (loan) |1999\u201300 |First Division |3||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |2||0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |5||0 |- | rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"center\" |Notts County (loan) |2000\u201301 |Second Division |20||1||2||0||0||0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||0||0||22||1 |- | rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"center\" |Leyton Orient (loan) |2001\u201302 |Third Division |10||1||0||0||0||0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |10||1 |- | rowspan=\"7\" valign=\"center\" |Peterborough United |2002\u201303 | rowspan=\"2\" |Second Division |36||2||1||0||1||0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||1Appearance(s) in Football League Trophy||0||39||2 |- |2003\u201304 |37||2||3||1||1||0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||3||0||44||3 |- |2004\u201305 |League One |30||0||3||0||0||0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||0||0||33||0 |- |2005\u201306 | rowspan=\"3\" |League Two |40||3||2||0||1||0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||3||0||46||0 |- |2006\u201307 |43||1||4||0||2||0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||1||0||50||1 |- |2007\u201308 |32||0||2||0||2||0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014|||1||0||37||0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !218!!8!!15!!1!!7!!0 ! colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 !9!!0!!249!!9 |- | rowspan=\"1\" valign=\"center\" |Brentford |2008\u201309 |League Two |35||1||1||0||1||0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||2||0||39||1 |- | rowspan=\"3\" valign=\"center\" |Luton Town |2009\u201310 | rowspan=\"2\" |Conference Premier |37||2||5||2|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||0||0||42||4 |- |2010\u201311 |19||0||0||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||2Appearance(s) in Football Conference play-offs||0||21||0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !56!!2!!5!!2!! colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 ! colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 !2!!0!!63!!2 |- | rowspan=\"6\" valign=\"center\" |Woking |2011\u201312 |Conference South |38||0||1||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||1Appearance(s) in FA Trophy||0||40||0 |- |2012\u201313 | rowspan=\"3\" |Conference Premier |43||0||1||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||2||0||46||0 |- |2013\u201314 |37||1||1||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||2||0||40||1 |- |2014\u201315 |35||3||2||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||5||0||42||3 |- |2015\u201316 |National League |1||0||0||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||0||0||1||0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !154!!4!!5!!0!! colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 ! colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 !10!!0!!169!!4 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Career total !498!!17!!28!!3!!10!!0 !1 !0!!24!!0!!560!!18 |} ==Honours== ;West Ham United *FA Youth Cup: 1998\u201399 ;Peterborough United *Football League Two second-place promotion: 2007\u201308 ;Brentford * Football League Two: 2008\u201309 ;Woking * Conference South: 2011\u201312 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:People from Grays, Essex Category:England under-21 international footballers Category:Saint Kitts and Nevis footballers Category:Saint Kitts and Nevis international footballers Category:West Ham United F.C. players Category:Portsmouth F.C. players Category:Notts County F.C. players Category:Leyton Orient F.C. players Category:Peterborough United F.C. players Category:Brentford F.C. players Category:Luton Town F.C. players Category:Woking F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:English Football League players Category:National League (English football) players Category:Black English sportspeople Category:English people of Saint Kitts and Nevis descent Category:Association football defenders ",
