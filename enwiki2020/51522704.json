    "text": "Salom\u00e9 is an oil painting on canvas, by Moretto da Brescia, from 1540. == Description == The oil painting on canvas measures 56 x 39 centimeters, and is in the collection of the Pinacoteca Tosio Martinengo in Brescia. The painting depicts Salome dressed in expensive clothes and a rich fur, laying a golden scepter in her left hand. Long hair are twisted together with a green veil and pearl strands. The figure of the woman seems to rest on a marble plaque placed in the foreground, over which, in black characters, there is the inscription \"QVAE SACRV[M] Ioanis CAPVT SALTANDO OBTINVIT\". The background is covered by some laurel trees == Analysis == The work is also known by the name of Tullia d'Aragona, or more often, Tullia d'Aragona as Salome, though the identification with the historical character of Tullia d'Aragona is without references. The work, according to critics, inaugurates the late production of the artist, where Moretto is much freer in composition and colors than previous works, in the style of Titian. == History == The original patron of the painting is unknown, and it appears for the first time in historical documents in a 19th-century inventory of Count Teodoro Lechi, reported under the title Herodias with fur and a wand in his hand. He then transferred it to other owners, in Brescia, and on 20 July 1814 it was used in exchange to obtain the Baptism of Saint Catherine by Paolo Veronese. The painting was then bought by Count Paolo Tosio in 1829 and along with the rest of the noble collection entered the Pinacoteca Tosio Martinengo in 1846.Pier Virgilio Begni Redona, pag. 354 The painting has been restored in 1986, and the operation has freed the painted surface from previous fillings, recovering almost completely the brilliance of the original color scheme. == Notes == == References == * Guido Biagi, Un'et\u00e9ra romana, in \"Nuova antologia di scienze, lettere e arti\", vol.4, fasc.16, 1886 * Rossana Bossaglia, La pittura bresciana del Cinquecento.
