Most of the families that eventually settled there came from Provemont, Michigan (now Lake Leelanau in Leelanau County, Michigan) and from French areas of Ontario. This is mentioned in a 1991 interview with Cecelia Bussey: http://leelanauhistory.pastperfectonline.com/archive/027AC0DE-312F-4F0F-85A1-643695582517. On the outskirts of Plamondon is a community of Old Believers (Old Ritualists), a Traditionalist Russian Orthodox sect whose ancestors broke from the Church after Patriarch Nikon's reforms in 1666. The schism, or Raskol, resulted over reforms in church ritual and translation intended to better align the Russian church with Greek Orthodox practices. The Old Believers that live outside Plamondon are bezpopovtsy, or priestless Old Believers, who believe that apostolic succession ended with Nikon's apostasy and therefore have no clergy and refuse the Eucharist. Most of these families moved to the area in the mid 1970s from Woodburn, Oregon, also home to a large Old Believer community. Many also came from Xinjiang, China, by way of New Zealand, where they fled after the Communist revolutions in Russia and China. == Demographics == As a designated place in the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Plamondon recorded a population of 348 living in 136 of its 172 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 345.
