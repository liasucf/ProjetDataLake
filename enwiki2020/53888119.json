    "text": "Red Force is a steel launched roller coaster located at Ferrari Land within PortAventura World in Salou, Catalonia, Spain. The ride was manufactured by Swiss manufacturer Intamin and opened on 7 April 2017. With a height of and a maximum speed of , Red Force is the tallest and fastest roller coaster in Europe as of 2019. ==Characteristics== ===Ride experience=== Once the train leaves the station, it is accelerated by linear synchronous motors from zero to in 5 seconds. The train then ascends a tall top hat, twisting 90 degrees to the right. Once the train goes over the top hat, it descends back down, again twisting 90 degrees to the left. This sends the train travelling parallel to the launch track but in the opposite direction. The train then enters a flat brake run and then ascends a small airtime hill before entering the final set of brakes. ===Trains=== Red Force's trains have three cars each. Each car seats four riders, allowing a total of 12 riders per train. The ride can accommodate approximately 1,200 riders per hour. ===Track=== The steel track of Red Force is approximately long and tall. The track is dark grey and the supports are red. ===Launch=== Red Force uses linear synchronous motors to accelerate the train from 0 to in 5 seconds. The ride uses supercapacitors to store and dissipate the energy needed to launch the train, reducing the peak load from the power grid necessary to launch the coaster. ==See also== *Top Thrill Dragster *Kingda Ka *2017 in amusement parks ==References== Category:Gigacoasters Category:Steel roller coasters Category:Roller coasters introduced in 2017 Category:Roller coasters in Spain Category:Operating roller coasters Category:Launched roller coasters Category:Roller coasters manufactured by Intamin ",
