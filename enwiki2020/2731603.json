    "text": "Tisab Ting, or, The Electrical Kiss is an 1896 Canadian science fiction novel, written by Ida May Ferguson of New Brunswick under the pseudonym Dyjan Fergus. The book is set in late 20th century Montreal and features an \"electrical genius\": a \"learned Chinaman\" who woos and wins a Canadian wife through his superior scientific knowledge as embodied in \"the Electrical Kiss.\" The book is an early version of the melodrama as social commentary. The key idea of a device capable of forcing one to love another against their will could have been a complex exploration of a woman's thoughts and feelings and whether they are artificially induced. However, according to a contemporary reviewer, the admitted novelty of the subject matter and plot of this \"startling\" work did not excuse this \"young lady writer\" for writing which was weak and without skill (it was her first and apparently only book).unsigned review \"Canadian Fiction\" The Canadian Magazine Vol. VIII No. 3 (January, 1897); p. 284 It is of interest mainly because of its early publication date.Ketterer, David, Canadian Science Fiction and Fantasy, Indiana University Press, 1992; p. 17 The University of Alberta Libraries published a microfiche copy of the book in 1980.Fergus, Dyjan, Tisab Ting, or, the Electrical Kiss, Hunter, Rose, Toronto, 1896 (reproduced 1980), ==References== Category:1896 Canadian novels Category:Canadian science fiction novels Category:Novels set in Montreal Category:Novels set in the 20th century Category:Works published under a pseudonym Category:1896 science fiction novels ",
