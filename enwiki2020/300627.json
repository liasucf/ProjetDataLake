Munnar is situated at around above mean sea level, in the Western Ghats mountain range. Munnar is also called the \"Kashmir of South India\" and is a popular honeymoon destination. ==History== The tradition that Col Arthur Wellesley, later to be the Duke of Wellington, leading a British detachment from Vandiperiyar to Bodinayakanur, then over the High Range and into the Coimbatore plains to cut off Tippu Sultan's retreat from Travancore, was the first Englishman in the High Range appears to be belied by the dates involved. If the story is a dozen years too early for Wellesley, it is quite possible that some other officer in General Meadow's Army may have had that distinction. Unfortunately, no record of that pioneering mountain crossing has been traced. What is available is a record of the surveying of this terrain in 1816-17 by Lt Benjamin Swayne Ward, son of Col Francis Swayne Ward to whom we owe many of the early views of Madras and South India Now available in lithprints. Ward and his assistant Lt Eyre Connor were on orders to map the unexplored country between Cochin and Madurai and so they followed the Periyar into the mountains and then headed north into what at that time was described as \"the dark impenetrable forests of the High Range\". They lost men to at least one elephant charge, suffered agony from leech bites and once ran so short of food that a deer run down and being feasted on by wild dogs was manna for the party and their jungle guides. The subsequent report by Ward and Connor was to lead to the Periyar Dam project, completed only in the 1890s,but for the present they were more pre occupied getting into the mountains that they could see towering in the distance from Bodi. Then, on 14 October 1817, \"the weather having improved the ascent into the High Range began\". Their first major camp was at a flat promontory at 6000 feet. And this was ever afterwards to be known as Top Station. Moving north, they saw to their south the Cardamom Hills, a slope 45 miles long and 30 wide from the heights above Bodi stretching into Travancore. To their north there appeared to be grasslands on high rock peaks. And in front of them, \"an outstanding mountain, shaped like an elephant\u2019s head\". On 8 November, they established camp at the confluence of three rivers, which they judged to be the centre of the district, and from Munnar (\"Moonar \u2013 three rivers), as it came to be known, they surveyed the area, discovered the ancient village of Neramangalam in ruins but surmised that it might well have been from here that ivory and peacock feathers, pepper and cardamom, sandalwood and other timber went to the lands to the West across the Arabian Sea\". It was to be nearly 50 years later that Sir Charles Trevelyan, Governor of Madras, instructed Col Douglas Hamilton to explore the hill country in the western part of the Madras Presidency, requesting special advice on the feasibility of establishing sanatoria for the British in the South and of developing revenue- earning projects without endangering the environment, as had happened in Ceylon where coffee had destroyed not only the rain forest but also paddy cultivation in the north \u2013 central rice bowl of ancient Ceylon. Marching south along the Anamallai, Hamilton saw \"the grandest and most extensive (view) I have ever beheld; some of the precipices are of stupendous magnitude and the charming variety of scenery comprising undulating grassy hills, wooded valleys, rocky crags, overhanging precipices, the green rice fields far below in the valley of the Anchanad, the grand mass of the Pulunies (beyond) and the blue ranges in the far distance, present a view far beyond my power to describe\u2026\" On 7 May 1862, Hamilton set out to climb Anaimudi, following a \"well worn elephant path, ascending the opposite slope by a series of short zigzags that were so perfect and regular that we could scarcely Eravikulam plateau (later Hamilton\u2019s Plateau), watered by two streams, one of which bordered the Eravikulam swamp before cascading down 1000 feet in a beautiful waterfall. Separating the plateau from Anaimudi was a deep, thickly forested ravine \u2013 later called Inaccessible Valley and, detouring it, they began the climb from the east to the peak. On our return, we followed an elephant path for several miles, the gradient of this path was truly wonderful, these sagacious animals avoiding every steep or difficult ascent, except at one hill which was cleverly zigzagged, owing to masses of sheer rock preventing a regular incline being taken.\" It was to be 15 years later before another report came in. But this was more significant from the viewpoint of this history, for though it came as a result of the shikar expeditions of the ever-exploring John Daniel Munro, he was an opener \u2013 up of land and a pioneering planter first and a shikari second. Reporting on the High Range in 1877, he wrote, \"Exclusive of the low Unjenaad valley which is not above 3100 feet, the area within these boundaries may be roughly estimated at 200 square miles with an elevation over 5000 ft \u2026 Much of this is worthless land, but there is a good deal fit for cultivation \u2026 Coffee \u2026 would succeed well at a somewhat lower elevation, and Tea and Cinchona would grow miles available for these purposes, and there being the great inducement of a good climate, it will doubtless not be many years before these fine hills get occupied\". And Munro, who always had a long \u2013 range view of things, indeed proved right again. Mention has already been made of the journey into these hills by Henry Turner and his half \u2013 brother \u2018Thambi\u2019 A W Turner, the concessions that Munro, then Superintendent of the Cardamom Hills for the Raja of Travancore, got them from the Raja, and the Society the three of them formed in 1879 with Rs 450,000 capital. The agreement they entered into with the Rajah read in part: \"The annual sum of one half British rupee on every acre of land other than grassland comprised in such deed which has already been or shall hereafter from time to time be opened up for the purpose of cultivation or otherwise\". While Thambi Turner began in 1879 clearing the forest round the Devikulam camp, later to become the taluk headquarters, Henry returned to Madras and began looking for others willing to take up land here. The first to do so was Baron George Otto Von Rosenberg of Dresden and his sister who were kin of the Turners by marriage. The Baron opened up Manalle, later a part of the family's Lockhart Estate, and it was developed by his son Baron John Michael in the 1890s, the first tennis court in the hills being added. It was property that was to remain for years in the family. Then came A H Sharp, who opened up Parvathi in the wilds and planted the first tea, to be followed by C Donovan. In1881 came E J Fowler to open up Aneimudi Estate and in 1882, C O Master and G W Claridge, C W W Martin, a fellow of Henry Turner's in the Madras Civil Service, sent his 18 \u2013 year \u2013 old nephew Aylmer Ffoulke Martin (Toby) to open Sothuparai near Chittavurrai in 1883 and Toby Martin ever seemed to be clearing new land for others after that. Other estates of this era were H M Knight's Surianalle, Panniar belonging to J A Hunter and K E Nicoll and the Turners\u2019 Talliar where the last coffee in the High Range flourished on 700 acres. Every one of them benefited from the experience of Ceylon planter John Payne, whom Henry Turner \u2018imported\u2019 in 1881. Payne not only opened up Talliar with coffee for the Turners, but he taught his fellow planters in the High Range road tracing, draining and general thottam work. He also cut a riding road, Payne's Ghat, from Devikulam to Periakanal and opened the district up to \u2018civilisation\u2019. In the Eighties, it was only their indomitable will that kept the planters going in this wilderness. They lived in grass \u2013 thatched huts with mud and wattle walls and surrounded their homes with elephant trenches. The only medical aid each planter had was \"his own medicine chest and he had to doctor himself and his coolies with only Doctor Short\u2019s old book on Medicine in India to help him\". It was 1889 before the pioneers saw the first European woman in the hills. That was when Baron Otto brought up his wife, the daughter of Henry Gribble of the Madras Civil Service; another Gribble girl married one of the Turner brothers. And in 1890 Toby Martin brought his bride \u2013 and they were to live decades in these hills. An event which helped considerably to improve the lives of the early planters was when Claridge and Toby Martin descended from Top Station to Bottom Station (Koranganie at the head of the Bodi Pass) and went on to Bodinayakanur. There they met Suppan Chetty, who appeared to be the village leader, and negotiated him to send up rice and other provisions by headload and bring down cinchona bark and other products for onward transport. Soon bullocks, donkeys and ponies were brought in to help. This link with Suppan Chetty and his adopted son Alaganan Chetty, later an M L A, was to continue into recent times with their successors, M/s A S Alaganan Chetty & Sons. Another event of significance was the arrival of John Ajoo, A Chinese, at Talliar Estate. One of six Chinese brought out by the East India Company to advice on tea planting and manufacture in the Nilgiris, he was recruited by Henry Turner and sent to the High Range. A small field of tea around the Munnar Estate Manager's bungalow was once 13 acres in extent and used to be called \u2018Chinaman\u2019s Field\u2019. John Ajoo's son Antony later owned a small estate called Vialkadavu next to Talliar in which the Turner family long retained an interest. By 1894, 26 estates, all of them small \u2013 holdings, were functioning on the Society's lands but none was doing well as the cinchona boom began to go bust. The Society, by now, was in financial difficulties and it advertised its land widely in British and Indian newspapers. One of the first to respond was the North and South Sylhet Company, a subsidiary of Finlay Muir, arrived in India in December 1894 to finalise the transaction, then decided to visit the High Range with his son James and P R Buchanan and W Milne (from Ceylon). Accompanying them was H M Knight, a pioneer in the Anamallais and at the time a prominent proprietary planter. James Muir's record of that journey from 17 December 1894 till 5 January 1895 is not without interest, revealing as it does the conditions of the times. It reads in excerpts: > \u2026arrived at Madras on the morning of the 12th December \u2026 next few days were > occupied in negotiations regarding the purchase of the shares of the \u2026 > Society \u2026and Rs 69/- per share was the price arranged to be paid after > deductions for losses and money spent during the year ended 30 November > 1894\u2026 \u2026 We arrived at Ammayanayakanur at 11:30 am the train being 23 minutes > late, and \u2026 had dinner at 6 pm and about 7\u2019o clock started in the bullock > transit \u2013 there being four of these carts altogether \u2013 to do some 40 miles, > to a village called Tayne(Theni).

The rope way was an ingenious construction, 2 > \u00bc miles in length and dropping 5000 feet, built by Gideon and William Kemle > from Periyar Dam scrap. The ropeway was opened in 1900 with great fanfare > and provided splendid service for many years. Mrs Martin described it \" as a > great and wonderful undertaking.

A > monorail trameline was laid from Munnar to Top Station along the road. Large > platforms, fitted with one large wheel to run on the road and a smaller > wheel to run on a single rail, were drawn by bullocks. Later, ponies, posted > at intervals, were used and speeded traffic from about 4 mph to 6 mph. The > tea chests were loaded on the platforms and if passengers wanted to use the > \u2018tram\u2019 two easy chairs were placed on the platform and luggage piled all > around them; from Top Station the passengers would have to tolerate the > discomfort of bandies to reach Bottom Station and onwards. A tea chest moved > from Kannan Devan to England the Davidson way went through various > adventures, which is perhaps why Davidson became Sir Leybourne.

P R > Buchanan took over as General Manager in 1901 and there began the fastest, > most extensive opening up of the High Ranges, virgin jungles being felled, > often with armed watchmen providing the workmen protection from the > elephants and other wild life. When, in 1908, he started building a 2\u2019 gauge > light steam railway to replace the monorail, another link was added in this > ingenious transport chain; the train would bring chests up to the point the > tracks had been completed, then the goods were headloaded and taken to what > was left of the monorail and its platform!

Herbert Lloyd Pinches now took over and, taking a cue > from the way the ropeway and the pioneering Munnar Factory were powered, he > started the Munnar Valley Electric Works, which supplied power to nine > factories within a radius of six miles.

The first > path of this ropeway, work on which was started in 1925, was in three > sections, Top Station to Chittavurrai Estate, from there to Sothuparai and > Pattupatty, then the third stretch to Munnar.

The former Kunda Valley Railway in Munnar was destroyed by a flood in 1924, but tourism officials are considering reconstructing the railway line to attract tourists. ==Etymology== The name Munnar is believed to mean \"three rivers\",Munnar History referring to its location at the confluence of the Mudhirapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundaly rivers. ==Location== Geographic coordinates of Munnar is 10\u00b005\u203221\u2033N 77\u00b003\u203235\u2033E. Munnar town is situated on the Kannan Devan Hills village in Devikulam taluk and is the largest panchayat in the Idukki district covering an area of nearly . ===Road=== Munnar KSRTC bus stand Munnar is well connected by both National highways, state highways and rural roads. The town lies in the Kochi - Dhanushkodi National highway (N.H 49), about from Cochin, from Adimali, from Udumalpettu in Tamil Nadu and from Neriyamangalam. Distance from major cities * from Kochi - Ernakulam - 150 km ===Railway=== The nearest major railway stations are at Ernakulam and Aluva (approximately by road). The Nearest Functioning Railway station is at Udumalaipettai. ===Airport=== The nearest airport is Cochin International Airport, which is away. The Coimbatore and Madurai airports is from Munnar. ==Administration== The panchayath of Munnar formed in 1961 January 24 is divided into 21 wards for administrative convenience. Coimbatore district lies in the north, Pallivasal in south, Devikulam and Marayoor in east and Mankulam, Kuttampuzha panchayaths in the west. * Vaguvarai * Chokkanad * Iravikulam * Kannimalai * Periyavarai * Munnar colony * Ikkanagar * Old Munnar * Chatta Munnar * Nallathanni * Sivanmalai * Munnar town * Cholamalai * Kadalar * Rajamalai * Kallar * Lakkam * Thalayar * Lakshmi * Nadayar * Moolakkada ==Flora and fauna== Tea plantations at Munnar Most of the native flora and fauna of Munnar have disappeared due to severe habitat fragmentation resultant from the creation of the plantations. However, some species continue to survive and thrive in several protected areas nearby, including the new Kurinjimala Sanctuary to the east, the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, Manjampatti Valley and the Amaravati reserve forest of Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary to the north east, the Eravikulam National Park and Anamudi Shola National Park to the north, the Pampadum Shola National Park to the south and the proposed Palani Hills National Park to the east. ==Endemic species== A Nilgiri tahr at Rajamalai near Munnar These protected areas are especially known for several threatened and endemic species including Nilgiri Thar, the grizzled giant squirrel, the Nilgiri wood-pigeon, elephant, the gaur, the Nilgiri langur, the sambar, and the neelakurinji (that blossoms only once in twelve years). ==Land ownership== There has been action to address the problems of property takeovers by the land mafia that have, according to successive governments, plagued the area. In 2011, the government estimated that 20,000 hectares of land had been illegally appropriated and launched a campaign of evictions that had first been mooted in 2007. ==Things to do in Munnar== There are four major directions in Munnar; Mattupatty Direction, Thekkedy Direction, Adimaly Direction and Coimbatore Direction. The climate and tea plantations are the main reason for tourism in Munnar. Tourists come here to see the plush green carpet that is strewn all around. The tourist count increases every year with a major number during the months of April\u2013May when summer vacations begin across the country. In 2018, a huge number of tourists is expected during the months of August\u2013September when the kurinji blooms once in 12 years. === Mattupatty Direction === === Thekkedy Direction === === Adimaly Direction === * Pothamedu View Point * Spices Plantation Visit * Cheeyapara Water Falls * Chengulam Dam === Coimbatore Direction === * Eravikulam National Park * Anamudi Peak * Marayur Sandle Forest * Lakkan Water Falls * Muniyara === Other Direction === * Munnar Tea Museum ==Geography and climate== The region in and around Munnar varies in height from to above mean sea level. The temperature ranges between and in winter and and in summer.
