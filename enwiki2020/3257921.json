    "text": "Arthur & George (2005) is the tenth novel by English author Julian Barnes which takes as its basis the true story of the \"Great Wyrley Outrages\". ==Plot introduction== Set at the turn of the 20th century, the story follows the separate but intersecting lives of two very different British men: a half- Indian solicitor and son of a Vicar, George Edalji, and the world-famous author of the Sherlock Holmes stories, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Roughly one- third of the book traces the story of Edalji's trial, conviction, and imprisonment for a crime he did not commit. About one-third of the book traces the story of Doyle's life and his relationships with his first wife Louisa Hawkins and his platonic lover Jean Leckie. Roughly one-third of the book concerns Doyle's attempt to clear the name of Edalji and uncover the true culprit of the crime. Julian Barnes called it \"a contemporary novel set in the past\" and the book does not aim to stick closely to the historical record at every point. ==Characters in Arthur & George== *George Edalji, solicitor in Birmingham *Charlotte Edalji n\u00e9e Stoneham, George's mother *Shapurji Edalji, George's father, vicar of Great Wyrley *Maud Edalji, George's sister *Mr. Meek, George's lawyer *Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the famous author *Jean Leckie, Conan Doyle's second wife *Louisa Doyle n\u00e9e Hawkins, Doyle's wife *The Mam, Arthur's mother *Connie, Arthur's sister *Willie Hornung (E.
