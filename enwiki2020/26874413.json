Located near Point Pleasant in Clermont County, it is a heavily stratified site, with nearly 8,000 years of occupation. Excavations at the site have yielded a large number of artifacts, including bones, chert, pottery, and shells. Cultures represented at the site range from Early Archaic to Fort Ancient, along with various Woodland cultures.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 1.

Because of the wide range of artifacts from so many cultures present at Clarke Farm, it has been recognized as a premier archaeological site. It is believed that the evidence of multiple cultures in succession at the site may contribute to an understanding of the succession of various cultures in the region. The archaeological value of the site led to its placement on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. ==References== Category:Archaeological sites in Ohio Category:Archaic period in North America Category:National Register of Historic Places in Clermont County, Ohio Category:Fort Ancient culture Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio Category:Woodland period ",
