    "text": "The Saint-Pierre river is a tributary of the east bank of the Saint-Regis River. The Saint-Pierre river flows in the municipality of Saint-R\u00e9mi (in Les Jardins-de-Napierville Regional County Municipality), and Saint-Constant (in Roussillon Regional County Municipality), in the administrative region of Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie, southwest of Quebec, in Canada. The river surface is generally frozen from mid-December to the end of March. Safe traffic on the ice is generally from late December to early March. The water level of the river varies with the seasons and the precipitation. == Geography == The main hydrographic slopes neighboring the Saint-Pierre river are: * north side: Saint-Regis River, St. Lawrence Seaway, Saint Lawrence River; * east side: Rivi\u00e8re de la Tortue (Delson); * south side: Noire River (rivi\u00e8re de l'Esturgeon); * west side: rivi\u00e8re de l'Esturgeon (Ch\u00e2teauguay River). The Saint-Pierre river takes its source from a set of agricultural streams (notably the Cordon and Marcotte streams) draining the area north of the town of Saint-R\u00e9mi. From Saint-R\u00e9mi, the Saint-Pierre river flows north into agricultural land. The river is bordered on the east by route 209. After crossing under the Autoroute 30 bridge, the Saint-Pierre river crosses north the town of Saint-Constant where it collects the waters of the western branch coming from the village of Saint-Isidore; then it crosses the territory of the cities of Saint-Constant, Delson and Sainte-Catherine. The mouth of the Saint- Pierre river is just north of the route 132 where it flows on the east bank of the Saint-Regis river. The mouth of the latter is located very close to the C\u00f4te-Sainte-Catherine lock, 3 km upstream of the mouth of the rivi\u00e8re de la Tortue (Delson). == Toponymy == The toponym \"Rivi\u00e8re Saint-Pierre\" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec.Commission de toponymie du Qu\u00e9bec - Bank of Place Names - Toponym: \"Rivi\u00e8re Saint-Pierre\" == References == == See also == * Les Jardins-de- Napierville Regional County Municipality * Roussillon Regional County Municipality * St. Lawrence River, a stream * St. Lawrence Seaway * Rivi\u00e8re de la Tortue (Delson), a stream * Saint-R\u00e9mi, a city * Saint-Constant, a city * List of rivers of Quebec Category:Rivers of Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie Category:Roussillon Regional County Municipality ",
