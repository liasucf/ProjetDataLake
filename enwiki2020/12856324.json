    "text": "Sir Peter Lely The Worsley family is an English family that is derived from Sir Elias de Workesley, a Norman knight who was a youth at the time of the Norman conquest. He later accompanied Duke Robert II of Normandy (elder son of William the Conqueror) on the First Crusade and was buried at Rhodes. Sir Elias had settled at Workesley, Lancashire, which later became known as Worsley, and the family seat was Worsley Hall. The family were seated at Worsley for over four hundred years and spawned a number of branches. One of these, the Worsleys of Appuldurcombe, has now died out in the male line, though represented by the Earls of Yarborough. Another, the Worsleys of Booth, is represented in the female line by the Tindal-Carill-Worsley family, formerly of Platt Hall.

The hall was bought by Ralph Worsley (1625) from the Platt family. Ralph Worsley's father, Charles, was the great grandson of Sir Geoffrey Worsley of Boothes and a kinsman of the Worsleys of Worsley Hall (from whom derived the Worsleys of Appuldurcombe and of Hovingham). Raph Worsley's son, Major-General Charles Worsley, was an eminent Parliamentary soldier in the English Civil War. Having reduced the Isle of Man in 1650, he commanded the troops who accompanied Oliver Cromwell into the British House of Commons in 1653, when Cromwell ordered Worsley to 'seize that bauble', whereupon he seized the mace, which was kept at Platt Hall for many years. Worsley later became major general for Lancashire, Cheshire and Derbyshire in the Rule of the Major Generals. On his death, in 1657, he was buried with great pomp in Westminster Abbey and is the only Parliamentarian whose remains still lie buried there. Charles Worsley's family remained at Platt Hall until 1906, when it was sold to the Manchester Corporation, due to the encroachment of the city on its estate. Elizabeth Tindal-Carill-Worsley, who sold the estate, was the granddaughter of the explorer and physician Sir Francis Sacheverel Darwin, son of the eminent scientist, physician and poet Dr Erasmus Darwin. She married Nicolas Tindal of Aylesbury, a great grand-nephew of Sir Nicholas Conyngham Tindal, Lord Chief Justice of England from 1829 \u2013 1843. Their grandson, Group Captain Nicolas Tindal-Carill-Worsley (known as Tindal), was a bomber pilot in the Second World War and a major instigator of the \"Great Escape\". His son, Charles Tindal, is the current representative of the family. ==See also== * Appuldurcombe House * Earl of Yarborough * Darwin-Wedgwood family ==Notes== ==References== *Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).
