She wrote poetry in both German and Slovak, founded the first Slovak women's journal Dennica, and went on to write plays and novels. She became widely known for her novel Sirota Podhradsk\u00fdch (The Podhradsk\u00fds' Orphan, 1889) which was deemed suitable for girls. ==Early life and education== Ter\u00e9zia Medveck\u00e1 was born with a twin brother in Zvolensk\u00e1 Slatina on 18 April 1857. She was the seventh child of Ter\u00e9zia (n\u00e9e Langeov\u00e1) and the Lutheran pastor Samuel Medveck\u00fd. After completing elementary school, she attended the private school of K. Orfanides in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica and that of T. F\u00e1bryov\u00e1 in Rimavsk\u00e1 Sobota but like most girls of the times, she did not receive a gymnasium education. She nevertheless became fluent in German and Hungarian in addition to her native Slovak, thanks in part to her own voracious reading. ==Poetry and editing== In 1875, on marrying the Lutheran pastor J\u00e1n Vansa, the couple moved to Lomni\u010dka where Vansov\u00e1 began writing poetry in both German and Slovak. Her first work Moje piesne (My Songs, 1875) was a rather awkward collection of poems in German but was followed with more mature verses published in the local Karpathenpost. From 1881, the couple lived in P\u00edla where Vansov\u00e1 worked as a writer, organizer and editor. In 1895, she became associated with the Slovak women's association \u017divena, acting as vice-president and editing the \u017divena almanacs. In 1898, Vansov\u00e1 founded the first Slovak magazine for women, Dennica (Morning Star) which she edited until 1914. It presented stories, poems and essays by women writers as well as articles on fashion, food, married life and the women's movement around the world. With the establishment of Czechoslovakia in 1918, she edited Slovensk\u00e1 \u017eena (Slovak Woman) from 1920 to 1923, although she no longer considered it to be \"her magazine\" as Dennica had been. ==Publications== As for her own publications, she is remembered mainly for her prose. In Prvotina (1889), she parodied the romantic sentimentality of articles in the popular German magazines, of which she was sometimes guilty herself. Her short stories frequently addressed relationships in a world of prejudice, such as the marital problems in Rozsob\u00e1\u0161en\u00ed (Divorced, 1884), caused by misunderstandings and prejudice. In 1889, she published Sirota Podhradsk\u00fdch (The Podhradsk\u00fds' Orphan), the first Slovak novel written by a woman. Its success stemmed from the psychological development of her characters, complex moral relationships, and a dramatic plot. ==Later life== After her husband's suicide in 1922, Vansov\u00e1 continued to write and to help others with their writing. She died on 10 October 1942. Today Vansov\u00e1 is remembered for her romantic novels which were popular with schoolgirls for several decades but are no longer widely read. She also made a mark in the Slovak national movement. Although she was also active in the women's movement, her impact was less successful as the movement itself failed to make any real progress in Slovakia. ==References== Category:1857 births Category:1942 deaths Category:20th-century Slovak women writers Category:20th- century Slovak writers Category:19th-century Slovak women writers Category:19th-century Slovak writers Category:People from the Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica Region Category:Slovak women poets Category:Slovak dramatists and playwrights Category:Slovak novelists Category:Women novelists Category:19th-century poets Category:Women dramatists and playwrights ",
