It was based on the play What Say They? by James Bridie. ==Premise== A young woman visiting a Scottish university in search of her uncle, who is in hiding from the authorities, is mistaken for the principal's secretary, so she pursues the impersonation. ==Cast== * Duncan Macrae as Professor Hayman * Joseph Tomelty as Dan McEntee / Connell O'Grady (writer) * Patrick Barr as Sir Archibald Asher * Charles Hawtrey as Adolphus Hayman, President of Temperance Society * Diane Hart as Ada Shore / posing as \"Miss Lamplighter\" (pending new principal's secretary) * Robert Urquhart as Sheltie * Edward Lexy as Lord Carshennie * Roddy McMillan as Mr Milligan, President of Students' Union Council * Jacqueline Mackenzie as Nellie * Eric Woodburn as the Bedellus * Molly Urquhart as Lady Duffy * Ronnie Corbett as Mr Freddie Mather, President of the Men's Union * Reginald Beckwith as BBC Commentator ==Critical reception== The Radio Times has described it as a \"theatrical comedy,\" which was \"shakily brought to the screen...the story involves mistaken identity, Celtic poetry, horse racing and the rigging of Rectorial elections. Blink and you'll miss Ronnie Corbett in what, of course, can only be described as a small role.\" ==References== ==Bibliography== * Harper, Sue & Porter, Vincent.
