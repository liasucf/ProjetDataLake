    "text": "The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority operates 170 bus routes (list of routes) in the Greater Boston area, many of which were formerly part of a large streetcar system. Some routes are for local transport within the city; others bring passengers from surrounding areas to stops on the MBTA Commuter Rail or subway lines. The MBTA has a policy objective to provide transit service within walking distance (defined as ) for all residents living in areas with population densities greater than within the MBTA's service district. Much of this service is provided by bus. The MBTA operates a four- route bus rapid transit service branded as the Silver Line, as well as three crosstown routes that were intended to become the first part of the now- suspended Urban Ring project. Fifteen routes designed as key routes run with higher frequency at all times, including extended service hours on Friday and Saturday nights over some of these routes. Most MBTA bus service is served by diesel, compressed natural gas, and diesel-electric hybrid buses. Silver Line routes running in the Waterfront tunnel use dual-mode buses that operate as trolleybuses in the tunnel and as diesel buses on the surface. Four routes based out of the Harvard bus tunnel run with trolleybuses in Cambridge and several surrounding suburbs. All buses and routes are wheelchair-accessible (see MBTA accessibility); most of the MBTA's bus fleet consists of low-floor buses with wheelchair ramps, while older high-floor buses have lifts. All buses have LED exterior headsigns displaying route and destination, with automated audio/visual stop announcements for passengers. After taking over operations in August 1964 from the former Metropolitan Transit Authority, the MBTA began rebranding many elements of Boston's public transportation network. After being found unsuitable in 1965 for what is now the Orange Line because it did not show up well on maps, yellow was chosen for the color of bus operations on January 8, 1972. The Boston Elevated Railway and MTA operated overnight Owl service until 1960. From September 2001 to June 2005, the MBTA operated bus service on 17 routes (7 normal bus routes and 10 routes replicating subway lines) until 2:30am on Friday and Saturday nights. Similar service on the key routes was operated from March 2013 to March 2014. In 2017, the MBTA Board considered a proposal to run all-night service on several routes with pulsed connections at a central hub. ==Fleet== ===Active fleet=== This is the current bus roster for the MBTA . All buses are wide; most buses are length, while 102 are articulated buses. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Order Year!! Manufacturer!! Model!! class=\"unsortable\" | Picture!! Fleet!! Qty.!!

Potential future orders include the 45-bus option order for extended-battery range hybrid buses (of which #1294 is a test bus). The MBTA may begin a phased 500-bus order in 2020, with delivery from 2021\u20132025. Under that plan, the agency would establish a continuous procurement process with 100 new buses per year, and buses retired after 12 years. ==Facilities== thumb|right|MBTA bus routes grouped by the facility they operate from at peak hours (2016) MBTA buses are operated out of nine facilities. The MBTA plans to replace Quincy Garage with a larger facility near Quincy Adams station. {|class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Name ! Address ! Routes !

However, some routes that connect with MBTA bus or subway service are operated by outside private contractors with partial subsidy by the MBTA. Five routes \u2013 the , /, , and \u2013 are numbered like other MBTA buses. The five routes are primarily commuter routes which connect with other MBTA services at their inbound terminals. They were taken over from various private operators (Hudson Bus Lines for the 710 and 716, Rapid Transit Inc. for the 712/713, and Nantasket Transportation for the 714). The 712 and 713 use MBTA-provided buses and accept Charliecards; the other routes do not. Four suburban municipalities contract with outside operators for local circulator routes, most with partial MBTA subsidy. Bedford and Beverly run single routes, Burlington runs five routes, and Lexington runs six. Most are run by private operators, except for the Beverly Shuttle, which is part of the Cape Ann Transportation Authority system. Additionally, a nonprofit shuttle is run in Boston's Mission Hill neighborhood. Those routes appear on MBTA system maps and connect with MBTA services at designated transfer points, but are numbered separately and do not accept MBTA passes. ==References== == External links == * MBTA \u2013 bus schedules and maps * MBTA \u2013 Better Bus Project Category:Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Category:Bus transportation in the Boston area ",
