    "text": "\"Last Christmas\" is a song by English pop duo Wham!, released on Epic Records, and internationally on MCA Records in December 1984, on a double A-side with \"Everything She Wants\". It was written and produced by George Michael, and has been covered by many artists since its original release. The song reached No. 1 in Denmark, Slovenia, and Sweden and No. 2 in nine countries: Belgium, Germany, Netherlands, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Norway, New Zealand and United Kingdom. Wham! donated all of their royalties to the Ethiopian famine. In a UK-wide poll in December 2012, it was voted eighth on the ITV television special The Nation's Favourite Christmas Song.\"The Nation's Favourite Christmas Song\". ITV. 22 December 2012. It was the most-played Christmas song of the 21st century in the UK until it was overtaken by \"Fairytale of New York\" in 2015.\"Fairytale Of New York is true sound of Christmas\". The Telegraph. Retrieved 21 September 2019 ==Origin== \"Last Christmas\" had its beginnings in 1984, while George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley were visiting Michael's parents. It was written by Michael in his childhood bedroom. Michael played Ridgeley the introduction and chorus melody to \"Last Christmas\", which Ridgeley later called \"a moment of wonder\".Pink News ===Recording=== The song was recorded in August 1984, at Advision Studios, London, England. George Michael wrote, performed, produced and played every single instrument on the track. With a Linn 9000 drum machine, a Roland Juno-60 synth and sleigh bells, they began recording the song in the summer. The only people in the studio were engineer Chris Porter and two assistants. According to Porter, lyrically \"you've got the happiness of the rhythm track, but against that you've got the sadness of the unrequited love\". == Chart performance == === United Kingdom === Wham! already had two Number One songs in the 1984 UK Singles Chart and news that they were planning a Christmas single meant that a battle for the coveted Christmas No. 1 spot in the UK seemed set to be between Wham! and the year's other big act, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, who had achieved a third No. 1 in early December with \"The Power of Love\". However, the Band Aid single written by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, produced the No. 1 single \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\", while Wham!'s offering peaked at No. 2 for much of the period. Wham! donated all \"Last Christmas/Everything She Wants\" royalties to the Ethiopian famine. In subsequent years, the song reached the middle echelons of the UK Singles Chart on a regular basis (excluding 1985, 1986, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, when the song reached the upper echelons of the chart) Also shows number of weeks spent in the UK Singles Chart top 100. {|class=\"sort wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\" |- ! colspan=\"3\"| UK Singles Chart |- !

Retrieved 7 December 2019. It has charted every year since 1997. In January 2008, the song fell from No. 4 to No. 64 there, also making it the biggest fall out of the top 10 on the singles chart. The single was originally released in two different formats in Japan with different cover art, a 7-inch and 12-inch vinyl (Long version) both with \"Credit Card Baby\" as their B-side. The former entered the top 20 of the Oricon Singles Chart peaking at No. 15, while the latter reached No. 47. The single was released in 1993 on CD single in the country and peaked at No. 17, selling nearly 40,000 copies that week. It was reissued in November 2001 and 2004 as a 2-track CD with the single edit and the \"Pudding Mix\". As a result of the success, \"Last Christmas\" is the eighth best-selling single of all time in Japan released by a non-Japanese act, with total physical sales of 683,000 units. In the Netherlands, the song never reached No. 1, peaking at No. 2 in January 1985 (behind Band Aid's \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\"). In the Dutch Singles Top 100 (one of three charts in the Netherlands that claims to be the \"official\" chart, but it is the only one that is not broadcast and remains unpublished except on its own official web page), the song has now entered on 16 different occasions, including every year since 2006. Its highest position after 1984 was No. 4 (during the 2016 and 2018 Christmas season).DutchCharts.nl In the Dutch Mega Top 50 (which was first published in 1993), the song re-appeared in 1997, 2000, 2007, 2008, and 2013. \"Last Christmas\" was originally not commercially released in 1984 as a single in the United States and therefore did not enter the main charts. It was released for the first time as a physical single on a 2-track 12\" vinyl through an exclusive Record Store Day release in November 2014.Wham!'s 1984 Classic 'Last Christmas' Hits Billboard Hot 100's Top 40 for First Time, Billboard The song has re-entered the Billboard Holiday Songs Chart on a regular basis with it peaking at No. 3 on 7 December 2019.Wham!'s 1984 Classic 'Last Christmas' Hits Billboard Hot 100's Top 40 for First Time - Billboard As of 25 November 2016, total US sales of the digital track stand at 751,000 downloads according to Nielsen SoundScan, placing it 10th on the list of all-time best-selling Christmas/holiday digital singles in US SoundScan history. The song debuted at number 50 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the chart dated 7 January 2017, after George Michael died. In December 2018, the song re-entered the Hot 100, reaching No. 25 in January 2019, and then a new peak of No. 11 in the first issue of 2020.

In December 2017, 28 December 2018 and December 2019 \"Last Christmas\" reached No. 1 in the Swedish singles chart. ==Music video== The video to \"Last Christmas\" shows Wham! members George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley accompanying girlfriends to see friends at an unspecified ski resort cottage: the cable-car that can be seen in two shots is from Saas-Fee, Switzerland, where the video was filmed. It becomes clear early on that the character of Ridgeley's girlfriend (played by model Kathy Hill) was previously in a relationship with Michael and that the song is aimed at her. She can be spotted throughout the video by the fact that she is usually wearing red, but everyone else is wearing more muted colors. There is a brief flashback to \"Last Christmas\", showing Michael's character presenting her with a jewelled brooch. In the present time, Ridgeley is wearing the brooch, suggesting that the girl gave the same gift (perhaps by regifting it) to her new love after she and Michael parted ways. When the girl wears the brooch from Michael's character, it is \"right side up\", and when Ridgeley's character wears it, he wears it \"upside down\". On numerous occasions, Michael presents a thoughtful expression, suggesting his conflicting emotions. As Michael is decorating the Christmas tree some decoration falls to the floor where Michael's ex-girlfriend is sitting and the ex-couple shares a few seconds of a knowing look at each other. Her seeming indifference to Ridgeley's open displays of affection makes the viewer wonder if Ridgeley's heart is the next to be broken. At the end of the video, everyone leaves the cottage and when the group get out of the cable-car, they are all properly \"paired off\" with Michael and his new girlfriend looking happy. The video also featured the duo's erstwhile backing singers Pepsi and Shirlie and Spandau Ballet bassist Martin Kemp, the boyfriend and future husband of Shirlie Holliman. As of December 2019, the music video has received 500 million views on the official Wham! YouTube channel. The second official music video \"Last Christmas (Pudding Mix)\" on Wham!\u2019s official channel has 30 million views (as of October 2020). The music video, originally shot on movie film, was released on 13 December 2019 in 4K Ultra HD resolution and has over 512 million views (as of October 2020). In order to achieve the exceptional clarity, the music video's original film director Andy Morahan found the original 35mm rushes and worked closely with teams at Cinelab London and VFX artist Russ Shaw at Nice Biscuits post production to recreate the video using the higher-resolution film. ==Mixes== The full original mix and vocal of \"Last Christmas\" has never been released in its entirety. In 1984 it was two edits of the song that were released: one (4:24) on the regular 7\" format and the other (missing the second verse (4:45)) on the original Japanese 12\" and promotional Spanish 7\". A remixed version with partly re-recorded and additional vocals was used for the regular 12\" format and entitled the \"Pudding Mix\". When the single was re-released in 1985, an edited version of the Pudding Mix was used for the regular 7\" and this version has been used on all subsequent re-releases. It is the 1985 7\" version (the edit of the 1984 12\" Pudding Mix) that is now the most common to find on \"various artists\" compilation albums (as well as George Michael's Twenty Five hits compilation) and the most widely known version. The full Pudding Mix has been featured on several compilations (including the Wham! hits compilation albums The Final and If You Were There (The Best of Wham)). The edits of the original 1984 recording are less widely available, although the longer version was used in early 1985 in some countries on the second set of formats of the \"Last Christmas/Everything She Wants\" double \"A\" sided single (once the latter started becoming the focus of promotion, following the end of the Christmas season) and has occasionally been used on \"various artists\" compilation albums. The shorter edit (as used on the original 7\") has not been released since and therefore has never appeared on the compact disc format. ==Charts== === Weekly charts === {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !

In some countries, the longer edit (4:34) of \"Last Christmas\" from 1984 was used on side two of the second 12-inch. The only difference between the 1988 and 1989 reissues is the text (Christmas '88\" and Christmas '89\") on the back of the record. == Appearances in other media == In the movie Last Christmas (2019), the film prominently features the music of the late singer George Michael, including this song and a previously unreleased track. The song was also featured in the video game Just Dance 2017 as duet between two dancers, one of whom is dressed as Santa Claus. ==Plagiarism allegations== On behalf of the writers of the song \"Can't Smile Without You\", made popular by Barry Manilow, publishing company Dick James Music sued Michael for plagiarism in the mid-1980s, claiming that \"Last Christmas\" lifted its melody from the former. The case was dismissed when a musicologist presented 60-odd songs from the past century that had a comparable chord sequence and melody. ==Cover versions== ===Whigfield version=== In the UK, the following single planned after \"Close to You\" was \"Big Time\"; however, it was suggested that Whigfield should record a version of \"Last Christmas\" to go with the release of \"Big Time\", as a double A-side single. The single was also released as a double A-side single in Germany with \"Close to You\". In other countries, \"Last Christmas\" was released on its own with various remixes. The single reached number 21 in the UK, which was Whigfield's final release on Systematic Records. It also features on various Special Edition versions of her debut album Whigfield and also on Whigfield II. The EP was released on 10 November 1995 in Australia. A UK single was released on 3 December 1995. ====Chart performance==== Whigfield's cover of \"Last Christmas\" was a moderate success in Europe. It managed to climb into the Top 10 in both Denmark and Spain, peaking at number 6 and 5. Additionally, it was a Top 20 hit in Finland and a Top 30 hit in Ireland, Scotland and the United Kingdom. In the latter, the single was released as a double single with \"Big Time\". It peaked at number 21 in its first week at the UK Singles Chart, on December 10, 1995. It was also a Top 40 hit in Belgium, as well as on the European Hot 100 Singles, where the song reached number 38. ====Music video==== A music video was made for \"Last Christmas\". It was directed by Italian director Giacomo De Simone. It features Whigfield performing the song in a winter landscape. The video was uploaded to YouTube in March 2013.

A more critical review came from music blog Popcrush, who deemed the cover overproduced. \"The slick production is a disservice to both Carly's vocals and the original's emotional heft,\" writes Samanth Vincenty. ====Live performances==== Jepsen performed the song live at the annual NBC television special Christmas in Rockefeller Center, which aired on 2 December 2015.
