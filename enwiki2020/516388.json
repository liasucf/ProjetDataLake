The incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Louis-Alexandre Taschereau, was re-elected, defeating the Quebec Conservative Party, led by Arthur Sauv\u00e9. It was the first of four election victories in a row for Taschereau. However, he had held office since 1920, following the resignation of the previous premier, Lomer Gouin. ==Results== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border- collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\" |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" !rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party !rowspan=\"2\"|Party leader !rowspan=\"2\"|# of candidates !colspan=\"3\"|Seats !colspan=\"3\"|Popular Vote |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" |align=\"center\"|1919 |align=\"center\"|Elected |align=\"center\"|% Change |align=\"center\"|# |align=\"center\"|% |align=\"center\"|% Change | Louis-Alexandre Taschereau |align=\"right\"|92 |align=\"right\"|74 !align=\"right\"|64 |align=\"right\"|-13.5% |align=\"right\"|149,730 |align=\"right\"| 51.52% |align=\"right\"|-0.41% | Arthur Sauv\u00e9 |align=\"right\"|71 |align=\"right\"| 5 !align=\"right\"| 20 |align=\"right\"| +400% |align=\"right\"|114,285 |align=\"right\"| 39.32% |align=\"right\"| +22.32% |colspan=2|Other |align=\"right\"|16 |align=\"right\"|2 !align=\"right\"|1 |align=\"right\"|-50.0% |align=\"right\"|26,634 |align=\"right\"| 9.16% |align=\"right\"|-22.0% |- |colspan=\"3\"|Total !align=\"right\"|179 |align=\"right\"|81 !align=\"right\"|85 !align=\"right\"|+4.9% !align=\"right\"|290,649 !align=\"right\"|100% |align=\"right\"| |- |} ==See also== * List of Quebec premiers * Politics of Quebec * Timeline of Quebec history * List of Quebec political parties * 16th Legislative Assembly of Quebec Quebec general election Category:Elections in Quebec General election Quebec general election ",
