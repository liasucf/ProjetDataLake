    "text": "Jean-Baptiste Goyet or J.-B. Goyet (10 May 1779 \u2014 20 June 1854) was a self- taught French artist. Beginning in 1827 his work was regularly selected for exhibition in the annual Paris Salon. His genre paintings\u2014variously sentimental, satirical, or historical\u2014reached a wide audience through reproductions using the then-new medium of lithography. His son, Eug\u00e8ne Goyet (1798-1857), also became a painter, with a career that surpassed that of his father. ==Establishing the Goyet atelier== Frontispiece and title page, Le Bouquet du Sentiment by Eug\u00e9nie Goyet, illustrated and published by Jean- Baptiste Goyet in 1816. Goyet was a self-taught artist. His first known work was a book he published in 1816 while still living in Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne. Goyet provided illustrations and decorations for Le Bouquet du Sentiment, written by his wife, Eug\u00e9nie, a dictionary of plants with fanciful notes on the allegorical meaning of various flowers, bouquets and colors, including a \"charming and very ingenious plant vocabulary by means of which two lovers with a flowerbed at their disposal can spin a perfect amorous intrigue.\" A reissue of the book in \"une nouvelle \u00e9dition, de luxe\" was announced in 1835.Le Citateur F\u00e9minin, June 1835, p. 288. The same issue on p. 262 featured a poem by Madame Eug\u00e9nie Goyet, \"L'Absence\": The book set a standard for such works for at least seventy years; reviewing Kate Greenaway's Langage des Fleurs in 1885, Lor\u00e9dan Larchey in Le Monde Illustr\u00e9 advised that readers should, \"instead, consult Le Bouquet du Sentiment, published in 1816 by Goyet in Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne. Yes, in Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne! Kate Greenaway would have done better to copy it.\"Larchey, Lor\u00e9dan. \"Revue Anecdotique: Fleurs Anglaise et Fleurs Fran\u00e7aises\", Le Monde Illustr\u00e9, 7 February 1885, pp. 86-87. His son, Eug\u00e8ne, was born when Jean-Baptiste was eighteen years old. When the younger Goyet showed an aptitude for drawing, his father sent him at the age of eighteen to Paris to receive the formal training that he himself lacked. Eug\u00e8ne ranked at the top of his class of sixty students at the atelier of Antoine-Jean Gros.Audiffred, Hyacinthe. \"N\u00e9crologie: Eug\u00e8ne Goyet\", Revue des Beaux-Arts, tome 8, 1857, pp. 237-8. At some point the Goyet family moved to Paris, taking up residence at 3 Rue de l'Abbaye; in 1837 they moved to 25-27 Rue de la Chaus\u00e9e-D'Antin. Father and son were to have a close lifelong relationship, residing at the same address and working in the same studio. They made their debuts at the Paris Salon in the same year, 1827, when Jean- Baptiste was 48 and Eug\u00e8ne was 29. From that point, both Goyets regularly had works selected for exhibition in the Salons, as did Eug\u00e8ne's wife, Zo\u00e9, a portrait artist who specialized in pastels. Jean-Baptiste found a patron in Marie-Caroline of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Duchess of Berry, who recognized and encouraged his early work and later made him curator of her renowned private gallery.de Saint-Didier, Henry. \"Varieties\", Revue des Beaux-Arts, tome 5, 1854, p. 223. ==Subject matter and major works== Jean-Baptiste Goyet, H\u00e9lo\u00efse et Abailard, oil on copper, 1829. Goyet found success with genre paintings that depicted historical figures, or that captured moments from daily life in a historical setting. A retrospective written in 1881 cited Goyet's works at the Salon of 1831 as his most notable exhibition. These included three \"very important works,\"\"Les Artistes de Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire depuis 30 Ans (1849-1879),\" Annales de L'Acad\u00e9mie de Macon, series II, tome III, 1881, pp. 47-48. Marie Louise d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, reine d\u2019Espagne et Luc Giordano; La Reine Christine de Su\u00e8de el le Guerchin; and H\u00e9lo\u00efse et Abailard, depicting the famous lovers as \"H\u00e9lo\u00efse, seduced by the sweet voice and the eloquence of Abailard, listens with all her soul.\"Explication des Ouvrages de Peinture, Sculpture, Gravure, Lithographie et Architecture des Artistes Vivans, Expos\u00e9s au Mus\u00e9e Royal, 1831, p. 76.

The painting may be affiliated with the troubadour style, with its romantic nostalgia for the Middle Ages in France. Its location and appearance long unknown to scholars, Goyet's H\u00e9lo\u00efse et Abailard was rediscovered at an auction in Oakland, California, in 2020. In the 1840s, Goyet began a series of allegory paintings. These included l'Histoire de la vie des artistes en quatre figures, with personifications of Hope, Melancholy, Discouragement, and Perseverance, at the Salon of 1842; l'Empire de l\u2019or (1845), inspired by Boileau's epigram, \"L'or m\u00eame \u00e0 la laideur donne un teint de beaut\u00e9: Mais tout devient affreux avec la pauvret\u00e9\" (\"Gold gives even ugliness a complexion of beauty: But everything becomes awful with poverty\"); and Allegory of the Second Empire, not exhibited at a Salon, but painted sometime between the ascent of Napolean III in 1852 and Goyet's death in 1854. Unlike his son, who achieved great success with paintings of saints, Goyet generally eschewed religious subjects. However, his depiction of Mary and her mother framed by images from the life of Christ, La Sainte-Vierge et Sainte Anne, was \"said to be his best work.\" First shown at the Salon of 1843, it was exhibited posthumously in Goyet's honor at the Salon of 1855. In his lifetime, only a few of Goyet's works were collected by institutions. Une Chapelle (1827) was purchased by the . La Lecture d'un Testament (1833) was acquired for the collection of King Louis-Philippe and \"miraculously escaped, in 1848, the sack of the Palais-Royal.\" Un conseil de guerre jugeant un duelliste, sous le r\u00e8gne de Louis XIII (1835) was on the list of paintings that Jules Verne in 1891 argued should be moved from official rooms in the H\u00f4tel-de-Ville of Amiens to the Mus\u00e9e de Picardie, where \"all the public could thus benefit.\" ==Politics and Society== Jean-Baptiste Goyet, Une Famille Parisienne (le 28 Juillet 1830), 1830. Jean-Baptiste Goyet, Une Famille Parisienne (le 30 Juillet 1830), 1830. The July Revolution of 1830 in France inspired artists like Delacroix to depict the events with stirring symbolism or with large-scale history paintings. Goyet commemorated the Trois Glorieuses (three glorious days of uprising) with sentimental genre paintings. His series titled Une Famille Parisenne depicts a mother and wife sheltering anxiously in their home, then consoling and bandaging their heroic son and husband on his return from the fray. The works were immediately issued as lithographs for popular consumption. The Goyets were concerned with the status of women as artists in France. In 1837, at a time when most artists would admit women to their ateliers only as models, Eug\u00e8ne and Zo\u00e9 opened a new studio at 27 Rue de la Chaus\u00e9e-D'Antin to teach drawing and painting to female students.Le Charivari, 24 December 1837, p. 7. At least one graduate of Zo\u00e9's atelier exhibited at the Paris Salon, in 1864.Veuve Victoire-Ad\u00e8le Keuler, \"\u00e9l\u00e8ve de Mme. Goyet,\" Explication des Ouvrages de Peinture et Dessins, Sculpture, Architecture et Gravure des Artistes Vivans, aux Palais des \u00c9lys\u00e9es, 1864, p. 599. In 1830, father and son were founding members of the (not be confused with later Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Libre des Beaux-Arts formed in 1868). Jean-Baptiste was appointed to a 10-man committee to consider the question of admitting women to the organization. Their eloquent report came down strongly in favor, but a vote of the membership, \"considering that ordinary subjects of deliberation, foreign for the most part to the attributes of their sex, would be almost always devoid of interest for them, decided that this admission would take place only on an honorary basis.\"Extrait de la proposition faite par M. Jacob, tendant \u00e0 l'admission des femmes artistes dans la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9, Annales de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre des beaux-arts, tome I, 1830-1831, pp. 224-231. ==Legacy== Eug\u00e8ne Goyet died less than three years after his father; their Salon careers were essentially parallel, beginning and ending together. In 1859, Zo\u00e9 Goyet completed her husband's final commission\u2014of a painting of Christ at Calvary, for La chapelle Notre-Dame du Calvaire, Garbriac, Averyon, France\u2014marking the end of over three decades in which the three Goyets played a prominent role in the world of French art. Zo\u00e9 died in 1869. A contemporary critic remarked that the works of Jean-Baptiste Goyet displayed \"perhaps a less elevated and less deep talent\" than that of his son, but possessed \"charming grace and irony.\"\"Nouvelles et Faits Divers\",L'Ami de la religion et du Roi: journal eccl\u00e9siastique, politique et litt\u00e9raire, April 1857, p. 767. An obituary dismissed his lack of formal training, saying that Goyet \"had taken lessons from the best of the masters, having always professed a deep admiration for the masterpieces of the great centuries in our country and abroad. This exquisite feeling for the beautiful and the true is found in all the compositions of this hard-working artist, from those that signaled his debut to the works that marked the end of his career.\" At least two portraits of J.-B. Goyet were exhibited in his lifetime. Eug\u00e8ne Goyet submitted a portrait of his father for the Salon of 1831, for which he received a medal. This portrait was included in the estate sale of Eug\u00e8ne Goyet held in 1857 after his death. Its whereabouts is unknown. J.-B. Goyet and his wife, Eug\u00e9nie, were each the subject of a drawing by Clotilde Gerard Juillerat exhibited in the Salon of 1834.Explication des ouvrages de peinture et dessins, sculpture, architecture et gravure des artistes vivans expos\u00e9s au Mus\u00e9e Royal, 1834, p. 79. The whereabouts of these portraits is unknown. ==Gallery== File:Jean-Baptiste Goyet--Le Moine--perhaps Une Chapelle 1827.jpg|Le Moine; perhaps Une Chapelle, 1827Une Chapelle, which marked Goyet's debut at the Paris Salon of 1827, was described as, \"Tons un peu rouges; le moine en pri\u00e8res est assez bien pos\u00e9; l'effet du tableau est satisfaisant,\" in Visite au Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, ou Guide de l'amateur \u00e0 l'exposition des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, gravure, lithographie et architecture des artistes vivans, 1828, p. 183.
