The award was for Japanese literary novels published in the previous year, with the winning work selected solely by \u014ce. The winner received no cash award, but several winning works were translated into other languages, such as English, French and German, for publication. Kenzabur\u014d \u014ce had an open conversation with each winner. The final prize was awarded in 2014, and the collected selection commentary and dialogues were reprinted in a single volume published by Kodansha in 2018. ==List of winners== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | Year | Author | Japanese title | English title | Ref |- |2007 |\u9577\u5d8b\u6709 Y\u016b Nagashima |\u5915\u5b50\u3061\u3083\u3093\u306e\u8fd1\u9053 Y\u016bko-chan no Chikamichi |Y\u016bko's Shortcut | |- |2008 |\u5ca1\u7530\u5229\u898f Toshiki Okada |\u308f\u305f\u3057\u305f\u3061\u306b\u8a31\u3055\u308c\u305f\u7279\u5225\u306a\u6642\u9593\u306e\u7d42\u308f\u308a Watashitachi ni Yurusareta Tokubetsu na Jikan no Owari |The End of the Special Time Allowed to Us | |- |2009 |\u5b89\u85e4\u793c\u4e8c Reiji Ando |\u5149\u306e\u66fc\u837c\u7f85 \u65e5\u672c\u6587\u5b66\u8ad6 Hikari no Mandara, Nihon Bungaku Ron |Mandala of Light: on Japanese Literature | |- |2010 |\u4e2d\u6751\u6587\u5247 Fuminori Nakamura | Suri |The Thief (tr.
