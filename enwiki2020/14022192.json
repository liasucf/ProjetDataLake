    "text": "West Hingham is an MBTA Commuter Rail station in Hingham, Massachusetts. It serves the Greenbush Line. It consists of a single side platform serving the line's one track. The station is fully accessible. ==History== The West Hingham station platform and South Street grade crossing in 1889 The New Haven Railroad abandoned its remaining Old Colony Division lines on June 30, 1959, after the completion of the Southeast Expressway. The West Hingham station had been located north of the South Street level crossing. The MBTA reopened the Greenbush Line on October 31, 2007, with West Hingham station located south of South Street where room for a parking lot was available. A downtown Hingham station was not possible due to the narrow tunnel constructed to avoid level crossings in Hingham Square, so West Hingham and Nantasket Junction stations both serve Hingham. ==References== ==External links== *MBTA - West Hingham *Station from Google Maps Street View Category:MBTA Commuter Rail stations in Plymouth County, Massachusetts Category:Stations along Old Colony Railroad lines Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 2007 Category:Buildings and structures in Hingham, Massachusetts ",
