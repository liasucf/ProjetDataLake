    "text": "Lovelock's theorem of general relativity says that from a local gravitational action which contains only second derivatives of the four-dimensional spacetime metric, then the only possible equations of motion are the Einstein field equations. The theorem was described by British physicist David Lovelock in 1971. ==Statement== In four dimensional space, any tensor A^{\\mu u} whose components are function of metric tensor g^{\\mu u} and its first and second derivatives (but linear in the second derivatives of g^{\\mu u}), and also symmetric and divergenceless, then field equation in vacuum A^{\\mu u}=0, then only possible form of A^{\\mu u} is :A^{\\mu u}=a G^{\\mu u}+b g^{\\mu u} where a and b are just simple constant numbers and G^{\\mu u} is the Einstein tensor. The only possible second-order Euler\u2013Lagrange expression obtainable in a four-dimensional space from a scalar density of the form \\mathcal{L}=\\mathcal{L}(g_{\\mu u}) is E^{\\mu u} = \\alpha \\sqrt{-g} \\left[R^{\\mu u} - \\frac{1}{2} g^{\\mu u} R \\right] + \\lambda \\sqrt{-g} g^{\\mu u} ==Consequences== Lovelock's theorem means that if we want to modify the Einstein field equations, then we have five options. * Add other fields rather than the metric tensor * Use more or less than four spacetime dimensions * Add more than second order derivatives of the metric * Non- locality, e.g. for example the inverse d'Alembertian * Emergence \u2013 the idea that the field equations don't come from the action. ==See also== * Lovelock theory of gravity * Vermeil's theorem ==References== Category:General relativity Category:Theorems in general relativity ",
