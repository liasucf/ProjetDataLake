Said Johnny Stevens of the song, \u201cA lot of people think the song is about being a human. I believe some of us aren\u2019t human at all. Or at least not completely, but that is still our name. At some point in the last couple hundred years something changed. The androids, the aliens...They aren\u2019t coming. We are here.\" ==Music video== The music video was released through Vanity Fair on February 23, 2017. It begins in a futuristic setting with a female lifelike robot being assembled, portrayed by actress Chloe Bridges in its final form, and is intercut with Johnny Stevens singing and viewing the robot's features up close. Blue crystal-like formations appear to grow out of the floor, as more robots appear, standing in formation behind Stevens. It ends with Bridges resting her head on Stevens' shoulder while a red light flashes beneath his skin. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !
