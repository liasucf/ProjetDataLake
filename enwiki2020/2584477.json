    "text": "Disney's Old Key West Resort is a Disney Vacation Club resort at the Walt Disney World Resort. It opened on December 20, 1991 and was formerly known as Disney's Vacation Club Resort until January 1996 when it was renamed. It was the first Disney Vacation Club Timeshare Resort, and has the largest rooms of any of the fifteen Disney Vacation Club Resorts. The accommodations include kitchen facilities and a laundry room. The rooms are designed in a Key West theme. Rooms are also available year-round for rental by non-members (and members) as Disney Vacation Club retains ownership of a majority of the resort. In October 2007, the resort received designation in the Florida Green Lodging Program. In 2010 Disney renovated the guest rooms at this resort, updating the kitchen with all new counter tops, new flooring throughout the rooms, and replaced all the tvs with flat screens. == Guest Rooms == Deluxe Studio - Studios at Disney's Old Key West Resort features 2 queen sized beds, a nightstand, a small round table with 2 chairs, a ceiling fan, a TV, a closet, a small patio/balcony, and a kitchenette. The kitchenette comes with a microwave, toaster, 12-cup coffee maker, a sink, and a mini-refrigerator. The patio/balcony features 2 chairs and a small table. The Studios are the only Disney Vacation Club studios that feature 2 beds rather than a bed and pull- out couch. One Bedroom Villas - One Bedroom Villas feature a large great room with a couch, love seat, a large plush chair that opens into a twin bed, flat- panel TV, 4-person dining room table, and a fully equipped kitchen. The master bedroom features a king sized bed, a chair with ottoman, and a large closet. In the master bath, there is a two-person jacuzzi tub, 2 sinks, and a stand-up shower. Attached to the master bathroom is a laundry room, with a full-sized washer and dryer. Two Bedroom Villas - A Two Bedroom Villa is the same as a One Bedroom, plus an additional bedroom off the living room, which is almost 100% comparable to a Studio. The only exception is that in some of the Two Bedroom Villas there is an additional walk-in closet in place of the studio entrance door and an additional sink in place of the kitchenette. Three Bedroom Grand Villas - The Grand Villas sleep 12 people, and feature 1 king bed, 2 queen beds, 2 double beds, and 1 queen sleeper sofa. They have 4 bathrooms and a very large living room area with all of the amenities contained in the One and Two Bedroom Villas. Grand Villas are the least expensive Grand Villas compared to the other Disney Vacation Club Resorts. == Dining == Olivia's Cafe is the only sit down restaurant at Disney's Old Key West Resort. Olivia's Cafe offers a breakfast, lunch, and dinner menu, with a few Key West touches. Good's Food to Go is a counter service restaurant located on the Turtle Krawl, located at the Hospitality House near the feature pool. Good's is open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It serves fresh fruit and pastry for breakfast, with a small selection of hot items. For lunch and dinner, you can get hamburgers, hot dogs, pizza, and sandwich wraps. There is also a simple dessert menu and children's menu. Gurgling Suitcase is the bar at Disney's Old Key West Resort. They offer drinks and simple snacks. Turtle Shack is a counter service location at the village pool on Old Turtle Pond Road. It offers a smaller menu than Good's Food to Go. The Turtle Shack is open seasonally and weather permitting. == Transportation == Disney's Old Key West Resort is served by Disney Transport bus and watercraft transportation.
