PALS is provided by the state of Virginia for their schools' use. This tool is designed to measure specific components of literacy (phonological awareness, alphabet knowledge, knowledge of letter sounds, spelling, concept of word, word recognition in isolation, and oral passage reading) to identify struggling readers in order to provide interventions as early as possible. While this tool is considered reliable, and having good construct, concurrent, and predictive validity, educators should consider data from a variety of sources when making high- stakes decisions.Invernizzi, M., Meir, J., & Juel, C. (2007). PALS 1-3: Phonological awareness literacy screening 1-3 (6th ed). Charlottesville, VA: University Printing Services. Available http://pals.virginia.edu/pdfs/rd/tech/1-3B%20Tech%20Ref%202010.pdf The results may also be used in the Response to Intervention (RtI) process. ===Literacy Instruction=== The Words Their Way series of instructional resources for literacy educators was co-authored by Donald R. Bear, Invernizzi, Shane Templeton, and Francine Johnston. The books provide screening tools to assess students' skills in various areas of literacy. It provides lessons teachers can use based on the assessment to specifically address areas of weakness and move students forward in the development. Companion websites, reproducibles, and materials on CD-ROM are useful resources for educators. Special attention to addressing the special needs of English language learners(ELL) are incorporated as well. Some of the books in the series are specifically designed for ELL students. ===Reading Interventions=== Book Buddies is a program for providing one-on-one reading interventions for struggling elementary school students. Recognizing the positive effects of individualized instruction and the fiscal limitations for schools to provide this, Dr. Invernizzi set out to devise a program that would benefit students without burdening the schools.Book Buddies: a Model Community Reading Tutorial Program at ULiveandLearn.com In the Book Buddies program, volunteers receive training and follow the lessons that are provided. In Talking Tutoring, a four-part series of webcasts produced by WETA/Reading Rockets, a panel of experts including Invernizzi, Carole Prest, and Ann Hoover, discuss struggling readers, the need for tutors, various tutoring models and the effect of tutors on reading success. Inversizzi refers to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) report indicating American students are in need of intervention. The panel discusses reading research, various models of tutoring from small group to one-on-one, tutoring training, and responds to audience questions.\"Talking Tutoring\".
