    "text": "FC Bayern Munich won the German double for the second time in three seasons, ensuring the first season for Felix Magath as manager was a successful one. With several German clubs suffering from financial difficulties at the time, the title race was a casual stroll for Bayern's star-filled squad, winning by 14 points, since sole rival Schalke 04 fell apart in the last month of the season. Among the key players in the success were Roy Makaay and playmaker Michael Ballack. This was the club's last season at Olympiastadion. ==First- team squad== ===Left club during season=== ==Results== ===Bundesliga=== ==Statistics== ===Top Scorers=== * Roy Makaay 22 (3) * Michael Ballack 13 * Claudio Pizarro 11 * Paolo Guerrero 6 * Sebastian Deisler 4 * Z\u00e9 Roberto 4 ==DFB Pokal== ===Matches=== ==Sources== RSSSF - Germany 2004/05 ==Reserve team== Bayern's reserve team were coached by Hermann Gerland.
