He lectures part-time at Witwatersrand University in electronic music composition. He composes for acoustic instruments, electronic sound sources, multimedia, including dance and theatre. He bases his technical and theoretical compositional approach in scientific research e.g. Study of traffic flow patterns, biochemical dynamics of energy formation, flow / resistance of fluids travelling through various transport systems, cognitive psycho-acoustic behavioural patterns in humans and the behaviour of sound in relationship to continued environmental changes. His sociocultural interests have led him to research the survival of music in the 21st century and the impact that media and technology have on the composer. These theories help to create moments of isolation allowing for the morphological study of each individual sound source, a strategic necessity that brings a degree of order and allows for the creation of various building blocks used in the construction of micro-environments that in turn form the backbone of his compositions. == Compositions == *UNOXHAKA [1998] Piano. * ...A VICTORY FOR HEALTH...
