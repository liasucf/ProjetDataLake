The family lived in Gordon on the north shore of Sydney. He attended Gordon Public School and Sydney Boys' High School before entering the Royal Australian Naval College (RANC) at age 13 in the RANC's first intake. Farncomb excelled academically at the RANC, graduating with very impressive scores and topped his final year (1916).Alan Zammit, 'Farncomb, Harold Bruce (1899\u20131971)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 14, Melbourne University Press, 1996, pp. 139\u2013141.
