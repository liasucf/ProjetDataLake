    "text": "Waimanu Valley is a remote valley on the northeast coast of Hawaii island. Besides the main Waimanu Stream, it includes Waih\u012blau Falls on a tributary. ==Description== Wai manu literally means \"bird water\" or \"river of birds\" in the Hawaiian language. During the time of Ancient Hawaii it was an ahupuaa, or ancient land division with a small village. Most of the area is state forest land, with a few campsites available with reservations. It is located in the H\u0101m\u0101kua district of Hawaii island. The Waimanu Stream watershed includes many smaller flows from Kohala Mountain to the Pacific Ocean at sea level. A system of dikes of hard lava rock force large amounts of ground water dropped from the tradewinds into this valley, making it very different from the smaller shallow valleys directly to the west. This ridge is administered as the Puu O Umi Natural State Area Reserve. Tributary Waih\u012blau Stream starts at about elevation at and flows into Waimanu Stream in the valley. Waih\u012blau Falls is one of the tallest single drops of a waterfall in the United States. It descends from about at to about elevation. The name comes from wai h\u012b lau which means \"many trickling waters\" since during heavy rains the stream splits into many smaller streams overflowing the cliff. Waimanu Stream empties into Waimanu Bay at sea level at . Other streams with waterfalls in the valley include Waiilikahi Falls and Lahomene Falls. The valley is not accessible by automobile. A foot trail called Waimanu or Muliwai Trail leads down a steep path from the Waipio Valley. At the south end of the valley, Waimanu Gap at elevation leads to the upper end of Waipio Valley. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Canyons and gorges of Hawaii Category:Valleys of Hawaii Category:Landforms of Hawaii (island) Category:Beaches of Hawaii (island) ",
