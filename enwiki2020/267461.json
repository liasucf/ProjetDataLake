    "text": "Surigao del Norte (Surigaonon: Probinsya nan Surigao del Norte; ; Tagalog: Hilagang Surigao) is a province in the Philippines located in the Caraga region of Mindanao. Its capital is Surigao City.http://www.philippinecountry.com/provcitmun.html#snorte The province comprises two major islands--Siargao and Bucas Grande--in the Philippine Sea, plus a small area at the northeastern tip of mainland Mindanao and other surrounding minor islands and islets. This mainland portion borders Agusan del Norte, and Surigao del Sur to the south. Surigao del Norte is the second northernmost of the Mindanao provinces and is an important transportation hub between Visayas and Mindanao. Numerous ferries cross the Surigao Strait between Surigao and the island of Leyte carrying vehicles and passengers between Liloan in Southern Leyte and Surigao City. ==Etymology== There are two hypotheses on the original meaning of \"Surigao\" among linguists, depending on the original root word. If the root word was taken to be sulig (\"sprout\" or \"spring up\"), then Surigao may have derived from suligao (\"spring water\"), likely referring to the Surigao River (known as \"Suligaw\" in Mandaya) that empties at the northern tip of the island of Mindanao. Early historical accounts record the name of the river as Suligao, Surigao, or Zurigan. Another possibility is that it is derived from Visayan surogao or suyogao, meaning \"water current\". From suyog (also sulog or surog), \"current\". Other Visayan words derived from the same root include Sinulog, Sulu, and Tausug (Suluk). ==History== province of Surigao in 1918|alt=An old map showing the current territories of the province as part of the province of Surigao The area of Surigao del Norte was once part of an ancient district referred to as \"Caraga\" during the Spanish colonial period named after its chief inhabitants, the Caraga tribe or Caragans who were largely concentrated in a settlement called Caraga. The ancient district of Caraga, which was established in 1609 comprised all of the present day provinces of Surigao del Norte, Dinagat Islands, Surigao del Sur, the northern part of Davao Oriental and eastern Misamis Oriental. The seat of government was at Tandag until it was transferred to the town of Surigao in 1848. Six Spanish military districts were established in Mindanao in 1860 and the areas of present-day Surigao del Norte, Surigao del Sur, Dinagat Islands, Agusan del Norte and Agusan del Sur (collectively called Agusan back then), including the territory lying between present day Butuan and Caraga bays, formed the third district called the \"East District\" which was changed in 1870 to \"Distrito de Surigao\". By the end of the Spanish rule in 1897, Agusan had been organized as a single politico- military comandancia named \"Butuan\", within the administrative jurisdiction of Distrito de Surigao. Distrito de Surigao became a chartered province on May 15, 1901 (Philippine Commission Act 127). The territorial expanse of the Surigao province was further reduced in 1907 when the politico-military commandancia of Butuan, then a sub-province of Surigao, was created into a separate province and officially named it Agusan with present-day Butuan as its capital. On September 18, 1960, through Republic Act 2786 dated June 19, 1960, the province of Surigao was divided into the present day provinces of Surigao del Norte and Surigao del Sur. Agusan province was later dissolved and divided into the present day provinces of Agusan del Norte (retains present day Butuan as capital) and Agusan del Sur in 1967 by Republic Act No. 4979. The town of Surigao became a city on August 30, 1970 pursuant to RA 6134. Dinagat Islands had been a part of the First District of Surigao del Norte until becoming a province on its own on December 2, 2006, with the approval of Republic Act No. 9355, the Charter of the Province of Dinagat Islands, in a plebiscite. Between February 2010 and March 2011, the islands were part again of Surigao del Norte after declaring RA 9355 unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, then were reinstated as a separate province. ==Geography== Surigao del Norte is an archipelago province situated at the rim of the Asian continental shelf. It is located at the northeastern tip of Mindanao and faces the Philippine Trench. The province is bounded by the Dinagat Islands on the north, east by the Philippine Sea, south by the provinces of Agusan del Norte and Surigao del Sur, and on the west by the Surigao Strait. The province, with an area of , comprises the mainland situated at the northeastern tip of Mindanao and several offshore islands, the largest of which include Siargao and Bucas Grande. The mainland is generally mountainous. The province has many caves and tunnels in its islands. Some are half-submerged in water most of the time and could be accessed only during low tides like the Sohoton Cove at Bucas Grande Island. Its biggest islands are usually mountainous and rich in minerals. Nonoc Island has one of the world's largest deposits of nickel. The smaller ones either rest on sand and gravel or have a limestone base bonded by boulders, reefs and sandbars. Some islets which include those in Del Carmen in Siargao Island are a cluster of rock formations jutting out from the sea covered with shrubs and coconut trees. ===Climate=== Surigao del Norte has no pronounced dry season, receiving maximum rainfall from November to January. ==Administrative divisions== Surigao del Norte comprises 20 municipalities and 1 component city, organized into two legislative districts and further subdivided into 335 barangays. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin:auto;table-layout:fixed;text-align:right;background- color:#FDFDFD;font-size:90%;border-collapse:collapse;\" !
