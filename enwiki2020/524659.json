He studied law at the University of Copenhagen, entered the Danish army as volunteer in 1848 in the war against the insurgents of Schleswig-Holstein, who were aided by Prussia and the other German states (see First Schleswig War). He went back to Iceland in 1850, became sheriff () of Bar\u00f0astrandars\u00fdsla, and later in Borgarfjar\u00f0ars\u00fdsla, where he died in 1868. His son, \u00deorvaldur Thoroddsen, became a well-known scientist. ==Work== He is the first novel writer of Iceland. J\u00f3nas Hallgr\u00edmsson had led the way by his short stories, but the earliest veritable Icelandic novel was J\u00f3n Th\u00f3roddsen's Piltur og St\u00falka (\u201cBoy and Girl\u201d), a picture of Icelandic country life. Later followed Ma\u00f0ur og Kona (\u201cMan and Woman\u201d), published after his death by the Icelandic Literary Society. His poems, mostly satirical, are popular; he follows J\u00f3nas Hallgr\u00edmsson closely in his style. ==In English== * Lad and Lass, a Story of Life in Iceland, trans. by Arthur Middleton Reeves, S.
