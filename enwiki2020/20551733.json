    "text": "The 1966 Torneo Descentralizado was the 50th season of the highest division of Peruvian football. This season marked the first time the Primera Divisi\u00f3n was named the Descentralizado because teams outside Lima and Callao were invited for the first time making it the first national championship in Peru. The four teams invited to play in the inaugural national championship were Melgar of Arequipa, Octavio Espinosa of Ica, Grau of Piura, and Alfonso Ugarte de Chicl\u00edn of Trujillo. The first match of the season was played on 13 August 1966 between Universitario and Mariscal Sucre in the Estadio Nacional. Shortly after this match, the first match to feature a team outside the Lima and Callao region was between Sporting Cristal and Alfonso Ugarte in the same stadium on the same day. The champion was Universitario. Four teams were relegated at the end of the season. Carlos Concha was relegated to the 1967 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n as the last placed team. In addition, Octavio Espinosa, Alfonso Ugarte, and Melgar were relegated as they needed to place seventh or higher to remain in the first division. They needed to play the 1967 Copa Per\u00fa to attain promotion to the first division. ==Teams== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Teams !
