Duke Professor of Immunology at Duke University School of Medicine. ==Education and career== Kelsoe completed his M.S. in 1974 from Southern Methodist University with a research focus on spermatogenesis in rat tapeworms. He then went on to Harvard University where he completed his Doctor of Science degree in 1979 with a thesis titled \"Mechanisms of the Humoral Immune Response. Experimental and Applied Studies.\" In 1982, Kelsoe joined the faculty at the University of Texas Medical Branch as an assistant professor in the Department of Microbiology, rising to the rank of associate professor in 1988. In 1989, Kelsoe moved to the University of Maryland School of Medicine as an associate professor in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology. He was promoted to full professor in 1994. In 1998, Kelsoe moved to Duke University School of Medicine, where he is currently a James B. Duke Professor of Immunology. ==Research== Kelsoe's research focuses on lymphocyte development and activation, as well as how lymphocytes specific to certain pathogens get selected. His group focuses in particular on immune responses to HIV and Influenza viruses. ==Notable publications== *Han S, Hathcock K... Kelsoe G (1995).
