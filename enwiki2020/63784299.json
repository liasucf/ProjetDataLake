RTL (\"Den 2ten RTL\" or \"Den Zweeten RTL\", \"Den Zweeten RTL\" in French) is the second specifically Luxembourgish television channel created by RTL Group on March 15, 2004, thirteen years after RTL T\u00e9l\u00e9 L\u00ebtzebuerg. The channel is aimed at a younger audience than its predecessor, with live broadcasts of international sporting events for which RTL has acquired the rights in Luxembourg (UEFA Champions League, UEFA European Championship in particular). Monday March 23, 2020, due to the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 in Luxembourg, RTL Group, parent company of RTL L\u00ebtzebuerg, decides to change the name and logo of the channel: thus, \"Den 2. RTL\" is renamed in RTL Zwee (RTL Deux in French) and includes in its schedule, until further notice, the majority of entertainment programs and series produced by RTL T\u00e9l\u00e9 L\u00ebtzebuerg as well as Luxembourg and international films. RTL T\u00e9l\u00e9 L\u00ebtzebuerg and RTL Zwee share the same packaging since 2007, only the staff members differ depending on the channel. This same dressing was modified in 2011 and in 2017 (2017 being the year of the move of RTL L\u00ebtzebuerg in its new seat called \"RTL City\"), at the same time as that of the televised newspapers (\"De Journal\") of RTL T\u00e9l\u00e9 L\u00ebtzebuerg. == References == == External links == * Category:RTL Group Category:European Broadcasting Union members Category:Luxembourgish-language mass media Category:Television networks in Luxembourg Category:Television in Luxembourg ",
