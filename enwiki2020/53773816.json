The conservation park occupies land in sections 199, 200 and 365 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Robertson. It is bounded by the Coles- Killanoola Road to the west and by the Bool Lagoon West Road to the north while the land reserved for roads on its east and south boundaries have not been developed as of 1992. A drain known as \u2018Killanoola Drain\u201d, which is part of the drainage infrastructure built in the south east of the state since European settlement, passes through the eastern quarter of the conservation park, carrying water to a drain known as \u2018Drain M\u2019 located to the north and which terminates in the sea at Beachport in the south. The presence of the drain is reported as having \u201cmodified the natural water regime of the wetland system\u201d within the conservation park. As of 1992, it included a \u201cformer sand quarry and two stone quarries\u201d in its south west corner, a system of yards \u201cwhich are historically significant remnants of past land use\u201d on its eastern side and a network of tracks to its boundaries and to its interior. It was proclaimed under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 on 18 September 1980. As of July 2016, it covered an area of . In 1992, the conservation park was described as having a landscape consisting of a limestone ridge in its \u201cwestern quarter\u201d while its remainder is a \u201ccomplex wetland system, with limestone outcrops.\u201d It supports the following \u201cdistinct vegetation types\u201d with one type in the \u201cwestern quarter\u201d and three types within the wetland system: #the \u201cwestern quarter\u201d supports a \u201clow open forest of brown stringybark \u2026 and pink gum \u2026 associations over a sparse low shrub layer.\u201d #\u201ca two strata mid-dense low shrub formation of mallee honey-myrtle (Melaleuca neglecta) with cutting grass \u2026 over a sparse tussock grass and dwarf shrub stratum dominated by bare twig-rush (Machaerinajuncea) and small darwinia \u2026;\u201d #\u201ca two strata low shrub formation of prickly tea-tree and mallee honey-myrtle over a sparse dwarf shrub layer dominated by clustered sword-sedge (Lepidospefllla congestum), bare twigrush, running marsh-flower (Villarsia reniformis), and prickly tea-tree; and\u201d #\u201dan isolated tree formation of South Australian blue gum \u2026 , pink gum and river red gum \u2026, over a sparse ground stratum of clustered sword-sedge and bare twig-rush with annual grasses and forbs\u201d. As of 1992, visitor use as reported as being \u201clow\u201d with visitors consisting mainly of \u201cmembers of the local and Naracoorte communities for nature study, with the former sand quarry used regularly for picnicking\u201d and with camping being \u201can occasional activity\u201d for which sites and associated facilities were absent.
