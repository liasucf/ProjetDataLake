Released in October 1986 in the UK as the lead single from the album One to One, it reached #35 in the UK Singles Chart, his lowest charting hit to that time, and the last UK top 40 hit of Jones' career. In the United States, it was the third single from the album, and reached #76 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
