This was also the first time the socialist parties received an overall majority of the elected parties' popular vote, although the Hansson cabinet still required cross-aisle co-operation to govern since the centre-right parties won 118 out of 230 seats. ==Results== {| class=wikitable style=text- align:right |- |colspan=7|300px |- !Party !Votes !% !Seats !+/\u2013 |- |align=left|Social Democratic Party||1,040,689||41.7||104||+14 |- |align=left|General Electoral League||585,248||23.5||58||\u201315 |- |align=left|Farmers' League||351,215||14.1||36||+9 |- |align=left|Free-minded National Association||244,577||9.8||20||\u20138 |- |align=left|Communist Party (Kilbommare)||132,564||5.3||6||New |- |align=left|Communist Party (Sill\u00e9nare)||74,245||3.0||2||\u20136 |- |align=left|Liberal Party||48,722||2.0||4||0 |- |align=left|Swedish National Socialist Party||15,170||0.6||0||New |- |align=left|Other parties||2,676||0.1||0||0 |- |align=left|Invalid/blank votes||6,060||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left|Total||2,501,166||100||230||0 |- |align=left|Registered voters/turnout||3,698,935||67.6||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left colspan=5|Source: Nohlen & St\u00f6ver |} Clerical People's Party, albeit a separate party, received 8,911 votes or 0.4 % of the vote share, but had the votes re-assigned to the General Electoral League as a result of them forfeiting their votes out of tactical purposes and were listed as Electoral League or \"Rightist\" votes in the official final results. No Clerical People's Party member got elected to the Riksdag, which meant the Electoral League covered the entire rightist delegation. Therefore the General Electoral League may correctly be attributed to both 23.1 % and 23.5 % of the overall vote share. ==References== 1932 Category:1932 elections in Europe Category:1932 in Sweden Category:September 1932 events ",
