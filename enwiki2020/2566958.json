    "text": "Fruit and leaf detail Gala is a clonally propagated apple cultivar with a mild and sweet flavour. In 2018, it surpassed Red Delicious as the apple cultivar with the highest production in the United States, according to the US Apple Association. It was the first time in over 50 years that any cultivar was produced more than Red Delicious.2018 Annual Review U.S. Apple Association. == Appearance and flavour == Gala apples are non-uniform in colour, usually vertically striped or mottled, with overall orange color. They are sweet, fine textured, and aromatic, can be added to salads, cooked, or eaten raw, and are especially suitable for creating sauces. == History == The first Gala apple tree was one of many seedlings resulting from a cross between a Golden Delicious and a Kidd's Orange Red planted in New Zealand in the 1930s by orchardist J.H. Kidd. Donald W. McKenzie, an employee of Stark Bros Nursery, obtained a US plant patent for the cultivar on October 15, 1974. It is a relatively new introduction to the UK, first planted in commercial volumes during the 1980s. The variety now represents about 20% of the total volume of the commercial production of eating apples grown in the UK, often replacing Cox's Orange Pippin. === Sports (mutations) === Many sports of Gala have been selected, mostly for increased red color, including the popular Royal Gala. The original cultivar produced fruit with orange stripes and a partial orange blush over a yellow background. Since then, several un-patented sports have been recognized. Additionally, more than twenty sports have received US plant patents: {| class=\"wikitable\" !Date !\"Inventor\" !Marketed as !Mutated from !Assignee !Habit !Pattern !Earlier !Color !Plant patent number |- |align=\"right\"| Oct 15, 1974 || McKenzie || Gala || \u2013 || Stark || standard || partial blush || \u2013 || yellow || |- |align=\"right\"| Oct 4, 1977 || Ten Hove || Royal Gala, Tenroy || Gala3637 || Stark || standard || stripe || \u2013 || red || |- |align=\"right\"| May 10, 1988 || Creech || Scarlet Gala || Kidd's D-83637 || C & 0 || standard || blush || \u2013 || scarlet || |- |align=\"right\"| Aug 1, 1989 || Kiddle || Galaxy || Tenroy4121 || Stark || standard || stripe || earlier || intense red || |- |align=\"right\"| Dec 18, 1990 || Cooper || Treco Spur Red Gala No. 42, Regal || Auvil || Oregon Rootstock || spur || stripe || \u2013 || red || |- |align=\"right\"| Jul 16, 1991 || Fulford || Fulford || Kidd3637 || || standard || blush || \u2013 || bright red || |- |align=\"right\"| Mar 1, 1994 || Olsen || Obrogala, UltraRed || Tenroy4121 || Stark || standard || stripe || 2\u20134 days || redder || |- |align=\"right\"| Apr 5, 1994 || Waliser || Waliser Gala || Tenroy4121 || Waliser || standard || stripe || 10 days || bright red || |- |align=\"right\"| May 10, 1994 || Hill || Applewaites || Kidd's3637 || || standard || blush || 2\u20133 days || more complete red || |- |align=\"right\"| Nov 5, 1996 || Olsen || Olsentwo Gala, Pacific Gala || Royal Gala4121 || || standard || stripe || 5\u201310 days || distinguishably different || |- |align=\"right\"| Sep 2, 1997 || Brookfield || Baigent || Royal Gala4121 || Brookfield || standard || stripe || extremely early || bright red || |- |align=\"right\"| Nov 11, 1997 || Gale || Gale Gala || Royal Gala4121 || Van Well || standard || stripe || 3 weeks || more complete || |- |align=\"right\"| Jun 23, 1998 || Fackler || Big Red Gala || Kidd's3637 || Protree || standard || stripe || \u2013 || same || |- |align=\"right\"| Mar 30, 1999 || Simmons || Simmons || Imperial || Peace Valley || standard || stripe || 21 days || brighter red || |- |align=\"right\"| Jan 18, 2000 || Stiekema || Stiekema 1 || Obragala8621 || || standard || blush || \u2013 || red || |- |align=\"right\"| Apr 11, 2000 || McSpadden, Jr || Caitlin || Tenroy4121 || Stark || standard || stripe || \"earlier\" || \u2013 || |- |align=\"right\"| Aug 13, 2002 || Black || Harry Black || Kidd's3637 || International Plant Management || standard || stripe || 5 wk. later || \u2013 || |- |align=\"right\"| Apr 29, 2003 || Banning || Banning Gala || Imperial || || standard || stripe || \u2013 || intense red blush, darker stripe || |- |align=\"right\"| Jan 6, 2004 || Smith || Smith gala || Tenroy4121 || || standard || stripe || \u2013 || yellow || |- |align=\"right\"| May 4, 2004 || Weaver || Weaver || Fulford7589 || Adams County Nursery || more compact || blush || \u2013 || bright red || |- |align=\"right\"| Jan 4, 2005 || Ligonniere || Dalitoga || Imperial || SNC Elaris || standard || stripe || 3 wk. || yellow || |- |align=\"right\"| Aug 15, 2006 || Burkitt || Burkitt Gala || Tenroy4121 || BMA Trust || standard || stripe || 10 d. || completely red || |- |align=\"right\"| Feb 26, 2008 || McDonald || El Ni\u00f1o || Royal4121 || || standard || intense dark red stripe || || bright red || |- |align=\"right\"| Jul 8, 2008 || McLaughlin || McLaughlin Gala, Blondee || Kidd's3637 || || standard || no striping or blush || 4\u20146 d. || yellow || |- |align=\"right\"| Dec 30, 2008 || Fankhauser || Alvnia || Gala || Fankhauser || standard || stripes || \"earlier\" || red, > 95A% coverage || |- |align=\"right\"| Apr 14, 2009 || Richard || Galaval || Galaxy6955 || Pepinieres du Valois || standard || blush || \u2013 || intense dark purple brown || |} Unpatented varieties include: Auvil, Imperial ==Descendant cultivar(s)== *Delfloga (Royal Gala \u00d7 Florina) *Jazz (Royal Gala \u00d7 Braeburn) *Envy (Royal Gala \u00d7 Braeburn) * Nicoter (Kanzi) (Gala \u00d7 Braeburn) United States Patent PP17201 * Sciros (Pacific Rose) (Splendor \u00d7 Gala) * Sweetie ('PremA280') == Season == Gala apple from South Tyrol with PDO sticker. Gala apples are grown from May through September in the northern hemisphere, but, like most apples, are available almost all year through the use of cold storage and controlled atmosphere storage. Australian Gala are available from late January. California fruit is available until October. While the season usually lasts only 9 or 10 months, they are able to last all year round. However, due to some apples continuing to be grown in some orchards, and the fact that they can be refrigerated for some months leads to the availability of the Gala apple year-round in some Australian markets. These usually taste different (slightly less sweet) from those in season. The UK season begins in late summer (August). Storage makes the UK fruit available nearly year-round as with fruit from other origins. == Royal Gala sport == Royal Gala is a Gala sport, patented by Stark in 1977, which produces redder fruits than the original cultivar. It is a pink-red dessert apple and is therefore usually eaten fresh. Royal Galas are usually harvested in early to late February in the southern hemisphere. In New Zealand the pinker original Gala has almost disappeared as a commercial apple in favor of the darker- skinned Royal Gala. == Storage == The optimum temperature for storing apples is between \u22121\u00b0 and 1 \u00b0C (30 to 34 \u00b0F), and the optimum relative humidity is 90 to 95%. Ethelyne gas accelerates ripening (and spoilage) of apples, as with many other fruit. == Listeria== At the beginning of 2015, Royal Gala and Granny Smith apples from the United States were identified as the likely cause of a Listeriosis outbreak. Listeria is a bacterium that can cause nausea, vomiting, headaches, neck stiffness, and can be dangerous to people with deficient immune systems. ==References== == External links== *New York Apple Association description *JUSTICIA Patents \u2013 Apple tree named \u2018McLaughlin Gala\u2019 Category:Apple cultivars with patented mutants Category:New Zealand apples Category:Apple cultivars ",
