Nastos stated \"The first of two Vee Jay label dates by the acclaimed modern jazz bassist Paul Chambers is a fine exercise in hard bop, split between showcasing his compositions and famous standards. Alto saxophonist Cannonball Adderley and trumpeter Freddie Hubbard are on the front line, perhaps for the only time in their storied careers, and work well for the most part ... The advantage in buying this reissue is that the second CD is outtakes from the originally issued tracks, and many of them have extended solos ... Chambers died far too young ten years hence in January of 1969, but left behind a memorable 15-year legacy, well represented by this recording where he was in his early prime\". Reviewing The Complete Vee Jay Paul Chambers/Wynton Kelly Sessions 1959-61 for All About Jazz C. Michael Hovan said \"This hard bop delight is notable for a front line that includes trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, new on the scene at the time, and Cannonball Adderley. Wynton Kelly, Chambers, and Jimmy Cobb were the rhythm team for Miles Davis at the time and their empathetic teamwork was responsible for elevating many a blowing date of the time above the mean standard\".Hovan, C. M. All About Jazz Review, accessed July 22, 2019 In JazzTimes Harvey Pekar wrote \"Hubbard makes one of his earliest recorded appearances, but his style already is quite original, although it would continue to evolve. His long lines and harmonic daring indicate that John Coltrane had a strong impact on him, as well as Clifford Brown. Technically he\u2019s brilliant, and plays with a big, brassy tone and command in all registers. Like Hubbard, Adderley is impressive, contributing hard swinging, imaginative spots\".Pekar, H.
