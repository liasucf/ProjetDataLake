He has made several contributions to the field of deep learning. ==Biography== Goodfellow obtained his B.S. and M.S. in computer science from Stanford University under the supervision of Andrew Ng, and his Ph.D. in machine learning from the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al in April 2014, under the supervision of Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville. His thesis is titled \"Deep learning of representations and its application to computer vision\".https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f78e/6ab39c67b1fcdf6d77f7b25dcff3e094ce24.pdf After graduation, Goodfellow joined Google as part of the Google Brain research team. He then left Google to join the newly founded OpenAI institute. He returned to Google Research in March 2017. Goodfellow is best known for inventing generative adversarial networks. He is also the lead author of the textbook Deep Learning. At Google, he developed a system enabling Google Maps to automatically transcribe addresses from photos taken by Street View cars and demonstrated security vulnerabilities of machine learning systems. In 2017, Goodfellow was cited in MIT Technology Review's 35 Innovators Under 35. In 2019, he was included in Foreign Policy's list of 100 Global Thinkers. In 2019 Goodfellow left Google and joined Apple Inc. as director of machine learning. ==References== Category:American computer scientists Category:Artificial intelligence researchers Category:Google employees Category:Living people Category:Machine learning researchers Category:People from San Francisco Category:Stanford University alumni Category:Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:1980s births Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Apple Inc. employees ",
