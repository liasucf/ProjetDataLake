However, the club was still active in a youth academy until circa 2005, as a new company A.S. Siracusa Calcio 1924 S.r.l.. Associazione Amici del Siracusa, a cultural association, currently owns the rights to use the logo and the name of the club.http://www.comune.siracusa.it/images/doc/Sport/New_Doc.pdf Paolo Giuliano, the general manager of Messina, was the president of the association. However, no football club submitted any tender to use the logo for 2014\u201315 season. ==History== === The origins === The earliest clubs representing the city of Syracuse were brought to the city by English sailors. The earliest of which were named Ortigia 1907; as the name suggests that club was founded in 1907, Esperia and Insuperabile. However, cycling remained the most popular sport by far during this time so these clubs did not reach much prominence. ===A.S. Siracusa=== This club was founded as Gruppo Sportivo Tommaso Gargallo on 1 April 1924, by two men who were part of the military, the lieutenant of the 75\u00b0 infantry Genisio Pioletti and his advanced captain Luigi Santuccio. The club were entered into the Italian Serie C league. Successively the team switched its denomination to Associazione Sportiva Siracusa. In 1945\u201346, Siracusa was admitted to Serie B, where he played for seven consecutive seasons. After a relegation to the amateur leagues, Siracusa returned to Serie C in 1970\u201371, after two playoffs against Fincantieri, a team from Palermo, both ended in a tie: then, Siracusa won a tie-breaking coin toss and was awarded promotion. In 1979 the club won Coppa Italia Serie C, defeating Biellese in the final.RSSSF That same year, Siracusa promoted to Serie C1, where he played for two seasons. In the 1970s the club also briefly used the name Siracusa Calcio. In 1985 the club went bankrupted, but the sports title was transferred to another company backed by new investors. Siracusa played Serie C2 until 1988, when, under coach Paolo Lombardo, the Sicilian club gained promotion to Serie C1. In 1994\u201395, despite serious financial troubles, Siracusa almost reached promotion to Serie B under head coach Giuliano Sonzogni, losing on playoffs to Avellino. Successively, the team was not able to go on financially, and Siracusa was consequently expelled from professional league, by the decision of Italian Football Federation's Commissione di Vigilanza sulle Societ\u00e0 di Calcio (Co.Vi.So.C.). The last financial filing of A.S. Siracusa S.r.l. (P.IVA 00822900890), dated 1993\u201394 season, shown the club had a net equity of minus 1,511,222,632 lire. The old club/company, last known as A.S. Siracusa Calcio S.r.l. , was officially declared bankrupted by the Court of Syracuse on 6 February 1996. ==Stadium== Their first stadium was Campo Coloniale from their inception until it was demolished in 1932. The present stadium, Stadio Nicola De Simone can hold 5,946. ==Phoenix clubs== ===A.S. Siracusa Calcio 1924=== However, the youth section of the club was survived, as A.S. Siracusa Calcio 1924, which the membership of the that youth academy in FIGC was finally cancelled circa 2006 (FIGC registration number: 910391).
