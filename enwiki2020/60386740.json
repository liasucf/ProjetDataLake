    "text": "Mustafa Tun\u00e7 Soyer (born 1959) is a Turkish politician from the Republican People's Party (CHP) who currently serves as the Mayor of \u0130zmir, Turkey's third largest city. He was elected to the position in the 2019 mayoral election. He previously served as the Mayor of Seferihisar, a coastal district of \u0130zmir, from 2009 to 2019. ==Early life and education== Soyer was born in Ankara, the capital city of Turkey, in 1959. He graduated from Bornova Anadolu Lisesi, a prestigious high school in Bornova, a district of \u0130zmir in which he received classes in foreign languages particularly in English and French before returning to Ankara to attend Ankara University Faculty of Law. He graduated in 1981. During his education, he was also an actor and assistant theatrical director. He completed two masters degrees, one in Webster University Geneva in the field of international relations and another at Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University about the European Union. ==Political career== In addition to serving as Mayor of Seferihisar and \u0130zmir, Soyer served as an advisor to the former mayor of \u0130zmir, Ahmet Piri\u015ftina. He also served as the assistant general secretary and executive member for foreign relations in the \u0130zmir Chamber of Commerce. He was the General Secretary for the EXPO 2015 Steering and Executive Committees. ===Mayor of Seferihisar=== Soyer was elected Mayor of Seferihisar, a coastal district of \u0130zmir, in the 2009 local election. He was the candidate of the main opposition center-left Republican People's Party (CHP). He was re-elected for a second term in the 2014 local election. Soyer drew national attention for his success as Seferihisar mayor, having established the town as a modal tourist destination as part of the slow movement culture. Seferihisar became a member of Cittaslow, the first of its kind in Turkey.http://www.cittaslow.org/network/seferihisar Because of his success and popularity in Seferihisar, Soyer was frequently seen as a potential future candidate for Mayor of \u0130zmir. ===Mayor of \u0130zmir=== Following the announcement that the serving mayor of \u0130zmir, Aziz Kocao\u011flu, would not stand for another term, the CHP began considering new candidates. Despite Kocao\u011flu deciding to re-enter the race shortly before the CHP was due to announce its candidate, Soyer was eventually selected, having long been seen as the frontrunner. Soyer was supported by the \u0130Y\u0130 Party, with which the CHP formed an electoral alliance named the Nation Alliance. In the 2019 mayoral election, which was held as part of the 2019 local elections, Soyer was elected with 58.1% of the vote, beating the People's Alliance candidate Nihat Zeybek\u00e7i. Zeybek\u00e7i, a former Economy Minister, received 38.7% of the vote. ==Family and personal life== Soyer is married and has two kids. His wife, Nept\u00fcn Soyer, worked in the tourism sector between 1999 and 2002.https://www.internethaber.com/tunc-soyer-esi-neptun-soyer-kimdir-kac- yasinda-ne-is-yapiyor-1937420h.htm ===Nurettin Soyer=== Soyer's father, Nurettin Soyer, was a prosecutor who took part in opening cases against prominent politicians following the 1980 coup d'\u00e9tat. His prosecutions led to 5 death sentences, 9 life sentences and sentences ranging from 10 months to 36 years for another 221 defendants.https://www.karar.com/guncel- haberler/nurettin-soyer-kimdir-1104028 Most of those prosecuted were from far- right groups, most notably the Grey Wolves. One defendant who received 5 years in prison was Alparslan T\u00fcrke\u015f, the founder and first leader of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). When Tun\u00e7 Soyer became the CHP's candidate for Mayor of \u0130zmir in 2019, the governing People's Alliance that includes the MHP sharply criticised him for his father's actions against nationalist politicians. However, Nurettin Soyer was also defended for being the only prosecutor ever to bring a case against Fethullah G\u00fclen, the leader of the G\u00fclen Movement, an organisation that is claimed to be a terrorist group by Turkish authorities (under the name 'FET\u00d6'.https://seferihisar.com/fethullah- guleni-45-yil-once-sanik-sandalyesine-oturtan-savci/) ==References== Category:People from Ankara Category:Ankara University Faculty of Law alumni Category:Republican People's Party (Turkey) politicians Category:Mayors of \u0130zmir Category:Living people Category:Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University alumni Category:Seferihisar Category:Webster University alumni Category:1959 births ",
