    "text": "Son Bo-mi is a multiply awarded modern South Korean writer of fiction born in Seoul, South Korea. ==Life== Son was born in Seoul, South Korea. Son made her literary debut int 2009 with Silence and she currently teaches creative writings at Kyeonghee University. She is married to writer Kim Jong-ok.\"I Wish There Could Be a 2nd Print, I Want to Fix the 'Introduction'\", Munhwa Ilbo, Retrieved 2017-05-10. ==Work== Son is known for writing extremely emotional works (Blanket, Hot Air Balloon, and I'm Leaving Too, Liz) in very dry and calm sentences that paradoxically seem to reveal more feeling through their aridity than they would through overt emotionalism. Her stories often feature elaborate narrative structures that often leave out key ingredients related to the plot. This is partially because many of her works are interrelated and events that have happened in one book are often expected to be known about in the other books, even if they are only referred to most elliptically. Her important works included Downpour, A Love of Scientist, Stroll, and Lindy Hop For Them. Downpour has been partially translated online, as it was one of her award-winning works. ==Awards== * 2014 5th Annual Young Artists Award * 2014 21st Kim Joon-Sung Prize * 2013 The 46th Hankook Ilbo Literary Award * 2012 The 3rd annual literary neighborhood young artist award * 2011Dong Ilbo Short Story Award * 2009 21st century Literary short story Division Newcomer AwardNaver \uc778\ubb3c\uac80\uc0c9: http://people.search.naver.com/search.naver?where=nexearch&sm;=tab_ppn&query;=%EC%86%90%EB%B3%B4%EB%AF%B8&os;=474468&ie;=utf8&key;=PeopleService].
