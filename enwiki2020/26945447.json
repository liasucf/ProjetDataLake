When the line from the midlands was quadrupled, the two eastern tracks were used by goods trains; to enable these to reach Brent sidings, a flyover was provided at Silkstream Junction, north of . ==Coal traffic== Coal trains, each consisting of up to 85 wagons, were despatched from the marshalling yards at Toton (between Nottingham and Derby), and received at Brent sidings. Here, they were split up and forwarded to the Midland Railway's own coal depots around London, and also to the London area marshalling yards belonging to other railways. ==Locomotives== The coal trains from Toton were so heavy that two 0-6-0 locomotives were usually required; from 1927, special LMS Garratt locomotives were built for this traffic, one of which could handle a similar load as two of the normal locomotives. ==Notes== ==References== * * Category:Midland Railway Category:Rail yards in the United Kingdom ",
