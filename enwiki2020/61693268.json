    "text": "Stuart Waiton is a senior sociology and criminology lecturer at Abertay University. He teaches on matters relating to anti-social behaviour, moral panics, hate crimes, and politics. Waiton was a member of the Revolutionary Communist Party, initially getting involved in anti-racist politics and supporting Workers Against Racism (WAR). In 2019 he joined the Brexit Party and was chosen as a candidate to be an MEP in Scotland, standing on a pro- immigration and pro-democracy platform. He was unsuccessful and lost his deposit after getting less than 5% of votes overall, and later stood as the prospective parliamentary candidate for Dundee West. Waiton has been a columnist for the Times Educational Supplement (Scotland) and has written for The Times, The Independent, Living Marxism and its successor Spiked, and currently is a columnist for the Glasgow Herald and a contributor to a number of mainstream radio and television discussion programmes. He has appeared on Sky News and has been a contributor for The Richie Allen Show. He has been involved in campaigns against the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act. He has criticised academics as stifling the debate around transgender topics, and has in turn been criticised for describing the transgender rights movement as asking for something that is biologically impossible. He has also questioned the state support for gender-neutral toilets and school uniforms and described the dynamic of equality campaigners as potentially authoritarian. ==Bibliography== * * * ==References== Category:Living people Category:Brexit Party parliamentary candidates Category:21st-century Scottish politicians Category:Lecturers Category:Academics of the University of Abertay Dundee Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
