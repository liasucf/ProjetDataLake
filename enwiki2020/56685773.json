    "text": "Huge swarms of Chaoborus edulis, resembling distant plumes of smoke over Lake Malawi's water Kunga cake or kungu is an East African food made of millions of densely compressed midges or flies. In his entomophagy book \"Insects: An Edible Field Guide\", Stefan Gates suggest that people can \"make burgers with it, or dry it out and grate parts of it off into stews\" for \"umami richness\". Bear Grylls calls it \"a great survival food\" and describes how vast quantities are caught and turned into kunga cake. American entomologist May Berenbaum discusses the situation where large swarms of midges can cause significant problems for local populations. She cites an example of how Chaoborus edulis swarms form near Lake Malawi and how the local people turn them into kunga cakes as a \"rich source of protein\" which is eaten \"with great enthusiasm\". Explorer David Livingstone (1865) claimed that they \"tasted not unlike caviare\" though Professor of Tropical Entomology Arnold van Huis declared that he did not like it at all. To catch the flies a frying pan can be coated in cooking oil and then wafted through a swarm. ==References== Category:African cuisine Category:Insects as food Category:Diptera of Africa ",
