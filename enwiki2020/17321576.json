    "text": "The Lebanese Second Division () is the second division of Lebanese football. Established in 1933, it is controlled by the Lebanese Football Association. The 12 teams that participate in the league play each other twice, once at home and once away, with the champions and the second placed team qualifying to the Lebanese Premier League to replace the bottom two teams. ==History== Salam Achrafieh won the inaugural edition of the Second Division, in 1933\u201334, after beating Ararat 2\u20130 in the final. There was no promotion or relegation system at the time, so Salam Achrafieh remained in the Second Division. In April 1935, Second Division clubs requested a promotion system to be implemented. It was proposed that, at the end of the season, every Second Division team that wanted to be promoted to the First Division had to play against three teams from the First Division, one match each, winning all three. The teams from the First Division had to have at least 7 players from their previous season's squad. ==Clubs== ===Champions=== The following is a list of Lebanese Second Division champions. {| |- | valign=\"top\" | {| class=\"wikitable\" !No. !Season !Champion(s) |- |1 |1933\u201334 |Salam Achrafieh |- |2 |1934\u201335 |Mokhtalat |- |3 |1935\u201336 |Unknown |- |4 |1936\u201337 |Unknown |- |5 |1937\u201338 |Hilmi Sports |- |6 |1938\u201339 |Racing Beirut |- | |1939\u201340 | |- |7 |1940\u201341 |Unknown |- |8 |1941\u201342 |Unknown |- |9 |1942\u201343 |Unknown |- |10 |1943\u201344 |Unknown |- |11 |1944\u201345 |Unknown |- |12 |1945\u201346 |Unknown |- |13 |1946\u201347 |Unknown |- |14 |1947\u201348 |Sagesse |- |15 |1948\u201349 |Unknown |- | |1949\u201350 | |- |16 |1950\u201351 |Nejmeh |- | |1951 to 1953 | |- |17 |1953\u201354 |Unknown |- |18 |1954\u201355 |Unknown |} |valign=\"top\"| {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !No. !Season !Champion(s) |- |19 |1955\u201356 |Sagesse |- |20 |1956\u201357 |Unknown |- | |1957 to 1960 | |- |21 |1960\u201361 |Unknown |- | |1961\u201362 | |- |22 |1962\u201363 |Unknown |- | |1963\u201364 | |- |23 |1964\u201365 |Unknown |- | |1965\u201366 | |- |24 |1966\u201367 |Ansar |- | |1967\u201368 | |- |25 |1968\u201369 |Unknown |- |26 |1969\u201370 |Unknown |- | |1970 to 1972 | |- |27 |1972\u201373 |Unknown |- | |1973\u201374 | |- |28 |1974\u201375 |Unknown |- | |1975 to 1987 | |- |29 |1987\u201388 |Mabarra |- | |1988\u201389 |Canceled |- |30 |1989\u201390 |Unknown |} |valign=\"top\"| {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !No. !Season !Champion(s) |- |31 |1990\u201391 |Unknown |- |32 |1991\u201392 |Akhaa Ahli |- |33 |1992\u201393 |Unknown |- |34 |1993\u201394 |Ahli Saida (Group A) Harakat Shabab (Group B) |- |35 |1994\u201395 |Unknown |- |36 |1995\u201396 |Unknown |- |37 |1996\u201397 |Unknown |- |38 |1997\u201398 |Unknown |- |39 |1998\u201399 |Sagesse |- |40 |1999\u20132000 |Racing Beirut |- |41 |2000\u201301 |Bourj |- |42 |2001\u201302 |Unknown |- |43 |2002\u201303 |Homenetmen |- |44 |2003\u201304 |Unknown |- |45 |2004\u201305 |Unknown |- |46 |2005\u201306 |Shabab Sahel |- |47 |2006\u201307 |Chabab Ghazieh (Group A) Racing Beirut (Group B) |- |48 |2007\u201308 |Chabab Ghazieh |- |49 |2008\u201309 |Ahli Saida |} |valign=\"top\"| {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !No. !
