In the park live 3,000 resident households. The sanctuary has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because it supports black-necked cranes (it is one of the country's two wintering sites), wood snipes and grey-crowned prinias. As of 2007, there was a record of the white-tailed eagle, a first for the sanctuary. It is listed in Bhutan's Tentative List for UNESCO inclusion. ==See also== * List of protected areas of Bhutan * Black-necked cranes in Bhutan ==References== Category:Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests Category:Wildlife sanctuaries of Bhutan Category:Protected areas established in 1998 Category:Lhuntse District Category:Mongar District Category:Trashiyangtse District Category:Important Bird Areas Category:Ramsar sites in Bhutan ",
