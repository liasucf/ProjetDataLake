She was born on August 2, 1912 in Gardiner, Maine to Charles Gordon Palmer and Annie Mayne. She graduated from the New England Conservatory of Music in 1934. Seven years later, she married music conductor Earl V. Clay. They thereafter moved to Manchester, New Hampshire where they each performed for different symphonies. During World War II, they moved to Seattle, Washington and received training from the Civil Aeronautics Administration to become aircraft communicators and controllers which eventually landed them in Alaska. In 1960, four years after the passing of her husband, Clay became one of the first women magistrates for the Alaska court system. The same year Sadie Neakok became the first female to serve in a magisterial capacity. Neither Neakok nor Clay possessed a law degree, though it was not a requirement at the time to serve as a magistrate. She retired from the bench in 1977. Clay was inducted in the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame in 2015. She died on February 11, 2016 in Anchorage, Alaska. == See also == * Alaska Women's Hall of Fame * Courts of Alaska * List of first women lawyers and judges in Alaska == References == Category:American women judges Category:New England Conservatory alumni Category:1912 births Category:2016 deaths Category:Alaska state court judges ",
