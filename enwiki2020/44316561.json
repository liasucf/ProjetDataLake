    "text": "Phantom Head is the seventh album by English rock group The Scaramanga Six. ==Background== In 2012, The Scaramanga Six used a crowd-sourcing initiative to raise funds to travel to Chicago and record with Steve Albini. For these sessions, the band expanded to a sextet for the first time since 2002, with the usual quartet of the Morricone brothers, Julia Arnez and Gareth Champion augmented by a second drummer (Steve Gilchrist, who'd played stints with the band on previous occasions) and James Kenosha on piano (who'd previously both produced and drummed for the band) In keeping with Albini's audio verit\u00e9 production ethos, the band recorded live to two-track tape. The session involved few overdubs. A follow-up session was recorded later in the year, with further vocals being recorded. The completed Phantom Head was released in April 2013. The six-piece lineup of The Scaramanga Six played concerts to support the album before reverting to the standard quartet lineup in 2014. ==Reception== The album was well received by press. In the national media, The Sun gave Phantom Head a four-out-of-five rating and said \"this self-styled evil pop-group persist in producing great albums that demand loudly \u2013 to be heard.\u2033 The Quietus described it as \"another great album from a band that really deserve a much bigger audience.\"Review of Phantom Head in The Quietus Louder Than War wrote \"the guitars are tight, the melodies are memorable and effective and the production is spot on.\"Review of Phantom Head in Louder Than War Vibrations hailed the album as a release which \"must surely rank amongst their finest work to date\".
