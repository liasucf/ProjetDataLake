As a freshman, he was the second-leading scorer on the 2011 national champion UConn Huskies team. ==High school career== Lamb attended Norcross High School in Norcross, Georgia, where he captained the basketball team and averaged 20 points and 6 rebounds per game, leading Norcross to the regional championship, the Elite 8 of the state playoffs and a final record of 27\u20133. He was recruited by UConn after drawing the attention of coach Jim Calhoun, who felt that Lamb reminded him of former UConn star Richard \"Rip\" Hamilton. Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Lamb was listed as the No. 19 shooting guard and the No. 76 player in the nation in 2010.Jeremy Lamb Recruiting Profile ==College career== During his freshman year at UConn, Lamb played in every game. He averaged 11.1 points per game, which was second on the team behind Kemba Walker. He scored a career-high 24 points against Marquette on January 25, 2011.
