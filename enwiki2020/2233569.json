    "text": "\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\" is a single taken from Radiohead's first album Pablo Honey, released just in advance of the album. It is the band's second single, and their first to receive a wide hearing (\"Creep\" had been issued in limited quantities some months earlier, and had charted at #78, but would soon become a hit and ultimately be re-released later in 1993). \"Anyone Can Play Guitar\" peaked at #32 in the UK, and remained a staple of the band's live sets throughout the early-mid 1990s. In Australia, the single peaked at #97 on the ARIA singles chart in 1994. ==Track listing== ===UK CD=== #\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\" (single edit) \u2013 3:21 #\"Faithless the Wonder Boy\" \u2013 4:14 #\"Coke Babies\" \u2013 2:58 ===Netherlands CD=== #\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\" (single edit) \u2013 3:21 #\"Faithless the Wonder Boy\" \u2013 4:14 ===Australia CD=== #\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\" \u2013 3:24 #\"Creep\" \u2013 3:57 #\"Pop Is Dead\" \u2013 2:12 #\"Thinking About You (EP Version)\" \u2013 2:17 #\"Killer Cars (Acoustic)\" \u2013 2:15 * Note: Track 5 recorded live at The Cabaret Metro for JBTV in Chicago on June 30, 1993. ===12\" promo=== #\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\" \u2013 3:25 #\"Faithless the Wonder Boy\" \u2013 4:14 #\"Coke Babies\" \u2013 2:58 ==Personnel== ;Radiohead *Thom Yorke \u2013 lead vocals, rhythm guitar, tape loops *Colin Greenwood \u2013 bass guitar *Jonny Greenwood \u2013 lead guitar *Ed O'Brien \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals *Philip Selway \u2013 drums ==References== ==External links== * \"Anyone Can Play Guitar\" video at YouTube * Category:Radiohead songs Category:Parlophone singles Category:1993 singles Category:Songs written by Thom Yorke Category:Songs written by Colin Greenwood Category:Songs written by Jonny Greenwood Category:Songs written by Philip Selway Category:Songs written by Ed O'Brien Category:1992 songs ",
