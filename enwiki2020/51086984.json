(Sha'aban 661 A.H.) at Maner, a village near Patna in Bihar. His father was Makhdoom Kamaluddin Yahya Maneri bin Israel bin Taj Faqeeh from Al-Khaleel (Palestine), a Sufi saint of Maner. His maternal grandfather Shahabuddin JagjotBalkhi, whose tomb is located at Kachchi Dargah in Patna district, was also a revered Sufi. At age 12, he left Maner to gain traditional knowledge of Arabic, Persian, logic, philosophy and religion. He was tutored by Ashraf-Uddin Abu Towama Bukhari, a famous scholar from Sonargaon near Narainganj (now in Dhaka, Bangladesh) with whom he spent 24 years. At first, he refused to marry but, upon falling ill, he married Bibi Badaam. He left home after the birth of his son Zakiuddin in 1289 A.D. His son lived and died in Bengal. == Career == After completing his education he left for Delhi where he met Nizamuddin and other Sufis. His elder brother Makhdoom Jaleeluddin Maneri (buried at Badi Dargah in Maner Sharif) accompanied him there, and introduced him to his pir (spiritual master) Sheikh Najeebuddin Firdausi. In Delhi, he became a disciple of Sheikh Najeebuddin Firdausi of Mehrauli and was given the title of Firdausi. To shun material comforts, Sheikh Sharfuddin Ahmed bin Yahya Maneri went into the forest of Bihiya (about 15 miles west of Maner). He later went to Rajgir (about 75 miles east of Maner) where he performed ascetic exercises in the hills. A hot spring close to a place where he often prayed in Rajgir is named Makhdoom Kund in his memory. After 30 years in the forests, Sheikh Sharfuddin Ahmed bin Yahya Maneri settled at Bihar Sharif.Later Sultan Muhammad Tughlaq built a Khanqah for him where he taught and trained disciples in Sufism (Tasawwuf). He devoted his life to teaching and writing. ==Bibliography== The collection of his letters (Maktoobat) and sermons (Malfoozat) received wide acclaim.
