They are growing in range and popularity, but remain restricted by the availability of venues. ==Venues== Handicraft markets in Hong Kong are usually held on weekends and holidays. They can be held in various places such as universities (such as the Afternoon Market in City University), malls (such as the weekend creative market in the APM mall), and industrial buildings such as the Wonder Market in Kwun Tong sheung wang industrial building. To join a handicraft market, the host companies which provide the venue will call for applications a few months before the market starts.

The applicant needs to send the host some samples of their artistic works. with a brief introduction. After the selection, the host will invite those who display a suitable style related to their main theme and a need to attend the market, and the application will then succeed.http://www.jccac.org.hk/uploads/jccac/201401/20140127_155125_ZB5U1Y2CQX_f.pdf Example of the online application form.http://www.ahahk.com/2015/02/x.html ==Development and history== With the growth of the handicraft market in Hong Kong, many artists, instead of just having an online shop, are choosing to set up a real shop and take part in handicraft markets.\u7da0\u8272\u624b\u4f5c\u5927\u71b1 90\u5f8c\u767c\u65b0\u5e74\u8ca1 - \u884c\u653f\u4eba\u54e1 - \u7ba1\u7406 - \u751f\u6d3b\u526f\u520a - \u7d93\u6fdf\u901a ET Net.

The handicraft market in Hong Kong faces three main challenges. One of these is the availability of sites for holding a handicraft market. In contrast to Taiwan, where handicraft markets may be held in parks, a handicraft market in Hong Kong may only be held in certain specified places, and only certain holders are permitted to apply to use these. Lastly, to attract sufficient sellers and buyers to attend the handicraft market may also be a challenge, as the handicraft market in Hong Kong is not as well developed as in certain other places. ==Events== thumbnail A road sign to Stanley market in Stanley plaza *Clockencraft is a handicraft market within the Hong Kong Music and Art Festival.
