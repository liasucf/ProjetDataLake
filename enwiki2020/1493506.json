It was the first Soviet helicopter to enter serial production. It is powered by one 575 hp Ivchenko AI-26V radial. It entered service in 1950 and was first seen on the 1951 Soviet Aviation Day, Tushino and was produced for 16 years. More than 1,000 were built in the USSR and 1,594 in Poland, as SM-1. ==Development== Mikhail Mil began work on rotary- winged aircraft before 1930, but the Mi-1, his first production helicopter, was begun in 1946, under a designation EG-1. In 1947 Mil became a head of OKB-4 design bureau in Tushino, and works were intensified. A final design was named GM-1 (for Gyelikopter Mila, Mil's Helicopter).Soviet engineers tried to create a completely original design. So, they made a rotor hub with spaced vertical and horizontal hinges. This design increased the efficiency of helicopter control and was much simpler than that used on American helicopters. The prototype completed first free flight on 20 September 1948 (pilot Mikhail Baikalov). In 1949 it underwent official state trials. Despite crashes of two prototypes,On 24 November 1948, in which Mikhail Baikalov bailed out, and on 7 March 1949, in which Baikalov died the design was an overall success, and after further work, was ordered for a production, under a new designation Mi-1, for Mil initials. The production was initially limited \u2014 the first series of only 15 machines was ordered on 21 February 1950, in factory No.3 in Moscow. Only after presentation to Joseph Stalin in 1951, the authorities decided to increase production. In 1952\u20131953, 30 Mi-1 were manufactured in Kazan, and from 1954 a mass production started in Orenburg and from 1956 in Rostov (current Rostvertol). The design was a subject of further improvements during production, mostly increasing reliability. Especially a rotor technology was changing. Period between repair increased to 300 hours in Mi-1T (hence a letter T for trekhsotchasovoi, 300-hour), 600 in Mi-1A, then to 1,000 and 3,000 hours by the end of production. The Helicopter Museum Mil Mi-1M All early variants seated pilot in front and two passengers behind him, in common cabin.Grzegorzewski, 1975 and Mi-1 at Ugolok neba The first production variant was Mi-1, quickly replaced by improved Mi-1T, that carried extra operational equipment including full radio and blind-flying instruments, and had more reliable engine AI-26V.Grzegorzewski, 1975 and Mi-1T at Ugolok neba The next basic variant was the Mi-1A of 1957, with further increased reliability and provisions for one 160 l external fuel tank.Grzegorzewski, 1975 and Mi-1A at Ugolok neba A new major variant, Mi-1M in 1957 introduced an enlarged cabin and the more powerful AI-26VF engine, which allowed the accommodation of three passengers on a bench behind the pilot. Cabin height increased from 1.22 to 1.26 m and width from 1.01 to 1.2 m. A noticeable difference was horizontal bottom windows line instead of slanted, with bigger rear side windows, and a less pointed fuselage nose. It could also be fitted with two external side capsules for the injured or mail.Grzegorzewski, 1975 and Mi-1M at Ugolok neba There were trials of an armed anti-tank variant Mi-1MU carried in 1961, being the first Soviet attack helicopter, but it did not enter production due to having a small payload and the cessation of production of the basic variant.Jakubovich, Nikolay. Boevye vertolety Rossii. Ot \"Omegi\" do \"Alligatora\". Moscow, Yuza & Eksmo, 2010, , pp.30-33. Well over 1,000 of all variants were built in the USSR, including a proportion of dual- control trainers (with U suffix): Mi-1U, TU, AU, MU, with the instructor seated behind a trainee. 15 were produced in Moscow in 1950, 30 in Kazan in 1952\u20131953, 597 in Orenburg in 1954\u20131958 and 370 in Rostov in 1956\u20131960. In 1956 license-production of the four-seat model began in Poland, at WSK PZL- \u015awidnik, where 1,594 were built until 1965, under the designation SM-1.Krzy\u017can, Marian. Samoloty w muzeach polskich. Warsaw, WKi\u0141, 1983. , p.124. Several new versions were developed at \u015awidnik, including the SM-2 five-seater, with a new fuselage. Several international records in its class were broken with the Mi-1 or SM-2.Grzegorzewski, 1975. ==Variants== ;GM-1 :The original designation of the Mil Mi-1 prototypes, powered by a AI-26GR 500-550 hp radial engine (later AI-26GRF). ;Mi-1 :Three-seat light general-purpose helicopter, seating a pilot and two passengers, powered by a AI-26GRF 575 hp radial piston engine.
