    "text": "Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown is the 13th prime-time animated television special based on the comic strip Peanuts by Charles M. Schulz. It originally aired on the CBS network on January 28, 1975 and aired annually on CBS from 1975 to 2000. It has aired annually on ABC since 2001 and has been paired with A Charlie Brown Valentine since 2009. In this special, Linus attempts to give a valentine to his teacher as Charlie Brown hopes to receive a valentine. ==Plot== Linus is fond of his teacher, Miss Othmar. To show his love, he buys her a huge heart-shaped box of chocolates. When Linus leaves, Sally believes that he bought the candy for her and decides to make him a valentine in return. Later, Lucy goes to a puppet show held by Snoopy. With Charlie Brown narrating the show, Snoopy tells a story about true love. At home, when Sally tries to make a valentine with very little success, Charlie Brown tries to show her how to cut out a heart, only to get upstaged by Snoopy, who makes a music box themed valentine. Valentine's Day comes and the gang brings valentine cards for everybody. Charlie Brown brings a briefcase hoping to receive many valentines. During the party, everybody gets their cards and candy hearts. After the cards are passed out, it turns out Charlie Brown has received nothing except for one candy heart which says \"FORGET IT, KID!\". Linus is also upset as he was unable to give the box of chocolates to Miss Othmar (as she left with her boyfriend). Charlie Brown and Linus vent their heartbreak in different ways: Linus throws his chocolates off a bridge. Charlie Brown slams his briefcase on his mailbox and kicks his mailbox, hurting his foot. The next day, Charlie Brown checks the mailbox for a (hopeful) belated valentine from the Little Red Haired Girl, Violet gives Charlie Brown a used valentine (having crossed her own name from it) as an apology. As Charlie Brown and Linus meet at the brick wall later, Charlie Brown expresses hope that Violet's pity valentine will start a trend and he will get more valentines the next year. ==Voice cast== * Duncan Watson: Charlie Brown * Melanie Kohn: Lucy van Pelt * Stephen Shea: Linus van Pelt * Lynn Mortensen: Sally Brown * Greg Felton: Schroeder * Linda Ercoli: Violet/Frieda * Bill Melendez: Snoopy/Woodstock ==Music score== The music score for ' was composed by Vince Guaraldi (except where noted) and conducted and arranged by John Scott Trotter.

However, a mono version of \"Heartburn Waltz\" (version 6) was first released in 1998 on Charlie Brown's Holiday Hits, marking the first time any music cues from the special received a general release. In the mid-2000s, recording session master tapes for seven 1970s-era Peanuts television specials scored by Guaraldi were discovered by his son, David Guaraldi. This resulted in four additional cues \u2014 \"Never Again\", \"Heartburn Waltz\" (version 8), \"There's Been a Change\" and \"Heartburn Waltz\" (aka \"Charlie Brown's Wake-Up\") (version 9) \u2014 being made available on the compilation album, Vince Guaraldi and the Lost Cues from the Charlie Brown Television Specials, Volume 2 (2008). ==Home media== Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown was released on VHS in the 1980s by Kartes Video Communications, Media Home Entertainment and its Hi-Tops Video subsidiary through the \"Snoopy's Home Video Library\" collection. That release cut out the part in the opening scene where Snoopy keeps shooting arrows, then in 1994 by Paramount Home Entertainment. Paramount released the special in 2003 on DVD with You're in Love, Charlie Brown and It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown. It was rereleased on January 15, 2008 by Warner Bros. Home Video in a \"remastered deluxe edition\" with a new bonus featurette, \"Unlucky in Love: An Unrequited Love Story\". Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown has also been released on laserdisc, and is available on iTunes. ==References== ==External links== * DVD Review of Deluxe Edition * Category:Peanuts television specials Category:Animated television specials Category:CBS television specials Category:Television programs directed by Phil Roman Category:1970s American television specials Category:1975 television specials Category:1975 in American television Category:Valentine's Day television specials Category:Television shows written by Charles M.
