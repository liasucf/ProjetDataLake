Until 1981 she was known only as J. A. Davis. Davis was born Jane Anthony in Warwick, Rhode Island, the daughter of Giles and Sara Robinson Greene Anthony. For a short while in 1838 she attended the Warren Ladies Seminary in Warren, Rhode Island; it has been posited that she studied drawing and painting at that institution. She married Edward Nelson Davis of Norwich, Connecticut, on February 1, 1841, and lived with him in that town for a time. On January 10, 1842, she gave birth to a child. The family moved to Providence, Rhode Island; there she gave birth to another child, her second, on April 26, 1847. In August 1854 she produced her last portrait, of Luella Hodges. She died of tuberculosis eight months later, and was buried in Swan Point Cemetery in Providence. It was common for women artists of the era to sign their work using only their initials, and Davis was no different in this regard; consequently, it was for many years assumed that she was male. In 1981 collectors Sybil and Arthur Kern identified the artist by name, further confirming their identification with two later reports. She produced miniature portraits, working in watercolor and pencil. Most of her subjects are depicted in three-quarter view, at bust length. Often they are clothed in black. Several characteristics appear in many of her depictions: a ragged part in the hair, bluish coloring of the eyelids, a wide and colored horizontal band below the bust, and negative space between the subject's arms and body. The artist sometimes incorporated flowers into her compositions. Many pieces were signed and dated; some also included the subject's name. Davis is known to have produced over 200 portraits, mostly of residents of the areas in which she lived. Three of her unsigned pieces were at one time attributed to James Ellsworth, and later to Alexander Emmons; three others were attributed to Joseph H. Davis and Eben Davis. An undated portrait by Davis, Lady Seated in a Boston Rocker, is owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/10731 Another piece, a family portrait, appeared on Antiques Roadshow in 2003, where it was appraised at between $25,000 and $35,000. ==References== Category:1821 births Category:1855 deaths Category:American women painters Category:19th-century American painters Category:19th-century American women artists Category:American watercolorists Category:Women watercolorists Category:People from Warwick, Rhode Island Category:People from Norwich, Connecticut Category:Artists from Providence, Rhode Island Category:Painters from Rhode Island Category:Painters from Connecticut Category:19th-century deaths from tuberculosis Category:Tuberculosis deaths in Rhode Island Category:Burials at Swan Point Cemetery ",
