In June 2017, the Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB), headed by CEO Ezekiel Mutua, ordered a ban on six series airing on Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, and Nicktoons for allegedly promoting homosexual themes to minors, including Hey Arnold!, The Legend of Korra, and The Loud House. The channel introduced a Nick Jr. block in 2017, which airs every morning. ==References== Category:Television channels and stations established in 2014 Africa Category:2014 establishments in Africa ",
