The rogue Govindan (Ranjith) who works for the drug lords (Naga Kannan and Pattinapakkam Jayaram) comes to her rescue, hence she stays with him for some time at the beach. Govindan then gets into a fight with other rogues and Parvathi is wounded in the process. The prostitute Kannagi (Nakshatra) with a heart of gold takes a wounded Parvathi at her home and accommodates her. Thereafter, Govindan is caught by the police and sentenced to jail for a short period. On his release from the jail, he decides to become a good man and dreams to marry Parvathi. In the meantime, Kannagi is killed in a car accident and the innocent Parvathi is arrested for prostitution.
