    "text": "The genus Ophioderma are distinctive ferns (or fern-allies) in the family Ophioglossaceae. Ophioderma is closely related to, and sometimes treated as a subgenus of, the genus Ophioglossum. It includes the genus formerly known as Cheiroglossa. Recent genetic analysis has indicated that the two genera should be treated as one, and Ophioderma has precedence by being validly published at an earlier date. The type species is Ophioderma pendulum. ==Species== *Ophioderma falcatum (C.Presl) O. Deg. *Ophioderma intermedia (Hook.) Nishida *Ophioderma palmatum Nakai\u2014hand fern *Ophioderma pendulum (L.)
