This was Bangladesh's second tour to Pakistan, with the first occurring in 2001\u201302, when the teams played one Test match.This series was the first international Test cricket series to be held in Pakistan after a 15-month absence due to security concerns. Pakistan announced their squad and included 7 new players without any previous Test cricket experience, after many senior players, such as Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Saeed Anwar) retired after WC 2003. Both series ended in whitewash, with Pakistan winning the test series 3 \u2013 0 and the ODI series 5 \u2013 0. During the Second Test, Bangladesh's Alok Kapali became the first Bangladeshi and the 32nd cricketer overall to take a Test hat-trick. Pakistan captain, Rashid Latif, was banned for 5 One Day Internationals after the test series for falsly claiming a dropped catch.
