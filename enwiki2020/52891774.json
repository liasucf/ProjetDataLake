In February 2018, it emerged that three female workers had accused Forsyth of inappropriate behaviour, texts, and emails before he left Save the Children; Forsyth said he had \"apologised unreservedly\" to them for his \"unsuitable and thoughtless conversations\". UNICEF later said that when Forsyth had joined it in 2016, Save the Children's reference for him had not mentioned the allegations and that it was \"continuing to work with him and Save the Children to get a better understanding of the facts\".
