His memoirs have been criticized for being oddly impersonal and for brushing over his marriage and his conversion to Catholicism, especially as his faith was to become a powerful motif in many of his novels.https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/20/specials/greene-sort.html Despite these omissions he deals frankly with the personal demons he faced in his teens, including an account of several suicide attempts, the resulting psychoanalysis his father arranged for him and his brief fascination with Russian roulette. ==References== Category:1971 non-fiction books Category:British autobiographies Category:Books by Graham Greene Category:The Bodley Head books ",
