    "text": "Woodpecker in the Rough is the 41st animated cartoon short subject in the Woody Woodpecker series. Released theatrically on June 16, 1952, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal International. ==Plot== When the golfing bug bites Woody Woodpecker, he is ready for the game, but the question is \"Is the game ready for him?\" as he tries to match play with a power golfer. Woody's attempts to play golf are interrupted by a big, burly man who makes a bet with him. ==Cultural references== Clarence Wheeler infused the background score with many quotations from Classical music and folk song. *In the scene depicting Woody asleep with his golf clubs, Johannes Brahms's Cradle Song can be heard. *After the sun rises over the golf course, Edvard Grieg's Morning Mood from his Peer Gynt, Op. 23, can be heard. *While a chirping bird breaks Woody's opponent's concentration, the popular American ballad \"Listen to the Mocking Bird\" is played. *Woody washes his golf balls to the tune of the popular Irish jig \"The Irish Washerwoman.\" ==Notes== *There is no director's credit for this film. Lantz himself has claimed to have directed Woodpecker in the Rough. *Woody went back to wearing white gloves in Woodpecker in the Rough (though he wears yellow gloves in the title card). Woody began wearing yellow colored gloves in Wicket Wacky, and continued doing so until Stage Hoax. *In the opening screen credits for Woodpecker in the Rough, the wood template changes from a red- colored wood background (at the series title card) to golden wood (for the rest of the film's intro). This change on the series intro would continue until Wrestling Wrecks. *Woodpecker in the Rough marks the first occasion Grace Stafford provided dialogue for Woody. In the previous nine cartoons, Stafford only provided a revised version of Woody's trademark laugh, or had Woody impersonating a woman. Woody would still only have an occasional line of dialogue here or there until Hypnotic Hick.Cooke, Jon, Komorowski, Thad, Shakarian, Pietro, and Tatay, Jack. \"1952\".
