He participated in the development of System R, the first relational database management system. In 1983, he and Andreas Reuter coined the acronym ACID to describe the essential characteristics of a distributed relational database (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability). These four properties, atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID), describe the major highlights of the transaction paradigm, which has influenced many aspects of development in database systems. ==Awards== Konrad Zuse Medal, 2001 Honorary doctorate from Universit\u00e4t Oldenburg, 2002 ==References== Category:German computer scientists Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt alumni Category:Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt faculty ",
