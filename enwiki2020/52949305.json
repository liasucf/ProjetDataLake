Teams who lost their respective ties competed in the relegation play-offs, with winning teams remaining in Group II, whereas European and African teams who lost their play-offs were relegated respectively to the Europe and Africa Zone Group III in 2018. ==Participating nations== Seeds: # # # # # # # # Remaining nations: * * * * * * * * ===Draw=== ==First round== ===Tunisia vs. Sweden=== ===Cyprus vs. Turkey=== ===Lithuania vs. Madagascar=== ===Georgia vs. Finland=== ===Latvia vs. Norway=== ===Denmark vs. Morocco=== ===South Africa vs. Estonia=== ===Slovenia vs. Monaco=== == Second round == === Turkey vs. Sweden === === Georgia vs. Lithuania === === Norway vs. Denmark === === South Africa vs. Slovenia === == Play-offs == === Cyprus vs. Tunisia === === Finland vs. Madagascar === === Morocco vs. Latvia === === Estonia vs. Monaco === == Third round == === Sweden vs. Lithuania === === Denmark vs. South Africa === ==References== ==External links== *Official Website Europe/Africa Zone Group II Category:Davis Cup Europe/Africa Zone ",
