He competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics and the 2004 Summer Olympics. He debuted professionally in 2004 with the team Comunidad Valenciana. In 2006, during the Operaci\u00f3n Puerto doping case, he was identified as the client of a doping traffic network led by Eufemiano Fuentes, under the code name Bonilla Alfredo. Bonilla was not sanctioned by the Spanish government since doping was not a crime at the time. He did not receive any other sanction either since the judge assigned to the case refused to share the case's evidence with the World Anti-Doping Agency or the Union Cycliste Internationale. Spanish court 31 later cleared him and all the other members of Comunidad Valenciana of any involvement in the case. On a document dated 28 July 2006 the court's secretary made clear none of the team members were found guilty of doping. ==Major results== ;1999 :1st Stage 11 Vuelta Ciclista a Costa Rica ;2001 :1st Time Trial Championships ;2002 :1st Stage 10 Vuelta Ciclista a Costa Rica :1st Overall Vuelta de Higuito :1st Overall Vuelta a Chiriqu\u00ed ;2003 :1st Overall Vuelta Ciclista a Costa Rica ::1st Stage 8 :1st Overall Vuelta a Zamora ::1st Stage 2 :1st Overall Vuelta a Galicia :1st Stage 1 Vuelta a Chiriqu\u00ed ;2004 :1st Stage 1 GP Estremadura :1st Time Trial Championships ;2008 :1st Stages 10 & 12 Vuelta Ciclista a Costa Rica :1st Copa Nacional Protecto :1st Overall Cl\u00e1sica Po\u00e1s :1st Overall Vuelta a Chiriqu\u00ed ::1st Stages 6, 8 & 9 :1st Stage 3 Vuelta a San Carlos ;2009 :1st Stages 6 & 11 Vuelta Ciclista a Costa Rica :1st Time Trial Championships :1st Stage 4 Vuelta a San Carlos :1st Prologue Vuelta a Chiriqu\u00ed ;2010 :1st Time Trial Championships :1st Desafio Powerade :1st Central American Games, Time Trial ;2011 :1st Overall Vuelta Ciclista a Costa Rica ::1st Stages 7 & 10 :1st Time Trial Championships :1st Stages 5 & 7 Vuelta de Higuito ;2013 :9th Overall Vuelta Ciclista a Costa Rica ==References== Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:People from Cartago Province Category:Costa Rican male cyclists Category:Pan American Games competitors for Costa Rica Category:Olympic cyclists of Costa Rica Category:Cyclists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2004 Summer Olympics ",
