He showed an early talent for drawing and his first tutors gained him a scholarship to the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in 1885, where he studied under Jean-L\u00e9on Gerome and Fran\u00e7ois Flameng. He was mainly inspired by historical subjects, especially the Napoleonic era, though he also produced portraits, landscapes, townscapes, and sketches, often adding drawings to his letters. From 1887 to 1914, he took part in the Salon des Artistes Fran\u00e7ais, and won many medals and travel bursaries. Spain, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Africa, and Egypt became major influences on him. He worked in oils, watercolour, gouache, pastel, and charcoal. He died of typhoid fever in 1916. ==Bibliography== *Catalogue for the exhibitions at Granville by the Mus\u00e9e du Vieux Granville and the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019art moderne Richard Anacr\u00e9on (July\u2013October 1999) Category:1916 deaths Category:1867 births Category:19th- century French painters Category:French male painters Category:20th-century French painters Category:20th-century male artists ",
