    "text": "The Dunsmore Cup (French: Coupe Dunsmore) is a Canadian sports trophy, presented annually to the winner of the university-level football competition conducted by R\u00e9seau du sport \u00e9tudiant du Qu\u00e9bec (RSEQ), the governing body for all student sports in the province of Quebec. The RSEQ university football conference, one of four within U Sports, was known as the Quebec University Football League before the 2011 season. The Cup was first awarded in 1980 to the winner of the Ontario-Quebec Interuniversity Football Conference and, upon re-organisation into the Quebec Intercollegiate Football Conference (later the Quebec University Football League and now part of RSEQ), continues to be awarded as the Quebec conference's championship. The winner of the Dunsmore Cup goes on to play in either the Uteck Bowl or the Mitchell Bowl national semi-final, depending on annual rotations. The Dunsmore Cup was donated by Bob Dunsmore of Queen's University, a 1915 Engineering graduate. He was the father of Robert Dunsmore, grandfather of Ross Dunsmore, Rosemary Dunsmore, and Katherine Camarta (n\u00e9e Dunsmore), and great grandfather of Andrew Dunsmore (b. 1983, Toronto), Shannon Sibold (b. 1984, Calgary), Michael Dunsmore (b. 1986, Toronto), William Sibold (b. 1989, Calgary), Georgia Sibold (b. 1992, Calgary), and Robert Van Wart (b. 1994, Toronto). Both Ross Dunsmore and Katherine Camarta are graduates of Queen's Law ('73, and '77 respectively). ==Winners== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Date !Winning Team !Score !Losing Team !Score !Location |- |8 November 1980 |Ottawa |13 |Queen's |12 |Ottawa, ON |- |14 November 1981 |Queen's |26 |McGill |19 |Montr\u00e9al, QC |- |6 November 1982 |Concordia |25 |Queen's |15 |Montr\u00e9al, QC |- |5 November 1983 |Queen's |36 |McGill |5 |Kingston, ON |- |10 November 1984 |Queen's |37 |Bishop's |35 |Lennoxville, QC |- |16 November 1985 |Carleton |46 |Concordia |21 |Ottawa, ON |- |8 November 1986 |Bishop's |38 |Carleton |19 |Lennoxville, QC |- |7 November 1987 |McGill |32 |Bishop's |16 |Lennoxville, QC |- |5 November 1988 |Bishop's |16 |Queen's |7 |Lennoxville, QC |- |4 November 1989 |Queen's |39 |Ottawa |18 |Kingston, ON |- |10 November 1990 |Bishop's |20 |Queen's |9 |Lennoxville, QC |- |9 November 1991 |Queen's |34 |Bishop's |31 |Lennoxville, QC |- |7 November 1992 |Queen's |32 |Bishop's |6 |Lennoxville, QC |- |6 November 1993 |Concordia |10 |Bishop's |7 |Lennoxville, QC |- |5 November 1994 |Bishop's |14 |McGill |7 |Montr\u00e9al, QC |- |11 November 1995 |Ottawa |8 |Queen's |3 |Ottawa, ON |- |9 November 1996 |Ottawa |20 |McGill |11 |Ottawa, ON |- |8 November 1997* |Queen's |7 |Ottawa |24 |Kingston, ON |- |15 November 1998 |Concordia |17 |Laval |12 |Montr\u00e9al, QC |- |13 November 1999 |Laval |38 |Ottawa |6 |Ste.
