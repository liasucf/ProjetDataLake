    "text": "\"We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful\" is a single by English singer Morrissey released in April 1992 by HMV. It was released as the first single from his Your Arsenal album, preceding the album by three months, and was the first Morrissey single to be co-written with guitarist Alain Whyte and produced by glam rock guitarist Mick Ronson, known for his work with David Bowie as one of the Spiders from Mars. Peaking at No. 17 in the UK Singles Chart, the song shows a harder edge to Morrissey's sound and moves away from the lighter pop of his 1991 album Kill Uncle. The Swedish synthpop band Universal Poplab covered the song on their 2004 debut eponymous album, in a duet with the Swedish pop singer H\u00e5kan Hellstr\u00f6m. Reel Big Fish covered the song on their 2005 album We're Not Happy 'til You're Not Happy, replacing the lyric \"And if they are Northern\" with \"And if they are No Doubt\". Morrissey claimed that the lyrics were about the music scene in Manchester, with bands contesting for success. On hating it when his friends became successful, he said: \"When my old friend Simon Topping [the frontman of Manchester band A Certain Ratio] appeared on the cover of the NME, I died a thousand deaths of sorrow and lay down in the woods to die.\" ==Critical reception== Andrew Collins in NME gave a very negative review of the single, writing that \"this is by far and away the ex-Smith's WORST single\" and described the music as \"the sound of five men bashing around in the darkness in search of a tune\" before finishing the review by announcing \"Moz is history, and we'd all do well to learn it.\"NME We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful Review In a retrospective review, Ned Raggett of AllMusic wrote, \"It may be a mouthful, but as delivered it becomes a wonderfully funny, intentionally bitchy sentiment for this EP's lead track.\" ==Track listings== ===7\" vinyl and cassette=== # \"We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful\" # \"Suedehead\" (live London 4/10/91) ===12\" vinyl (UK)=== # \"We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful\" # \"Suedehead\" (live London 4/10/91) # \"I've Changed My Plea to Guilty\" (live London 4/10/91) # \"Pregnant for the Last Time\" (live London 4/10/91) ===CD (UK)=== # \"We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful\" # \"Suedehead\" (live London 4/10/91) # \"I've Changed My Plea to Guilty\" (live London 4/10/91) # \"Alsatian Cousin\" (live London 4/10/91) ===12\" vinyl and CD (USA)=== # \"We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful\" # \"Suedehead\" (live London 4/10/91) # \"I've Changed My Plea to Guilty\" (live London 4/10/91) # \"Pregnant for the Last Time\" (live London 4/10/91) # \"Alsatian Cousin\" (live London 4/10/91) {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
