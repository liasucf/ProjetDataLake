The ridge goes between Windy Pass and Independence Pass, east of Spirit Lake. Several road guides list Windy Ridge Road (NF-99) as one of the best roads in Washington State due to its good pavement, good views, and winding \"sweeper\" curves enjoyable to many drivers and motorcycle riders. At the end of the road at elevation, at above Spirit Lake, there is a viewpoint into the St. Helens crater. NF-99 meets Forest Road 25 near Wakepish Sno-park running to Windy Ridge and other Spirit Lake overlooks past places such as Bear Meadow Viewpoint, Miner's Car, Meta Lake and Cascade Peaks.
