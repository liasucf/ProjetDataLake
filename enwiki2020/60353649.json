A tornado, a lightning strike, and her father's early death when O'Leary was eleven left the family at risk of losing the farm; the ensuing struggle, which her mother met by renting rooms to tourists as a B&B;, marks O'Leary's practice and forms the basis of its feminist language.Atherton, Monique. \"Perforated Utopias,\" Artfile Magazine, March 22, 2019.

She attended the National College of Art and Design in Dublin beginning in 1982, and was awarded a scholarship to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in the United States, where she earned a BFA (1987) and MFA (1989). In 1989, she won a Pollock-Krasner Award and was actively exhibiting in Chicago, including solo shows at Zolla/Lieberman Gallery (1991\u20133).Artner, Alan G. \"O'Leary on Track with Rigorous New Works,\" Chicago Tribune, November 22, 1991.McCracken, David. \"New O'Leary Works Strike Dynamic Balance,\" Chicago Tribune, June 18, 1993.

Writers such as Alison Pilkington and Robin Hill suggest that O'Leary's work deconstructs painting, expanding its possibilities into space while blurring boundaries between object and image with bricolage approaches they trace to Kurt Schwitters and Dada, as well as Arte Povera. O'Leary's exploration extends to the history of painting and its materials, as well as her personal and artistic history; she transforms studio remnants and detritus into new, tactile works through an intuitive, part-handicraft, part invention- through-need process that harkens to her Irish childhood, weaving personal memories into universal narratives.Baume, Sara. \"Helen O'Leary at Catherine Hammond Gallery,\" Visual Artists News, Visual Artists Ireland.

Retrieved March 25, 2019. ===Early paintings=== In her early work in Chicago, O'Leary created large-scale paintings that riffed on the \"heroic\" work of abstract expressionism (e.g., Untitled, 1989). She laid canvas on the floor, capturing drips, mistakes and overshot gestures normally bound for floorboards; for her, the process alluded to issues of class (e.g., servants washing floors) and subsistence (surviving off table leavings and cast offs). Chicago Tribune critic Alan Artner labeled her second solo show at Zolla/Lieberman (1991) a fulfillment of earlier promise, noting her \"drawn, dripped and stenciled\" works for an improvised look that \"disguised their rigor\" and that recalled the early abstractions of Kandinsky. Artner suggested that in the best works, her lattice-like forms \"exploit fragility by suggesting a highly strung discourse that has run amok\" with accretions submerging, encircling, overwhelming firmer shapes and gestures. After purchasing a home in Drumshanbo, Ireland in the 1994, O'Leary traveled more often. As a result, she sought to create still-epic paintings that could fit in suitcases and be reassembled; this extended her fragmented painting process further and led to new modes of creating, picking apart and exhibiting work.Falvey, Deirdre. Artscape: Review, \"Trunk Show,\" Irish Times, December 11, 2004. Aidan Dunne described a painting installation in this vein for EVA International in Limerick (1999) as a \"sprawling but elegantly understated\" recreation of the \"crowded yet calming walls\" of her studio. In the 2000s, she extended these explorations in collaborative installations with artist Katie Holten as \"Plot\"; her experimentation ultimately evolved into her mature \"constructed paintings.\"Sirius Art Centre. \"Sirius Art Centre \u2013 Programme 2000,\" Retrieved March 25, 2019.Foley, Catherine. \"Anything you bamboo...,\" Irish Times, September 30, 2000.

She disassembled, repurposed, glued and patched older works and studio detritus (wood off-cuts, linen scraps, shards, fragments), refashioning them into new works exploring notions of support, stability and the boundaries of painting.Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann. \" Hennessy Art Fund 2018: Helen O'Leary on 'dissembling painting,'\" Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann, May 29, 2018. Retrieved March 25, 2019. Critics suggest the shift liberated her work to take on a variety of tenuous, three-dimensional forms: small, wall-mounted, fa\u00e7ade-like pieces masking precarious scaffolding; free- standing, exposed grid-like constructions that read like absences, with open spaces replacing blocks of color (e.g., Armour - Delicate_Negotiations, 2014); and installations displaying a \"kinetic, Tinguely-like potential.\" O'Leary found inspiration in diverse sources, from bent and pierced armor to the combined concision and complexity of both Sean n\u00f3s song\u2014a form of Irish lament\u2014and the literature of Beckett and poets Louise Gluck and Vona Groarke.Butler, Sharon. \"Ideas and Influences: Helen O'Leary,\" Two Coats of Paint, October 12, 2014.

In the installations The Shape of Disappointment (2007), Outawack (2009\u201312) and Shelf life of facts (2016), she combined excessive, re-figured and re-joined frames to create prosthesis-like supports that suggested shifting perspectives, uncertainty, and a sense of violence and control in their making.Butler Gallery.

The later wall-mounted \"Armour\" series (2013\u20134) featured small, fa\u00e7ades of abutted bits of panel that obscure, but also reveal (through peephole-like fissures), shifting views of also-cobbled, sometimes thwarted armatures.Zinn, Tamar. \"Helen O'Leary: Between moments of certainty,\" October 9, 2015.

Reviewers described them as delicate, tentative pieces that were neither haphazard or slipshod, but rather mysterious, assured edifices of resourcefulness, meticulousness and quiet strength, austerely painted in grey, purple brown, olive and white egg tempera. The Huffington Post deemed the larger, busier works in her \"The Geometry of Dirt\" show (2014) as \"harrowingly emotional\" and \"at once ragged, solid and radiant,\" their processes of destruction and construction suggesting the piecing together of an incomplete self, and holes and punctures reading like wounds; the review identified in the work's minimalism a rejection of that movement's intellectualism, de-materiality and transcendence for something \"experiential and earth-bound.\" Helen O'Leary, Shelf life of facts (Installation details), constructed wood, linen, egg tempera, steel, aluminum, porcelain with gold luster.

New York Times critic Holland Cotter called the work \"painterly,\" also observing how it evoked memory and history and laid bare O'Leary's process and that of making paintings in general.
