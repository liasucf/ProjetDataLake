As an ethnic Albanian, he had fought for the Ottomans against the Safavids in Persia. After that he had built a mosque (the Sylejman Pasha Mosque), a bakery and a hammam ( Islamic sauna). He founded the settlement of Tirana, now the capital of Albania, in 1614 as an oriental-style town of those times. According to some legends, he named the town he founded after Tehran, the capital of Persia (nowadays Iran). With Suleymans foundations, Tirana soon became the center of Albanian art, culture and religion (especially with the Spread of Islam and the Bektashi Sufism), it became famous because of its strategic position at the heart of Albania. His resting place, the Suleyman Pasha Tomb, got destroyed during the Communist dictatorship. A statue of Sulejman Pasha stands in the square named after him in downtown Tirana.
