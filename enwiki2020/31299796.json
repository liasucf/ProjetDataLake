    "text": "The Expedition of al-Muraysi\u02bf () was an early Muslim campaign against the tribe of Banu Mustaliq which took place in January 627 CE. ==Surprise attack== On hearing the advent of the Muslims, the tribe was terrified, and the Arabs that accompanied them defected and fled for their lives. Abu Bakr was entrusted as the commander of the Muhajir's (Emigrants), and Sa\u2018d bin \u2018Ub\u0101dah was the commander of the An\u1e63ar (Helpers). The two armies were stationed at a well called Al-Murays\u012b', near the sea, a short distance from Mecca. They fought with bows and arrows for an hour, and then the Muslims advanced so rapidly, they surrounded the al-Mu\u1e63\u1e6daliq and took the entire tribe as prisoners, with their families, herds and flock. The battle ended in full victory for the Muslims. (free online) 'Al\u012b ibn Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib killed a few wounded Ban\u016b al-Mu\u1e63\u1e6daliq; among whom were M\u0101lik and his son. Two hundred families were taken as captives, two hundred camels, five thousand sheep, goats, as well as a huge quantity of household goods which were captured as booty. The household goods were sold in an auction to the highest bidder. However, there is an accident during the battle where 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit unintentionally killed one of his Ansari clansmen, Hisham ibn Subabah by mistake since he thought Hisham was an enemy. Juwayr\u012byah bint al-\u1e24\u0101rith, daughter of the Ban\u016b al- Mu\u1e63\u1e6daliq chief was one of the captives, and agreed to marry Mu\u1e25ammad in exchange for releasing 100 prisoners who converted to Islam, as compensation (according to the Muslim scholar Safiur Rahman al Mubarakpuri).Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 29, Number 3920 ==Altercation between the fighters on return to Medina== The army remained at the well of Al-Murays\u012b' for several days, during which an altercation ensued between the Muh\u0101jir and An\u1e63\u0101r. One of the Muh\u0101jirs, named Jahja, attacked an Ans\u0101r\u012b, and the two groups immediately clashed, but the quarrel was broken up by Mu\u1e25ammad. 'Abdull\u0101h ibn \u2018Ubayy, who was referred to as the head of the Hypocrites (al-Mun\u0101fiq\u016bn) by Muslim historians, was furious for the challenge which the Muslims showed towards the hostile plans and vicious intrigues woven behind closed doors, and swore \"the most honourable will expel the meanest out of Madinah\", and added: \"They (the Muslims) have outnumbered and shared us our land. If you fatten your dog, it will eat you.\" When that talk was reported to the Mu\u1e25ammad, 'Umar asked for permission to have Ibn \u2018Ubayy killed. Muhammad turned down his proposal on the grounds that it was not becoming for a prophet to be accused of killing his people. 'Abdull\u0101h ibn Ubayy's son, who was also called 'Abdull\u0101h, was angry at his father for the disrespect he showed. When the army reached Madinah, he drew his sword against his father and barred his father's entry into the town until he had confessed and declared that he himself was the meanest of the citizens of Madinah and that Mu\u1e25ammad was the most honourable of them. The son was ready to cut off his father's head and bring it to Mu\u1e25ammad, if he so wished. He said, according to the Muslim Historian al-\u1e6cabar\u012b: According to the Sealed Nectar, Mu\u1e25ammad did not punish Abdull\u0101h ibn Ubayy in the public interest. 'Umar ibn Al-Khatt\u0101b asked Mu\u1e25ammad why he did not accept his offer to kill him, to which he replied: ==Islamic primary sources== ===Hadith literature=== The event is mentioned in many collections of \u1e25ad\u012bth. *\u1e62a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25 al- Bukh\u0101r\u012b mentions the event as follows: *\u1e62a\u1e25\u012b\u1e25 Muslim \u1e25adith compilation also makes mention of some parts of the expedition: Many other \u1e25ad\u012bths mention a surprise attack, according to the historian Sir William Muir. ===Biographical literature=== The event is mentioned in Ibn Hish\u0101m's biography of Mu\u1e25ammad;, the Muslim jurist Ibn Qayyim al-Jawz\u012byah also mentioned the event in his biography of Mu\u1e25ammad called Z\u0101d al-Ma'\u0101d., Footnote 1. ==See also== *Muhammad as a general ==Notes== Mubarakpuri, Safiur Rahman Al (2005) Category:627 Category:Campaigns led by Muhammad ",
