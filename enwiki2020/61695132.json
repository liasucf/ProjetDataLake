Honor Week events in 2019 were banned by the Governorship of \u0130zmir. The \u0130zmir Bar Association applied to the court to suspend the execution of the ban on the grounds that it was unlawful. The court eventually issued a decision to stop the execution of the ban. With this decision, it was announced that the \u0130zmir Pride march would take place for the seventh time on June 22nd. However, the police intervened in the march and detained more than twenty people. == Supporters and organizers == *Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University Equal Ribbon Community *Ege University LGBTQ Community *E\u011fitim-Sen \u0130zmir LGBTQ Commission No. 2 *Red Rainbow \u0130zmir *HDK \u0130zmir LGBTQ Commission *\u0130zmir LGBTQ Initiative *Black Pink Triangle *Ahura LGBTQ *\u0130zmir Bar Association == References == Pride Category:June events Category:LGBT events in Turkey Category:Pride parades Category:Recurring events established in 2013 Category:2013 establishments in Turkey ",
