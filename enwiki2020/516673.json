Morrison (October 5, 1869August 20, 1953) was the 55th Governor of the U.S. state of North Carolina from 1921 to 1925. ==Early life and career== He was born in 1869 in Richmond County, North Carolina. In 1898, Morrison participated in the Wilmington insurrection of 1898, a violent coup d'\u00e9tat by a group of white supremacists. They expelled opposition black and white political leaders from the city, destroyed the property and businesses of black citizens built up since the Civil War, including the only black newspaper in the city, and killed an estimated 60 to more than 300 people. The governor of North Carolina, Daniel Lindsay Russell, was forced to flee from Wilmington to Raleigh. Morrison boarded in train in Maxton, North Carolina in the company of a small band of Red Shirts and warned Russell that a more hostile band of Red Shirts were waiting at a later stop. He advised Russell to hide in the baggage car to avoid being lynched, which he did.*, pp. 172-173 In 1900, he was elected to the North Carolina Senate for one term.NCpedia biography of Cameron Morrison ==Governorship== With the backing of Sen. Furnifold Simmons and the help of race-baiting tactics employed by A. D. Watts, Morrison defeated O. Max Gardner in the 1920 Democratic primary for governor.News & Observer: \"What the obituary didn't say\" by Rob Christensen In the general election, he defeated Republican nominee John J. Parker. He came to be called \"the Good Roads governor\" for his support of a modern highway system.

Overman) between 1930 and 1932, but lost his seat in the Democratic primary runoff to Robert R. Reynolds. Morrison was later elected to one term in the United States House of Representatives from 1943 to 1945. He again lost a Democratic primary for a U.S. Senate seat in 1944, to Clyde R. Hoey.
