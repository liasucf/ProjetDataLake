    "text": "The Fruit Bowl is an early 20th century drawing by Juan Gris. The work was produced as part of a collaboration between Gris and Pierre Reverdy to commission a book filled with lithographs made from the former's paintings. The project was interrupted by the onset of World War One in 1914 and never finished. Reverdy composed a poem titled The Fruit Bowl to accompany the painting. Gris' work is currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. == References == Category:Drawings of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Category:1916 drawings Category:Paintings by Juan Gris ",
