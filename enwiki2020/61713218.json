    "text": "Silverhorn Mountain is a mountain summit located in the Mistaya River valley of Banff National Park, in the Canadian Rockies of Alberta, Canada. Silverhorn Mountain is situated 3.9 kilometres southeast of Mount Weed, and 3.1 km northwest of Observation Peak. Silverhorn stands directly east across the Mistaya River valley from Mount Patterson, and both are prominent features seen from the Icefields Parkway. ==History== The mountain was given its descriptive name in 1899 by Rev. Charles Lathrop Noyes (1851-1923), a member of the Appalachian Mountain Club who climbed in the Rockies and made several first ascents, such as Mount Balfour, Mount Gordon, and Mount Lefroy. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1924 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. ==Geology== Like other mountains in Banff Park, Silverhorn is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.Geology of the Rocky Mountains and Columbias, by Ben Gadd, 2008 ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Silverhorn Mountain is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 \u00b0C with wind chill factors below -30 \u00b0C. Precipitation runoff from Silverhorn Mountain drains west into the Mistaya River, or east into Dolomite Creek which is a tributary of the Siffleur River. ==References== ==See also== *List of mountains of Canada *Geography of Alberta *Geology of the Rocky Mountains ==External links== * Parks Canada web site: Banff National Park * Climbing Silverhorn Mountain at Explor8ion.com * Silverhorn Mountain: weather forecast Category:Mountains of Alberta Category:Mountains of Banff National Park Category:Canadian Rockies ",
