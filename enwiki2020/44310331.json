    "text": "\"One and All (We Are)\" is the second single from The Smashing Pumpkins' tenth album Monuments to an Elegy. The track premiered through Huffington Post on November 5th, 2014. ==Recording and sound== In an interview with the Huffington Post, band leader Billy Corgan said \"I basically sang the whole song the first time I wrote it... It had written itself.\" Rolling Stone described the track as having \"a deep wash of grungy guitar distortion ...the hard-rocking \"One and All\" features the drumming of M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's Tommy Lee bashing his way through Billy Corgan and Jeff Schroeder's murky mires of guitar and the singer's lyrics about feeling young.\" ==Reception== The song was favorably received. Stereogum said \"The brand new, guitar-overloaded \u201cOne and All\u201d is a considerable improvement on \u201cBeing Beige,\u201d in my opinion \u2014 it\u2019s considerably heavier, too, which plays to Billy Corgan\u2019s strengths at this point in his career.\" Music Times stated that \"Fans of the Pumpkins will not be disappointed, as the song has a darkly metallic quality reminiscent of their 1995 opus Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\"Spin.com stated \"The new track isn't quite a return to the Pumpkins' glory days, but \"One and All\" does boast a shoegaze-set-on-overdrive sheen.\" ==Personnel== ;The Smashing Pumpkins *Billy Corgan \u2013 vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards and synthesizers *Jeff Schroeder \u2013 guitar ;Additional musicians *Tommy Lee \u2013 drums ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !
