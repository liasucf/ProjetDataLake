Key findings of his research include: * In Egypt, the government's employment guarantee for graduates and the fact that public sector wages in the 1990s were at least as high as in the private sector have jointly encouraged queuing for government jobs, reduced the employment of graduates in the private sector, and thereby contributed to high youth unemployment rates and unsustainable growth of public sector employment.Assaad, R. (1997). The Effects of Public Sector Hiring and Compensation Policies on the Egyptian Labor Market. World Bank Economic Review, 11(1), pp. 85-118. * The differences between Egyptian men and women's access to wage employment has increased during the 1990s, in part because women have less geographic mobility and thus cannot pursue job opportunities to the same degree as men.Assaad, R., Arntz, M. (2005). Constrained Geographic Mobility and Gendered Labor Market Outcomes under Structural Adjustment: Evidence from Egypt. World Development, 33(3), pp. 431-454. * Labour market relations in settings where formal institutions are absent or ineffective, e.g. in Egypt's construction market in the late 1980s, may still be shaped by informal institutions such as customs, kinship groups, or other social networks.Assaad, R. (1993). Formal and informal institutions in the labor market, with applications to the construction sector in Egypt. World Development, 21(6), pp. 925-939. * Egyptian women in urban areas respond differently to their husbands working abroad than in rural areas: whereas in urban areas, female labour market participation decreases in response to male international migration, female work in rural areas simply shifts towards unpaid family and subsistence work.Binzel, C., Assaad, R. (2011). Egyptian men working abroad: Labour supply responses by the women left behind. Labour Economics, 18(51), pp. 98-114. == Selected publications == * Assaad, R., Krafft, C. (2015).
