It was designed by eminent British architect Edwin Lutyens as a residence for Mir Osman Ali Khan, the last Nizam of Hyderabad.https://www.livehistoryindia.com/cover-story/2019/09/22/sanjan- digging-deep-into-historyhttps://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/stories- behind-the-royal-abodes/article8203558.ece ==History== Hyderabad House was built for Mir Osman Ali Khan, the last Nizam of Hyderabad. It is situated next to the Baroda House, the erstwhile royal residence of the Maharaja of Baroda and currently the zonal headquarters office of Northern Railways. After Indian independence in 1947, the palace was taken over by the Indian Government from the Nizam. It is currently used by the Government of India for banquets and meetings for visiting foreign dignitaries. It has also been a venue for joint press conferences and major government events. == Architecture == Spread over 8.77 acres, and built in the shape of a butterfly, in Indo-Saracenic architecture. The entrance hall of the palace, a dome with an entrance hall beneath with symmetrical wings at fifty-five degree angle, is the outstanding feature. It has 36 rooms including a zenana, four of which have now been converted into dining rooms. It is located to the northwest of the India Gate. With the exception of the Viceroy's House, it was the largest and grandest of all palaces built in Delhi by Edwin Lutyens during 1921-1931. The Nizam\u2019s sons disliked the building, finding it too western in style for their taste and was seldom used. == See also == * Jaipur House * Bikaner House * Baroda House * Patiala House * Dholpur House == References == ==Further reading== * * Delhi By Patrick Horton, Hugh Finlay ==External links== *Deccan Herald feature *Panoramio photo Category:Official residences in India Category:Hyderabad State Category:Government buildings in Delhi Category:Royal residences in Delhi Category:Works of Edwin Lutyens in India Category:Palaces of Nizams of Hyderabad Category:State guesthouses ",
