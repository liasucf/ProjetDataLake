    "text": "Ellis Robins School is a Zimbabwean boys' high school that was founded in Salisbury, Rhodesia in 1953. It is located in the suburb of Mabelreign in Salisbury (now called Harare). Next door is Mabelreign Girls High School, the school's sister school. The Ellis Robins school colours are yellow and blue, the badge has two dolphins facing each other, and the school Latin motto is \"Esse Quam Videri\" which means \"To be, rather than to seem\". This motto comes from the family coat of arms of Sir Ellis Robins, who was Chairman of the British South Africa Company and the school is also named after him. There was a government proposal in 2003 to rename all schools in Zimbabwe and Ellis Robins was scheduled to be called Leopold Takawira Boys High but overwhelming parental disapproval ensures that the original name is still used. The school is one of the popular group A schools that participate in the Dairiboard Schools Rugby Festival which is held annually at Prince Edward School. Ellis Robins who are famously known as \"FUSH\", are fierce rivals with Allan Wilson High School with whom they compete with in various sporting disciplines. This rivalry is known to have existed since the colonial era. ==House system== Malcolm (boarders), Lawley, Newton, Abercorn ==Clubs and societies== The school has a variety of Clubs and Societies that are offered to the students to participate in.
