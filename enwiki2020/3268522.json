Recently, it was demonstrated that this species produces two acyl-homoserine lactones (S-(-)-N-hexanoyl- and N-heptanoyl-homoserine lactone), widely recognized bacterial quorum sensing signaling substances, and employed in bacterial cell-to-cell communication systems. ==References== ==External links== *Type strain of Erwinia psidii at BacDive - the Bacterial Diversity Metadatabase Category:Bacterial plant pathogens and diseases Category:Bacteria described in 1988 Category:Enterobacterales ",
