The settlement that formed around it was initially called Noble. Because it was located at the mouth of Spencer Creek, the community became known as Spencer Creek and received a post office with that name on June 15, 1869. After the Pere Marquette Railway came to the town in 1891, the post office was renamed Alden on July 18, 1892, for William Alden Smith, who was an official with the railroad company. Smith later became a congressman and U.S. senator from Michigan. The community of Alden was listed as a newly-organized census- designated place for the 2010 census, meaning it now has officially defined boundaries and population statistics for the first time. == References == == External links == *Some information about Alden and nice photographs of the Alden railroad depot Category:Unincorporated communities in Antrim County, Michigan Category:Census-designated places in Michigan Category:Census- designated places in Antrim County, Michigan Category:Unincorporated communities in Michigan Category:Populated places established in 1868 Category:1868 establishments in Michigan ",
