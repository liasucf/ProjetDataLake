The House of Representatives subsequently let the bill die, so the changes were not realised. Had the changes been approved, the legislature would have become unicameral from 2009 onwards. ==Campaign== The Puerto Rican Independence Party supported the victorious \"yes\" vote in favor of one chamber. The Popular Democratic Party did not take an official stance on the matter, with its leadership supporting or opposing the measure. The New Progressive Party opposed the constitutional amendment under electoral review, but supported abstention from the vote. ==Results== {| class=wikitable style=text- align:right !Choice !Votes !% |- |align=left|One chamber||464,010||83.94 |- |align=left|Two chambers '||88,733||16.06 |- |align=left|Invalid/blank votes||1,212||\u2013 |- |align=left|Total||553,955||100 |- |align=left|Registered voters/turnout||2,453,292||22.58 |- |align=left colspan=3|Source: Direct Democracy |} ==References== ==External links== *State Commission of Elections of Puerto Rico 2005 Category:2005 in Puerto Rico Category:2005 referendums Category:2005 ballot measures Category:2005 Puerto Rico elections Category:July 2005 events in North America ",
