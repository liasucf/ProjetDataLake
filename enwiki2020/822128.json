    "text": "The Battle of M\u00e9ribel took place at M\u00e9ribel (now in Haute-Savoie, France) on 13 September 1793, when the forces of the Kingdom of Sardinia were defeated by the French Army. In 1792, Revolutionary French forces had marched into Savoy to \"bring freedom\" to its people as part of the French Revolution. A decree annexing it to France was signed on 27 November of the same year, and it became the 85th d\u00e9partement of France, renamed as the Mont Blanc d\u00e9partement. Following the execution of King Louis XVI, the French Revolution became widely despised and feared elsewhere in Europe. In 1793, the French Republic raised an army of 300,000 men, while only few Savoyards signed up for service. A much larger force of Savoyards, conducted by the Royalist camp attacked the French Army, and reconquered the Alpine valleys and Annecy. However, they were not enough to remove the French presence from Savoy and the territory was retaken. ==References== Category:1793 in France Category:Conflicts in 1793 Meribel 1793 Meribel 1793 Category:Battles in Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes ",
