On 9 August candidates George London and Robert Snijders came forward. London is a Queen's Service Medal recipient, given to him for his services to the community; he is a volunteer health shuttle driver for St John Ambulance since 2009 and was elected chairman of the Marton Community Patrol in June 2015. Snijders is a civil engineer and the new owner of the Old Granary in Marton since July 2016; Snijders and his wife aim to restore the building\u2014a Heritage New Zealand Category II building\u2014which had burnt down in March 2013. ==Campaign== On 28 July, as no other candidates had yet come forward, mayor Watson encouraged other candidates to stand for the mayoral election saying \"It would be poor democracy if there were no more names put forward\". Watson voiced his drive as being the number of projects he had initiated that he wanted to see through, and the district being faced with fairly major challenges around earthquake infrastructure. Snijder's view on the council is that \"it needed to be more engaged with the community\". Snijder has been a civil engineer working in Libya, Russia and England doing urban rejuvenation. \"With my construction background I feel I'm more than qualified to step in and provide advice and expertise on costs and how to improve the proposed design [of new proposed centres in Bulls, Marton and Taihape].\" In addition, Snijder aims to increase tourism in the area. London, a resident in Marton for 16 years and chair of the Marton Community Patrol, has said the council \"needs a 'stronger' leader\". Further adding: \"I don't think there's a strong enough council there at the moment. They're a bit shy, a bit quiet and I want to be a bit louder and get out there more\". ==Results== The results were released on 31 October 2016.https://www.rangitikei.govt.nz/news/2016/final-election-results ==See also== *2016 Rangitikei local elections *2016 New Zealand local elections ==References== ==External links== *2016 elections information on the Rangitikei District Council website *2016 elections information on the Electoral Commission website Rangitikei Category:Politics of Rangitikei Rangitikei ",
