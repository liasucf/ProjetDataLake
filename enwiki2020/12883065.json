    "text": "David Michael Matranga (born January 8, 1977) is an American former professional baseball infielder. He played parts of two seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Houston Astros in 2003 and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 2005. ==Career== Matranga played for the Texas Rangers Triple-A affiliate, the Oklahoma Redhawks, in 2007. In January 2008, Matranga signed a minor league contract with the Kansas City Royals. He became a free agent at the end of the season and signed a minor league contract with the Florida Marlins in February 2009. After playing the entire season for their top farm team, the New Orleans Zephyrs, he became a free agent once again. Matranga was the 86th player in major league history and the second player in Astros history to hit a home run in his first plate appearance, doing so on June 27, 2003. Pinch-hitting in the ninth spot, Matranga batted in the fifth inning against Joaquin Benoit, which tied the game 4-4, although the Rangers would rally to win 10-7.https://www.baseball- reference.com/boxes/HOU/HOU200306270.shtml As it turned out, it was his only major league hit, as he failed to get a hit in his next five plate appearances in MLB, with his final appearance being the lone one with the Angels in 2005. After being released by the team on July 9, 2005, he signed as a free agent with four teams over the next four years, although he never made it back to the big leagues. After retiring at 32, Matranga became an sports agent, becoming Director of Scouting at PSI Sports Management.https://www.foxsports.com/mlb/story/houston-astros-texas-rangers- david-matranga-one-done-101315 ==References== ==External links== *MiLB.com Player Page * Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Major League Baseball second basemen Category:Houston Astros players Category:Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim players Category:Auburn Doubledays players Category:Round Rock Express players Category:New Orleans Zephyrs players Category:Arizona League Angels players Category:Arkansas Travelers players Category:Salt Lake Stingers players Category:Portland Beavers players Category:Oklahoma RedHawks players Category:Omaha Royals players Category:Baseball players from California Category:Pepperdine Waves baseball players ",
