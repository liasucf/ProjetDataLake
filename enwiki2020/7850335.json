It was formerly known as the Frederic B. Pratt House, as it was built for him as the family home with his wife Caroline Ladd Pratt. Completed in 1898, it was designed by architects Babb, Cook and Willard in a neo-Georgian style. Caroline Ladd Pratt survived her husband. She bequeathed the mansion to the Pratt Institute, which the family had long supported. Today it us used as the residence of the college president. In 2017, Matiz Architecture and Design completed a restoration project that addressed many facade and window elements, bringing the historic residence back to its more elegant appearance. The exterior trellis was also restored as part of the architectural restoration. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1898 Category:1898 establishments in New York (state) Category:Babb, Cook and Willard buildings Category:Houses in Brooklyn Category:Colonial Revival architecture in New York (state) Category:Pratt Institute ",
