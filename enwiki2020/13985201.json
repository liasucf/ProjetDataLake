On 11 September 2008, following the MPRP's victory in the June parliamentary election, S. Bayar was elected as the new Prime Minister of a coalition government between the MPRP and DP.AFP: Mongolian parliament elects PM after turmoil Under his leadership, the Mongolian Government finally signed an investment agreement to mine the Oyu Tolgoi copper deposit.Investment Agreement on Oyu Tolgoi Deposit Signed Montsame, 6 October 2009 The deal was later revealed that in fact it was in favor of the investors. According to some sources, after his resignation he moved to the US and bought several properties on his daughter and relatives names. Later it was found that he has several offshore accounts. It is believed that he still has influences on MPP which is confirmed by a leaked video footage in which he gives advice to Miyegombo Enkhbold, the official head of the party, for his presidential election speech preparation. ===2008 state of emergency=== On 1 July 2008 Nambaryn Enkhbayar, President of Mongolia of that time announced State of Emergency in the midnight after the riot was over. During his announced State of Emergency the police chased civilians and shot four civilians to death from their backs and severely injured a dozen of civilians to life disability in streets different from demonstration or riot location. Also the police arrested approximately 1000 people in street or from random locations whether connected to the riot or not and imprisoned them including children and women without legal advocacy and inhumanely and degradingly treated them with torture involved as they claimed and later released some of them and sentenced some of them. Victims, and their families, civil societies claim the responsibility to Nambaryn Enkhbayar who announced the state of emergency in the middle of night - uncustomary hour of announcing state of emergency and shooting civilians without weapons in streets by chasing them and shooting them from their backs in random locations. A wounded teenager to lifelong disability and witnesses confirmed that they were shot by the police. The police is the state enforcement agency under the government, thus President Nambaryn Enkhbayar, Prime Minister Sanjaagiin Bayar and Minister of Justice Munkh-Orgil have been blamed by the victims, their families, and civil societies for the deaths. === Declining health and resignation === Bayar was admitted to a hospital in Ulan Bator in October 2009. Because of his declining health, Bayar announced his resignation in a letter to Mongolia's parliament one week later on 26 October 2009. A meeting held two days later confirmed that the Mongolian parliament had accepted his resignation. Bayar apologised to those who had voted for him. Norov Altankhuyag, the First Vice Prime Minister, temporarily moved up as Bayar's replacement. Bayar then was replaced by S\u00fckhbaataryn Batbold on 29 October 2009. On 8 April 2010, Sanjaagiin Bayar read his written request to resign from the chairmanship of former communist party Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party due to declining health reasons to the conference of the party and then was replaced by S\u00fckhbaataryn Batbold for the position on the same day from the party conference. == Arrest == On April 11, 2018, Bayar and Saikhanbileg, another former prime minister of Mongolia, were arrested by the anti-graft agency of Mongolia. ==References== ==External links== * Bayar becomes Prime Minister Onoodor newspaper (Mongolian) * Bayar becomes Prime Minister of Mongolia The UB Post newspaper (English) Category:1956 births Category:Ambassadors of Mongolia to Russia Category:Living people Category:Mongolian diplomats Category:Mongolian expatriates in the Soviet Union Category:Mongolian expatriates in the United States Category:Mongolian People's Party politicians Category:Moscow State University alumni Category:People from Ulaanbaatar Category:Prime Ministers of Mongolia Category:Heads of government who were later imprisoned ",
