The filmmakers share many common techniques including the use of poetic dialogue and allegorical storytelling dealing with political and philosophical issues with documentary style narrative films. Barari's works are influenced by documentary filmmaker Morteza Avini and narrative film director Abbas Kiarostami, Who has a reputation for using child protagonists, for documentary style narrative films, for stories that take place in rural villages, and for conversations that unfold inside cars, using stationary mounted cameras. He is also known for his use of contemporary Iranian poetry in the dialogue, titles, and themes of his films. \"Barari is the unvarnished offspring of Kiarostami and Hitchcock!\" ==Filmography== *City in the Hands of Children (1991) *The Nest (1992,Banned) *The Green Hell (1996) *The Devil's Dance (2000) *Dead Heat under the Shrubs (2004,Banned) *Day of Rain (2007) *Maryam's Report (2005/2011,Banned/Disbanded) *The Twelve Chairs (2011) ==Festivals and awards== ===1988=== *REACTION (short film) \\- 1st National Students Film Festival, Tehran; won the top prize \\- Fajr Film Festival, Tehran ===1989=== *REACTION (short film) \\- Ebensee Festival of Nations, Austria; won the silver plaque ===1991=== *LONELINESS AND THE CLOD (short film) \\- 5th International Festival of Film and Video for Children and Young Adults, Tehran; Won The Golden Butterfly for the Best Film \\- FIPA Cannes-91, France *City in the Hands of Children \\- Fajr Film Festival, Tehran ===1992=== *City in the Hands of Children \\- 6th International Festival of Film and Video for Children and Young Adults, Isfahan *The Nest \\- Fajr Film Festival, Tehran ===1996=== *The Green Hell \\- Fajr Film Festival ===2000=== *The Devil's Dance \\- Fajr Film Festival ===2004=== *Dead Heat under the Shrubs \\- 7th Brooklyn Int'l Film Festival, USA-New York \\- Cinema Paradise Film Festival, USA-Hawaii \\- 12th Raindance Film Festival, UK \\- 6th Panorama, Greece-Thessaloniki \\- 49th Valladolid Int'l Film Festival, Spain; Winner of Audience Award Best Film \\- 7th Rehoboth Beach Independent film Festival, USA-Delaware \\- 1st annual Turks & Caicos, USA \\- 4th Anchorage Film Festival, USA-Alaska \\- 4th Tiburon International Film Festival, USA ===2005=== *Dead Heat under the Shrubs \\- Festival del Cine Pobre, Cuba-Gibara \\- Indianapolis International Film Festival, USA ===2006=== *Dead Heat under the Shrubs \\- Int'l Fest. of Muslim Cinema\"Golden Minbar\", Russia-Kazan ===2007=== *Dead Heat under the Shrubs \\- 9th Mumbai International Film Festival, India *Day of Rain \\- Roosta Film Festival, Tehran; Won the Golden Plaque for the best film \\- 21st International Children Film Festival, Hamedan; Mentioned for religious content \\- 1st Quran Film Festival, Tehran; Won the Khademin QurF an Medal \\- 25th International environmental film festival, Paris \\- The 37th Roshd International Film Festival, Tehran/Nov.2007 ==References== == External links == * *World Iranian Film Center Official Website Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Iranian film directors Category:Iranian film producers Esmael Barari ",
