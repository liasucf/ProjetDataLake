Their donation, combined with others, allowed the museum to be constructed in Central Park on the southeast side of downtown.History . Bakersfield Museum of Art. Accessed: 04-12-2010. When the museum was completed, it was turned over to the city for maintenance. It was operated by volunteers of the Bakersfield Art Association, and the city appointed Art Commission. Primarily the museum would showcase the work of local artists and occasionally a traveling art show. It would also be surrounded by gardens, which would showcase sculptures and other art forms. In 1990, the museum was transferred from the city to the Bakersfield Art Foundation, an independent governing agency. At that time, the name was changed to the Bakersfield Museum of Art. Since then, the museum has seen many changes. In 1991, one year after the transfer, the museum was accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. In 1997, with major endowments from Patricia Crail Brown Foundation and the late Dr. George and Millie Ablin, the museum started a campaign to expand. In June of the same year, the foundation purchased the land the museum occupied from the city. Work then started on expanding the facility. By 2001, construction on the structure was completed. ==Description== The Bakersfield Museum of Art is . It contains two large galleries and two smaller galleries.
