    "text": "Santiago Mart\u00edn Prado (born 21 March 1955), sometimes known as Pradito, is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a midfielder, and a manager. ==Playing career== Madrid-born Prado was an Atl\u00e9tico Madrid youth graduate, and started playing for the reserves in 1974, with the side in Tercera Divisi\u00f3n. He played the 1976\u201377 season on loan at CD Eldense in the same category before returning to Atleti. Prado established himself as a starter during the 1979\u201380 season, contributing with a career-best 16 goals as his side achieved promotion to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. He left the club in 1982, after two full seasons in the second tier. ==Coaching career== Prado returned to Atleti in 1994, after being named manager of their farm team CP Amor\u00f3s. After achieving promotion to the fourth division, he was named in charge of the B-team, and led the club back to the second level in his first season; in his second, however, he was dismissed in November after only four points out of 30. Prado subsequently managed other clubs in the lower leagues, being in charge of CF Rayo Majadahonda (two stints), Getafe CF, CD Toledo, Talavera CF, CD Legan\u00e9s and UD San Sebasti\u00e1n de los Reyes.
