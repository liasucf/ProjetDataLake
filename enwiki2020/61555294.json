His parents were juvenile delinquents who later became \"musicianaries\", eventually playing in Christian metal bands. He was banned from listening to secular rock music on the radio until he was a teen. Matt has never served time in prison. He did community service by working construction for 12 hours a day and performed at biker rallies and prisons with his parents' ministry. ==Career== In November 2016, Maeson released his debut single \"Cringe\". In 2018, Maeson performed at festivals such as Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, and Forecastle. Prior to the release of his debut album Bank on the Funeral on April 5, 2019, he released two EPs, Who Killed Matt Maeson in 2017, and The Hearse in 2018. In January 2019, his song \"Cringe\" reached No. 7 on the Adult Alternative Songs chart. The song later spent four weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in August that year, the longest running number-one single by a new artist in 2019. \"Cringe\" was certified gold by the RIAA on February 11, 2020. In August 2020, Maeson returned to number one on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart with \"Hallucinogenics\", which went on to top the Billboard Rock Airplay chart one week later. ==Discography== ===Albums=== * Bank on the Funeral (2019) ===Extended plays=== * Who Killed Matt Maeson (2017) * The Hearse (2018) ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font- size:90%;\"| US Alt. ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| US Rock ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| US AAA ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| CAN.
