    "text": "Bernhard Sabel Bernhard Sabel (1957, Trier) is a German psychologist who heads the Institute of Medical Psychology at the Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg. Sabel investigates treatment options for visual impairments through the activation and rehabilitation of residual vision. His work has appeared in over 200 publication. == Research interests == Sabel's basic and clinical research work focuses on brain plasticity and vision restoration. Based on this work with animal models of vision loss and his clinical work, he discovered that low vision and blindness must not be viewed as irreversible, but that it can be improved or restored to some extent, even long after the damage has occurred. The underlying theory and mechanisms of vision restoration were spelled out by the \u201chypothesis of residual vision activation\u201d. It states that in patients with visual impairments, residual vision can be activated again by means of vision training exercises or non- invasive brain current stimulation. By reactivating previously hypometabolic, inactive (\u201csilent\u201d) neurons, visual function can thus recover, improving not only vision test results but also subjective vision and quality of life. Sabel showed that vision restoration is independent of the person's age, sex, and duration of the damage, but that it depends primarily on the degree of how much residual vision the patients still have. Most recently, he discovered that the mental stress has a negative influence on vision restoration while relaxation techniques (such as meditation) improve outcome. == Publications == Sabel's work has been published in Science, Nature Medicine, Archives of Neurology, Neurology, and Neuroimage.. Sobel.s research work on vision loss and vision restoration also inspired the thriller novel trilogy authored by .. Sabel has published over 240 science publications since 1979 in international SCI journals, 10 books, and over 40 book-chapters related to the topic of brain plasticity and vision restoration following glaucoma, optic neuropathy and stroke. Sobel has given over 500 lectures at national and international conferences. Since 1997 Sobel has been the Editor-in-Chief of the SCI journal Restorative Neurology and Neuroscience.
