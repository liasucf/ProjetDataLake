In Hindu mythology, it is referred to as the physical holy location where a temple or a collection of temples, its tank and deities exist. ==Sacred geography== There exist privileged regions and places where energy in the form of terrestrial magnetism rises heavenward. As per Hindu religious mythology, Prana (gravity) pulls life downwards, while apanan (levity) pulls life upwards. Such places are called Tirtha (ways), Kshetra (ways) or pitha (base). Sacred geography can identify sacred places and sometimes explain the importance of those which are already known.The Hindu Temple. Alain Danielou The dwelling of gods must be built on such privileged ground (kshetras), and, as a rule, sacred cities arise around them.Brahmatsamhita,55.4-8 The temple should be close to a water course or near a lake located to the east or north. For the building of a temple, it should have a lake on the left (north) or in front (east), and not otherwise. If the temple is built on an island, the presence of water all around is of good omen.Vishnu Dharmottar Purana, 3.93.30-31 ==See also== *Hindu *Hindu calendar *Hindu deities *Hindu denominations *Hindu mythology *Hinduism by country *List of Hindu temples *List of notable Hindus *List of related articles *Tirtha and Kshetra *Theertham ==References== Category:Hindu temple architecture ",
