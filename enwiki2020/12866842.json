Barr, No. 19-16487 (9th Cir. Aug. 16, 2019): Judge Tashima partially dissented when the Ninth Circuit held 2-1 that Trump's asylum ban could take place in New Mexico and Texas but not California or Arizona. Tashima would have blocked the asylum ban in all 4 states.

Neal Bain, No. 17-10107 (9th Cir. June 11, 2019): Writing for a unanimous panel, Judge Tashima overturned a conviction for armed bank robbery. He held that the defendant\u2019s inadvertent placement of a closed pocket knife on a bank counter did not constitute \u201carmed\u201d bank robbery because this action did not \u201cput[] in jeopardy the life of any person by the use of a dangerous weapon,\u201d which is a requirement for armed bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d).Julie Steinberg (June 11, 2019). \u201cPlacing Knife on Counter During Bank Robbery Not \u2018Use\u2019 of Weapon\u201d. \u201cBloomberg Law\u201d. *On March 8, 2019, Tashima ruled that asylum seekers are entitled to habeas review and have the right to appeal their deportations. *United States v. Evelyn Sineneng-Smith, No. 15-10614 (9th Cir. Dec. 4, 2018): Writing for a unanimous panel, Judge Tashima struck down a statute as unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the First Amendment. The panel held that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324(a)(1)(A)(iv)\u2014which permits a felony prosecution of any person who \u201cencourages or induces\u201d an alien to come to, enter, or reside in the United States if the encourager knew, or recklessly disregarded the fact that such coming to, entry, or residence is or will be in violation of law\u2014was unconstitutional because it criminalizes a substantial amount of protected expression in relation to its narrow band of legitimately prohibited conduct and unprotected expression. Judge Tashima wrote, \u201cAt the very least, it is clear that the statute potentially criminalizes the simple words \u2013 spoken to a son,a wife, a parent, a friend, a neighbor, a coworker, a student, a client \u2013 \u2018I encourage you to stay here.\u2019\u201d He also wrote that the statute appeared to apply to statements amounting to \u201cpure advocacy on a hotly debated issue in our society.\u201dJosh Gerstein (Dec. 4, 2018). \u201cFederal appeals court rules against another immigration crackdown attempt\u201d. \u201cPolitico\u201d. *Gonz\u00e1lez v.
