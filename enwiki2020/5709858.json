    "text": "\"Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth with Money in My Hand\" is a song by American alternative rock group Primitive Radio Gods. It was released in June 1996 as the lead single from their debut album, Rocket. The song became popular after being featured in the movie The Cable Guy (as well as its film soundtrack). Soon after, it peaked at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks and Adult Alternative Songs charts. It became a radio hit over the following few months, reaching number two in Canada and number 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart. ==Content== The song's title is a reference to the otherwise unrelated song \"Outside a Broken Phone Booth with Money in My Hand\" by Bruce Cockburn, from his 1978 album Further Adventures Of. Its chorus consists of a sample from the 1964 B.B. King song \"How Blue Can You Get\": \"I've been downhearted, baby, ever since the day we met.\" At the end of the song, the lead singer also sings King's sampled lyrics. ==Reception== Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote \"With its loping, unthreatening hip-hop beats and its looped B.B. King sample, 'Standing' had all the appeal of an adult novelty for most listeners\u2014it was something that was out of the ordinary, to be sure, but not something that you would want to investigate much further.\" ==Track listing== American CD #\"Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth with Money in My Hand\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 4:35 #\"Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth with Money in My Hand\" \u2013 5:39 American 7\" #\"Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth with Money in My Hand\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 4:35 #\"Feel Me\" \u2013 2:46 British CD #\"Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth with Money in My Hand\" (Radio Edit) \u2013 4:35 #\"Mona Lisa\" \u2013 3:10 #\"Feel Me\" \u2013 2:46 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1996) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1996) !scope=\"col\"|Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada Top Singles (RPM) |34 |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada Rock/Alternative (RPM) |13 |} ==Cover versions== It was covered by The Copyrights on the Methadones/Copyrights split CD.
