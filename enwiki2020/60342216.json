Mukherjee was called as Nihar, Arti, Santi, Sovarani Bose, Bani, Suroma Devi, and Khuki to maintain the secrecy during the Indian revolution. == Titagarh conspiracy case == Parul Mukherjee was connected in the Titagarh conspiracy case together with Purnanondo Das Gupta, Sita Nath Dey, Nihar Ranjan Ray, Shyam Benode Pal chowdhury and others for making explosives to fight against the British, due to their severe torture upon the labours. All the activists used to reside in a haunted house at Goala Para, under P.S Titagarh. With her help, the police began to suspect her along with her associates. Parul Mukherjee was in charge of a house at Titagarh, a Municipality of North 24-Parganas District in the Indian State of West Bengal and provided shelter for revolutionary fugitives escaped from jail. In 1936, Purnananda Das Gupta and Sitanath Dey along with other revolutionaries who escaped from the Alipore Jail had taken shelter at the Titagarh House, and were discovered by the British police. On 30 January 1936, she was arrested along with thirty-three people from the hiding place of Titagarh which led to the Titagarh Conspiracy Case. Jitendra Mohan Banerjee represented her in the case against the Emperor. Mukherjee along with other Anushilan Samiti leaders, workers and absconders were convicted and put behind bars on 9 May 1938. Parul Mukherjee was unmarried and later self-retired from public life. == References == Category:People from Comilla Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing ",
