    "text": "Mount Tumbine is a mountain in northern Mozambique. It lies in Milange District of Zamb\u00e9zia Province, immediately east of the town of Milange. The Ruo River, which forms the border between Mozambique and Malawi, runs north of the mountain, separating it from the larger Mulanje Massif in Malawi. It is surrounded by plains on the east, south, and west. The mountain consists of a nearly circular intrusion of syenite, 8 km in diameter.Woolley, Alan Robert (1987).
