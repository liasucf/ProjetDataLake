The mission was contracted by NASA and is flown by SpaceX. This CRS mission is the first with the Falcon 9 Block 5. It carried the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar and the Robotic Refueling Mission 3 experiment as external payloads. ==Launch== On February 2016, it was announced that NASA had awarded a contract extension to SpaceX for five additional CRS missions (CRS-16 to CRS-20). , a NASA Inspector General report had this mission manifested for August 2018, but it was later delayed to 29 November, 4 December, and 5 December 2018. The first stage booster B1050.1 experienced a grid fin hydraulic pump stall on re-entry. This caused the first stage to go into a roll after the re-entry burn. It failed to reach Landing Zone 1, but recovered enough to achieve a water landing off Cape Canaveral. Shortly after the landing, Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, stated the booster appeared undamaged and was being recovered. He also stated that if the damage is not enough to retire the booster, it \"could be used for an internal SpaceX mission in the future\". On 13 January 2019, Dragon was released from ISS at 23:33 UTC and deorbited, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean approximately 5 hours later on 14 January at 05:10 UTC, returning more than of cargo to Earth. ==Payload== NASA has contracted for the CRS-16 mission from SpaceX and therefore determines the primary payload, date/time of launch, and orbital parameters for the Dragon space capsule. CRS-16 carried a total of of material into orbit. This included of pressurised cargo with packaging bound for the International Space Station, and of unpressurised cargo composed of two external station experiments: the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar and the Robotic Refueling Mission 3. Forty mice also flew with the payload in an experiment called Rodent Research-8 (RR-8). The CRS-16 mission also carried a pair of CubeSats originally planned to launch aboard the Cygnus NG-10 International Space Station cargo resupply mission, but which were deferred. These included the UNITE CubeSat from the University of Southern Indiana and the TechEdSat-8 CubeSat from NASA's Ames Research Center. The following is a breakdown of cargo bound for the ISS: * Crew supplies: * Science investigations: ** Rodent Research-8 (RR-8) ** Molecular Muscle Experiment (MME) ** Growth of Large, Perfect Protein Crystals for Neutron Crystallography (Perfect Crystals) * Spacewalk equipment: * Vehicle hardware: * Computer resources: * Russian hardware: * External payloads: ** Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI): \u2248 ** Robotic Refueling Mission 3 (RRM3) ==See also== *Uncrewed spaceflights to the International Space Station ==References== ==External links== * Dragon website at SpaceX.com * Commercial Resupply Services at NASA.gov Category:SpaceX Dragon Category:Spacecraft launched in 2018 Category:SpaceX payloads contracted by NASA Category:Supply vehicles for the International Space Station Category:Spacecraft which reentered in 2019 ",
