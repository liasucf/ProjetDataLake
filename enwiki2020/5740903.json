    "text": "A Tribute to Buzz Shearman is a compilation/tribute album by the Canadian rock group Moxy in the band's original incarnation with Buzz Shearman, Earl Johnson, Buddy Caine, Bill Wade and Terry Juric. The album is a tribute to Moxy vocalist Buzz Shearman (who died in a motorbike accident in 1983) from his wife Vallerie. She was an executive with the indie label Ahed Records Of Canada and released the album. The album collects some of the band's best- known and three previously unreleased songs called \"Trouble\", \"Eyeballs\" and \"Highway\" with Shearman on vocals. The back cover of the album features a nice testimonial from San Antonio's disc jockey known as the godfather of rock, Joe Anthony, who wrote : \"Buzz had that special quality in his voice that carried a smile and a lift. He penetrated himself into the listeners and was very forceful with them. He gave a definite impression to the music. His passing was untimely, but he gave us so much in such a short span. His music is his legacy\". There are two distinct versions of the album cover one released in 1984 and the second released in 1994 on CD. ==Credits== * Buzz Shearman: vocals * Earl Johnson: Guitar * Buddy Caine: Guitar * Bill Wade: drums * Terry Juric: Bass * Tommy Bolin: Guitar solo \"Train\" * Jack Douglas : Producer * Valerie Shearman : Producer * Mark Smith : Producer ==Tracks== #Sail on Sail Away \u2013 4:52 \u2013 From Moxy I (1975) #Can't You See I'm a Star \u2013 3:36 \u2013 From Moxy I (1974) #Train \u2013 4:37 \u2013 From Moxy I (1975) #Cause There's Another \u2013 3:43 \u2013 From Moxy II (1976) #Trouble \u2013 3:52 \u2013 Previously unreleased track (Buzz Shearman) #Change in My Life \u2013 4:37 \u2013 From Moxy II (1976) #Eyeballs \u2013 3:03 \u2013 Previously unreleased track (Johnnie Lovesin) #Sweet Reputation (Symphony for Margaret) \u2013 3:54 \u2013 From Ridin' High (1977) #Highway \u2013 4:12 \u2013 Previously unreleased track (Earl Johnson) #Riding High \u2013 4:03 \u2013 From Ridin' High (1977) ==Reissued== Moxy\u2019s original catalogue of albums were again available starting in 1994 when Valerie Shearman (\"Buzz\" widow) oversaw the release of all of Moxy's back catalogue of albums on CD through Pacemaker Records, and again in 2003 this time through Unidisc Music Inc. ==References== ==External links== *Moxy official website Category:1984 compilation albums Category:Tribute albums Category:Moxy (band) albums Category:Albums produced by Jack Douglas (record producer) ",
