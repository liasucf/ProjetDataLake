    "text": "Mustafa Hamsho (; born 10 October 1953) is a retired Syrian boxer who never won a world title but fought some big names in his career. Though he was not a winner in all of those fights, he did some things to make every one of his fights interesting and controversial in some regard. The Syrian Slugger racked up a winning record in the late 1970s defeated Wilford Scypion on June 15th, 1980 and former world middleweight champion Alan Minter on June 6th,1981 to get a shot at then-champion Marvelous Marvin Hagler in October of that year, but showed no respect for the champion during their matchup - or at least for the time it lasted. Hagler methodically used right jabs and right hooks to bust up Hamsho's face (which needed 55 stitches) until the fight was stopped in the 11th. (The fight was not actually stopped on cuts; Hamsho's corner stopped the fight due to a Hagler barrage in the 11th.) Sports Illustrated commended Hamsho, calling him courageous for his effort on that fight.https://vault.si.com/vault/1981/10/12/one-goring-one-boring Hamsho continued to fight, defeating Curtis Parker, future world champion Bobby Czyz, and former three-division world champion Wilfred Ben\u00edtez during 1982 and 1983, then received a return visit to take on Hagler in a rematch in October 1984 in NYC's Madison Square Garden. After Hamsho tried to play rough in the early going, Hagler ended things early this time by flooring Hamsho twice in the third round (the second knockdown produced by a Floyd Patterson-like hook), thus forcing Hamsho's trainer to jump in and stop the fight. Hamsho would continue to fight, with the biggest name on his list being Donny Lalonde, who decisioned Hamsho in the spring of 1987 and would then go on to become light heavyweight champion later that year. Hamsho's career would then peter out over the next few years. ==Professional boxing record== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- !Result !Record !Opponent !Type
