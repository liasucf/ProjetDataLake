He was present in kurultai where Jamukha was elected Gurkhan in 1201. According to a story, he, along with the Oirat chief Quduqa B\u00e4ki, used a jada or \"thunder stone\" to unleash a powerful storm on Genghis' army. But the magical ploy backfired when an unexpected wind blew the storm back at Quduqa. Buyruq, troubled by this storm, left the alliance and retreated to the south side of the Altai Mountains.The Secret History of The Mongols, \u00a7144 He was soon attacked by Keraites led by Toghrul in 1202, in alliance with Genghis on shores of Soqoq-Usun river (in modern Ulaangom). Caught unprepared, Buyruq fled and crossed Altai, arriving at Ulungur river. Buyruq's general K\u00f6kse Sabraq attacked Toghrul who moved away from Genghis, defeated Toghrul's son Sengg\u00fcm, capturing his son and wife in process.
