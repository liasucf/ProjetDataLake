    "text": "Portrait of Alfred Verhaeren by William Jelley Alfred Verhaeren (Brussels, 8 October 1849 \u2013 Ixelles, 10 February 1924) Alfred Verhaeren at the Netherlands Institute for Art History was a Belgian painter known for his portraits, interior scenes, architectural paintings and still lifes.S. Sulzberger, Alfred Verhaeren, Biographie Nationale de Belgique, Volume 32, p. 557-559 He participated in the second wave of Belgian Realism and was later influenced by Impressionism.Louise Fredericq, Alfred Verhaeren in: Dictionnaire des peintres belges ==Life== Alfred Verhaeren was born in Brussels. He was the cousin of the poet \u00c9mile Verhaeren. He studied at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts of Brussels under Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Portaels and Louis Dubois. He studied still lifes by the old masters to perfect his technique. Lost in thoughts Verhaeren was a member of the group of artists called Chrysalide founded in Brussels in 1875 and to which belonged artists such as James Ensor, Constantin Meunier and Frans Van Leemputten. Chrysalide held its first exhibition in 1876 and the last one in 1881. Verhaeren remained independent for a while until he joined the Cercle Pour l'Art.Jules Du Jardin, L'Art Flamand, Bruxelles, A. Boitte, 1896, p. 81-85 He later joined an association for young artists, which was given the Dutch name Voorwaarts ('Forward') in 1885. Co-founders were Franz Meerts and Louis Baretta. Its motto was: Hooger is ons doel ('Higher is our goal'). What is remarkable is both the Dutch-language name of the association and the Dutch-language motto. Its members included Ernest Hoerickx, L\u00e9on Massaux, Emile Rimbout, Jan Stobbaerts, Pieter Stobbaerts, Eug\u00e8ne Surinx, Flori van Acker and Camille Wauters. Later others joined including Theodoor Verstraete, Emile Claus, Adrien-Joseph Heymans, Gustave Vanaise, Victor Gilsoul, Eug\u00e8ne Laermans, August De Bats, Henri Ottevaere and Emile Van Doren. The first salon of Voorwaarts was held in 1885 in the IJzerenkruistraat in the bustling heart of Brussels. In 1888 Voorwaarts exhibited in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels. The association ceased to exist in 1893.Ernest Verlat, Exposition du Voorwaarts 1892 in: La Jeune Belgique, 1892, XI, 2, p. 124 Interior of a church Verhaeren participated in numerous exhibitions: in Paris in 1889, in Berlin in 1891 and at the Maison des Arts in Brussels in 1896. At the Exposition Universelle (1900) he won a silver medal. Alfred Verhaeren died in Ixelles on 10 February 1924. ==Work== Verhaeren is known for his portraits, interior scenes, architectural paintings and still lifes. He was a member of the second wave of Belgian Realism and was later influenced by Impressionism. Verhaeren used a very personal technique: his intense and bright tones are heavily impasted while the surface of the painting, slightly crushed, has the appearance of enamel. ==Notes== ==External links== * Category:1849 births Category:19th-century Belgian painters Category:Belgian landscape painters Category:Belgian still life painters Category:Belgian portrait painters Category:1924 deaths ",
