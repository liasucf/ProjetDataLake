He began his career with hometown side Torrent CF, and went on to represent CF Balaguer, CF Borges Blanques, UE Lleida's reserves, CF Tremp, UD Fraga, CD Bin\u00e9far, UD Barbastro and UD Alcampell, where he retired in 2002 at the age of 33. ==Coaching career== Immediately after retiring Seligrat took up coaching, being named manager of his last club Alcampell. For the 2003\u201304 season, he took over CD Teruel in the fourth division, but was sacked in May 2004. Seligrat was appointed at fourth tier side Atl\u00e8tic Ciutadella CF in August 2004, moving to fellow league team CF Sporting Mahon\u00e9s the following June. On 4 June 2007, he left the latter club to join Juan Carlos Oliva's staff at Superleague Greece side Aris Thessaloniki FC, but left the club shortly after Oliva was sacked, just a few months later. Upon returning to Spain, Seligrat was named in charge of CF Gand\u00eda in May 2008, and managed to achieve promotion to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B with the club in 2010. He subsequently left the club for CD Ol\u00edmpic de X\u00e0tiva, whom he also helped promote to the third division in 2011. On 18 June 2012, Seligrat was appointed manager of third division side Lleida Esportiu. At the club, he managed to reach the promotion play-offs twice, but was knocked out in both times; he subsequently left the club. On 24 November 2014, Seligrat took over Hurac\u00e1n Valencia CF, still in the third tier. On 9 October 2015, he resigned, and was appointed in charge of CD Alcoyano the following 20 May. On 22 June 2017, Seligrat was named manager of CE Sabadell FC, still in the third division. He was sacked by the club on 14 January 2019, after nearly fighting with the club's supporters in his last match in charge. On 17 November 2019, Seligrat was appointed at Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona, freshly relegated to the third division. The following 11 June, he renewed his contract with the club until 2021. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:People from Torrent, Valencia Category:Spanish footballers Category:Valencian footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Tercera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Divisiones Regionales de F\u00fatbol players Category:CF Balaguer footballers Category:CD Bin\u00e9far players Category:UD Barbastro players Category:Spanish football managers Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B managers Category:Lleida Esportiu managers Category:Hurac\u00e1n Valencia CF managers Category:CD Alcoyano managers Category:CE Sabadell FC managers Category:Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona managers ",
