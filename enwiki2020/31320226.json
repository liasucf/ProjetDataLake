In September 2018, Thy won the FIFA Fair Play Award during the 2018 The Best FIFA Football Awards. Thy missed an Eredivisie match for VVV Venlo against PSV Eindhoven to save the life of a Leukemia patient in urgent need of matching stem cells for treatment by donating blood. His gesture actually saw an increase in cell donations in the Netherlands after widespread coverage of this news all over the world. \"The best thing about the story is that thousands of new donors registered in the Netherlands - this really makes me proud,\" Thy said during his acceptance speech. On 5 January 2019, Thy returned to the Eredivisie signing with PEC Zwolle for 1.5 years. In May 2020, Thy agreed to join Sparta Rotterdam, also of the Eredivisie. ==International career== Thy was joint topscorer in the tournament alongside Luc Castaignos as Germany won the 2009 UEFA European Under-17 Championship.
