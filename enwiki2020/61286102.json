She has done extensive work at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California and was President of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis from 1992 to 1994. She was President of the Scientific Council of the Fondation pour la Recherche M\u00e9dicale, President of the Board of Directors of Inserm, Vice-President of the Board of Directors of the Institut Curie, Member of the Institut universitaire de France, Member of the Ethics Committee of the CNRS, Member of the Conseil \u00c9conomique, Social et Environnemental (CESE) and Head of Scientific Information and Communication of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences. == Professional career == Dominique Meyer is currently Professor Emeritus of Hematology at the University of Paris XI, member of the Scientific Council of the Parliamentary Office for the Assessment of Scientific and Technological Choices (OPECST) and member of the Institut de France, whose Central Administrative Commission she chaired in 2019. Her world-renowned work has been devoted to the study of hemostasis and more specifically to the analysis of one of the proteins involved, von Willebrand factor, which is the central focus of her research on the molecular mechanisms that ensure a balance between bleeding and thrombosis. == Publications == \\- On her research: more than 350 original articles and about fifty general reviews, book chapters or didactic articles.
