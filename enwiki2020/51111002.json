    "text": "The Dammersfeld Ridge () is a low mountain chain in the High Rh\u00f6n in Germany, which begins on a line from Bischofsheim to Gersfeld and runs in a southwesterly direction to Riedenberg \u2013 Werberg \u2013 Maria Ehrenberg. The majority of this area today is a military out-of-bounds area, the Wildflecken Training Area. Its highest point is the Dammersfeldkuppe, the second-highest mountain in the Rh\u00f6n. The Bavarian-Hessian state border runs along the crest of the mountain chain. == Natural regions == The Dammersfeld Ridge was first defined in 1968 as a natural region as part of the natural regional classification of Germany at a map scale of 1:200,000 (Sheet 140 Schweinfurt), and it is grouped as follows:Brigitte Schwenzer: Geographische Landesaufnahme: Die naturr\u00e4umlichen Einheiten auf Blatt 140 Schweinfurt - Bundesanstalt f\u00fcr Landeskunde, Bad Godesberg 1968 \u2192 Online-Karte (PDF, 4 MB) *(part of no. 35 East Hesse Highlands) **(part of no. 354 High Rh\u00f6n) ***(part of no. 354.0 Southern High Rh\u00f6n) ****354.00 Dammersfeld Ridge == Mountains == * Dammersfeldkuppe (927.9 m; northwest of Wildflecken, in the southwest of the area) ** Dreifeldskuppe (832 m, west-northwest summit) ** Ottersteine (821 m, northern summit) *** Bremerkopf 797 m ** Dalherdakuppe (801 m, north- northwestern summit) * Eierhauckberg (910 m) ** Beilstein (865 m; west- southwestern summit) * Hohe H\u00f6lle (894 m) ** Himmeldunkberg (888 m, southern summit) ** Teufelsberg (844 m, southwestern summit) * Mittelberg (880 m; almost a northeastern spur of the Eierhauckberg) ** Schachen (857 m; eastern summit) ** Rommerser Berg (850 m; northern summit) ** Zornberg (838 m, southern summit}) * R\u00fcckberg (870 m, almost a southern spur of the Dammersfeldkuppe) * Reesberg (851 m) * Simmelsberg (843 m, with the Simmelsberg winter sports area) * Gro\u00dfer Auersberg (809 m) * Kleiner Auersberg (808 m) * Ehrenberg 674 m File:Kreuzberg-Panorama.jpg|View from the Kreuzberg northward to the Dammersfeld Ridge with Kleiner- and Gro\u00dfer Auersberg, Dammersfeldkuppe, Eierhauckberg and Himmeldunkberg. == References == Category:Mountain ranges of Bavaria Category:Mountain ranges of Hesse Category:Rh\u00f6n Mountains Category:Natural regions of the East Hesse Highlands Category:Rh\u00f6n-Grabfeld Category:Bad Kissingen (district) Category:Fulda (district) ",
