    "text": "Kristoffer Lo (born 19 February 1985 in Moss, Norway) is a Norwegian jazz musician (tuba, flugabone, guitar, keyboards) and composer. == Biography == Kristoffer Lo (2011) Lo has redefined the use of tuba and its role in band. From its traditional role as the low-end in symphony orchestras and Dixieland bands, he has taken the instrument to a new direction, filling the position as the ultra low end in metal- and noise bands. With a bunch of electronics and huge amps, Kristoffer\u2019s tuba sounds like a low-end monster and a high pitched squeal at the same time. He is a part of bands like Pelbo, Trondheim Jazz Orchestra, Microtub, Sunswitch and Highasakite. With music studies from the jazz program at the Musikkonservatoriet i Trondheim, he has slowly built up a solid reputation both in Norway and elsewhere. == Honors == *2013: This years Jazzstipendiat at Moldejazz == Discography == === Solo albums === *2013: Anomie (Gigafon Records) *2016: The Black Meat (Propeller Recordings) === Collaborations === ;Midtnorsk Ungdomsstorband with Andr\u00e9 Roligheten and Brother K *2009: Live At Dokkhuset (MNJ Records) ;With PELbO *2010: PELbO (Riot Factory) *2011: Days Of Transcendence (Riot Factory) ;With Microtub (Hayward / Lo / Taxt) *2011: Microtub (Sofa Records) *2014: Star System (Sofa Records) ;With Machina *2011: So Much For Dancing (\u00d8ra Fonogram) ;With Sunswitch *2012: Sunswitch (Riot Factory) ;With Highasakite *2012: All That Floats Will Rain (Propeller Records) *2014: Silent Treatment (Propeller Records) ;With Yodok *2013: #2 (The Perfect Hoax) ;With Yodok III *2014: Yodok III (A New Wave Of Jazz) *2015: The Sky Flashes.
