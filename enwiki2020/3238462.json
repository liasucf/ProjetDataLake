    "text": "Renishaw plc () is a British engineering company based in Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire. The company specialises in measurement, motion control, healthcare, spectroscopy and manufacturing and is best known for its coordinate-measuring machines and machine tool products. It is a leading company in metal additive manufacturing where machines print parts from metal powder. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. ==History== The Company was founded by Sir David McMurtry and John Deer in 1973. McMurtry had needed to measure fuel pipes on a prototype jet engine: at the time, coordinate-measuring machine sensors featured rigid styli, which required manual positioning on the surface and which yielded poor repeatability when measuring delicate components. To meet this need, McMurtry invented a touch-trigger probe device, which he then patented. The probe featured an elegant 'kinematic' location for a spring-loaded stylus, providing a highly repeatable seated position for the stylus combined with the compliance needed to measure such components. Renishaw was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in November 1984. In 2006 the Company bought 'itp', a German manufacturer of precision styli.UK metrology firm buys precision styli maker Manufacturing Talk, 19 June 2006 In early 2009 the global recession reached Renishaw, resulting in a large proportion of the workforce being placed \"at risk\".Engineering firm Renishaw cuts 500 jobs Guardian, 11 March 2009 Since 2009, Renishaw has seen a turnaround in business, with orders doubling within a year,Gloucestershire engineering firm Renishaw recruiting BBC News, 23 June 2010 and the company stating that it had \"recovered strongly since the worldwide recession\".Gloucestershire firm offers 125 jobs for young people BBC News, 10 December 2010 In 2010 Renishaw bought a stake (and subsequently took complete control) of Measuring Devices Ltd, a company providing a range of services in the field of surveying equipment.

The company's strategy has been to grow organically sustained by patented innovations. The company's product portfolio has since expanded into touch probes for CNC machine tools, calibration systems that optimise the performance of CNC machinery, linear encoder systems, rotary encoder systems, additive manufacturing machines, dental CAD/CAM systems, Raman spectroscopy and medical devices for functional neurosurgery applications. ==Locations== Renishaw's main offices are situated in an old mill from the industrial revolution, with several new buildings on a site. It is a nature oriented site, with dozens of birds (including ducks and swans) and a large lake. The site is also close to the village of Charfield, slightly west of the market town of Wotton-Under- Edge. The company has a machine shop located at Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, and an assembly facility at Woodchester, both near Stroud. There are further assembly facilities in Dublin (Ireland) and Pune (India). Renishaw also has research facilities located in Wotton-under-Edge, Edinburgh and Ljubljana. ==References== ==External links== *Official site *Yahoo profile Category:Engineering companies of the United Kingdom Category:Companies listed on the London Stock Exchange Category:Companies based in Gloucestershire Category:Technology companies established in 1973 Category:Wotton-under-Edge Category:1973 establishments in England ",
