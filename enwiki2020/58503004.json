    "text": "The Ninety-First Arkansas General Assembly was the legislative body of the state of Arkansas in 2017 and 2018. In this General Assembly, the Arkansas Senate and Arkansas House of Representatives were both controlled by the Republicans. In the Senate, 23 senators were Republicans, 11 were Democrats, and one position was vacant until April. In the House, 69 representatives were Republicans, 30 were Democrats, and one was independent. ==Sessions== The Regular Session of the 91st General Assembly opened on January 9, 2017. It adjourned sine die May 1, 2017, immediately followed the First Extraordinary Session. ==Major events== ===Corruption and scandals=== The 91st General Assembly was marked by several scandals, indictments, and guilty pleas involving current and former legislators. Two sitting legislators resigned following charges of fraud and other crimes. Former legislators Hank Wilkins IV, Jon Woods and Micah Neal plead guilty during the 91st General Assembly, detailing a fraud and kickback scheme abusing Arkansas's General Improvement Fund. Their pleas indicated sitting members in the 91st General Assembly could be charged later. Representative Mickey Gates (R-22nd) made national news for failing to pay taxes for 15 years, but resisted calls for his resignation. ===Major legislation=== One of the most contentious pieces of legislation was \"Guns on Campus\" http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2017/2017R/Documents/2017R%20and%202017S1%20Legislative%20General%20Summary.pdf http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2017/2018F/Fiscal%20Summary/2018F%20Summary%20of%20Fiscal%20Legislation.pdf ===Vacancies=== * Senator Greg Standridge (R-16th) died November 16, 2017.
