    "text": "The EAR 58 class was a class of gauge Garratt-type articulated steam locomotives built by Beyer, Peacock & Co. in Manchester, England, in 1949. The eighteen members of the class were ordered by the Kenya-Uganda Railway (KUR) immediately after World War II, and were a slightly modified, oil-burning version of the KUR's existing coal-fired EC3 class. By the time the new locomotives were built and entered service, the KUR had been succeeded by the East African Railways (EAR), which designated the coal-fired EC3s as its 57 class, and the new, oil-burning EC3s as its 58 class. ==Class list== The numbers and build dates of each member of the class were as follows: {|cellpadding=\"2\" | {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Builder's number !Built !KUR number !EAR number !Notes |- |align=center|7290 |align=center|1949 |align=center|89 |align=center|5801 | |- |align=center|7291 |align=center|1949 |align=center|90 |align=center|5802 | |- |align=center|7292 |align=center|1949 |align=center|91 |align=center|5803 | |- |align=center|7293 |align=center|1949 |align=center|92 |align=center|5804 | |- |align=center|7294 |align=center|1949 |align=center|93 |align=center|5805 | |- |align=center|7295 |align=center|1949 |align=center|94 |align=center|5806 | |- |align=center|7296 |align=center|1949 |align=center|95 |align=center|5807 | |- |align=center|7297 |align=center|1949 |align=center|96* |align=center|5808 |First member of class to enter service with EAR number. |- |align=center|7298 |align=center|1949 |align=center|97* |align=center|5809 | |- |align=center|7299 |align=center|1949 |align=center|98* |align=center|5810 | |- |align=center|7300 |align=center|1949 |align=center|99* |align=center|5811 | |- |align=center|7301 |align=center|1949 |align=center|100* |align=center|5812 | |- |align=center|7302 |align=center|1949 |align=center|101* |align=center|5813 | |- |align=center|7303 |align=center|1949 |align=center|102* |align=center|5814 | |- |align=center|7304 |align=center|1949 |align=center|103* |align=center|5815 | |- |align=center|7305 |align=center|1949 |align=center|104* |align=center|5816 | |- |align=center|7306 |align=center|1949 |align=center|105* |align=center|5817 | |- |align=center|7307 |align=center|1949 |align=center|106* |align=center|5818 | |- |colspan=\"5\" align=left| * KUR number allocated but not carried |} |} ==See also== *Rail transport in Kenya *Rail transport in Uganda ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== * * * * * ==External links== Category:Beyer, Peacock locomotives Category:East African Railways locomotives Category:Garratt locomotives Category:Metre gauge steam locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1949 Category:Steam locomotives of Kenya Category:Steam locomotives of Uganda Category:4-8-4+4-8-4 locomotives Category:Scrapped locomotives ",
