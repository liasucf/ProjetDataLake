Macrophilia is a fascination with or a sexual fantasy involving giants, more commonly expressed as giantesses (female giants). It is typically a male fantasy, with the male playing the \"smaller\" part\u2014entering, being dominated, or being eaten by the larger woman. Others involve partners who naturally have a significant difference in size. Online communities refer to this subculture as macro fetish or GTS fetish, an abbreviation of \"giantess\" and sometimes the backronym \"giant tiny sex\". ==Description== Although macrophilia literally translates to simply a \"lover of large,\" in the context of a sexual fantasy, it is used to mean someone who is attracted to beings larger than themselves. Generally, the interest differs between people, and depends on gender and sexual orientation. They often enjoy feeling small and being abused, degraded, dominated, or eaten, and they may also view female giants as being powerful and dominating. Commenting on why there are not as many female macrophiles, psychologist Helen Friedman theorized that because women in most societies already view men as dominant and powerful, there is no need for them to fantasize about it. Women that take on the roles of the giantess within this fetish often find the practice to be empowering and enjoy being worshipped. The roots of macrophilia may lie in sexual arousal in childhood and early adolescence which is accidentally associated with giants, according to Mark Griffiths's speculation. ==Community== ===Internet=== The internet has played an important role in helping to develop the fetish. The pornography site Pornhub's 2015 annual report showed that compared to 2014, the biggest increasing of sex tape was giantess, which had a 1091 percent gain in searches. There also existed an exhibit at the Museum of Sex titled \"Kink: Geography of the Erotic Imagination\" which explored many different fantasies, including macrophilia. Online content creators have also developed homemade media that has helped grow the fetish's reach. In addition to generating content across websites, some content creators have even branded themselves in ways that helped them generate a following and gain revenue for their work. After data was gathered from 4,814,732 videos on clips4sale, an established porn site, it was found that \"giantess\" was the 34th most popular category. The macro community has produced fiction writing, digital art, and collages on websites such as DeviantArt and Pixiv. Dedicated macrophilia websites include Giantess World and the Giantess City forums. Karbo, Eskoz, and AshkiiWolf are among the more popular artists. Macrophilia video games have also been developed; Sizebox is a sandbox game in which players import models and create scenes. Shrink High (Japanese: \u7e2e\u5c0f\u5b66\u5712, Syukusho Gakuen) is an RPG Maker title in which the player shrinks in a high school. Resize Me! is an anime VR game in development; the player is gradually shrunken by their childhood friend and toyed with. ===Real world experience=== One way macrophiles enjoy their fetish physically is by scheduling private sessions with extraordinarily tall women to engage in non- sexual interactions; trampling, lifting and carrying, foot worshiping, roleplaying and domination. SizeCon, an annual adult convention held in New York City for macrophiles and microphiles, is one outlet. Events include guest panels, exhibitions, workshops, and gaming.. ==See also== * Amazons * Resizing (fiction) * Vorarephilia ==References== ===Further reading=== * * Category:Size Category:Paraphilias Category:Giants ",
