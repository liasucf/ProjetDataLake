    "text": "Salix myrtilloides, the swamp willow, is a willow native to boglands in cool temperate to subarctic regions of northeastern Europe and northern Asia from central Norway and Poland eastwards to the Pacific Ocean coasts, with isolated populations further south in mountain bogs in the Alps, Carpathians and Sikhote-Alin mountains.Den Virtuella Floran: Salix myrtilloides (in Swedish; with maps) It is a deciduous small shrub growing to tall. The leaves are oval- acute, 15\u201320 mm long, with an entire or sparsely toothed margin, dark green above, paler glaucous or purple-tinged below. The flowers are produced in catkins 1\u20132 cm long in the spring at the same time as the new leaves appear.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. Macmillan . The leaves resemble bilberry (Vaccinium uliginosum) leaves in shape, hence the name in the Finnish and Swedish languages, which translates as \"bog bilberry willow\". A very similar, closely related species, Salix pedicellaris (bog willow), occurs in northern North America; it is classified as a variety of swamp willow S. myrtilloides var. pedicellaris by some botanists. ==References== myrtilloides Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ",
