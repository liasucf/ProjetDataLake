    "text": "The Linear Tape File System (LTFS) is a file system that allows files stored on magnetic tape to be accessed in a similar fashion to those on disk or removable flash drives. It requires both a specific format of data on the tape media and software to provide a file system interface to the data. The technology, based around a self-describing tape format developed by IBM, was adopted by the LTO Consortium in 2010. == History == Magnetic tape data storage has been used for over 50 years, but typically did not hold file metadata in a form easy to access or modify independent of the file content data. Often external databases were used to maintain file metadata (file names, timestamps, directory hierarchy) to hold this data but these external databases were generally not designed for interoperability and tapes might or might not contain an index of their content. In Unix-like systems, there is the tar interoperable standard, but this is not well-suited to allow modification of file metadata independent of modifying file content data - and does not maintain a central index of files nor provide a filesystem interface or characteristics. LTFS technology was first implemented by IBM as a prototype running on Linux and Mac OS X during 2008/2009. This prototype was demonstrated at NAB 2009. Based on feedback from this initial demonstration and experience within IBM the filesystem was overhauled in preparation for release as a product. The LTFS development team worked with the vendors of LTO tape products (HP and Quantum) to build support and understanding of the LTFS format and filesystem implementation leading up to the public release. The LTFS Format Specification and filesystem implementation were released on April 12, 2010 with the support of IBM, HP, Quantum, and the LTO Consortium.NAB-2010 LTFS v2.0.0 was released in March 2011, improving the text to clarify and remove ambiguity. It also added support for sparse files; persistent file identifiers; virtual extended attributes for filesystem metadata and control - and defined minimum and recommended blocksize values for LTFS volumes, for compatibility across various HBA hardware implementations. == Format specification == The ISO/IEC 20919:2016 standard defines the LTFS Format requirements for interchanged media that claims LTFS compliance. It defines the data format, independent of the physical storage media and the software commands format, to make data truly interchangeable. The ISO standard was prepared by SNIA. It is based on LTFS v2.2, and was adopted to ISO by a joint technical committee ISO/IEC JTC 1 Information Technology. The SNIA workgroup continues to develop LTFS and release updates. Version 2.0.0 defines rules for how the version number may change in future, and how compatibility is maintained across varying implementations. All implementations must: * correctly read media that was compliant with any prior version * write media that is compliant with the version they claim compliance with {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\" |+ LTFS Format Specification History |- !

LTFS Format Specification v 2.1 is the baseline for the technical work and standards accreditation process; SNIA LTFS TWG members include HP, IBM, Oracle and Quantum. ==Nature== While LTFS can make a tape appear to behave like a disk, it does not change the fundamentally sequential nature of tape. Files are always appended to the end of the tape. If a file is modified and overwritten or removed from the volume, the associated tape blocks used are not freed up, they are simply marked as unavailable and the used volume capacity is not recovered. Data is only deleted and capacity recovered if the whole tape is reformatted. In spite of these disadvantages, there are several uses cases where LTFS formatted tape is superior to disk and other data storage technologies. While LTO seek times can range from 10 to 100 seconds, the streaming data transfer rate can match or exceed disk data transfer rates. Additionally, LTO cartridges are easily transportable and hold far more data than any other removable data storage format. The ability to copy a large file or a large selection of files (up to 1.5TB for LTO-5 or 2.5TB for LTO_6) to an LTFS formatted tape, allows easy exchange of data to a collaborator, or the saving of an archival copy. Since LTFS is an open standard, LTFS formatted tapes are usable by a wide variety of computing systems. == Implementations == === IBM Linear Tape File System - Single Drive Edition === The IBM Linear Tape File System - Single Drive Edition, (initially released as \"IBM Long Term File System\"), allows tapes to be formatted as an LTFS volume, and for these volumes to be mounted - and users and applications access files and directories stored on the tape directly, including drag-and-drop of files. ==== Operating systems supported by IBM LTFS-SDE ==== * Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL 5) with LTFS-SDE - 1.2.0 for Linux (support for RHEL 5 dropped in 2.2.2.0, last supported release 2.2.1.1) * Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL 6) with LTFS-SDE * Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL 7) with LTFS-SDE - 2.2.2.0 for Linux * SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 11 SP 1 with LTFS-SDE 1.2.0 for Linux * Mac OS X 10.5.6 (Leopard), 10.6.7 (Snow Leopard) with LTFS-SDE - 1.2.0 for Mac OS X (Support dropped in version 2.2.2.0) * Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), with LTFS-SDE - 1.2.5 for Mac OS X (Support dropped in version 2.2.2.0) * Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion), with LTFS-SDE - 1.3.0.2 for Mac OS X (Support dropped in version 2.2.2.0) * Mac OS X 10.9 (Mavericks), with LTFS-SDE - 2.2.0.0 for Mac OS X (Support dropped in version 2.2.2.0) * Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite), 10.11 (El Capitan) with LTFS-SDE - 2.2.2.0 for Mac OS X * Windows 7 with LTFS-SDE - Windows version 1.2.0 * Windows 8 with LTFS-SDE - Windows version 1.3.0.1 * Windows 8.1 with LTFS-SDE - Windows version 2.2.0.0 * Windows Server 2008 R2 with LTFS-SDE - Windows version 1.2.2 * Windows Server 2012 with LTFS-SDE - Windows version 1.3.0.1 === IBM Linear Tape File System - Library Edition === The IBM Linear Tape File System - Library Edition (LTFS-LE) product allows LTFS volumes to be used in a tape library.
