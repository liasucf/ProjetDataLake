Retrieved 18 March 2015. ==Early life, education, and training== Sandra Sue Noll was born in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and raised in Fayetteville, Arkansas, where her parents moved when she was five years old. She began her theatrical training at an early age in classes for ballet, tap dancing, and drama at the Sue Keller Studio. Her ballet teachers there included Keller's daughter, Toby Keller Jorgensen, as well as a changing roster of dancers trained in Balanchine technique at the School of American Ballet in New York City. Noll continued her training at the Keller Studio until her sophomore year at the University of Arkansas. She was befriended during her college years by Eleanor King, a pioneer of modern dance who was an artist in residence at the university. In 1956, encouraged by King and at her mother's urging, she found the courage to audition for entrance to the recently established Dance Division at the Juilliard School in New York, which offered an innovative curriculum that included both ballet and modern dance for all its students.Sandra Noll Hammond, Professor of Dance, curriculum vitae supplement, dated 19 March 2015, in faculty files of the University of Hawai'i Manoa; used by permission of the subject. At Juilliard from 1956 to 1958, Noll was strongly influenced by the example of Martha Hill, modern dancer and founding director of the Dance Division. Among her modern dance teachers there were Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n, whose company she had admired at a university performance in Arkansas, and Betty Jones, a legendary teacher and founding member of Lim\u00f3n's company. Her ballet teachers on the faculty, including Antony Tudor, Margaret Craske, and Alfredo Corvino, were even more important to her training. In 1957, at age twenty-one, Noll married Philip Hammond, a sociologist of religion, and acquired the surname by which she would become professionally known. She then continued her dance studies with Thalia Mara and Arthur Mahoney at the School of Ballet Repertory and with Tudor and Craske at the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School. ==Professional career== In New York City, Hammond performed with the William Hug Dance Company (1956-1959) and with the Ballet Repertory Dancers (1958-1960), directed by Mara and Mahoney. Following her husband's academic appointments, she then began moving about the country. She danced as a soloist and guest artist with the Connecticut Opera Company (1961-1964) and, in San Francisco, as a corps member of the Pacific Ballet (1964-1965), directed by Alan Howard. After a career hiatus of a few years, she moved to Tucson, Arizona, in 1971. There, she joined the Arizona Dance Theater, a touring company directed by Frances Smith Cohen, and remained with that group until 1978. Over the next two decades, she performed as a free- lance artist, specializing in Baroque dance, early Romantic ballet, and other styles of historical dance. As a Baroque dance specialist, she performed nationally with early music ensembles and with historical dance pioneers R\u00e9gine Astier and Angene Feves.\"Sandra Noll Hammond,\" biography, CORPS de Ballet International. During these years, Hammond expanded her career as performer to include work as a ballet teacher, lecturer, and administrator in academic dance programs. At the University of Arizona, she was co-founder, with Cohen, of the dance major program and was a lecturer and teacher of courses in ballet technique, modern dance technique, dance history, and historical dance forms, from 1970 through 1978.\"Sandra Noll Hammond,\" biographical note, Early Dance. https://earlydance.org. Retrieved 24 March 2015. An extended leave during that period allowed her to study sixteenth- through eighteenth-century dances with Alan Stark, a dance historian in Mexico City. Back in Tucson, as departmental director of dance, she also created choreography for student and faculty concerts, in which she sometimes performed, and she continued her ballet studies with Dolores Mitrovich, whose career in Italy had include ballet training with Rafael Grassi and Enrico Cecchetti. Thereafter, having moved to California in 1979, Hammond was a visiting lecturer at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where she taught dance history and ballet technique and earned a bachelor of arts degree in liberal studies. Later, as visiting lecturer at the University of California, Los Angeles, she taught dance history, Baroque dance technique, and early nineteenth-century ballet technique and was the leader of a ballet history research seminar at the graduate level.Marian Smith, Ballet and Opera in the Age of \"Giselle\" (Princeton University Press, 2000), p. 244. In 1985, she moved again, to Hawai'i, where she won appointments as associate professor, full professor, and director of dance at the University of Hawai'i Manoa, in Honolulu. For the next ten years, she taught courses in ballet technique, dance history, and historical dance forms for undergraduates and a seminar in theory and criticism for graduate students.Sandra Noll Hammond, Dance Historian, curriculum vitae, 2009, in files of the Music Division, Library of Congress. https://www.loc.gov/music. Retrieved 18 March 2015. ==Related activities== Throughout her academic career, Hammond was a popular guest artist, lecturer, and workshop leader at numerous institutions and venues around the world. In California, besides appearances in Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, she was a featured presenter and performer at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, Stanford University, the California State University at Long Beach, and Mills College in Oakland. An accomplished actress as well as a dancer, she sometimes recreated historical dance performances with narration by her Santa Barbara colleague Frank W.D. Ries. Her impersonation of Anna Pavlova in Pavlova Gavotte (1913), performed to Paul Lincke's song \"Das Gl\u016dhw\u016brmchen\" (The Glow-Worm) in authentic costume, was an audience favorite. At the end, after leaving center stage, she would linger nearby, encouraging spectators to continue applauding, and then would demurely come out again, smiling sweetly, for yet one more gracious bow.Personal communication from Elizabeth Aldrich, 20 March 2015; used by permission of the writer.
