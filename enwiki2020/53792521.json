    "text": "The gens Pedania was a minor plebeian family at Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned at the time of the Second Punic War, but they achieved little prominence until imperial times, when the ill-starred Lucius Pedanius Secundus attained the consulship under Nero.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 163 (\"Pedanius\"). ==Origin== The great majority of nomina ending in -anius were derived from place-names or cognomina ending in -anus. Such gentilicia were frequently, although not exclusively, of Umbrian origin. There is also an old Latin cognomen of frequent occurrence, Pedo, referring to someone with broad feet, which could have given rise to a similar nomen, although in this case Pedonius would be the expected form. However, Pedonius is not attested, nor are there clear examples of a surname Pedanus, so Pedo as the root of Pedanius remains a strong possibility.Chase, pp. 110, 118, 119. ==Members== * Titus Pedanius, the first centurion appointed over the principes in 211 BC, during the Second Punic War. At the siege of Capua, when the Roman forces were faltering, he led a charge over the enemy's ramparts, which resulted in the capture of the city. After the battle, Pedanius was decorated for his courage.Livy, xxv. 14.Valerius Maximus, iii. 2. \u00a7 20. * Pedanius Costa, one of the legates of Brutus in 43 and 42 BC.Broughton, vol. II, pp. 354, 366. * Pedanius, one of the legates of Augustus who served as presidents of the court convened by Herod for the trial of his sons.Josephus, Bellum Juda\u00efcum, i. 27. \u00a7 2.PIR, vol. III, p. 19. * Lucius Pedanius Secundus, consul suffectus ex Kal. Mart. in AD 43. He was praefectus urbi in 61, when he was murdered by one of his slaves. Under Roman law, all of the slaves belonging to the murdered man were to be put to death, in this instance numbering some four hundred; despite public outcry, the sentence was enforced by Nero.Tacitus, Annales, xiv. 42.PIR, vol. III, p. 20. * Lucius Pedanius L. f. Secundus Julius Persicus, named in an inscription from Barcino.. * Pedanius Costa, an opponent of Nero, and one of the candidates for the consulship in AD 69, the year following Nero's death. Vitellius chose not to designate him as one of the consuls for the coming year, because of his hostility to the late emperor.Tacitus, Historiae, ii. 71. * Pedanius, a soldier in the Roman cavalry, who participated in the capture of Jerusalem in AD 70. His daring in capturing one of the defenders through sheer strength and expert horsemanship is described by Josephus.Josephus, Bellum Juda\u00efcum, vi. 2. \u00a7 8. * Pedanius Dioscorides, a celebrated physician toward the end of the first century, and the author of De Materia Medica.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, pp. 1051, 1052 (Dioscorides, physicians, No. 1). ===Pedanii Salinatores=== * Gnaeus Pedanius Fuscus Salinator, consul suffectus ex Kal.

Cn. n., the grandson of Lucius Julius Ursus Servianus, was put to death by Hadrian at the age of eighteen, in AD 136, along with his elderly grandfather, supposedly for expressing their disappointment at the emperor's designation of Lucius Ceionius Commodus as his heir.Aelius Spartianus, \"The Life of Hadrian\", 23.Cassius Dio, lxix. 17. ==See also== * List of Roman gentes ==References== ==Bibliography== * Titus Livius (Livy), History of Rome. * Valerius Maximus, Factorum ac Dictorum Memorabilium (Memorable Facts and Sayings). * Publius Cornelius Tacitus, Annales. * Flavius Josephus, Bellum Juda\u00efcum (The Jewish War). * Publius Cornelius Tacitus, Annales, Historiae. * Lucius Cassius Dio Cocceianus (Cassius Dio), Roman History. * Aelius Lampridius, Aelius Spartianus, Flavius Vopiscus, Julius Capitolinus, Trebellius Pollio, and Vulcatius Gallicanus, Historia Augusta (Augustan History). * Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, William Smith, ed., Little, Brown and Company, Boston (1849). * Theodor Mommsen et alii, Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (The Body of Latin Inscriptions, abbreviated CIL), Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften (1853\u2013present). * Ren\u00e9 Cagnat et alii, L'Ann\u00e9e \u00e9pigraphique (The Year in Epigraphy, abbreviated AE), Presses Universitaires de France (1888\u2013present). * George Davis Chase, \"The Origin of Roman Praenomina\", in Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, vol.
