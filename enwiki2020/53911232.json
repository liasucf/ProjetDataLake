    "text": "Gabriel Silberstein (born 17 October 1974) is a former professional tennis player from Chile. ==Biography== ===Early career=== As a junior he was a strong performer and most notably finished runner-up in the boys' doubles with Marcelo R\u00edos at the 1992 US Open. He won his first Challenger match aged 17 and in 1992 won a Challenger tournament in Ribeir\u00e3o. ===Professional tour=== In 1993 he began competing professionally and made his first ATP Tour main draw appearance the following year at Santiago. He was one of the successful qualifiers at the 1995 ATP German Open, a top-tier event now known as the Hamburg Masters. At the end of the 1997 season he reached his best ranking of 131 in the world, following a year which included wins over Karol Ku\u010dera in St Poelten and Carlos Costa in Santiago. ===Representative career=== Silberstein featured in a total of 9 ties for the Chile Davis Cup team from 1993 to 1997. In 1995 he suffered disappointment, having started a tie against Argentina with a win over Franco Dav\u00edn, it was his loss to Javier Frana in the final reverse singles that decided the tie, a match Silbertein led two sets to love. He helped Chile reach the World Group qualifiers in the 1997 Davis Cup. His defeat of Ecuador's Nicol\u00e1s Lapentti in five sets started Chile's campaign and he finished off the tie by beating Luis Morej\u00f3n in a dead rubber to secure a 4-1 win. His most significant contribution came in the next tie, against Argentina at the National Stadium in Santiago. With the tie level at 1-1, a scoreline which included a loss for Silberstein to Hern\u00e1n Gumy, he teamed up with R\u00edos in the doubles to beat Javier Frana and Luis Lobo in five sets. R\u00edos then gave Chile the tie over their South American rivals with victory in the first of the reverse singles, setting up a qualifying match against India. History repeated itself in the tie with India, as Silberstein again squandered a two set lead in the fifth and deciding rubber, to lose to Mahesh Bhupathi. He finished his Davis Cup career with an 8-6 record in singles, 11-9 overall. At the 1995 Pan American Games he won a bronze medal for Chile in the men's doubles event, with partner Sergio Cort\u00e9s. ===Personal life=== Silberstein emigrated to Chile from West Germany. He was born in Neum\u00fcnster, a city in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein. His youngest brother, \u00c1lvaro, was seriously injured in a 2004 car accident, which left him with full paralysis from the chest down In 2016 \u00c1lvaro trekked Patagonia in a wheelchair, a trip that captured media attention and was filmed by a documentary crew. ==Challenger titles== ===Singles: (1)=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=font-size:97% !style=\"width:20px\" class=\"unsortable\"|No. !style=\"width:40px\"|Year !style=\"width:220px\"|Tournament !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:200px\"|Opponent !style=\"width:160px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |- |1. |1992 |Ribeir\u00e3o, Brazil |Clay | Mario Tabares |7\u20136, 7\u20136 |} ==See also== *List of Chile Davis Cup team representatives ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Chilean male tennis players Category:German emigrants to Chile Category:People from Neum\u00fcnster Category:Sportspeople from Schleswig-Holstein Category:Pan American Games bronze medalists for Chile Category:Pan American Games medalists in tennis Category:Tennis players at the 1995 Pan American Games ",
