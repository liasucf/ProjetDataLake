    "text": "The voiceless palatal lateral fricative is a type of consonantal sound, used in a few spoken languages. This sound is somewhat rare; Dahalo has both a palatal lateral fricative and an affricate; Hadza has a series of affricates. In Bura, it is the realization of palatalized and contrasts with . The IPA has no dedicated symbol for this sound. The devoicing and raising diacritics may be used to transcribe it: . However, the \"belt\" on the existing symbol for a voiceless lateral fricative, , forms the basis for other lateral fricatives used in the extIPA, including the palatal, : Image:Palatal lateral fricative.png SIL International has added this symbol to the Private Use Areas of their Gentium, Charis, and Doulos fonts, as U+F267 (). If distinction is necessary, the voiceless alveolo-palatal lateral fricative may be transcribed as (retracted and palatalized ) or (devoiced, advanced and raised ); these are essentially equivalent, since the contact includes both the blade and body (but not the tip) of the tongue. The equivalent X-SAMPA symbols are `K_-_j` or `K_-'` and `L_0_+_r`, respectively. A non-IPA letter (devoiced and raised can be used, which is an ordinary \"l\", plus the curl found in the symbols for alveolo-palatal sibilant fricatives ). ==Features== Features of the voiceless palatal lateral fricative: ==Occurrence== {| class=\"wikitable\" !colspan=2| Language !
