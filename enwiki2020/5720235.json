    "text": "\"Sunny\" is a soul jazz song written by Bobby Hebb in 1963. It is one of the most performed and recorded popular songs, with hundreds of versions released. BMI rates \"Sunny\" #25 in its \"Top 100 songs of the century\". It is also known by its first line: \"Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain\". == Background and composition == Hebb's parents, William and Ovalla Hebb, were both blind musicians. Hebb and his older brother Harold performed as a song- and-dance duo in Nashville, beginning when Bobby was three and Harold was nine. Hebb performed on a TV show hosted by country music record producer Owen Bradley. Hebb wrote the song in the 48 hours following a double tragedy on November 22, 1963: the day U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, and Hebb's older brother Harold was also stabbed to death outside a Nashville nightclub. Hebb was devastated by both events and many critics say that they, and critically the loss of his older brother, inspired the lyrics and tune. According to Hebb, he merely wrote the song as an expression of a preference for a \"sunny\" disposition over a \"lousy\" disposition following the murder of his brother. Events influenced Hebb's songwriting, but his melody, crossing over into R&B; (#3 on U.S. R&B; chart) and Pop (#2 on U.S. Pop chart), together with the optimistic lyrics, came from the artist's desire to express that one should always \"look at the bright side\". Hebb has said about \"Sunny\": \"All my intentions were to think of happier times and pay tribute to my brother \u2013 basically looking for a brighter day \u2013 because times were at a low. After I wrote it, I thought 'Sunny' just might be a different approach to what Johnny Bragg was talking about in 'Just Walkin' in the Rain.'\" ==Mieko Hirota version== \"Sunny\" was first recorded by Mieko \"Miko\" Hirota \u2013 the \"Connie Francis of Japan\" and Billy Taylor trio (feat. Ben Tucker and Grady Tate) on the Columbia records release \"Miko in New York\" (1965), recorded in New York. It was also released on the audio album Hit Kit Miko, Vol. 2 (October 20, 1965). ==Dave Pike version== In America it was released by marimbaphonist Dave Pike on Atlantic Records in 1966 on the Jazz for the Jet Set album, recorded in New York City on October 26 and November 2, 1965. Grady Tate, who played drums on Mieko Hirotas version, also played on this version. ==Bobby Hebb version== The personnel on the Bobby Hebb recording included Joe Shepley, Burt Collins on trumpet, Micky Gravine on trombone, Artie Kaplan and Joe Grimaldi on sax, Artie Butler on piano, Joe Renzetti and Al Gorgoni on guitar, Paul (PB) Brown and Joe Macho on bass, Al Rogers on drums and George Devens on percussion. The song was recorded while the session was in overtime; many of the studio musicians booked for that date had to leave early for other recording sessions. Joe Renzetti was the arranger. \"Sunny\" was originally part of an 18-song demo recorded by producer Jerry Ross, also famous for Spanky and Our Gang, Keith's \"98.6\" and \"Apple, Peaches, Pumpkin Pie\" by Jay & the Techniques (Hebb was offered this song but didn't want to be considered a novelty act and let the song go to Jay Proctor). \"Sunny\" was recorded at Bell Sound Studios in New York City and released as a single in 1966. It met with immediate success, which resulted in Hebb touring in 1966 with the Beatles. The song peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in late August 1966.https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1966-08-20 ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1966) !Peak position |- |Canada RPM Top Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- | Japanese Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|86 |- |Netherlands | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- |New Zealand (Listener) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|16 |- |South Africa (Springbok) |align=\"center\"|7 |- | UK Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|12 |- | US Billboard Hot 100Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1990 - | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- | US Billboard R&B; Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 |- | US Cash Box Top 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !

This version was arranged by Joe Renzetti, who also arranged the original record. The 7\" single was released in late 1975. The B-side featured another song of Hebb's called \"Proud Soul Heritage\". ==Cher version== Cher recorded the song for her third solo album Ch\u00e9r, it was released as the third single in Europe and Asia, achieving success in numerous European countries.

The single was backed by a non-album track \"New York City\", a reworked version of Farian artist Gilla's 1976 hit single \"Tu es!\" / \"Why Don't You Do It\" with an intro borrowed from the album track \"Help Help\", issued only in some territories instead of \"Baby Do You Wanna Bump\". The recording was remixed in 1988, 1999 (it was a minor hit single in early 2000) and 2015, and has been sampled by Boogie Pimps for their 2004 version. While Liz Mitchell sang the original lead vocals on Boney M.'s version, original member Maizie Williams recorded a solo version in 2006.
