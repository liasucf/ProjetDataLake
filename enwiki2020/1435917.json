After becoming surplus to requirements on this route, the fleet saw further use with a number of other operators. ==Description== The original interior of a Stansted Express Class 322 In 1987 British Rail (BR) was extending electrification north from London Liverpool Street towards Cambridge. Included in this plan was the construction of new branch line, diverging from the main line at Stansted Mountfitchet, to serve the newly built , which opened in 1991. BR decided to build a dedicated fleet of units to work a new service, the Stansted Express.New line for Stansted makes progess Rail issue 78 March 1988 page 15BREL EMU orders The Railway Magazine issue 1051 November 1988 page 687 The Class 322 units were built to the same basic design as the Class 321 units, which were still under construction for services on the Great Eastern Main Line and West Coast Main Line, but with a larger First Class area in the DTCO resulting in a different window arrangement. Although the Stansted route fell under the jurisdiction of Network SouthEast (NSE), the units were delivered into service in a special white livery with a broad green band, instead of the more usual NSE blue/red/white livery. Five 4-car units were built, numbered 322481\u2013485. Each unit consisted of two outer driving trailers, an intermediate trailer and an intermediate motor coach. The technical description of the formation of each unit is DTCO+TSO+MSO+DTSO. Individual vehicles are numbered as follows: *78163\u201378167 \u2013 DTCO *72023\u201372027 \u2013 TSO *63137\u201363141 \u2013 MSO *77985\u201377989 \u2013 DTSO Originally the units had a lower density 2+2 seating arrangement in Standard Class appropriate to their use on airport traffic, but during their C6X refurbishment in 2005-2007 the DTCO was changed to DTSO and all seating was changed to 3+2 with a cycle rack fitted in the DTSO(A). The changed DTCO was designated DTSO(A) and the units were reformed as DTCO(B)-TSO-MSO-DTCO(A), and operation in Scotland was in this form until 2011. On transfer away from Scotland the bike racks were removed and replaced by First Class 2+1 seating, but this was subsequently changed to 3+2 standard class seatig in 2015, the DTSO(A) also gaining an accessible toilet. The units were the last of a long line of BR multiple units to be based on the Mark 3 bodyshell design. ==Current operations== ===Greater Anglia=== In July 2020 all were leased to Greater Anglia to operate services out of London Liverpool Street on the Great Eastern Main Line. They were leased to allow Class 360s to move to East Midlands Railway. All are scheduled to be replaced by Class 720s in 2021.Stored stock makes way for deliveries of new vehicles Rail issue 904 6 May 2020 page 25All GA 755s in passenger service Rail issue 911 12 August 2020 page 29 ==Former operations== ===Network SouthEast=== On introduction in 1990 the Class 322s were painted in a joint livery for Network SouthEast (NSE) and British Airports Authority consisting of a light grey and white body with green waist band lettered \"Stansted Express\" on one side and \"Network SouthEast\" on the other. Until opening of the Stansted Airport spur the units worked peak-hour services between Cambridge and Liverpool Street, but also found use on special trains wandering as far afield and York and Colchester. ===West Anglia Great Northern=== One 322485 at London Liverpool Street in August 2004 In the lead up to the privatisation of British Rail, in 1994 all were sold to Eversholt Rail Group.25 Years of ROSCOs Railway Express issue 281 October 2019 page 20 All passed with the franchise to West Anglia Great Northern in January 1997. Having been replaced by Class 317s on Stansted services, they were used indiscriminately as part of the general fleet and would operate on other WAGN services including on the East Coast Main Line from London King's Cross to Peterborough. ===Sub-leasing from WAGN=== In 1998 two Class 322 units were sub-leased to North Western Trains to operate a service between Euston and Manchester AirportNWT livery for Class 322 Stansted units Rail issue 329 22 April 1998 page 12 but the service was discontinued after a year and the units were returned to WAGN.FNW cuts Euston-Manchester service Rail issue 355 21 April 1999 page 13First North Western to axe Manchester-London service The Railway Magazine issue 1178 June 1999 page 9 From 1998 units were also occasionally sub-let to Silverlink and used on services between Euston and Birmingham and to Anglia Railways to cover for late delivery of units for London Liverpool Street to Norwich services. ===ScotRail=== In December 2001, all were transferred to fellow National Express franchise ScotRail to replace Class 305s on the North Berwick Line.
