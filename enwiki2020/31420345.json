He was the son of Jean de Foix, vicecount of Lautrec and governor of the Dauphin\u00e9, and of Jeanne d'Aydie de Lescun. His sister was Fran\u00e7oise de Foix, mistress of King Francis I of France. His brothers Odet of Foix, Viscount of Lautrec and Thomas, lord of Lescun, were also promoted to high positions in the military by the King, by the influence of Fran\u00e7oise. After the Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre in 1512, he was appointed in 1521 by Henry II of Navarre commander of a Gascoigne-Navarrese army, to try for the third time to recapture the Kingdom of Navarre. At first, the campaign was successful and Navarre was recaptured in May, but on June 30, 1521, Lesparre's army suffered a crushing defeat in the Battle of No\u00e1in against the Spanish. 5.000 men were lost and Lesparre himself was wounded and captured, but later released for ransom. He died in the Italian Wars. Category:1490 births Category:1547 deaths Andre Category:Military leaders of the Italian Wars Category:French generals ",
