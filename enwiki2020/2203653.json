It was developed from the Short Seaford, itself a development of the Short Sunderland military flying boat design. The first Solent flew in 1946. New Solents were used by BOAC and TEAL, production ending in 1949. Second-hand aircraft were operated until 1958 by a number of small airlines such as Aquila Airways. ==Design and development== Interior of TEAL Solent preserved at Museum of Transport and Technology in Auckland. The Short S.45 Solent was a high-wing monoplane flying boat of aluminium construction. Power was provided by four Bristol HerculesNational Archives Airworthiness Division Type Records engines. The aircraft could be fitted for 24 passengers with day and night accommodation or 36 day passengers. The cabins (four on the lower deck and two on the upper) could be used to sleep four or seat six. The upper deck included a lounge/dining area next to kitchen; the lower deck had two dressing rooms, toilets and three freight compartments. The flight crew was five (two pilots, navigator, and radio operator with the flight engineer in a separate compartment behind the flight deck opposite crew rest berths) and there were two stewards to attend to the passengers.Flight 3 January 1946 p10 ==Use== Short Solent 2 G-AHIN \"Southampton\" served BOAC on its Johannesburg route between 1948 and 1950 The Solent 2 introduced by BOAC could carry 34 passengers and 7 crew. Between 1948 and 1950, BOAC operated their Solents on the three-times weekly scheduled service from Southampton to Johannesburg taking a route down the Nile and across East Africa. The journey took four days, including overnight stops. The Solents replaced Avro Yorks running the service.\"To South Africa on the First Springbok Flying-boat Service\" Flight 1948 The last Solent-operated service on the route departed from Berth 50 at Southampton on 10 November 1950, bringing BOAC's flying-boat operations to an end. Tasman Empire Airways Limited (TEAL) operated a total of five Solent 4s between 1949 and 1960 on their scheduled routes between Sydney, Fiji, Auckland and Wellington. The last TEAL Solent service was flown between Fiji and Tahiti on 14 September 1960 by ZK-AMO \"Aranui\", which is now preserved. The TEAL Solents could carry 45 passengers and all versions of the type provided a great deal of space and luxury compared with contemporary or modern land-based aircraft. Aquila Airways Solent 4 G-ANAJ \"City of Funchal\" at Berth 50 Southampton Docks in August 1955 Several Solents served Aquila Airways on their routes from Southampton to Madeira and the Canary Islands using ex BOAC and TEAL aircraft. On 15 November 1957, Aquila Airways G-AKNU, a Solent 3, crashed near Chessell, Isle of Wight, after it experienced loss of power to two engines.Flight, 8 August 1958, p. 208 The crash killed 45 out of the 58 on board. British commercial flying-boat operations ceased on 30 September 1958 when Aquila Airways withdrew its Madeira service. ==Survivors== *Short Solent ZK-AMO Aranui, a Mk IV formerly used by TEAL firstly between Mechanics Bay on Auckland Harbour and Rose Bay Sydney Australia until superseded on scheduled services by the land based propliners. ZK-AMO was then redeployed on the iconic Coral Route, from Auckland New Zealand to Fiji, Samoa, Cook Islands, Tonga and Tahiti, until once again superseded by propliners in September 1960. ZK-AMO has been fully restored and preserved at the Museum of Transport and Technology in Auckland. Briefly overhauled outside when the Keith Park Memorial Aviation Display at MOTAT was enlarged 2010/2011. *An ex-BOAC Solent 3, later owned by Howard Hughes, has been rescued and is in the United States at the Oakland Aviation Museum in Oakland, California.;Solent at the Oakland Aviation Museum, Oakland, California it is this Solent which appears briefly (and anachronistically) in the film Raiders of the Lost Ark, though through matte effects is made to resemble a more historically accurate Boeing 314 Clipper.Verschuere, Gilles. \"The Making of Raiders of the Lost Ark: Concluding the Adventure.\" The Raider.Net, 2009. ==Variants== * Solent 2 : civilian version for BOAC of the Short Seaford, 12 aircraft built at RochesterBarnes and James, pp. 407\u2013409 * Solent 3 : converted S.45 Seaford. 7 aircraft \u2013 6 at Queen's Island, Belfast, 1 at Hamble * Solent 4 : powered by Bristol Hercules 733, four aircraft built at Belfast ==Operators== Exterior of the MOTAT aircraft. ; * Trans-Oceanic Airways ; * Tasman Empire Airways Limited (TEAL) ; * Aquila Airways * British Overseas Airways Corporation ; * South Pacific Airlines The only military use of the Solent was for trials at the United Kingdom Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment in 1951, the former BOAC Solent 3 was scrapped after the trials. ==Accidents and incidents== 15 November 1957 \u2013 Aquila Airways Solent G-AKNU crashed on the Isle of Wight. The aircraft took off at around 10:40 pm from Southampton Water for Lisbon, Madeira and Las Palmas. Around 20 minutes later, the crew reported the failure of number 4 engine and turned back. Soon after, number 3 engine also stopped and around one minute after the radio report, the aircraft crashed into a chalk quarry near Chessell, killing 45 of the 58 people on board. No cause for either engine failure was established in the subsequent investigation. A memorial to those killed is in St Mary's Church, Brook. A tree and a plaque mark the crash-site. ==Specifications (Solent 2)== ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * * == External links == * Short Flying Boats in New Zealand * Tasman Empire Airways Limited * Century of Flight Category:1940s British airliners Category:Short Brothers aircraft Category:Flying boats Category:Four-engined tractor aircraft Category:High- wing aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1946 Category:Four-engined piston aircraft ",
