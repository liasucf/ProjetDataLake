    "text": "Rex Andrew SinquefieldRex Andrew Sinquefield Executive Profile & Biography Bloomberg (; born September 7, 1944) is an American businessman, investor, and philanthropist who has been called an \"index-fund pioneer\". He is active in Missouri politics, his two main interests being rolling back the income tax and increasing public funding for charter schools. ==Early life and education== He had 18 cleft palate operations before age five. His father died when he was five years old. Because of the family's poverty, Sinquefield and his brother were placed in a local Catholic orphanage, the Saint Vincent Home for Children in St. Louis, Missouri.Rex Sinquefield biography. Retrieved October 29, 2013. The school was run by strict German nuns who made the children sleep in big dormitories, wash the dishes, clean the rooms, and scrub the floors with steel wool. Sinquefield told the BBC that the school's regimentation taught him self-discipline. When they were teenagers, Sinquefield and his brother returned home to live with their mother, who resented the city's 1% wage tax. He graduated from Bishop DuBourg High School in 1962.DB Alumni. Retrieved October 29, 2013. He studied to be a priest at the Diocesan Seminary at Cardinal Glennon College in St. Louis. At the time, he owned $200 worth of one stock. During the Vietnam War, he served as a \u201chigh-end gopher\u201d in the finance corps at Fort Riley, as he put it. Working with top-secret records, he found it \u201ceasy, boring, safe and a terrible waste of manpower.\u201d He then studied economics at Saint Louis University, but later said it was \"all a waste, Keynesian crap\". After receiving a business degree from Saint Louis University, he went to the University of Chicago, where he studied under future Nobel Prize winner Merton Miller, who described the efficiency of the world's stock and bond markets, and Eugene Fama, who coined the term \u201cefficient markets\". He received an MBA from Chicago. == Career == Sinquefield then went to work at the American National Bank of Chicago where he put his professors' ideas into practice, developing, in 1973, the first S&P; 500 passively managed index fund.Rex Sinquefield's Crusade Against Income Taxes. Business Week. March 12, 2012. Seven years later, the fund managed $12 billion. In May 1974, in the depths of the worst bear market since the 1930s, Sinquefield and Roger Ibbotson made a brash prediction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average, floundering in the 800s at the time, would hit 9,218 in 1998 and 10,000 by November 1999. === Dimensional Fund Advisors === In 1981, Sinquefield and another University of Chicago teaching assistant, David Booth, co-founded Dimensional Fund Advisors, the first passive fund focused on small (microcap) companies customarily ignored in large institutional portfolios. As of June 30, 2018, it managed more than $582 billion in assets.Dimensional Fund Advisors. Retrieved September 19, 2018. Dimensional Fund Advisors' investment strategy has been said to create an optimal portfolio consisting of various funds that emulate different style and size attributes of various securities markets worldwide, so that one fund might behave like the S&P; 500, another might correlate with just the value stocks in the S&P; 500, while a third might emulate the performance of all small-cap stocks. Sinquefield is a proponent of passive investment, meaning that he believes you simply cannot beat the market. Passive investing, Sinquefield has said, generally refers to the idea that you are going to get market rates of return from whatever category you're investing in. If you are invested in stocks, you will do no better or worse than the market over time. If you limit yourself to, say, small-cap stocks, then your return, over time, will be no better or worse than the returns on the aggregate of small stocks. We believe that you're not going to be able to do much better than that because the market doesn't misvalue securities. The prices are right. If you believe in active management, you're saying that there are people who can make valuation judgments that are superior to the market. In 2005, he retired from DFA because he was \u201cbored\u201d and returned to St. Louis, where he became involved in politics and philanthropy. ==Politics== === Show-Me Institute === On his return to St. Louis, Sinquefield co-founded the Show-Me Institute with R. Crosby Kemper III, a Kansas City banker. Based in Clayton, Show-Me is a think tank that commissions studies on public-policy issues. It has been labeled libertarian, conservative,Slate Links to Show-Me Institute Study, Show-Me Daily, 2008-11-14, accessed 2009-3-25 and free-market. He is president of the institute, whose motto is \u201cAdvancing liberty with responsibility by promoting market solutions for Missouri public policy.\u201d Show-Me has successfully lobbied for a cable franchise reform bill and HB 818, which made Missouri the first state to let employers contribute pretax dollars to employees' health-savings accounts. Show-Me has also opposed governments' use of eminent domain. === Campaign contributions === Sinquefield became a major financial contributor to political campaigns of both political parties in Missouri politics after the Missouri legislature ended campaign finance limits in 2009.Power Players: Missouri's 17 largest political donors from 2008 to 2013. Retrieved October 29, 2013 According to a 2015 Governing Magazine article, \"big majorities\" in both houses of the Missouri legislature have received campaign contributions from Sinquefield.

He advocates eliminating the state's income tax and replacing it with a more comprehensive sales tax. Sinquefield advocates replacing Missouri's and Kansas' income tax with a state sales tax on things like childcare, restaurants, and hotels. Sinquefield also gave money to the group Kansans for No Income Tax which helped governor Sam Brownback lower the state income tax in 2012. Dubbed the Kansas experiment, this policy decreased state revenues by hundreds of millions of dollars; caused spending on roads, bridges, and education to be slashed;\"Kansas Legislature approves budget deal, after lawmakers deliver blistering critiques of state finances,\" May 2, 2016, Topeka Capital- Journal\"Kansas Republicans Sour on Their Tax-Cut Experiment\" February 24, 2017, The Atlantic and failed to lift Kansas' below-average economic growth. In 2017, the Republican-controlled Legislature of Kansas voted to roll back the cuts and overrode Brownback's veto. Sinquefield also has repeatedly backed measures to repeal the earnings taxes of St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri. He is the primary financial supporter of the Let Voters Decide committee.Sinquefield, allies to seek ballot proposal ending Missouri's income tax. January 6, 2011. In 2010, the committee placed a statewide initiative on the Missouri ballot. Called Proposition A, it would prevent all Missouri communities except Kansas City and St. Louis from imposing earnings taxes. It would also allow Kansas City and St. Louis voters to vote on whether to retain their earnings taxes. Missourians passed proposition A with a large margin \u2013 68.4% YES / 31.6% NO (1,294,911 YES votes to 598,010 NO votes). On January 5, 2011, Let Voters Decide submitted nine initiative petitions to the Missouri Secretary of State calling for a repeal of the state's income tax \u2013 with a top rate of six percent. The petitions also called for a higher sales tax, capped at seven percent, that would be applied to virtually any good or service transaction involving individuals. Sinquefield and Let Voters Decide President Travis Brown say that replacing the income tax with a sales tax would help create jobs, promote economic development and make state revenue collection less volatile.\"Group seeks to swap state income tax for sales tax\" In 2014, Missouri lowered its income tax rate.https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbrown/2014/05/09/missouri-legislature- overrides-veto-joins-midwest-tax-cut-movement/#27c91ce33329 ===Local control of St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department=== Sinquefield supported the successful effort to return local control of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department to the City of St. Louis. Since 1861, the police department had been run by a five-person board that included four gubernatorial appointees. Sinquefield donated $300,000 to \"A Safer Missouri\", a group supporting the campaign for local control. A Safer Missouri endorsed state legislation in favor of local control, along with a ballot initiative filed with the Missouri Secretary of State, which will be pursued if the legislative efforts fail, according to a spokeswoman for A Safer Missouri.\"Sinquefield's latest cause: Local control for St. Louis Police\" The ballot initiative was filed and entitled Proposition A. Local control, the Proposition A ballot initiative, received broad support, including St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay, and the Missouri Democratic Party On February 22, 2011, the House of Representatives passed House Bill 71, the local measure in that body, by a vote of 109\u201346.\"House committee passes local control measure; Sinquefield backs it\" The bill went on the Senate,Senate Bill 23, which failed.
