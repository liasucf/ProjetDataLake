    "text": "The University of the Philippines Press (or the U.P. Press) is the official publishing house for all constituent units of the U.P. system, and is the first university press in the country. It is mandated to encourage, publish, and disseminate scholarly, creative, and scientific works that represent distinct contributions to knowledge in various academic disciplines, which commercial publishers would not ordinarily undertake to publish. Its main office is located at the University of the Philippines Diliman. It is currently headed by poet, critic and literary scholar J. Neil Garcia. == Awards == Since its establishment on March 16, 1965, the U.P. Press has published important, often groundbreaking, works by home scholars that represent distinct contributions to knowledge. Its titles have consistently won recognition from prestigious award-giving bodies including the National Book Awards \"Book of the Year\" award from the Manila Critics Circle, the Madrigal Gonzales Best First Book Award, and the Outstanding Book of the Year award from the National Academy of Science and Technology. Because of this achievement, it has twice been cited Publisher of the Year by the Manila Critics Circle. This is in keeping with the vision of being the leading academic publishing house that sets the benchmark for academic, technical, and literary titles. == External links == * Category:University of the Philippines Category:University of the Philippines Diliman Category:University presses of the Philippines Category:Book publishing companies of the Philippines Category:Publishing companies established in 1965 Category:Companies based in Quezon City ",
