    "text": "Pain psychology is the study of psychological and behavioral processes in chronic pain. It also involves the implementation of treatments for chronic pain, which include traditional therapeutic techniques (e.g. active listening, reflection, empathy) and behavioral techniques like guided imagery or meditation. Mental health related difficulties can arise as a result of pain, or can pre-exist and worsen during the course of chronic pain. It is a specialty in the field of clinical psychology focused on the treatment of pain. Pain psychology aims to treat the 'person in pain' rather than strictly the pain itself. Pain psychology can also be regarded as a branch of medical psychology, as many conditions associated with chronic pain have significant medical outcomes as well. == See also == * Pain management * Psychogenic pain * Pain Catastrophizing Scale == References == == External links == * Science Advances in Pain Research * How psychologists can help with pain management * The Psychology of Pain Category:Branches of psychology Category:Pain management ",
