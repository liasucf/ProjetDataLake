    "text": "Frankenstein, Jr. and The Impossibles is an American animated television series produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions. It premiered on September 10, 1966 on CBS, and ran for two seasons on Saturday mornings. ==Overview== The program contained two segments, which each served as a middle ground between Hanna-Barbera's traditional early output and its superhero-based late-1960s cartoons. Each episode would feature two segments with The Impossibles, and Frankenstein, Jr. in between. * Frankenstein, Jr.: Taking place in Civic City, boy scientist Buzz Conroy (voiced by Dick Beals) and his father Professor Conroy (voiced by John Stephenson) fight supervillains with the aid of a powerful heroic robot named \"Frankenstein, Jr.\" (voiced by Ted Cassidy). Buzz built \"Frankie\" and activated him through an energy ring. * The Impossibles: The title characters are a trio of superheroes (Multi-Man, Fluid-Man, and Coil-Man) who pose undercover as a Beatlesesque rock music band. The characters' names are descriptive of their powers: Multi-Man (voiced by Don Messick) can create identical copies of himself; Coil-Man (voiced by Hal Smith) can form into a super-springy coil; and Fluid-Man (voiced by Paul Frees) can transform his body into any fluid. The heroes receive assignments from \"Big D\" (also voiced by Frees), who contacts them via a receiver in the base of Coil-Man's left-handed guitar. During the development of the show, this group was called \"The Incredibles,\" but was changed to \"The Impossibles\" by the time of production. The team's pre-production name was later given to the superhero family from the 2004 Disney/Pixar film of the same name. The show was the target of complaints about violence in children's television, and was canceled in 1968 (first-run episodes had already ceased a year earlier). The Frankenstein, Jr. segments were later recycled in the 1976 series Space Ghost and Frankenstein, Jr., which aired on NBC from November 27, 1976 to September 3, 1977, replacing the canceled Big John, Little John. ==Voice cast== * Dick Beals as Buzz Conroy * Ted Cassidy as Frankenstein, Jr. * John Stephenson as Professor Conroy * Paul Frees as Fluid Man, Big D * Don Messick as Multi Man * Hal Smith as Coil Man ==List of episodes== ===Frankenstein, Jr.=== ===The Impossibles=== ==Home video== On April 26, 2011, Warner Home Video (via the Warner Archive Collection) released Frankenstein, Jr. and The Impossibles: The Complete Series on DVD in region 1 as part of their Hanna\u2013Barbera Classics Collection. This is a Manufacture-on-Demand (MOD) release, available exclusively through Warner's online store and Amazon.com. ==Other appearances== * Buzz Conroy and Frankenstein, Jr. appeared in the Yogi's Space Race episode \"Race Through the Planet of the Monsters\". ==Adaptations== Fantastic Four #1 A single issue of a Frankenstein Jr. and the Impossibles comic was released by Gold Key Comics in 1966 as a tie-in to the TV series, and the contents were reprinted in The Impossibles Annual by Atlas Publishing & Distributing Co. Ltd, UK in 1968. The two Frankenstein Jr. comic stories were titled \"The Image Invasion\" and \"Frankenstein Jr. Meets the Flea Man\". A new text-based story, specially written for the annual, was \"A Spook in his Wheel\". The character reappeared in the comic Hanna-Barbera Presents #8 published by Archie Comics in 1996. The front cover featured Frankenstein, Jr. battling the Impossibles in an homage to the front cover of the original Fantastic Four #1 by Marvel Comics. A Big Little Book titled Frankenstein, Jr.: The Menace of the Heartless Monster was published in 1968.http://www.biglittlebooks.com/frankensteinjr.html The Impossibles' heroic identities were re-used for a later Hanna-Barbera production, The Super Globetrotters (which also featured a similar concept\u2014in this case, the famous Harlem Globetrotters as undercover superheroes): * Nate Branch's heroic identity was alternately known as \"Fluid Man\" or \"Liquid Man\", with powers (and a flippered costume) similar to the Impossibles' Fluid-Man. * \"Twiggy\" Sanders became \"Spaghetti Man\", with coiling and stretching abilities similar to Coil-Man. * \"Geese\" Ausbie as \"Multi Man\" had virtually identical powers as his Impossibles counterpart and a similar costume. In 2016, Buzz and Frankenstein, Jr. and the Impossibles played a major role in the DC Comics series Future Quest, that also featured characters from various animated series produced by Hanna-Barbera such as Jonny Quest, Space Ghost, The Herculoids, Birdman and the Galaxy Trio and Moby Dick and Mighty Mightor.In this series, the team gained a new female member named Cobalt. ==References== ==External links== * Frankenstein, Jr. at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.
