    "text": "Jos\u00e9 W. F. Valle (born June 2, 1953) is a Spanish-Brazilian physicist. Born in Brazil, he earned a PhD in Theoretical Physics from Syracuse University (New York, 1982). In January 1983 he joined the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Oxfordshire, UK, as a Research Associate, where he got married with a Spanish geneticist. In 1986 he moved to Spain, joining as a visiting Professor at the Autonomous University of Barcelona, and subsequently IFIC (Instituto de F\u00edsica Corpuscular) at the University of Valencia in 1987. He is a Full Professor at the Spanish Council for Scientific Research CSIC. He is known for his numerous contributions to theoretical astroparticle and high energy physics, especially neutrino physics. Valle has contributed significantly to the modern theory of neutrino mass. In a groundbreaking work with Joseph Schechter he has provided the first exhaustive discussion of the various mechanisms of neutrino mass generation (including the variants of the seesaw mechanism). The same authors also formulated the Schechter-Valle theorem demonstrating that an observation of neutrinoless double beta decay will necessarily imply neutrinos to be Majorana fermions and vice versa. He also contributed to the correct interpretation of the oscillations of solar and atmospheric neutrinos which led to the physics Nobel Prize 2015 awarded to Arthur B. McDonald and Takaaki Kajita. The discovery of neutrino masses and oscillations can be considered as the only firm indication of the incompleteness of the Standard Model of particle physics with important consequences also for astrophysics and cosmology. ==Honors== * Spanish Iberdrola Science & Technology Prize for Theoretical Physics in 1999 * Humboldt Prize in 2002 * Medal of the Mexican Physical Society, 2014. * Premio M\u00e9xico de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda 2018 ==Press== * CERN Courier note on the occasion of the Humboldt Research Award, April-2003 * An Interview to Spanish newspaper [El Pais, October 2006. * An article on \"Neutrino detection\" in Spanish newspaper El Publico, May 2008, download here. ==Publications== Authored a particle physics textbook Neutrinos in High Energy and Astroparticle Physics which has been reviewed by the CERN Courier Here is his publication profile from the INSPIRE-HEP High Energy Physics database. ==References== ==External links== * Citation summary profile from Inspire Energy Physics database * Google scholar profile * Particle theorists citation ranking from Spires HEP database (2004). * AHEP Group official site * IFIC AHEP popular site * IFIC-Institut de F\u00edsica Corpuscular official site * Festivalle2013 * Items by or about Jos\u00e9 Valle in the Library of Congress catalogue * Items by or about Jos\u00e9 Valle in the German National Library catalogue * Cited in the popular science book The Perfect Wave: With Neutrinos at the Boundary of Space and Time, by Heinrich P\u00e4s, Harvard University Press * Premio M\u00e9xico de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda 2018 * Entrega del Premio M\u00e9xico de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda 2018 * Receiving Premio M\u00e9xico de Ciencia y Tecnolog\u00eda 2018, on December 9, 2019, Mexico, DF. ==See also== * List of theoretical physicists Category:Particle physicists Category:Weak interaction physicists Category:Brazilian physicists Category:Humboldt Research Award recipients Category:Spanish physicists Category:Living people Category:1953 births ",
