On 5 November 2018 it was confirmed that The Williamson Trust would merge with Leigh Academies Trust (LAT), although the wording of the press release suggests that The Williamson Trust is effectively being taken over. ==History== The trust was established by governors of the selective Rochester Maths School to oversee the development of the comprehensive The Hundred of Hoo School. It took over responsibility for several of the Hoo Peninsula primary schools. It took responsibility for Elaine Avenue Primary School in Strood.

The DfE had written to the trust expressing concern about the lack of progress at this school and at Stoke and Allhallows.
