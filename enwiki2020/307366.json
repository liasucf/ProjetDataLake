    "text": "Vaisheshika or Vai\u015be\u1e63ika () is one of the six schools of Indian philosophy (Vedic systems) from ancient India. In its early stages, the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika was an independent philosophy with its own metaphysics, epistemology, logic, ethics, and soteriology.Amita Chatterjee (2011), Ny\u0101ya-vai\u015be\u1e63ika Philosophy, The Oxford Handbook of World Philosophy, Over time, the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika system became similar in its philosophical procedures, ethical conclusions and soteriology to the Ny\u0101ya school of Hinduism, but retained its difference in epistemology and metaphysics. The epistemology of Vai\u015be\u1e63ika school of Hinduism, like Buddhism, accepted only two reliable means to knowledge: perception and inference. Vai\u015be\u1e63ika school and Buddhism both consider their respective scriptures as indisputable and valid means to knowledge, the difference being that the scriptures held to be a valid and reliable source by Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas were the Vedas. Vaisheshika school is known for its insights in naturalism.Dale Riepe (1996), Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, , pages 227-246Kak, S. 'Matter and Mind: The Vaisheshika Sutra of Kanada' (2016), Mount Meru Publishing, Mississauga, Ontario, . It is a form of atomism in natural philosophy.Analytical philosophy in early modern India J Ganeri, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy It postulated that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to param\u0101\u1e47u (atoms), and one's experiences are derived from the interplay of substance (a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements), quality, activity, commonness, particularity and inherence.Oliver Leaman, Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy. Routledge, , 1999, page 269. Everything was composed of atoms, qualities emerged from aggregates of atoms, but the aggregation and nature of these atoms was predetermined by cosmic forces. Ajivika metaphysics included a theory of atoms which was later adapted in Vai\u015be\u1e63ika school. According to Vai\u015be\u1e63ika school, knowledge and liberation were achievable by a complete understanding of the world of experience.. Vai\u015be\u1e63ika darshana was founded by Ka\u1e47\u0101da Kashyapa around the 6th to 2nd century BC.Oliver Leaman (1999), Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy. Routledge, , page 269J Ganeri (2012), The Self: Naturalism, Consciousness, and the First-Person Stance, Oxford University Press, ==Overview== Although the Vaisheshika system developed independently from the Nyaya school of Hinduism, the two became similar and are often studied together. In its classical form, however, the Vaishesika school differed from the Nyaya in one crucial respect: where Nyaya accepted four sources of valid knowledge, the Vaishesika accepted only two. The epistemology of Vai\u015be\u1e63ika school of Hinduism accepted only two reliable means to knowledge \u2013 perception and inference. Vaisheshika espouses a form of atomism, that the reality is composed of five substances (examples are earth, water, air, fire, and space). Each of these five are of two types, explains Ganeri, (param\u0101\u1e47u) and composite. A param\u0101\u1e47u is that which is indestructible, indivisible, and has a special kind of dimension, called \u201csmall\u201d (a\u1e47u). A composite is that which is divisible into param\u0101\u1e47u. Whatever human beings perceive is composite, and even the smallest perceptible thing, namely, a fleck of dust, has parts, which are therefore invisible. The Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas visualized the smallest composite thing as a \u201ctriad\u201d (trya\u1e47uka) with three parts, each part with a \u201cdyad\u201d (dya\u1e47uka). Vai\u015be\u1e63ikas believed that a dyad has two parts, each of which is an atom. Size, form, truths and everything that human beings experience as a whole is a function of parmanus, their number and their spatial arrangements. Parama means \"most distant, remotest, extreme, last\" and a\u1e47u means \"atom, very small particle\", hence param\u0101\u1e47u is essentially \"the most distant or last small (i.e. smallest) particle\". Vaisheshika postulated that what one experiences is derived from dravya (substance: a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements), guna (quality), karma (activity), samanya (commonness), vishesha (particularity) and nsamavaya (inherence, inseparable connectedness of everything).M Hiriyanna (1993), Outlines of Indian Philosophy, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 228-237 ==Epistemology== Hinduism identifies six Pram\u0101\u1e47as as epistemically reliable means to accurate knowledge and to truths:P Bilimoria (1993), Pram\u0101\u1e47a epistemology: Some recent developments, in Asian philosophy - Volume 7 (Editor: G Floistad), Springer, , pages 137-154 Pratyak\u1e63a (perception), Anum\u0101na (inference), Upam\u0101na (comparison and analogy), Arth\u0101patti (postulation, derivation from circumstances), Anupalabdhi (non- perception, negative/cognitive proof) and \u015aabda (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts). *Eliott Deutsche (2000), in Philosophy of Religion : Indian Philosophy Vol 4 (Editor: Roy Perrett), Routledge, , pages 245-248; *John A. Grimes, A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy: Sanskrit Terms Defined in English, State University of New York Press, , page 238Gavin Flood, An Introduction to Hinduism, Cambridge University Press, , page 225 Of these epistemology considered only pratyak\u1e63a (perception) and (inference) as reliable means of valid knowledge. Nyaya school, related to Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, accepts four out of these six.DPS Bhawuk (2011), Spirituality and Indian Psychology (Editor: Anthony Marsella), Springer, , page 172 *Pratyak\u1e63a (\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0937) means perception. It is of two types: external and internal. External perception is described as that arising from the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, while internal perception is described by this school as that of inner sense, the mind.MM Kamal (1998), The Epistemology of the Carvaka Philosophy, Journal of Indian and Buddhist Studies, 46(2): 13-16B Matilal (1992), Perception: An Essay in Indian Theories of Knowledge, Oxford University Press, The ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism identify four requirements for correct perception: Indriyarthasannikarsa (direct experience by one's sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), Avyapadesya (non-verbal; correct perception is not through hearsay, according to ancient Indian scholars, where one's sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else's perception), Avyabhicara (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one's sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and Vyavasayatmaka (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one's failure to observe all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one does not want to observe).Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 160-168 Some ancient scholars proposed \"unusual perception\" as pram\u0101\u1e47a and called it internal perception, a proposal contested by other Indian scholars. The internal perception concepts included pratibha (intuition), samanyalaksanapratyaksa (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and jnanalaksanapratyaksa (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a 'topic of study' by observing its current state).Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 168-169 Further, the texts considered and refined rules of accepting uncertain knowledge from Pratyak\u1e63a-pranama, so as to contrast nirnaya (definite judgment, conclusion) from anadhyavasaya (indefinite judgment).Karl Potter (1977), Meaning and Truth, in Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1995 by Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 170-172 *Anum\u0101na (\u0905\u0928\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0928) means inference. It is described as reaching a new conclusion and truth from one or more observations and previous truths by applying reason.W Halbfass (1991), Tradition and Reflection, State University of New York Press, , page 26-27 Observing smoke and inferring fire is an example of Anumana. In all except one Hindu philosophies,Carvaka school is the exception this is a valid and useful means to knowledge. The method of inference is explained by Indian texts as consisting of three parts: pratijna (hypothesis), hetu (a reason), and drshtanta (examples).James Lochtefeld, \"Anumana\" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A-M, Rosen Publishing. , page 46-47 The hypothesis must further be broken down into two parts, state the ancient Indian scholars: sadhya (that idea which needs to proven or disproven) and paksha (the object on which the sadhya is predicated). The inference is conditionally true if sapaksha (positive examples as evidence) are present, and if vipaksha (negative examples as counter-evidence) are absent. For rigor, the Indian philosophies also state further epistemic steps. For example, they demand Vyapti - the requirement that the hetu (reason) must necessarily and separately account for the inference in \"all\" cases, in both sapaksha and vipaksha.Karl Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, A conditionally proven hypothesis is called a nigamana (conclusion).Monier Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom - Religious, Philosophical and Ethical Doctrines of the Hindus, Luzac & Co, London, page 61 ===Syllogism=== The syllogism of the school was similar to that of the Ny\u0101ya school of Hinduism, but the names given by to the 5 members of syllogism are different. ==Literature== The earliest systematic exposition of the Vaisheshika is found in the of (or ). This treatise is divided into ten books. The two commentaries on the , and are no more extant. \u2019s (c. 4th century) is the next important work of this school. Though commonly known as of , this treatise is basically an independent work on the subject. The next Vaisheshika treatise, Candra\u2019s (648) based on \u2019s treatise is available only in Chinese translation. The earliest commentary available on \u2019s treatise is \u2019s (8th century). The other three commentaries are \u2019s (991), Udayana\u2019s (10th century) and \u2019s (11th century). \u2019s which also belongs to the same period, presents the and the principles as a part of one whole. \u2019s on is also an important work. ==The Categories or Pad\u0101rtha== According to the Vaisheshika school, all things that exist, that can be cognized and named are s (literal meaning: the meaning of a word), the objects of experience. All objects of experience can be classified into six categories, dravya (substance), (quality), karma (activity), (generality), (particularity) and (inherence). Later s ( and Udayana and ) added one more category abhava (non-existence). The first three categories are defined as artha (which can perceived) and they have real objective existence. The last three categories are defined as (product of intellectual discrimination) and they are logical categories. # Dravya (substance): The substances are conceived as 9 in number. They are, (earth), ap (water), tejas (fire), (air), (ether), (time), dik (space), (self or soul) and manas (mind). The first five are called s, the substances having some specific qualities so that they could be perceived by one or the other external senses. # (quality): The mentions 17 s (qualities), to which added another 7. While a substance is capable of existing independently by itself, a (quality) cannot exist so. The original 17 s (qualities) are, (colour), rasa (taste), gandha (smell), (touch), (number), (size/dimension/quantity), (individuality), (conjunction/accompaniments), (disjunction), paratva (priority), aparatva (posteriority), buddhi (knowledge), sukha (pleasure), (pain), (desire), (aversion) and prayatna (effort). To these added gurutva (heaviness), dravatva (fluidity), sneha (viscosity), dharma (merit), adharma (demerit), (sound) and (faculty). # Karma (activity): The karmas (activities) like s (qualities) have no separate existence, they belong to the substances. But while a quality is a permanent feature of a substance, an activity is a transient one. (ether), (time), dik (space) and (self), though substances, are devoid of karma (activity). # (generality): Since there are plurality of substances, there will be relations among them. When a property is found common to many substances, it is called . # (particularity): By means of , we are able to perceive substances as different from one another. As the ultimate atoms are innumerable so are the s. # (inherence): defined as the relation between the cause and the effect. defined it as the relationship existing between the substances that are inseparable, standing to one another in the relation of the container and the contained. The relation of is not perceivable but only inferable from the inseparable connection of the substances. ==The atomic theory== According to the school, the are the smallest mahat (perceivable) particles and defined as s (triads). These are made of three parts, each of which are defined as (dyad). The s are conceived as made of two parts, each of which are defined as (atom). The s (atoms) are indivisible and eternal, they can neither be created nor destroyed. Each (atom) possesses its own distinct (individuality) and have an inhering relation which is responsible for change and motion. The measure of the partless atoms is known as parima\u1e47\u1e0dala parim\u0101\u1e47a. It is eternal and it cannot generate the measure of any other substance. Its measure is its own absolutely. The early Vai\u015be\u1e63ika texts presented the following syllogism to prove that all objects i.e. the four bh\u016btas, p\u1e5bthv\u012b (earth), ap (water), tejas (fire) and v\u0101yu (air) are made of indivisible param\u0101\u1e47us (atoms): Assume that the matter is not made of indivisible atoms, and that it is continuous. Take a stone. One can divide this up into infinitely many pieces (since matter is continuous). Now, the Himalayan mountain range also has infinitely many pieces, so one may build another Himalayan mountain range with the infinite number of pieces that one has. One begins with a stone and ends up with the Himalayas, which is a paradox - so the original assumption that matter is continuous must be wrong, and so all objects must be made up of a finite number of param\u0101\u1e47us (atoms). ==See also== *Darshanas *Hindu philosophy *Hinduism *Nyaya (philosophy) *Pad\u0101rtha *Tarka-Sangraha *Vai\u015be\u1e63ika S\u016btra *Atomism ==Notes== ==References== *. *. *. ==Further reading== * Bimal Matilal (1977), A History of Indian Literature - Ny\u0101ya-Vai\u015be\u1e63ika, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, , * Gopi Kaviraj (1961), Gleanings from the history and bibliography of the Nyaya-Vaisesika literature, Indian Studies: Past & Present, Volume 2, Number 4, * * *Kak, Subhash: Matter and Mind: The Vai\u015be\u1e63ika S\u016btra of Ka\u1e47\u0101da * * * ==External links== *A summary of Vaisheshika physics * Shastra Nethralaya - Vaisheshika * GRETIL e-text of the Vai\u015be\u1e63ika S\u016btras Category:Ancient Indian philosophy Category:\u0100stika Category:Atomism Category:Epistemology Category:Hindu philosophy Category:Logic Category:Metaphysics ",
