    "text": "The Cordillera Blanca Batholith () is an extensive group of individual plutons that crop out near or at Cordillera Blanca, Peru. The batholith intrudes the Jurassic Chicama Formation. To the west the Cordillera Blanca Fault makes up the border of the batolith. It has been suggested that the magma that originated the batholith was the product of partial melting of underplated basaltic crust. ==References== ==See also== *Casma Group *Coastal Batholith of Peru Category:Batholiths of South America Category:Geology of Peru ",
