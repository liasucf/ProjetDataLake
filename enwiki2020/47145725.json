It was built in 1765 and remained in the Woolsey family, who were very influential in township affairs, until 1929. During the American Revolution, Jeremiah Woolsey served as a commissioner to recruit men to serve in the Continental Army, service for which he received 37 Pounds Sterling in 1780 at the behest of George Washington. The home was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Mercer County, New Jersey ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Mercer County, New Jersey Category:Houses in Mercer County, New Jersey Category:Hopewell Township, Mercer County, New Jersey Category:Houses completed in 1800 Category:New Jersey Register of Historic Places Category:Woolsey family ",
