    "text": "Schmidt Island () is one of the islands of the Severnaya Zemlya group in the Russian Arctic and was named after Soviet scientist and first head of the Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route, Otto Schmidt. It is located at the far northwestern end of the archipelago and lies slightly south of the Arctic Cape on Komsomolets Island. ==Geography== Schmidt Island is significantly detached from the rest of Severnaya Zemlya regarding the relative proximity of the other main islands to each other. It measures and is almost entirely covered by the Schmidt Ice Cap. Owing to its exposed position, the climate in the Schmidt Island's area is much colder than in the rest of the archipelago.http://www.ggy.bris.ac.uk/staff/personal/MartinSiegert/Bassford_eal_AAAR_2006a.pdf File:Schmidt-Insel 1 2014-09-01.jpg|Schmidt Island (Sewernaja Semlja, 81\u00b012\u2019N, 91\u00b010\u2018E) File:Schmidt-Insel 2 2014-09-01.jpg|View of the ice cap covering Schmidt Island ==See also== * List of glaciers of Russia * List of islands of Russia ==References== ==External links== * Category:Islands of the Kara Sea Category:Islands of Severnaya Zemlya ",
