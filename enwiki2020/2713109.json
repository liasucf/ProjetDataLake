    "text": "Fantastic is the debut studio album by British pop duo Wham! released on 9 July 1983. It reached number one on the UK Albums Chart. It included the previously released singles \"Young Guns\", \"Wham! Rap\" and \"Bad Boys\". \"Club Tropicana\" was released as a single to coincide with the album's release. Although not on the album \"Club Fantastic Megamix\" (a medley of songs from the album) was released against the band's wishes by Innervision soon after Fantastic, and whilst they were in proceedings to leave the label. Two songs, Golden Soul and Soul Boy, were written by George and Andrew for the album but both were shelved as 'neither of them were any good'. According to Andrew Ridgeley in his 2019 book Wham! George and me it was during the writing and recording of this album that the pair realised how much stronger a songwriter George was, and they resolved amicably to let George take over all future Wham! songwriting duties in order to achieve the success they both wanted for the band. The album features a hidden track (played on a honky-tonk-style piano), after the final 20 seconds of \"Young Guns (Go for It!)\". In the U.S., the album was originally released as the group \"WHAM! U.K.\", due to a conflict with a U.S. group with the same name (Columbia BFC-38911). ==Track listing== ===Original=== ===Reissue=== The track listing of the first edition of the CD and the original cassette tape feature three bonus tracks interspersed within the original track listing, consisting of instrumental remixes.
