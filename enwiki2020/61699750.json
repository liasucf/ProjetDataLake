Prior to joining the University of Bristol he was Feodor Lynen Fellow of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation at Brown University working with Arto Nurmikko. == Career and research == Kuball is known for his research into thermal characterization and reliability of electronic materials and devices, with particular focus on wide bandgap semiconductors, and RF and power electronic devices. He pioneered techniques such as Raman thermography, based on Raman spectroscopy, to determine temperature in devices with submicron spatial resolution and nanosecond time resolution,Measurement of temperature in active high-power AlGaN/GaN HFETs using Raman spectroscopy M Kuball, JM Hayes, MJ Uren, I Martin, JCH Birbeck, RS Balmer, BT Hughes, IEEE Electron Device Letters 23 (1), pp 7-9 (2002) https://doi.org/10.1109/55.974795M Kuball amd JW Pomeroy, A Review of Raman Thermography for Electronic and Opto-Electronic Device Measurement With Submicron Spatial and Nanosecond Temporal Resolution, IEEE Transactions on Device and Materials Reliability 16 (4), pp 667 - 684 (2016) https://doi.org/10.1109/TDMR.2016.2617458 and numerous other techniques for the thermal JW Pomeroy, R Baranyai Simon, H Sun, D Francis, F Faili, DJ Twitchen, M Kuball, Contactless thermal boundary resistance measurement of GaN-on-diamond wafers, IEEE Electron Device Letters 35 (10), pp 1007-1009 (2014) https://doi.org/10.1109/LED.2014.2350075J Anaya, S Rossi, M Alomari, E Kohn, L T\u00f3th, B P\u00e9cz, KD Hobart, TJ Anderson, TI Feygelson, BB Pate, M Kuball, Control of the in-plane thermal conductivity of ultra-thin nanocrystalline diamond films through the grain and grain boundary properties, Acta Materialia 103, pp 141-152 (2016) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2015.09.045 and electrical characterizationMJ Uren, J Moreke, M Kuball, Buffer design to minimize current collapse in GaN/AlGaN HFETs, IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices 59 (12), pp 3327-3333 (2012) https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2012.2216535MJ Uren, M C\u00e4sar, MA Gajda, M Kuball, Applied Physics Letters 104 (26), pp 263505 https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4885695 of materials and devices including for understanding device reliability. Raman Thermography was used by multiple companies to qualify GaN transistor technology for space applications.https://epsrc.ukri.org/files/newsevents/publications/case- studies/2015/lastinglifetimesbristoluniversity/ In 2019, he founded TherMap Solutions to commercialize techniques he developed and is presently its chief business officer. He presently leads the \u00a35M EPSRC Programme Grant GaN- DaMEIntegrated GaN-Diamond Microwave Electronics: From Materials, Transistors to MMICsDiamond D-Day workshop gives progress update on GaN-on-diamond microwave technology which develops GaN-on-Diamond technology for ultra high power RF devices, and the \u00a32M EPSRC Platform grant MANGI Materials and Devices for Next Generation Internet (MANGI) which implements this technology for next generation internet applications. ==Awards and honours== In recognition for his achievements, Kuball was awarded a Royal Academy of Engineering Chair in Emerging Technologies, was elevated to Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers,November: IEEE fellows 2019 | News and features | University of Bristol IEEE Fellows Directory - Member Profile of the Materials Research SocietyMarch: kuball materials research society | News and features | University of Bristolhttps://www.mrs.org/mrs-fellows-list, of Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers,January: Martin Kuball awards | News and features | University of BristolMartin Kuball Institution of Engineering and TechnologyRecently Elected Fellows and the Institute of Physics New fellows, new members and In Memoriam in September 2016Fellow (FInstP).
