    "text": "The Azerbaijan\u2013Georgia\u2013Romania Interconnector (AGRI) is a proposed project to transport Azerbaijani natural gas to Romania and further to Central Europe. Natural gas would be transported by the pipeline from Sangachal Terminal in Azerbaijan to the Kulevi Terminal at the Black Sea coast of Georgia. In Kulevi, the liquefied natural gas export terminal (LNG plant) would be built. Liquefied natural gas will be transported by LNG tankers to the Constan\u0163a terminal in Romania. After regasificaton natural gas will be delivered through the existing gas grid to Romania and other European countries. Alternative to the transportation of liquefied natural gas is transportation of compressed natural gas. Capacity of the interconnector is expected to be of natural gas per year, of which will be consumed in Romania. The project is expected to cost \u20ac4\u20136 billion. On 13 April 2010, the Minister of Industry and Energy of Azerbaijan Natig Aliyev, Minister of Economy, Commerce and Business Environment of Romania Adriean Videanu and Georgian Energy Minister Alexander Khetaguri signed a memorandum on implementation of the project and establishment of the project company headquartered in Bucharest. The project is developed by AGRI LNG Co formed by Romgaz, State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic, Georgian Oil and Gas Corporation, and MVM. This is possible that also Bulgaria can join the project. The project is seen as a competitor to the Nabucco pipeline, White Stream, South Stream, Trans Adriatic Pipeline, and Interconnector Turkey\u2013Greece\u2013Italy projects. ==See also== * Energy in Georgia (country) == References == Category:Proposed liquefied natural gas plants Category:Proposed pipelines in Europe Category:Natural gas pipelines in Azerbaijan Category:Natural gas pipelines in Georgia (country) Category:Energy infrastructure in Romania Category:Natural gas pipelines in Romania Category:Natural gas pipelines in Hungary Category:Azerbaijan\u2013Georgia (country) relations Category:Azerbaijan\u2013Romania relations Category:Georgia (country)\u2013Romania relations Category:Black Sea energy ",
