It is notable that there is a distance of between this station and Machynlleth, the longest distance between two intermediate stations in Wales. ==History== The notable Welsh romantic poet John Ceiriog Hughes was employed as a station master and Manager of the Van Railway at Caersws railway station from 1868 until his death in 1887. From 1871 to 1940 the Van Railway terminated at Caersws. The station was built by the Newtown and Machynlleth Railway of the Cambrian Railways in the 1890s. Originally there was a passing loop, a goods shed, a water tower and a ticket office and a signal box - the latter remained in use until March 2011 as a gate box to supervise the station level crossing (this is now operated from Machynlleth). The station was threatened with closure in 1964 along with all of the other wayside stops on the former Cambrian main line (as a consequence of the Beeching Axe), but reprieved by the then Minister of Transport Tom Fraser in December that year to act as the notional railhead for the town of Llanidloes (following the demise of the Mid-Wales Railway that served it directly).Disused Stations - Montgomery Disused Stations Site Record; Retrieved 31 July 2017 In February 2013, Caersws station won the \"Wales\u2019 Best Unstaffed Train Station\" award, supported by Keep Wales Tidy.http://www.keepwalestidy.org/10408 ==Facilities== Though unstaffed, the station has a ticket machine installed.
