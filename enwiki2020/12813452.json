    "text": "Operation Chesterfield was the assault by the 1st Canadian Division on the Hitler Line, in May 1944 during World War II. The Hitler Line was a German fortified defensive line south of Rome. Initial attempts to penetrate the defences before they had been effectively manned had failed and a set piece, prepared assault became necessary. The action was hard-fought. Ultimately, Allied forces penetrated the line and the German defenders had to retreat, in some disorder. ==References== Category:Italian campaign (World War II) Category:Land battles of World War II involving the United Kingdom Category:Military operations of World War II involving Germany Category:Battles of World War II involving Canada Category:Military history of Canada during World War II Category:May 1944 events ",
