    "text": "Overture () is a 1965 Hungarian short documentary film written by J\u00e1nos Vad\u00e1sz. It won the Short Film Palme d'Or at the 1965 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short. ==Plot== After the opening title card, a white blur in the center of a black screen resolves to the shape of a chicken egg. We penetrate the shell, and watch, in time- lapse, the 21-day development of a chicken embryo, from a germ spot on the yolk to the emergence of the baby chick, compressed into under eight minutes, set to Beethoven's Egmont Overture. ==Cultural influences== Film uses complete Beethoven's Ouverture to Egmont as soundtrack for image series featuring hatching bird, referencing rebellious nature of Egmont fighting for freedom despite all barriers. Beethoven's Egmont is a set of incidental music pieces for the 1787 play of the same name by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The film, nominated for Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) is described as \"among the most ingenious pairings of music and image in the history of the festival.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:1965 films Category:Hungarian films Category:Hungarian-language films Category:Hungarian documentary films Category:Short documentary films Category:Short Film Palme d'Or winners Category:1965 documentary films Category:1965 short films ",
