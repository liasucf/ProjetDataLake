Dancin' Dave Derbyshire, mentioning in an eight out of ten review from Cross Rhythms, responds, \"With her eclectic blend of neo-soul styles LeJuene shows off her impressive vocals by effortlessly lifting the smooth sounds of some of the songs and belting out others.\" Her third album, Evolution of Me, released by Fontana Records in 2012, and again this did not chart. ==Personal life== Thompson is married to Cedric Thompson, who is a native of Anderson, South Carolina, and he is a Grammy Award and Stellar Award-winning music producer.
