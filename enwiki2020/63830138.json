It is her first extended play released under a major label and features a guest appearance from Brooke Candy. Singles \"2ON\" and \"Big Racks\" featuring Brooke Candy were previously released in anticipation for the EP. == Background and promotion == \"2ON\" served as the lead single and was released on 24 May 2019 alongside its music video. Runway explained the meaning of the song on a Twitter post released the same day as the song. She stated \"Every day we are told that we could be better, prettier, brighter \u2013 as if there\u2019s something wrong with us in the first place? When I was younger, I couldn\u2019t hack the amount of shade thrown at my skin tone from the playgrounds, to the boys at the bus stops after school that were equally as black to every TV show, every music video, every movie that insinuated MY black was not beautiful!\u201d. The song would be featured on Paper Magazine's Top 50 Songs of 2019 List. \"Big Racks\" featuring American rapper Brooke Candy was released as the second single from the album on 5 July. The accompanying music video would receive praise for its inclusion of touching upon racial discrimination in the workplace. On 2 August Bree Runway announced the EP's release date as well as the cover art and tracklist. The EP was released on 16 August 2019. A music video for \"All Night\" was released on 21 August. === Artwork === In an interview, Bree discussed the artwork for the EP stating, \"(the) cover is half white and half black and that in itself is a message. I want you to be free and be yourself. The darker side of it (represents) the lengths people will go to become lighter and also to become more acceptable socially and in our workplaces. For the EP, I looked at the lengths we would go to damage ourselves because of society\". == Track listing == == Credits and personnel == Credits adapted from Tidalhttps://listen.tidal.com/album/115150762/credits and organized in alphabetical order by surname. * Johannes Burger - songwriting * Brooke Candy - featured artist , additional vocals * Levi Gordon - songwriting * Max Grahn - songwriting * Fat Max Gsus - production, songwriting * Michael Ilbert - mixing * Kilian & Jo - production * Dave Kutch - mastering * Imani McFarlane - additional vocals * Todd Oliver-Fisherman - guitar * Will Reeves - mixing * Raf Riley - mixing , associated performer * Bree Runway - lead vocals, songwriting * Kilian Wilke - songwriting * Moon Willis - production , songwriting * 808Charmer - production , songwriting == Release history == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" ! scope=\"col\" |Region ! scope=\"col\" |Date ! scope=\"col\" |Format ! scope=\"col\" |Label ! scope=\"col\" | |- ! scope=\"row\" |Various |16 August 2019 | |Virgin EMI |https://listen.tidal.com/album/115150762 |- |} == References == Category:2019 EPs Category:Hip hop EPs Category:Virgin EMI Records albums ",
