Mentioned for the first time in 1084, its name comes from Dutch and means \"South church\" (compare nearby Nortkerque). In 1396, Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy stayed at the castle. The English occupied it in the year 1405. Louis XI took it back in 1477 and king Henry VII fought and won it again in 1488. Finally, in 1542 the French, under Antoine de Bourbon, duke of Vend\u00f4me, re-took it and completely destroyed the castle. In May 1595, the village church was looted by the French. On 7 August 1635, a body of Spanish troops, from Saint-Omer, seized the town. In 1638, the French seized the village back again. ==Population== ==Politics== Presidential Elections Second Round:http://www.lemonde.fr/data/france/presidentielle-2017/ {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Winning Candidate!!Party!!% |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 2017 | Marine Le Pen | FN | 56.96 |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 2012 | Fran\u00e7ois Hollande | PS | 50.78 |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 2007 | Nicolas Sarkozy | UMP | 55.68 |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 2002 | Jacques Chirac | RPR | 72.88 |} ==Places of interest== * The church of St.Martin, dating from the sixteenth century. * The ruins of the ch\u00e2teau de La Montoire, dating from the fourteenth century. ==See also== *Communes of the Pas-de-Calais department ==References== * INSEE commune file ==External links== * Official website of the commune of Zutkerque Category:Communes of Pas-de-Calais ",
