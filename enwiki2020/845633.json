    "text": "LIBRA - Party of Liberal Democrats ( or LIBRA for short, also spelled Libra) was a short-lived Croatian social-liberal political party active between September 2002 and August 2005. During its existence the party ran in only one parliamentary election, in 2003, and won three seats in the 151-seat 5th Assembly of the Croatian Parliament. LIBRA was formed in July 2002 and formally registered in September that year, following a split in the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) when a faction led by Jozo Rado\u0161, then defence minister in the Cabinet of Ivica Ra\u010dan I, opposed HSLS leader Dra\u017een Budi\u0161a's decision to leave the ruling five-party centre-left coalition dominated by SDP, in the hopes of provoking an early election. However, then Prime Minister Ivica Ra\u010dan managed to avoid a fresh election by forming a reconstructed Cabinet of Ivica Ra\u010dan II on 30 July 2002, with the newly formed LIBRA holding two seats in the cabinet - Goran Grani\u0107 as Deputy Prime Minister, and Roland \u017duvani\u0107 as Minister for Maritime Affairs, Transport and Communications. Until the end of the 4th Assembly in October 2003, the party was represented in the Croatian Parliament with nine members, all former HSLS members, with Ivo \u0160krabalo as head of the party club. LIBRA then ran in the November 2003 election as a junior partner in a centre-left coalition with Social Democratic Party (SDP), Istrian Democratic Assembly (IDS) and the Liberal Party (LS). The coalition lost the election to the centre-right Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), winning a total of 43 seats in a 151-seat parliament, out of which only 3 belonged to LIBRA. In February 2005 party members voted to merge with the Croatian People's Party (HNS) which changed its name in Croatian People's Party - Liberal Democrats (HNS-LD or, more commonly, just HNS). Two of LIBRA's MPs in the 5th Assembly, Jozo Rado\u0161 and Vilim Herman, joined HNS, while the third, \u017deljko Pavlic, resigned his party membership to become independent. In August 2005 the party was formally struck from the party register. ==Election history== The following is a summary of the party's results in legislative elections for the Croatian Parliament. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Election !In coalition with !Votes won (coalition totals) !Percentage !Seats won !Change !Government |- |2003 |SDP-IDS-LS |560,593 |22.60% | | 3 | |} ==See also== *Liberalism in Croatia *Croatian People's Party \u2013 Liberal Democrats ==References== Category:Liberal parties in Croatia Category:Social liberal parties Category:Defunct political parties in Croatia Category:Political parties established in 2002 Category:Political parties disestablished in 2005 Category:2005 disestablishments in Croatia Category:2002 establishments in Croatia ",
