    "text": "The Langenhagen Pferdemarkt\u2013Hannover Airport railway is a main line in the town of Langenhagen in the Hanover Region in the German state of Lower Saxony. It provides a public transport connection to Hannover Airport. It has been operated exclusively by the Hanover S-Bahn since its opening on 28 May 2000. == Route== Shortly after Langenhagen Pferdemarkt station, the line branches to the west off the Hanover\u2013Buchholz railway, which runs to the north at this point. It then runs almost directly to the west, crossing the A 352. Shortly before Hannover Airport station, the line enters a cutting, which bends to the southwest and the line runs into the underground station. The S-Bahn station is a terminal station and the only station on the line. The station has two platform tracks, which join in the tunnel area to form one track, although the station access ramp is wide enough for the laying of a second track. Signalling on the line is operated by the computer-based interlocking in Langenhagen, which is controlled by a dispatcher in Betriebszentrale Nord (Operations Centre North) in Hanover. == Operations== Normally, the line is served by S5 services to Hamelin and Paderborn. During large fairs on the Hanover Fairground, S8 services also run to Hannover Messe/Laatzen station. Trial operations had already taken place on the line by 3 March 2000. == References == Category:Railway lines in Lower Saxony Category:Railway lines opened in 2000 Category:2000 establishments in Germany Category:Buildings and structures in Hanover Region Category:Airport rail links in Germany Category:Hanover S-Bahn ",
