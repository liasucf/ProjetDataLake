    "text": "Talkin' Honky Blues is a studio album by Canadian hip hop musician Buck 65. It was released on WEA in 2003. The album won the 2004 Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year. ==Critical reception== Sean Carruthers of AllMusic gave the album 4 stars out of 5, saying: \"Instead of jazzy or funky backing tracks, most of the tracks here crib heavily from country, which is where the 'honky' comes in: this is the sort of thing that Buck 65 grew up with and what influenced him.\" He described it as \"a beat poetry album with hip hop beats.\" Rollie Pemberton of Pitchfork gave the album a 7.6 out of 10, saying, \"[Buck 65] has discovered a happy medium between folk and rap, turning his initial disdain for the lack of innovation in hip-hop into a more diverse sound.\" Terry Sawyer of PopMatters named it the best album of 2003. In 2005, Jason Richards of Now called it \"[Buck 65's] most accessible album\". In 2007, Dan Weiss of Stylus Magazine placed it at number 6 on the \"Top 10 Alt-Country Greats Not Recorded by Uncle Tupelo\" list. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from liner notes. * Buck 65 \u2013 lyrics, beats, turntables, recording, mixing * Graeme Campbell \u2013 MIDI, other computer stuff, recording, mixing * Charles Austin \u2013 guitar, stringed things, recording, mixing * Dale Murray \u2013 pedal steel guitar * Andrew Glencross \u2013 keyboards * Michael Catano \u2013 drums * Bob Ludwig \u2013 mastering * Jenn McIntyre \u2013 art direction, design, illustration * Ingram Barss \u2013 photography * Jenn McIntyre \u2013 photography * Patrick Duffy \u2013 layout * Jenn Hirst \u2013 A&R; * Steve Blair \u2013 A&R; ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |- !scope=\"col\"| Chart !scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2003 albums Category:Buck 65 albums Category:Warner Music Group albums Category:Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year albums ",
