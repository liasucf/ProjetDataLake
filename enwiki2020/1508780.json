Holme was one of the Valiant Sixty, a group of early leaders and activists in the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). ==Life== Holme was born in Lancashire, England, on November 3, 1624, to a yeoman named George and his wife Alice (n\u00e9e Whiteside). He married Sarah Croft in 1649, and soon enlisted in the army under the leadership of Oliver Cromwell, where he attained the rank of captain. It may have been in the army that he gained some experience in surveying. After retiring he was granted more than 4,000 acres (16 km\u00b2) in County Wexford, Ireland, which was then under the control and colonization of England. At some point he joined the Quaker movement in Ireland, reputedly converted by George Fox, founder of the sect. There he met fellow Quaker William Penn, founder of Pennsylvania. In 1682, Penn wrote to Holme from the colony asking him to come be his surveyor, since his original surveyor, Captain William Crispin, had recently become ill and died on the voyage to America. Shortly thereafter, Holme, a widower, sailed with four of his children to America, where he arrived in August 1682.Thomas Holme Historical Marker Holme designed the plan of the city of Philadelphia and produced the first detailed map of Pennsylvania, entitled \"A Mapp of Ye Improved Part of Pensilvania in America, Divided Into Countyes, Townships and Lotts....\" (published circa 1687).\"A Brief History of the Methodist Episcopal Church of Spring City, Pa\" Page 7, 1899 On Penn's arrival in the colony, he appointed Holme as one of his councilors. Holme also served as a justice of the peace and commissioner of property. Holme held the office of Surveyor-General until his death at age 71 in the spring of 1695, in Dublin Township, Philadelphia County (now the Holmesburg section of the city of Philadelphia). In 1863, a memorial was erected at his burial site, in the form of a six-foot-tall marble obelisk, near where his home is believed to have been located, now part of Pennypack Park. ==Legacy== Philadelphia's Holme Avenue, Holme Circle, and Thomas Holme Elementary School were all named in his honor, as is Holmesburg, a neighborhood in northeast Philadelphia. ==See also== *Nicholas Scull II == References == ==Further reading== * *Hough, Oliver, \"Captain Thomas Holme, Surveyor-General of Pennsylvania and Provincial Councillor,\" The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. XIX & XX, 1895 & 1896\\. ==External links== * http://archives.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=711 * Biographical essay in Professional Surveyor magazine: **Part 1 **Part 2 * Image of one of Holme's maps from the Lower Merion Historical Society * \"Portraiture of the City of Philadelphia\" (1683), by Thomas Holme * Brief biography at virtualology.com * Category:1624 births Category:1695 deaths Category:People of colonial Pennsylvania Category:American Quakers Category:Converts to Quakerism Category:People from Lancashire (before 1974) Category:Roundheads Category:17th-century Quakers Category:History of Philadelphia Category:American cartographers Category:Kingdom of England emigrants to the Thirteen Colonies ",
