He was known for the assistance that he gave to Jews during the war, providing false papers so they could escape the Nazis and their collaborators. For this he was named Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem. ==Early years== Roger Belb\u00e9och was born on 26 July 1921 in Saint-Maurice, now in the Val-de-Marne. His family was from Brittany. His father was a Communist and taught him to resist all forms of oppression. After graduating from school he obtain a job with the PTT in 1938. He met and befriended the Communist propagandist Robert Deloche at the end of the 1930s. ==World War II (1939\u201345)== After the fall of France in June 1940 Belb\u00e9och fell back on Clermont-Ferrand, then Lyon, with his comrades. They wanted to join General Charles de Gaulle, and wandered in S\u00e8te, Toulouse and Bordeaux in an effort to cross the border into Spain, but eventually returned to Paris. In 1941 he joined the Front-National pour la Libert\u00e9 et l'Ind\u00e9pendance nationale. Albert Ouzoulias and Robert Deloche advised Belb\u00e9och to infiltrate the Parisian police. Belb\u00e9och joined the commissariat of the 12th arrondissement of Paris, in which position he could help members of the Resistance to gain false papers, and could help persecuted Jews. He was assigned to the Bel Air quarter. He made contact with the caretakers and office boys who worked for the Organisation Todt, and through them gained access to records of Jews who were subject to house arrest. His friends told him not to concern himself with the Jews, but he felt it was his duty. He also distributed Resistance leaflets and collected information. On 16 July 1942, the day of the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup, French police arrested Belb\u00e9och's Jewish fianc\u00e9e Claudine Kaufmann and her family. He never saw her again. Madame Hermoza, Jewish wife of Joseph Mezan, a French Christian, was arrested because she was not wearing her star and taken to Belb\u00e9och's police station, where Belb\u00e9och at once set her free so she would not be delivered to the Gestapo. Her husband was arrested on the grounds that he was hiding a Jew, and was taken to the prefecture, where Belb\u00e9och managed to get him released. Madame Hermoza escaped to the south with her two children using false papers supplied by Belb\u00e9och. A colleague denounced Belb\u00e9och. On 6 September 1942 Belb\u00e9och was arrested and taken to the Commissariat for Jewish Affairs. He expected to be accused of making false papers, but was confronted with a young Jewish member of the resistance whom he had given false papers and who had been terribly beaten. He began to insult the police and was himself beaten up. His tailbone and two ribs were broken. The prefect of Blois intervened. Belb\u00e9och was taken to hospital in Saint Antoine, then to Brittany for two months to recover. On returning to Paris he demanded to resume his job. He was reinstated in the police and assigned to Nogent-sur-Marne. He continued to work for the Resistance and to help Jewish or Christian refugees until the liberation of France. ==Later career== After the war Belb\u00e9och remained with the police, and became a Commandant of the National Police. He retired in 1975. He became a member of the board of the National Museum of the Resistance and adviser to the National Association of veterans of the Resistance.
