    "text": "The Houston Street Viaduct (formerly the Dallas-Oak Cliff Viaduct) is a viaduct in Dallas, Texas that crosses the Trinity River via Houston Street, connecting Downtown Dallas and Oak Cliff. Designed by Ira G. Hedrick, it was built in 1911, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ==History== The viaduct project was conceived after the Great Trinity River Flood of 1908, which destroyed existing bridges connecting Oak Cliff with downtown Dallas. In 1909, Dallas County voters approved a $600,000 bond issue for the new bridge. ==References== Category:Bridges in Dallas Category:Viaducts in the United States Category:National Register of Historic Places in Dallas ",
