Opened in 1987 and located on the High Street, the Treaty Centre offers 270,194 square feet of retail space and is anchored by Debenhams and Wilkinsons. It has an average weekly footfall of 195,000 people. ==History== The centre took two years to built and more than 10 years in planning. The site was built on the site of a former library and civic hall buildings dating back to 1905 which were demolished. In 2006 a rival shopping centre called the Blenheim Centre was built to the north. In 2011 the centre was acquired by Quidnet Capital for \u00a337 million and in the following years the centre was refurbished. ==Gallery== Inside the Treaty Centre, Hounslow.jpg|Inside the Treaty Centre Christmas at Treaty Centre.jpg|Inside the Treaty Centre during Christmas time Carousel in High Street Hounslow - geograph.org.uk - 1598857.jpg|A carousel on High Street, in front of the Treaty Centre's entrance ==References== Category:Shopping centres in the London Borough of Hounslow Category:Shopping malls established in 1987 ",
