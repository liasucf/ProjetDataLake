    "text": "Blaengavenny Farmhouse, Llanvihangel Crucorney, Monmouthshire is a farmhouse of late medieval origins. It is a Grade II listed building. Its adjacent barn and granary have separate Grade II listings. ==History== Cadw dates the earliest parts of the farmhouse to the period 1480\u20131520. In the 17th century, the hall was sub-divided creating an upper floor, with other work being undertaken. This later building is indicated by a date stone set in the porch with a date 1621. The Cadw listing record describes the farm as \"exceptionally interesting with only minor alterations since 1621\". It remains the private farmhouse to a working farm. ==Architecture and description== The architectural historian John Newman describes the farmhouse as; \"largely single-storeyed, consisting of two parts. Sir Cyril Fox and Lord Raglan, in the first of their three-volume study Monmouthshire Houses, give a plan showing the typical hall house layout. Peter Smith, in his study Houses of the Welsh Countryside, records Blaengavenny as an example of a half timbered house, a type relatively rare in Wales and generally located, as here, proximate to the England\u2013Wales border. The farmhouse is Grade II* listed, with its barn and granary having separate, Grade II listings. ==Notes== == References == * * * Category:Buildings and structures in Monmouthshire Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Monmouthshire ",
