    "text": "Hamilton Park is a public park at 513 W. 72nd Street in the Englewood neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The park opened in 1904 as part of a plan led by the South Park Commission to add small neighborhood parks on Chicago's South Side. It was the first public park in Englewood. Landscape designers the Olmsted Brothers and architecture firm D. H. Burnham & Company collaborated on the park's design. The park opened with a fieldhouse, baseball field, wading pool, and walkways; within the decade, the designers added gymnasiums, a playground, and tennis courts. The fieldhouse has a Beaux-Arts design, and its inside features several murals of prominent figures in American history. The park was heavily used after it opened, and the fieldhouse in particular was booked so consistently that it was expanded in the 1920s. The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 20, 1995. ==References== Category:Parks in Chicago Category:Parks on the National Register of Historic Places in Chicago Category:Baseball venues in Chicago Category:Basketball venues in Chicago Category:Softball venues in Chicago Category:Swimming venues in Chicago Category:Tennis venues in Chicago Category:South Side, Chicago Category:Urban public parks Category:1904 establishments in Illinois Category:Beaux-Arts architecture in Illinois ",
