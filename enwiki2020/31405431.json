It handles and regulates civil aviation in Vietnam.Transport in Vietnam. World Bank. Feb. 2007. Among its functions are: the formulation of plans and programs to develop civil aviation; the development of legal drafts, regulations and standards relating to civil aviation; information dissemination and education on aviation law; aviation safety and security; airport, aircraft and flight management; environmental protection; search and rescue and flood prevention; ratifying air fares proposed by airlines operating in Vietnam; research and development; handling complaints and/or violations of aviation law; administrative reform; and financial and personnel affairs.General information . Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam. September 2010. As of 2001, CAAV managed 19 airports throughout Vietnam, focusing on three main international airports: Tan Son Nhat Airport, Noi Bai Airport, and Da Nang Airport. The agency has its headquarters in Gia Th\u1ee5y Ward, Long Bi\u00ean District, Hanoi.\"Home .\" Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam.

It was originally tasked with state management, national defense, and commercialization of air transportation. The aviation sector expanded greatly during its formative years, expanding from a few aircraft in what was then North Vietnam to eventually include a fleet of over 50 aircraft (including both Soviet- and American-made craft) in a unified Vietnam after 1976. Infrastructure was improved during this time, as airports country-wide were equipped with better facilities and materials for flight management and operations. CAAV grew to serve around 250,000 passengers a year, both domestically and on international routes to China, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand.A Strategy For The Vietnam Civil Aviation Administration To Promote Us-Vietnam Bilateral Civil Aviation Agreement . Chi Nguyen. December 2001. Monterey Institute of International Studies, Monterey, California. A dramatic decrease in foreign aid in the early 1980s led to a crisis for the CAAV, which found itself unable to replace aging aircraft at a time when the demand for air transportation was rising. At the same time, it became apparent that years of focusing on military functions had led to a decrease in efficiency, both economically and personnel-wise. In response, the CAAV underwent a renovation in its organizational structure and culture, refocusing itself on equipment repair and maintenance, and establishing two main tasks for the civil aviation sector: air transportation and air services. To reflect its new structure, national flag carrier Vietnam Airlines was established by government decree in 1989 (Decision No.225/CT). In February 1990, the CAAV was transferred out of the Ministry of Defence to the Ministry of Transport, Post and Communications. Vietnam Airlines completed its restructuring programme and formally split from the Civil Aviation Administration to become a state enterprise in 1993. All the same, for the next few years, the new airline continued to be known as Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam. In 1996, Vietnam Airlines was officially incorporated with a number of aviation-related businesses into the present Vietnam Airlines Corporation. The early 1990s were a time of notable growth in the civil aviation sector of Vietnam\u2014the sector expanded by 31% in 1995 alone. In the following years, however, the 1997 Asian financial crisis brought a downturn in growth, and further challenges to the sector. ==See also== *List of airlines of Vietnam ==Notes and references== ==External links== * Civil Aviation Administration of Vietnam Vietnam Category:Government agencies of Vietnam Category:Governmental office in Hanoi Category:Civil aviation in Vietnam Category:Transport organizations based in Vietnam ",
