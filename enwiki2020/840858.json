His father was a Serbian Orthodox priest. Georgije's early education took place in Timi\u0219oara and Szeged. He lived for a time in Zrenjanin, where he began studying painting under Konstantin Danil. He later studied fine arts in Vienna and Munich but the revolution of 1848 interrupted his education, which he never finished. He took active part in the 1848 Revolution and was wounded while fighting in Srbobran. After the revolution he moved to Belgrade, Principality of Serbia, where he served as a schoolteacher, a lector in a state-owned printing office, and in various other jobs, although he was often unemployed. Jak\u0161i\u0107 lived in Skadarska Street in the center of the city's bohemian life and of Belgrade's artists, writers, musicians and actors. As a political liberal, he was persecuted by authorities. Jak\u0161i\u0107 died in 1878, having had taken part in the uprising against the Turks in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Jak\u0161i\u0107 is one of the most expressive representatives of Serbian Romanticism. According to Serbian literary critic Jovan Skerli\u0107, Jak\u0161i\u010b was influenced mainly by S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi, the great Hungarian poet of the 1848 Revolution, and Lord Byron's poetry depicting the Greek War of Independence. ==Literary works== \u0110ura Jak\u0161i\u0107 wrote about forty short stories and three full-length dramas in verse on historical themes: *Stanoje Glava\u0161 (1878) *The Migration of the Serbs (Seoba Srbalja, 1864) *Elizabeth the Montenegrin Queen (Jelisaveta kneginja crnogorska, 1868) and the novel Warriors. He also wrote poems, several of which are considered among the best of 19th-century Serbian poetry: Na Liparu (On the Lipar Hill), Put u Gornjak (The Road to Gornjak) and Mila, which is dedicated to his first love Mila, who he intended to marry but never found courage to tell her. He also drew sketches of Mila, one of which later became his famous painting \"Devojka u Plavom\" (The Girl in Blue). Other notable poems are Otad\u017ebina (Fatherland), Ve\u010de (Evening) and Pono\u0107 (Midnight). Jak\u0161i\u0107 published Pripovetke (Short Stories), which was released posthumously in two volumes on two occasions, 1882\u20131883 and 1902 in Belgrade. Through them he expressed his pessimism and bitterness about the harsh blows life and people had dealt him. A popular motif in Jak\u0161i\u0107's work is the Battle of Kosovo, Kosovo myth, eagles and Serbian epic poetry. ==Artistic opus== Jak\u0161i\u0107 painted around 200 paintings. The main influences on Jak\u0161i\u0107 were Rembrandt, Diego Vel\u00e1zquez and Peter Paul Rubens. Jak\u0161i\u0107's work varies in quality, ranging from masterpieces to half-professional paintings. According to Novak Radoni\u0107, the biggest problem with his painting is the improper use of anatomy. His most praised picture is \"The Lady in Blue\", which was used for promotion during the reopening of the National Museum of Serbia. The following paintings by \u0110ura Jak\u0161i\u0107 are part of the collection of the National Museum in Belgrade: * Autoprotrait * Battle of Montenegris * Kosovo * Night Watch (Na stra\u017ei) * Ubistvo Kara\u0111or\u0111a (The Assassination of Kara\u0111or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107) * Strahinja Ban (Strahinja Banovi\u0107) * Knez Lazar Hrebeljanovi\u0107 (Lazar of Serbia) * Girl in Blue (Devojka u plavom) * Portrait of director \u0106iri\u0107 * Car Du\u0161an (Stephen Uro\u0161 IV Du\u0161an of Serbia) * Knjaz Milan Obrenovi\u0107 IV *Nevesta Baja Pivljanina (The bride of Bajo Pivljanin) == Legacy== Jak\u0161i\u0107 is featured on the 20 new dinars banknote from the 1994 series \u0110ura Jak\u0161i\u0107 is included in The 100 most prominent Serbs.
