Learning to play guitar at the age of nine, Charles grew up mostly in Ohio learning to play folk, country and bluegrass. Although obtaining a scholarship in Musical Theater at Kent State University, Charles's interest in guitar/vocal and the recording industry led him to Indiana University (IU) where he majored in Audio Engineering.

Gaining engineering credits on independent and major label recordings, Charles also worked as a technician at notable recording studios including OmniSound and Quad Recording. Charles also designed and manufactured the Room Mic Footswitch, a device that allows musicians to control turning on a studio room mic during a recording session. In 1990, Charles auditioned for Steven Curtis Chapman's upcoming \"For The Sake Of The Call\" tour. After touring as lead guitarist and vocalist with Chapman, Charles met Chris Marion who invited Charles to team up with him and four other musicians (Danny Myrick, TJ Klay, Roger Helton, Bruce Gust) in a band later to become Step One Recording artist Western Flyer. Charles recorded two CDs with Western Flyer and left the group in June, 1996. The remaining members of Western Flyer disbanded at the end of 1996 to pursue other musical opportunities.
