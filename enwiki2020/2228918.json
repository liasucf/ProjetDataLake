Trijicon specializes in self- luminous optics and night sights, mainly using the low-energy radioactive isotope tritium, light-gathering fiber optics and battery-powered LED. Additionally, Trijicon is a contractor for the United States military and supplies the Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) and RX01 reflex sights. The ACOG, Reflex, TriPower, AccuPoint, and Night Sights are available to military, law enforcement and civilian markets. The company's name comes from combining \"tritium\", an element utilised in the company's illumination technology, and \"icon\", meaning picture or image. The \"j\" was added to combine the two words to form \"Trijicon\".Trijicon, Trijicon History ==History== Trijicon was founded in 1981 by Glyn Bindon as Armson USA, the sole US importer and distributor of the Armson OEG. The Armson OEG was an occluded- type gunsight that used tritium and fiber optics in its construction and was manufactured in South Africa. It was created in 1981 and reached shops in 1983. The gunsight became popular due to its variety of mounting systems for popular rifles and shotguns.https://www.trijicon.com/na_en/company/history.php In 1985 Bindon reorganized the company as Trijicon and began manufacture of night sights for pistols. Trijicon introduced a tritium-illuminated telescopic sight for the US Military called the TA01 4x32 Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) in 1987. == Controversy == On January 18, 2010, ABC News reported that Trijicon was placing references to Biblical verses on the side of the ACOG sights sold to the United States military. Legal and religious organizations spoke out against the practice and Trijicon subsequently ceased the practice and provided customers with kits to remove the Bible verse numbers from existing scopes. ==See also== * Aimpoint AB * EOTech * ELCAN Optical Technologies * ITL MARS == References == == External links == * * Trijicon AccuPoint, Shooting Times magazine Category:Firearm manufacturers of the United States Category:Firearm sights Category:Privately held companies based in Michigan Category:Optics manufacturing companies ",
