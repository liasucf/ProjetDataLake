Then he invited American educator John Calvin Ferguson to serve as the vice-chancellor in the second year. * In the spring of 1898, the Nanyang Public School established its own middle school, which was special due to its status and was managed by Wang Zhishan. He recruited new students from society. * In 1909, the special middle school changed into common school which is also called \"affiliated school\". It was famous that time because its students are in high academic level. * In 1920, Nanyang Public School changed into Shanghai Jiaotong University. * In 1955, some university professors, teachers and students moved to Xi'an. Xi'an Jiaotong University was officially founded in 1959. * In July, 1959, The High School Affiliated to Xi'an Jiaotong University was established. * In 1971, the high school was managed by Xi'an government and it changed name to \"Xi'an No.38 Middle School\". * In 1981, in order to inherit history, HSXJTU was rebuilt. * In 1991, HSXJTU was awarded the title of the key high school of Xi'an and Shaanxi province. * In December, 2008, it was chosen as the first batch of demonstration high school in Shaanxi. == School Mission == \u52aa\u529b\u8ffd\u6c42\u9002\u5408\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b66\u751f\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u3002 To help each student to discover their talents. \u57f9\u517b\u6709\u6db5\u517b\u3001\u6709\u8d23\u4efb\u5fc3\u3001\u6709\u521b\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u6709\u9886\u8896\u7d20\u517b\u3001\u6709\u56fd\u9645\u80f8\u6000\u7684\u54c1\u5b66\u4f53\u517c\u4f18\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u53d1\u5c55\u4eba\u624d\u3002 We aim at Nurturing whole persons with inner grace, responsibility, creativity, leadership and international outlook. ==References== Category:Schools in Xi'an Category:High schools in Shaanxi Category:Educational institutions established in 1959 Xi'an Jiaotong University ",
