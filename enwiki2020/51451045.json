She was one of the few female physicians/doctors that was known to exist in history. Before her death, she published a book titled \"Sayings of a Female Doctor\", which was passed on throughout generations. However, the romance depicted in the drama between Tan Yunxian and the two Emperors is strictly fictional. In reality, Tan Yunxian did not exist in the same time period as Zhu Qizhen and Zhu Qiyu, and naturally would not be able to work at the Zhengtong Emperor\u2019s Palace. The character in the story is actually a combination of Tan Yunxian and the historical Empress Hang. During the writing of the drama, screenwriter Zhang Wei consulted professional Chinese physicians regarding medical terminology and prescription use. Lead actress Cecilia Liu reportedly took lessons with a traditional physician to learn the basics of Chinese medicine and treatment (such as acupuncture, taking pulse and massage techniques) in preparation for the role. ==Soundtrack== ==Reception== The series received positive feedback from the audience and topped Baidu's charts of most popular TV dramas in China. It gained attention for its exquisite costumes, showcase of traditional Chinese medicine and performance of its leads. The series was also noted for featuring a well-respected female figure in China history. The series was also commercially successful, achieving an average ratings of 1.2 on both Dragon TV and Jiangsu TV and placing first in its ratings slot nationally. It was among the highest rated dramas of the year, and ranked #9 on Huading's Top 100 Satisfaction Survey for TV series. === Ratings === {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible jquery-tablesorter\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"2\" |Broadcast date ! colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"2\" |Episode ! colspan=\"3\" |Dragon TV CSM52 ratings ! colspan=\"3\" |Jiangsu TV CSM52 ratings |- !Ratings (%) !Audience share (%) !Rank !Ratings (%) !Audience share (%) !Rank |- |2016.2.13 |1-2 |0.893 |2.359 |3 |0.782 |2.068 |5 |- |2016.2.14 |3 |0.918 |2.435 |4 |0.646 |1.714 |10 |- |2016.2.15 |4-5 |1.03 |2.666 |4 |0.844 |2.19 |7 |- |2016.2.16 |6-7 |0.978 |2.56 |4 |0.902 |2.37 |5 |- |2016.2.17 |8-9 |0.992 |2.55 |3 |0.912 |2.35 |5 |- |2016.2.18 |10-11 |0.988 |2.58 |4 |0.956 |2.5 |5 |- |2016.2.19 |12-13 |0.98 |2.495 |2 |0.895 |2.285 |4 |- |2016.2.20 |14-15 |1.127 |2.96 |2 |0.881 |2.32 |4 |- |2016.2.21 |16-17 |1.122 |2.86 |2 |1.038 |2.65 |4 |- |2016.2.22 |18-19 |1.09 |2.745 |1 |1.029 |2.596 |4 |- |2016.2.23 |20-21 |1.309 |3.416 |1 |1.152 |3.014 |2 |- |2016.2.24 |22-23 |1.279 |3.4 |1 |1.228 |3.28 |2 |- |2016.2.25 |24-25 |1.158 |3.079 |2 |1.204 |3.206 |1 |- |2016.2.26 |26-27 |1.205 |3.116 |2 |1.244 |3.227 |1 |- |2016.2.27 |28-29 |1.192 |3.169 |1 |1.163 |3.104 |3 |- |2016.2.28 |30-31 |1.36 |3.539 |1 |1.32 |3.441 |2 |- |2016.2.29 |32-33 |1.450 |3.92 |1 |1.333 |3.593 |2 |- |2016.3.1 |34-35 |1.540 |4.188 |1 |1.260 |3.434 |2 |- |2016.3.2 |36-37 |1.590 |4.237 |1 |1.395 |3.725 |2 |- |2016.3.3 |38-39 |1.530 |4.134 |1 |1.260 |3.400 |2 |- |2016.3.4 |40-41 |1.466 |3.791 |2 |1.478 |3.832 |1 |- |2016.3.5 |42-43 |1.521 |3.926 |1 |1.471 |3.796 |2 |- |2016.3.6 |44 |1.481 |3.935 |1 |1.306 |3.465 |2 |- |2016.3.7 |45-46 |1.725 |4.52 |1 |1.406 |3.69 |2 |- |2016.3.8 |47-48 |1.792 |4.729 |1 |1.527 |4.056 |2 |- |2016.3.9 |49-50 |2.007 |5.118 |1 |1.706 |4.375 |2 |- ! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"1\" |Average ratings !1.296 !3.39 !- !1.175 !3.08 !- |} * Highest ratings are marked in red, lowest ratings are marked in blue ===Awards and nominations=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
