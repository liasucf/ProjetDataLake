It is named after David Hare, founder of Hare School. ==History== The Professor of Surgery at medical college had no separate surgical wards and had a single OT at the MCH building. At the instance of Principal G. Bomford and Surgeon Richard Havelock Charles, the building of a modern surgical hospital was undertaken. In 1910, the Prince of Wales Hospital was opened with 88 beds. The total cost of building the hospital was Rs 10,17,585/- and was so named to commemorate the visit of the Prince of Wales to India. It was formally inaugurated on 22 March 1911 by H.E. Lady Hardinge. In 1976, the Prince of Wales Hospital was renamed the David Hare Block (to pay tribute to the noted philanthropist and only nonmedical Principal of Medical College, on his bicentennial birth celebration.) and a new floor has been constructed. It now houses the surgery and cardiothoracic surgery departments. ==Departments== The original building, with the old name \"Prince of Wales Hospital *Department of General Surgery (most of the wards) *Department of Radiodiagnosis *Department of Radiotherapy *Department of Vascular and Cardiothoracic Surgery *Office of Superintendent of Medical College Kolkata ==References== == External links == * Medical College Bengal \u2014 A Pioneer Over the Eras Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1911 Category:Hospitals in Kolkata Category:Hospitals established in 1910 Category:Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata Category:1911 establishments in India ",
