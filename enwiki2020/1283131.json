    "text": "Yugh (Yug) is a Yeniseian language, closely related to Ket, formerly spoken by the Yugh people, one of the southern groups along the Yenisei River in central Siberia. It was once regarded as a dialect of the Ket language, which was considered to be a language isolate, and was therefore called Sym Ket or Southern Ket; however, the Ket considered it to be a distinct language. By the early 1990s there were only two or three non-fluent speakers remaining, and the language was virtually extinct. In the 2010 census only one ethnic Yugh was counted.2010 census data ==Notes== ==References== *Vajda, Edward J., Yeniseian Peoples and Languages : A History of Yeniseian Studies with an Annotated Bibliography and a Source Guide, Curzon Press: 2002 . ==External links== * Yugh basic lexicon at the Global Lexicostatistical Database Category:Extinct languages of Asia Category:Languages of Russia Category:Yeniseian languages Category:Languages extinct in the 20th century ",
