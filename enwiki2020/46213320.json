His books have won many prestigious prizes. ==Biography== Born in Fife in 1975, Francis studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and joined the Emergency department at the old Royal Edinburgh Hospital. Having qualified as a physician, Francis spent ten years travelling on all seven continents. Francis spent time working in India and Africa, made several trips to the Arctic, and is said to have crossed Eurasia and Australasia by motorcycle. Francis was working at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh when he decided to undertake a 15-month position as the resident doctor with the British Antarctic Survey. He arrived at the Halley Research Station in Antarctica via the RRS Ernest Shackleton, a supply ship, on Christmas Eve, 2002, after a two-month voyage. ==Writings== Francis's experiences eventually formed the basis for his second book, Empire Antarctica (2012); his first book, True North: Travels in Arctic Europe (2008), detailed his experiences travelling in Arctic Europe from Unst to Svalbard. His Adventures in Human Being (2015) won the Saltire Society Literary Award for non-fiction and was a British Medical Association (BMA) book of the year.London Review of Books, Vol. 39 No. 21 (2 November 2017), pp. 21\u201322 Retrieved 26 October 2017. Empire Antarctica was a shortlisted finalist for a number of book awards in 2013, including the Ondaatje Prize and the Saltire Prize, but received its most notable honour in November 2013 at the Lennoxlove Book Festival when it was named the 2013 Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust's Scottish Book of the Year. Francis has been contributing articles and reviews to The Guardian since 2010, the London Review of Books, and the New York Review of Books since 2013. In addition to book reviews, his contributions occasionally consisted of prose ruminations on medical topics such as stethoscopes and the human brain, an approach that led to his being commissioned by the Wellcome Trust to produce a collection of essays in this style. ==Bibliography== ===Books=== *Adventures in Human Being (Profile Books 2015). *Empire Antarctica: Ice, Silence & Emperor Penguins (Chatto & Windus 2012). *True North: Travels in Arctic Europe (Polygon 2008, 2010). ===Translations=== *Empire Antarctica: Eis, Totenstille & Kaiserpinguine (DuMont 2013). .
