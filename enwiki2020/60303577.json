    "text": "K\u00e2tip \u00c7elebi, or Haji Khalifa, is celebrated in the countries of the Islamic East as the author of the Ka\u015ff az-Zun\u016bn (The Removal of Doubt from the Names of Books and the Arts). This bibliographic encyclopedia of books and sciences was based on the Mift\u0101\u1e25 al-Sa\u02bf\u0101da wa-mi\u1e63b\u0101\u1e25 al-Siy\u0101dah by the c.16th Ottoman historian, Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fczade. However the Ka\u015ff substantially enlarges it, cataloging titles of about 15,000 book, about 9,500 names of authors, and about 300 sciences and arts. At the age of twenty-five in 1633 while in Aleppo he began compiling and composing the work that occupied him for the next twenty years, until its completion in 1652. An account of this is contained in his book \"Mizan al-Haq\", where he writes: \"On my stay in Aleppo, I would visit bookshops to browse, and then when I had returned to Istanbul and came into some money, I began acquiring books and letters. In 1638, a relative died and left me a more substantial legacy, which was spent in large part collecting the great works which I had seen in Aleppo, Istanbul and in the public repositories of the Sultanate of Oman\". ==Contents== *Vol.1.
