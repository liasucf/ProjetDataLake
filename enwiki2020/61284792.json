    "text": "Hell Is Real Derby, also known as the Ohio Derby, is a rivalry between the two Major League Soccer (MLS) clubs based in Ohio: Columbus Crew SC and FC Cincinnati. Under current MLS regular season scheduling, the series occurs twice per season as both teams are members of the Eastern Conference. ==Background== On June 15, 1994, MLS announced that Columbus would be home to one of the ten founding members of the new top-flight North American professional soccer league. Cincinnati joined the league in 2019 as an expansion team under the same name as their United Soccer League club, which had started play in 2016, thus creating the first top-flight derby in Ohio. Two weeks after the Cincinnati expansion announcement, the clubs met for the first time with lower-league Cincinnati winning 1\u20130 in the U.S. Open Cup. In October 2017, Columbus Crew owner Anthony Precourt threatened to move the team to Austin, Texas, putting the prospect of an MLS rivalry between the two Ohio teams in jeopardy. Precourt's proposed relocation sparked outrage in the American soccer community, creating the #SaveTheCrew movement. After a year of support by fans, rival teams, local businesses, and politicians, the Crew committed to staying in Columbus in November 2018, when the Haslam family (owners of the NFL's Cleveland Browns, which had been the subject of an even more controversial relocation in the 1990s) purchased the club. ==History== Alex Crognale of Columbus and Baye Djiby Fall of Cincinnati battle for a header in the 2017 U.S. Open Cup. The two teams met for the first time in the fourth round of the 2017 U.S. Open Cup, while FC Cincinnati was still a member of the United Soccer League. Cincinnati won the match 1\u20130 on a goal from Djiby, knocking Columbus out of the tournament and advancing to the quarterfinals. On August 10, 2019, the two sides played against each other in MLS league play for the first time, ending in a 2\u20132 draw at Mapfre Stadium. Columbus earned their first win of the series in that season's reverse fixture with a 3\u20131 victory. ==Moniker== The derby's name was inspired by a sign erected along the section of Interstate 71 that connects Columbus and Cincinnati. The derby's name was created by fans of both teams in 2017, prior to the first competitive meeting in the U.S. Open Cup. It is derived from a religious sign that reads \"Hell Is Real\" and is located on Interstate 71, which connects Columbus and Cincinnati\u2013a distance of . The sign was installed in 2004 on a local farm in Chenoweth by a Kentucky developer who had installed similar religious signs in other states. ==Match results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%\" |- !width=15|No. !width=90|Date !width=100|Competition !width=200|Venue !width=110|Home team !width=25|Score !width=110|Away team !width=15|Attendance |- |1. | |U.S. Open Cup |Nippert Stadium |FC Cincinnati |style=\"text-align:center; background:#FE5000;\"| 1\u20130 |Columbus Crew SC |30,160 |- |2. | |rowspan=2|MLS |Mapfre Stadium |Columbus Crew SC |style=\"text-align:center; background:#DDDDDD;\"| 2\u20132 |FC Cincinnati |20,865 |- |3. | |Nippert Stadium |FC Cincinnati |style=\"text-align:center; background:#fff200;\"| 1\u20133 |Columbus Crew SC |30,611 |- |4. |nobreak|July 11, 2020 |MLS is Back\u2021 |ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex |FC Cincinnati |style=\"text-align:center; background:#fff200;\"| 0\u20134 |Columbus Crew SC |0\u2020 |- |5. |August 29, 2020 |rowspan=3|MLS |Nippert Stadium |FC Cincinnati |style=\"text-align:center; background:#DDDDDD;\"| 0\u20130 |Columbus Crew SC |0\u2020 |- |6. |September 6, 2020 |Mapfre Stadium |Columbus Crew SC |style=\"text- align:center; background:#fff200;\"| 3\u20130 |FC Cincinnati |1,500\u2020 |- |7. |October 14, 2020 |Nippert Stadium |FC Cincinnati |style=\"text-align:center; background:#FE5000;\"| 2\u20131 |Columbus Crew SC |0\u2020 |} \u2020 Matches played behind closed doors or reduced capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \u2021 Although the match was part of the MLS is Back Tournament, group stage matches count toward regular season MLS statistics. == Statistics == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !
