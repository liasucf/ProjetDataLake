The dance actually took place under the bridge and not on the bridge (, not sur).http://www.rvcampingeurope.com/avignon.html == Dance description == # It starts out with everyone in pairs and they dance around each other. # When the chorus is done stop in front of your partner and traditionally the male will bow on the first part then tip his hat on the second. # When the chorus begins again repeat step one. # When this stops so does the dance and then the girl curtsies to one side then the other. # For the first part, repeat step one and then if you have an audience turn on your heel and bow to them. == Lyrics == === Chorus === Sur le Pont d'Avignon L'on y danse, l'on y danse Sur le Pont d'Avignon L'on y danse tous en rond.
