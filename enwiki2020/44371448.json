    "text": "Aparviz was an Iranian aristocrat, who served as the marzban (general of a frontier province, \"margrave\") of Sakastan in the 7th-century. He is first mentioned in 650/1 during the Arab invasion of Iran, where is mentioned as surrendering to the Rashidun Arabs; when he consulted the Arab military officer Rabi ibn Ziyad Harithi, the latter was using the bodies of two dead soldiers as a chair. This horrified Aparviz, who in order to save the inhabitants of Sakastan, made peace with the Arabs in return for heavy tribute. Two years later, the inhabitants of Sakastan rebelled against the Arabs, however, no mention of Aparviz is made. ==Sources== * * * * Category:Generals of Yazdegerd III Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:Sasanian governors of Sakastan Category:7th-century Iranian people ",
