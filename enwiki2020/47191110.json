    "text": "\"Roses\" is a song by American DJ duo the Chainsmokers. It was released on June 16, 2015 as the second single from their debut EP, Bouquet (2015). The song features vocals from American singer Rozes. It was written by Andrew Taggart and Elizabeth Mencel and produced by the Chainsmokers. ==Background== In an interview with Mike Wass of Idolator, the Chainsmokers said, \"We always felt the song was special. When you want to listen to it again and again after you\u2019ve made the song, you know you\u2019ve got something. You\u2019ve really got to put it out and let the public try to decide what it is and what it isn\u2019t. When we put the song out, it was an overwhelmingly positive response. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a hit but we knew that it was a special song. I think that it definitely has a Chainsmokers feel to it, but there\u2019s a lot of influences (Taylor Swift, Max Martin) in the production. But I think that\u2019s what\u2019s cool about it and why people are enjoying it because it doesn\u2019t feel and sound like everything that\u2019s on the radio right now. But it\u2019s catchy and accessible. I think it\u2019s refreshing.\" ==Composition== \"Roses\" is written in the key of E major with a tempo of 100 beats per minute in common time. The song alternates between the chords E and E, and the vocals span from B3 to B4. ==Music video== The music video for the song was released to YouTube on August 7, 2015. The video opens with a woman closing the shop she works in for the day, while a man is seen arriving on a plane and leaving the airport. They meet and spend the night watching an old film and smoking on her couch, however in the morning he leaves while she is still asleep. She is upset to see the man has gone and that night searches for him, while he is seen driving his car around the city. She is crying on a street when he sees her and stops his car, and they are reunited and embrace. They return to her couch and the video ends with them kissing. Throughout the video the woman can also be seen dancing in a dark, misty room with two spotlights, and after the couple are reunited, rose petals fall through the air as she dances through them. ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (2015\u201317) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Denmark (Tracklisten) | 29 |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Latvia (Latvijas Top 40) | 5 |- !scope=\"row\"| Lebanon (Lebanese Top 20) | 9 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot Dance/Electronic Songs (Billboard) | 25 |} {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
