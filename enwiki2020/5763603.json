His Dakota (registration VT-CLA) was shot down by a Dutch Kittyhawk when landing in Maguwo Airfield (now Adisucipto International Airport), Sleman Regency, Yogyakarta. The same plane carried Adisucipto and Adi Sumarmo (also national heroes of Indonesia). == Recognition == The medical faculty of the University of Indonesia honored him as Indonesia's father of Physiology. The annual Medical and General Biology Competition is called the Abdulrahman Saleh trophy. In 2000, based on Indonesian Air Force initiative and family approval, his grave was relocated to Ngoto, near the crash site. Many friends and supporters came to lay him to rest and thanked him for his service. The new grave is part of the Indonesian Air Force's Monument Perjuangan Ngoto, together with the graves of Mrs. Ismudiati Abdulrahman Saleh, Agustinus Adisucipto, and Mrs. Adisucipto. In honour of his service, the Indonesian Air Force has named the Abdulrahman Saleh Air Force Base in Malang, East Java after him. This Air Force Base is also serving civil aviation for the city. == References == Category:1909 births Category:1947 deaths Category:National Heroes of Indonesia Category:Indonesian physiologists Category:Indonesian aviators Category:People from Batavia, Dutch East Indies Category:20th-century physicians Category:Aviators killed by being shot down ",
