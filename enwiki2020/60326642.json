    "text": "Camille Hoffman is a painter and mixed-media installation artist, living and working in New York, NY. Using everyday materials and drawing from Philippine weaving and Jewish folk traditions, Hoffman combines personal narrative and historical critique. Hoffman's work reflects on the embedded meanings of light, nature, the frontier, borders, race, gender and power in American landscape paintings of the 19th century. Hoffman has worked as an arts educator and community organizer in Phoenix, the San Francisco Bay Area, New Haven, Brooklyn, and Queens. == Early life and education == Camille Hoffman was born in Chicago, IL in 1987. She earned her BFA in Community Arts and Painting from the California College of the Arts in 2009. She received her MFA in Painting and Printmaking from the Yale School of Art in 2015, during which she received the Carol Schlosberg Memorial Prize for excellence in painting and a Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship for research in Spain. == Art == Camille Hoffman's work examines colonial histories, consumerism, and play. Her paintings and installations layer traditional art materials with textures and objects from the everyday. Hoffman's landscape works are a mixed- media meditation on Manifest Destiny and its representation in the romantic American landscape. She reflects on the enclosed meanings found in light, nature, the frontier, borders, race, gender and power in the 19th century American landscape paintings. Taking inspiration from her ancestors' Philippine weaving techniques and Jewish folk traditions, with the addition of traditional landscape painting techniques from her academic training, Hoffman integrates refuse into the image, to reveal trans-cultural contradictions. These works incorporate holiday-themed tablecloths, discarded medical records, nature calendars, plastic bags, paint, and other materials to make imaginary landscapes grounded in accumulation, personal narrative and history. Hoffman has been the recipient of numerous honors, including a National Endowment for the Arts Award and the Van Lier Fellowship from the Museum of Arts and Design. == Exhibits == Hoffman has exhibited her work throughout the United States and in Europe. === Solo exhibitions === 2005\\.
