    "text": "Broughton Park RUFC, is one of the oldest rugby union clubs in England and was established in 1882, just one year after the Lancashire County Rugby Football Union was founded and eleven years after the formation of the national Rugby Football Union. The first XV plays in North 1 West, a sixth level league in the English league system following their promotion as champions of South Lancs/Cheshire 1 at the end of the 2017-18 season. ==History== Broughton Park was established in 1882 and despite this early beginning was the third Broughton based rugby club, after Broughton RUFC (1862) and Broughton Rangers (1877). The club was overshadowed in terms of international representation by its two neighbours for the first decade of its existence. In 1919, just after the First World War, it started to make a mark on the national scene with A M Crook becoming both the Lancashire Union president and also being elected to the presidency of the Rugby Football Union. J E Kidd was elected Lancashire president in 1930 and it was not until the 1960s that Broughton once again came to the fore. The glory days of the club were in the 1960s and 1970s and at one point they fielded four internationals on the pitch.NOWIRUL(E) TIMES ISSUE NO. 1 In this period they also had two more Lancashire presidents and in 1981 in John Burgess they had a president of the Rugby Football Union. Broughton Park were never able to recapture the heights of this period, and in the professional era have not managed to reach the top flight. ==Club honours== *Courage National Division 4 North champions: 1989\u201390 *South Lancs/Cheshire 1 champions (2): 2005\u201306, 2017\u201318 *North Lancashire/Cumbria v South Lancs/Cheshire 1 promotion playoff winners: 2012\u201313 ==Ground== The club has had a number of different grounds in its time, mainly in the Salford/Prestwich areas, but also in the south of Manchester.
