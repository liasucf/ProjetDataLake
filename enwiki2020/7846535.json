This was Tajikistan's first time participating in a Winter Olympic Games. The country sent one representative, alpine skier Andrey Drygin. He failed to finish either of his events. ==Background== The National Olympic Committee of the Republic of Tajikistan (NOC) was first recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1993, and Tajikistan made its Olympic debut at the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympics. The nation was making its Winter Olympic Games debut in these Salt Lake City Games. The country sent one representative, alpine skier Andrey Drygin. Gafar Mirzoyev, the president of the NOC, was selected as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony. ==Alpine skiing== Andrey Drygin was 24 years old at the time of the Salt Lake City Olympics. In the super-G held on 16 February, he failed to finish the single run race. On 21 February, in the giant slalom, he finished the first run in a time of 1 minute and 22.01 seconds, which put him in a tie for 68th place. However, he failed to complete the second run, and therefore unclassified for the event. Drygin would later go on to represent Tajikistan twice more, at the 2006 Winter Olympics and the 2010 Winter Olympics. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Run 1 !colspan=\"2\"|Run 2 !colspan=\"3\"|Final/Total |- !Time !Rank !Time !Rank !Time !Diff !Rank |-align=\"center\" |align=\"left\" rowspan=2|Andrey Drygin |align=\"left\" |Super-G |colspan=4 |colspan=3|Did not finish |- |align=\"left\" |Giant slalom |1:22.01 |68 |Did not finish | |colspan=3 align=center|Did not finish |} ==References== Category:Nations at the 2002 Winter Olympics 2002 Category:2002 in Tajikistani sport ",
