    "text": "The Graz International Bilingual School (GIBS) is an Austrian bilingual (English/German)university preparatory semi-independent charter school Gymnasium in Graz, Austria. == School profile == GIBS is a bilingual (German- English) university preparatory charter school. At present the school comprises more than 800 students and 60 teaching staff. The rest of the team is made up of the language assistants, trainee teachers and other administrative staff. The language of instruction is English in the form of \"flexible monolingualism\". The first three months of Year 1 take the form of an intensive phase of language acquisition after which the students have reached a level of language competence which enables them to participate in lessons conducted in the target language. Following the intensive phase, linguistic back-up for other subjects is provided when required in the English class. In Year 7 History is taught in French. During the first five school years in particular, different subjects collaborate on broad projects that supplement language instruction. Between Year 6 and Year 8, the upper level course system ensures the interconnection and deepening of learning material, and also allows the students to dive deeper into their interests that they wish to pursue in their later professional life. Students from non-German speaking countries receive instruction in German as a foreign language. Their evaluation is in accordance to \u00a7 18/12 of the School Instruction Guidelines which allows students to select either German or English as their first language of instruction and be thereby assessed accordingly.https://web.archive.org/web/20090310183418/http://www.gibs.at/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task;=blogcategory&id;=8&Itemid;=47 The school has a reputation for academic excellence and a strong participation in national awards and organizations. Upon graduation, virtually 100% of students enroll in a 4-year degree program. GIBS graduates have attended Harvard College, Imperial College London, Cornell University, King's College London, London School of Economics, Oxford University, Maastricht University, ETH Z\u00fcrich and the University of St. Gallen, among others. The level of education is similar to the normal equivalent of the Austrian school system, but allows room for further study in the individual's field of interest through the upper school course system. Language proficiency in at least one foreign language is a graduation requirement, and three foreign languages (English, French, Spanish, Russian, Latin, or German as a Foreign Language) must be taken for 8 (English), 6 (French or Spanish) or 4 (Latin or Russian) years respectively. == Campus == The school campus is located in the North Western part of Graz in Eggenberg, neighbouring the historic palace Schloss Eggenberg and the private school of the Grazer Schulschwestern. The main building to which the school relocated in 2010 was built in 1964 after the designs of G\u00fcnther Domenig and Eilfried Huth. This building houses, among others, the biology lab, three computer science labs, the library, the gym and changing rooms, music and art rooms, practise rooms, the administration and conference rooms, and most classrooms. Furthermore, the Northern Wing offers after-school facilities and the cafeteria for those participating in ACE, additionally to the main office and storage rooms. Study corners can be found throughout the school. The underground parking garage is directly accessible from the main building. The new wing, built in 2010, is home to the classrooms of the graduating class, the chemistry and physics labs and the visual arts room. == Sport facilities == Additionally to the school gym, the neighbouring ASK\u00d6 sport centre and Auster Bad provide gyms, volleyball courts, tennis courts, basketball courts, soccer and baseball fields, running tracks and indoor/outdoor swimming pools, which are used regularly by the students for school and extracurricular activities. == Admissions == GIBS is, in theory, a public state school but there are entrance limitations. These are largely a result of the number of applicants that apply because of the very prestigious reputation of the school. In the past few years, GIBS has been getting nearly four times as many applications from new students than it can accept. In order to be accepted to GIBS a student's elementary school report card must consist mainly of \"Sehr Gut\" or \"A\" grades (90% or over in all classes), and the student must complete an entrance test and interview together with other applying students. Students with a bilingual background will be given higher priority, and have to complete an individual interview. == Course system == The school offers a Course System for Years 6-8. While upholding the principle of an all-round education fundamental to the Austrian school system, the course system allows students more freedom to pursue their particular interests and in-depth study. Students can select courses which are useful for their proposed academic and professional careers. == Student, parent and teacher Involvement == The school encourages strong student and parent involvement, whether this be concerning outings or schoolwork. Alongside the class representatives (two per class, e.g. 4 or 6 per grade), which are elected for a yearly term and deal with issues directly in the student body, the SGA (Schulgemeinschaftsausschuss) is the main decision-making body of the school. It is composed of the principal or administrator as a chairperson (depending on availability and does not have a vote), three parent representatives, three staff representatives, and the three student-body presidents. All are elected at the beginning of the year by the respective groups. A majority vote of two votes per party is needed for any decision to be passed. Furthermore, the Parent-Teacher-Association is involved in many issues concerning the school from school funding to course decisions and social events. On a social level, the PTA and the student-body organize frequent social events during the year. The Graduation Ball that is organized by the graduating class is held in high regard throughout the city, often having more than 3,000 visitors. Other events include the annual Jazzbrunch, the Talent Show, the Graduation Awards Ceremony, the Halloween and Carnival Parties, the Christmas Performance and frequent Drama Club performances. == Departments == Pool 1- Languages English German French Spanish Latin Russian Pool 2- Sciences Biology Chemistry Physics Mathematics Pool 3- Humanities History, Politics and Social Studies Geography and Economics Psychology Philosophy Pool 4- Other Religious Education Music Arts Computing Descriptive Geometry Physical Education == Extracurricular qualifications == DELE - Diplomas de Espa\u00f1ol como Lengua Extranjera DELF - Dipl\u00f4me d`\u00e9tudes de langue fran\u00e7ais EBCL - European Business Competence Licence ECDL - European Computer Driving Licence IELTS \u2013 International English Language Testing System == Awards == P\u00e4dagogischer Panther 2000 Europ\u00e4isches Siegel f\u00fcr innovativen Sprachunterricht 2000 AK Schulpreis 2003/2004 f\u00fcr Kurssystem Euroscola Strasbourg 2004, 2007, 2009, 2010 European Youth Parliament 2004, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 School Award 2004 \"Auf den Spuren des steirischen Panthers\" von Roland Berger, 2009 Eurolingua, 3xGold, 3xSilber, 2xBronze, 2010 Eurolingua 2011 Schulhomepage Award 2007 UNESCO ASPnet School since 2007 SPIN Seal of Excellence 2006 Ranked best School in Austria in the Oesterreich Schulwahl 2006http://www.oe24.at/zeitung/oesterreich/article43320.ece == Other == ACE- After School Care & Education DaF/DaZ- German as a Foreign Language (Beginners, Intermediate and Advanced) Choir English Drama European Youth Parliament Prix des lyc\u00e9ens autrichiens Eurolingua == References == == External links == *Official Graz International Bilingual School website German Category:Bilingual schools Category:International schools in Austria Category:Schools in Graz Category:Educational institutions established in 1991 ",
