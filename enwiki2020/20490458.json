    "text": "The b\u01ce construction is a grammatical construction in the Chinese language. In a b\u01ce construction, the object of a verb is placed after the function word (or, in more formal writing, ), and the verb placed after the object, forming a subject\u2013object\u2013verb (SOV) sentence.Zheng Ye, Weidong Zhan, Xiaolin Zhou (2007). \"The semantic processing of syntactic structure in sentence comprehension: An ERP study.\" Brain Research 1142, pp. 135-145. Linguists commonly analyze b\u01ce as a light verb construction,Hornstein, Norbert, Jairo Nunes, and Kleanthes K. Grohmann (2005). Understanding Minimalism. New York: Cambridge University Press. pp. 99-100. or as a preposition. ==Formation== Charles Li and Sandra Thompson (1981) offer the following examples of the b\u01ce construction:Li & Thompson (1981), pp. 463-464\\. The glosses have been modified to be legible to non-specialists. \"CRS\" stands for Current Relevant State, a special discourse feature possibly marked by the sentence-final particle in Chinese; \"CL\" stands for \"Classifier,\" a kind of word used for counting in Chinese. {| |- | || [subject] || _[b\u01ce]_ || _[direct object]_ || [verb] |- | || || || || |- | width=100px|Transcription || width=75px|n\u012d || width=75px|b\u0103 || width=170px|t\u0101-de y\u00ecsi || ji\u0103ng-ch\u016b-l\u00e1i le |- | Gloss || you || BA || he-POSSESSIVE meaning || speak-out-come CRS |- | Translation ||colspan=5|You have explained what he meant.

Friederici, and Xiaolin Zhou (2006). \"Semantic and syntactic processing in Chinese sentence comprehension: Evidence from event-related potentials.\" Brain Research 1071, pp. 186-196. According to Wang Li, \"the disposal form states how a person is handled, manipulated, or dealt with; how something is disposed of; or how an affair is conducted,\"Wang Li (1947). (Modern Chinese Grammar). Shanghai: Zhonghua Shuju. Translation by Charles Li (1974), \"Historical Change of Word Order: A Case Study in Chinese and Its Implications.\" Quoted in Li & Thompson (1981). or, in other words, \"what happens to\" the object. Therefore, it is generally used with verbs that are high in transitivity, a property that describes the effect a verb has on its object; b\u01ce does not occur grammatically with verbs that express states or emotions, such as \"love\" and \"miss,\" or with verbs that express activities that have no effect on the direct object, such as \"sing\" and \"see.\"Li & Thompson (1981), p. 467. The direct object of a b\u01ce construction must meet certain requirements as well. It is usually definite, meaning that it is specific and unique (as in phrases beginning with the equivalent of this, that, these, or those). It may sometimes also be generic, such as \"salt\" in the sentence \"She sometimes eats salt thinking it's sugar.\"Li & Thompson (1981). p. 465. The object of a b\u01ce construction is nearly always something that both the speaker and hearer know about and are aware of. ==Research== Because of the numerous constraints on the kinds of words that may be used in b\u01ce construction, this construction has often been used in studies on language processing and on grammaticality judgments of native speakers. For example, sentences with b\u01ce construction that have syntactic violations (such as b\u01ce being followed by a verb rather than a noun) and semantic violations (such as b\u01ce being followed by a verb that doesn't express \"disposal\") have been used to study the interaction of syntactic and semantic processing in the brain using the neuroimaging technique of ERP, and to evaluate construction grammar's model of meaning-building. ==Notes== ==References== *Chao Yuen Ren (1968).
