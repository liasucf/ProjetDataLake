    "text": "Lists of mathematics topics cover a variety of topics related to mathematics. Some of these lists link to hundreds of articles; some link only to a few. The template to the right includes links to alphabetical lists of all mathematical articles. This article brings together the same content organized in a manner better suited for browsing. Lists cover aspects of basic and advanced mathematics, methodology, mathematical statements, integrals, general concepts, mathematical objects, integrals and reference tables. They also cover equations named after people, societies, mathematicians, journals and meta-lists. The purpose of this list is not similar to that of the Mathematics Subject Classification formulated by the American Mathematical Society. Many mathematics journals ask authors of research papers and expository articles to list subject codes from the Mathematics Subject Classification in their papers. The subject codes so listed are used by the two major reviewing databases, Mathematical Reviews and Zentralblatt MATH. This list has some items that would not fit in such a classification, such as list of exponential topics and list of factorial and binomial topics, which may surprise the reader with the diversity of their coverage. ==Basic mathematics== This branch is typically taught in secondary education or in the first year of university. * Outline of discrete mathematics * List of calculus topics * List of geometry topics ** Outline of geometry ** List of trigonometry topics *** Outline of trigonometry *** List of trigonometric identities * List of topics in logic ==Areas of advanced mathematics== See also Areas of mathematics and Glossary of areas of mathematics. As a rough guide this list is divided into pure and applied sections although in reality these branches are overlapping and intertwined. ===Pure mathematics=== ====Algebra==== Algebra includes the study of algebraic structures, which are sets and operations defined on these sets satisfying certain axioms. The field of algebra is further divided according to which structure is studied; for instance, group theory concerns an algebraic structure called group. * Outline of algebra * List of abstract algebra topics * List of algebraic structures * List of Boolean algebra topics * List of category theory topics * List of commutative algebra topics * List of homological algebra topics * List of group theory topics * List of representation theory topics * List of linear algebra topics * List of reciprocity laws * Glossary of field theory * Glossary of group theory * Glossary of linear algebra * Glossary of ring theory * List of cohomology theories ====Calculus and analysis==== Fourier series approximation of square wave in five steps.

Each touches its neighbors without crossing. Geometry is initially the study of spatial figures like circles and cubes, though it has been generalized considerably. Topology developed from geometry; it looks at those properties that do not change even when the figures are deformed by stretching and bending, like dimension. * List of geometry topics * List of geometric shapes * List of curves topics * List of triangle topics * List of circle topics ** List of topics related to pi * List of general topology topics * List of differential geometry topics * List of algebraic geometry topics ** List of algebraic surfaces * List of algebraic topology topics ** List of cohomology theories * List of geometric topology topics * List of knot theory topics *List of topology topics * List of Lie group topics * Glossary of differential geometry and topology * Glossary of general topology * List of mathematical properties of points * Glossary of Riemannian and metric geometry * Glossary of scheme theory ====Combinatorics==== Combinatorics concerns the study of discrete (and usually finite) objects. Aspects include \"counting\" the objects satisfying certain criteria (enumerative combinatorics), deciding when the criteria can be met, and constructing and analyzing objects meeting the criteria (as in combinatorial designs and matroid theory), finding \"largest\", \"smallest\", or \"optimal\" objects (extremal combinatorics and combinatorial optimization), and finding algebraic structures these objects may have (algebraic combinatorics). * Outline of combinatorics * List of graph theory topics * Glossary of graph theory ====Logic==== Venn diagrams are illustrations of set theoretical, mathematical or logical relationships. Logic is the foundation which underlies mathematical logic and the rest of mathematics. It tries to formalize valid reasoning. In particular, it attempts to define what constitutes a proof. * List of Boolean algebra topics * List of first-order theories * List of large cardinal properties * List of mathematical logic topics * Glossary of order theory * List of set theory topics ====Number theory==== The branch of mathematics that deals with the properties and relationships of numbers, especially the positive integers. Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics devoted primarily to the study of the integers and integer-valued functions. German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss said, \"Mathematics is the queen of the sciences\u2014and number theory is the queen of mathematics.\" Number theory also studies the natural, or whole, numbers. One of the central concepts in number theory is that of the prime number, and there are many questions about primes that appear simple but whose resolution continues to elude mathematicians. * List of algebraic number theory topics * List of number theory topics * List of recreational number theory topics * Glossary of arithmetic and Diophantine geometry * List of prime numbers--not just a table, but a list of various kinds of prime numbers (each with an accompanying table) * List of zeta functions ===Applied mathematics=== ====Dynamical systems and differential equations==== Phase portrait of a continuous-time dynamical system, the Van der Pol oscillator. A differential equation is an equation involving an unknown function and its derivatives. In a dynamical system, a fixed rule describes the time dependence of a point in a geometrical space. The mathematical models used to describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, or the number of fish each spring in a lake are examples of dynamical systems. * List of dynamical systems and differential equations topics * List of partial differential equation topics * List of nonlinear partial differential equations ====Mathematical physics==== Mathematical physics is concerned with \"the application of mathematics to problems in physics and the development of mathematical methods suitable for such applications and for the formulation of physical theories\". * List of mathematical topics in classical mechanics * List of mathematical topics in quantum theory * List of mathematical topics in relativity * List of string theory topics * Index of wave articles ====Theory of computation==== Ray tracing is a process based on computational mathematics.

Historically, information theory was developed to find fundamental limits on compressing and reliably communicating data. Signal processing is the analysis, interpretation, and manipulation of signals. Signals of interest include sound, images, biological signals such as ECG, radar signals, and many others. Processing of such signals includes filtering, storage and reconstruction, separation of information from noise, compression, and feature extraction. * List of information theory topics * List of algebraic coding theory topics * List of cryptography topics ====Probability and statistics==== The \"bell curve\"\u2014the probability density function of the normal distribution. Probability theory is the formalization and study of the mathematics of uncertain events or knowledge. The related field of mathematical statistics develops statistical theory with mathematics. Statistics, the science concerned with collecting and analyzing data, is an autonomous discipline (and not a subdiscipline of applied mathematics). * List of probability topics * List of stochastic processes topics * List of probability distributions * Catalog of articles in probability theory * List of statistics topics * Outline of regression analysis ====Game theory==== Game theory is a branch of mathematics that uses models to study interactions with formalized incentive structures (\"games\").
