At the end of the pageant Mary Jean Lastimosa (Miss Universe 2014 - Top 10 Finalist) crowned Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach as Miss Universe Philippines 2015 while Bianca Guidotti (Binibining Pilipinas International 2014) crowned Janicel Jaranilla Lubina as Binibining Pilipinas International 2015. The pageant also awarded three other titles to participate in minor international beauty pageants in which Kris Tiffany Janson (Miss Intercontinental 2014 2nd Runner- up) crowned Christi Lynn Landrito McGarry as Binibining Pilipinas Intercontinental 2015, Yvethe Marie Santiago (Miss Supranational 2014 - Top 20 Semi-Finalist) crowned Rogelie Ardosa Catacutan as Binibining Pilipinas Supranational 2015, and Parul Shah (Binibining Pilipinas Tourism 2014) crowned Ann Lorraine Maniego Colis as Binibining Pilipinas Tourism 2015. The first runner-up was Hannah Ruth Lulu Sison, 26, a multi-media artist/professor from Oas, Albay, while Kimverlyn Ofalsa Suiza, 26, a TV segment producer from Marikina City, was named second runner-up. A few months later, Colis was appointed by BPCI to represent the country in the upcoming Miss Globe pageant in Canada this year, thus earning the title as the first Binibining Pilipinas Globe 2015. Her predecessor when she was crowned as Binibining Pilipinas Tourism, Parul Shah was also appointed to represent the country in the Miss Grand International pageant in Thailand, prior to the acquisition of the local franchise. Shah earns the title as the first Binibining Pilipinas Grand International 2015, despite the fact that a former Binibining Pilipinas candidate was the country's first representative to the pageant (Annalie Forbes). Prior to the appointment of Colis, BPCI decided to discontinue the title of Binibining Pilipinas Tourism prior to the cancellation of the Miss Tourism Queen International pageant. This pageant produced the third Miss Universe titlist for the Philippines, Pia Wurtzbach, thus ending the 42-year drought for a Filipina Miss Universe. This batch has produced 5 international titleholders: Miss Universe 2015, Miss Globe 2015, Miss International 2016, Miss Globe International 2016, and Reina Hispanoamericana 2017. ==Results== ;Color keys Six titles were awarded to participate internationally (2 titles from the Big Four international beauty pageants and 4 minor international beauty pageants) and two runner-up positions were given in the following order: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\" !width=\"280\" style=\"background-color:#787878;color:#FFFFFF;\"|Final Results !width=\"250\" style=\"background-color:#787878;color:#FFFFFF;\"|Candidate !width=\"300\" style=\"background-color:#787878;color:#FFFFFF;\"|International Placement |- |style=\"background:gold;\" | Miss Universe Philippines 2015 |style=\"background:gold;\" | Pia Alonzo Wurtzbach !style=\"background:gold;\" |Miss Universe 2015 |- |style=\"background:#FFFACD;\" |Binibining Pilipinas International 2015 |style=\"background:#FFFACD;\" |Janicel Lubina !style=\"background:#FFFACD;\" | Top 10 Finalist |- | style=\"background:#FFFACD;\" |Binibining Pilipinas Supranational 2015 |style=\"background:#FFFACD;\" |Rogelie Catacutan !style=\"background:#FFFACD;\" |Top 13 Finalist |- |style=\"background:#FFFF66;\" | Binibining Pilipinas Intercontinental 2015 |style=\"background:#FFFF66;\" |Christi Lynn McGarry !style=\"background:#FFFF66;\" |1st Runner-up |- |style=\"background:gold;\" | Binibining Pilipinas Globe 2015 |style=\"background:gold;\" |Ann Lorraine Colis !style=\"background:gold;\" | Miss Globe 2015 |- | Binibining Pilipinas 2015 1st Runner-Up |Hannah Ruth Sison |- | Binibining Pilipinas 2015 2nd Runner-Up |Kimverlyn Suiza |- | Top 15 Finalists | * #9 - Maolin Yalung * #12 - Kylie Verzosa * #14 - Princess Joy Camu * #17 - Brenna Cassandra Gamboa * #21 - Alaiza Flor Malinao * #22 - Anja Vanessa Peter * #23 - Justine Beatrice Felizarta * #34 - Teresita Ssen Marquez |- |} ===Special awards=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" !width=\"250\" style=\"background-color:#787878;color:#FFFFFF;\"|Award !width=\"350\" style=\"background-color:#787878;color:#FFFFFF;\"|Candidate |- | Miss Friendship | * 6 \u2013 Toni Alyessa Hipolito |- | Miss Talent | * 34 \u2013 Teresita Ssen Marquez |- | Face of Binibini (Miss Photogenic) | * 5 \u2013 Cannielle Faith Santos |- | Best in National Costume | * 34 \u2013 Teresita Ssen Marquez (designed by Frederick Peralta) |- | Miss Philippine Airlines | * 12 \u2013 Kylie Verzosa |- | Manila Bulletin Readers' Choice | * 5 \u2013 Cannielle Faith Santos |- | She's So JAG | * 34 \u2013 Teresita Ssen Marquez |- | Best in Swimsuit | * 11 \u2013 Janicel Lubina |- | Best in Evening Gown | * 11 \u2013 Janicel Lubina |- | Miss Cream Silk | * 10 \u2013 Pia Wurtzbach |} ==Candidates== The 34 Candidates included: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:100%; width:70%;\" |- !
