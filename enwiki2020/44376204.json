The squadron was established on 1 April 1948 and remained active until disestablished on 30 September 1977. ==History== Early experience with helicopters by the U.S. Navy was begun with Helicopter Development Squadron 3 (VX-3), which operated out of Naval Air Station Lakehurst, New Jersey (USA). This led to creation of the service's first two designated helicopter squadrons, Helicopter Utility Squadron 1 (HU-1) and HU-2 on 1 April 1948. Both squadrons were given the nickname \"Fleet Angels\" and their full designation was Helicopter Utility Squadron, reflecting the multiple missions that these squadrons were expected to be able to complete. In July 1965, HU-2 was re-designated Helicopter Combat Support Squadron 2 (HC-2). After 25 years at NAS Lakehurst, the squadron was relocated to Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida (USA), where on 30 September 1977, the squadron would be disestablished due to budget constraints following nearly 30 years of service.
