    "text": "Manzanar () was a town in Inyo County, California, founded by water engineer and land developer George Chaffey. It was situated on the former narrow gauge railway line of the Southern Pacific Railroad north of Lone Pine, at an elevation of . A post office operated at Manzanar from 1911 to 1914. Manzanar was a shipping point for the surrounding apple orchards before the diversion of water through the Los Angeles Aqueduct from the Owens Valley to Los Angeles. During World War II, the area was the location of the Manzanar War Relocation Center, where people of Japanese ancestry were held.http://www.nps.gov/manz/ . accessed 6/24/2010 == Owens Valley Paiute == Manzanar was first inhabited by Native Americans nearly 10,000 years ago. Approximately 1,500 years ago, the area was settled by the Owens Valley Paiute, who ranged across the Owens Valley from Long Valley on the north to Owens Lake on the south, and from the crest of the Sierra Nevada on the west to the Inyo Mountains on the east. Other Native American nations in the region included the Miwok, Western Mono, and Tubatulabal to the west, the Shoshone to the south and east, and the Mono Lake Paiute to the north. The Owens Valley Paiute hunted and fished, collected pine nuts, and raised crops utilizing irrigation in the Manzanar area. They also traded brown-ware pottery for salt from the Saline Valley, and traded other wares and goods across the Sierra Nevada during the summer and fall. The Owens Valley received scant attention from European Americans until the early 1860s, as it was little more than a crossroads on the routes through the area. When gold and silver were discovered in the Sierra Nevada and the Inyo Mountains, the resulting sudden influx of miners, farmers, cattlemen and their hungry herds brought conflict with the Owens Valley Paiute, whose crops were being destroyed. \"The Army didn't take them on a direct route, either, said Owens Valley Paiute elder Irene Button. \"They were forced to walk all the way around the eastern shore of Owens Lake\" (covers an area of approximately ). Approximately one-third of the Native Americans in the Owens Valley were relocated to Fort Tejon. After 1863, many returned to their permanent villages, established along creeks flowing down from the Sierra Nevada mountains. In the Manzanar area, the Owens Valley Paiute had established villages along Bairs, Georges, Shepherds, and Symmes creeks. == Ranchers == When European American settlers first arrived in the Owens Valley in the mid-19th century, they found a number of large Paiute villages in the Manzanar area. John Shepherd, one of the first of the new settlers, homesteaded of land north of Georges Creek in 1864. With the help of Owens Valley Paiute field workers and laborers, he expanded his ranch to . As the area was developed, its farmers by 1922 produced \"probably 90 per cent Winesaps on 400 to 500 acres of bearing trees,\" even with its \"limited water supply.\" Inyo County agricultural agent J.P. Hertel predicted that year the growers would \"no doubt plant many more trees in the future and irrigate them by the development of large wells.\"J.P. Hertel, \"Apple Culture: A Promising Industry in Owens Valley,\" Los Angeles Times, July 30, 1922, image 177 In 1925 it was known as \"one of the best apple and peach districts in California.\" \"City to Lease Owens Tracts,\" Los Angeles Times, January 4, 1925, image 7 ==Township== George Chaffey In 1905, George Chaffey, an agricultural developer from Southern California, purchased Shepherd's ranch and subdivided it, along with other adjacent ranches. He founded the town of Manzanar in 1910, \"on the main trunk line of the Southern Pacific.\"\"Topmost Prices for Owens Valley Apples,\" Santa Ana Register, March 1, 1913, image 10 By August 1911, the town had a population of \"almost 200 people.\"\"The Thousand Wonders of Productive Owens Valley; Manzanar\" Los Angeles Times, August 13, 1911, image 88, column 5 The articles of incorporation for a Manzanar Water Company were filed on September 15, 1910, with capital stock of $250,000. The incorporators, directors, and subscribers were G.A. Hanson, Isaac Baxter and C.E. Searls.\"Official Record,\" San Bernardino Daily Sun, September 25, 1910, image 7 In January 1911, the Inyo County Board of Supervisors approved an application by Chaffey's Owens Valley Improvement Company for a telephone line between Independence, Lone River, Owengo, Francis, Citrus and Manzanar.\"Progress Marks Passing of Time,\" Los Angeles Times, January 29, 1911, image 61 The company built an irrigation system over an area of a thousand acres and planted about twenty thousand fruit trees. Ira L. Hatfield was the town's first postmaster, appointed in May 1911.\"Postmasters Are Named for Office,\" The San Francisco Call, May 16, 1911, image 18 The first post office was at Thebes, a town 1.5 miles away. Manzanar Community Hall, ca. 1912. In back is Hatfield's (later Bandhauer's) General Store, which housed the post office. In summer 1911, a \"one and a half story building, 40x50\" was erected at the corner of Francis and Independence avenues. The lower floor included a hall to be used \"for public gatherings, church, Sunday-school and dancing.\" Four rooms were to be used for a company office, a barber shop and \"other small lines of business.\" The upper floor was planned for \"a good-sized hall to be used for lodge purposes.\"\"New Building's Varied Uses,\" Los Angeles Times, July 8, 1911, image 15 By 1920, the town had more than twenty-five homes, a two-room school, a town hall, and a general store. Also at that time, nearly of apple, pear, and peach trees were under cultivation; along with crops of grapes, prunes, potatoes, corn and alfalfa; and large vegetable and flower gardens. \"Manzanar was a very happy place and a pleasant place to live during those years, with its peach, pear, and apple orchards, alfalfa fields, tree-lined country lanes, meadows and corn fields,\" said Martha Mills, who lived at Manzanar from 1916 to 1920. == Quenching Los Angeles' thirst == U.S. Route 395, 2007 In 1913, the City of Los Angeles completed construction of its Los Angeles Aqueduct. It did not take long for Los Angeles water officials to realize that Owens River water was insufficient to supply the rapidly growing metropolis. In 1920, they began to purchase more of the water rights on the Owens Valley floor. As the decade went on, the City of Los Angeles bought out one Owens Valley farmer after another, and extended its reach northward into Mono County, including Long Valley. By 1933, the city owned 85 percent of all town property and 95 percent of all ranch and farm land in the Owens Valley, including Manzanar. Although some residents sold their land for prices that made them financially independent and relocated, a significant number chose to stay. In dry years, Los Angeles pumped ground water and drained all surface water, diverting all of it into its aqueduct and leaving Owens Valley ranchers without water. Without water for irrigation, the holdout ranchers left their ranches and their communities; that included the town of Manzanar, which was abandoned by 1929. By the beginning of August 1924, however, \"the purchase of the Manzanar district for $780,000 was consummated by Los Angeles.\"\"Los Angeles Buys Complete Control of Owens River,\" Reno Evening Gazette, August 18, 1924, page 6 The Alabama Hills, 2009 The 4,958-acre Manzanar tract of 68 parcels was obtained by the city for an \"aggregate price\" of $788,120 ($159 an acre). It was described as lying \"between the north end of the Alabama Hills and the town of Independence.\" It was fed by the \"Shepard [sic], George, Bairs, Symmes and Pinyon creeks.\" City engineer William Mulholland said the land would be valuable to the city \"chiefly as a subterranean reservoir of water.\"\"City Buys Owens Tract,\" Los Angeles Times, August 6, 1924, image 17 By 1925, as a result of farmers and others moving away from Manzanar as Los Angeles purchased their properties, the \"two-teacher school\" was expected to have only seven pupils.W.A.
