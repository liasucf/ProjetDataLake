    "text": "Jean-Pierre Droz (1746 - 1823) was a coin and medal engraver born in Switzerland and trained in Paris. Droz was most known for engraving the Napol\u00e9on coin at the Paris Mint. He was employed by the prominent English manufacturer and business man, Matthew Boulton (1728 - 1809) to improve Boulton's coin and medal quality. However, he worked there for just two years. In 1789, Droz devised a collar used to engrave the sides of coins and ensure a circular shape, and though it was unsuitable for large numbers of coins, it remained in use at the Soho Mint. He was a member of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists. == References == ==External links== * Category:1746 births Category:1823 deaths Category:Members and Associates of the Royal Birmingham Society of Artists Category:Coin designers ",
