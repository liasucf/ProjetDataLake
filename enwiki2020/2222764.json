Upper Houghton has been declared a National Heritage Area. Upper and Lower Houghton are separated by the East-West section of Houghton Drive and part of Louis Botha Avenue. Small sections of Upper Houghton lie east of Louis Botha Avenue (bordering Observatory), and west of the north\u2013south section of Houghton Drive (bordering Parktown and Hillbrow). Houghton is surrounded by wealthy suburbs in all directions, except south, where Upper Houghton borders less-affluent suburbs like Yeoville and Hillbrow. ===Architecture=== Historically a wealthy area, it contains many mansions on big stands, blocks of flats, as well as office parks (developed on the sites of former homes) on streets close to the M1 and on Louis Botha Avenue. Houghton is architecturally varied. There are good examples of art deco buildings (particularly some of the flats), and many of the large houses in the 1930s are good examples of the Modern style inspired by the work of Le Corbusier (Chipkin 1993), including Stern House (1935) designed by Rex Distin Martienssen and partners. The suburb, particularly Lower Houghton, is currently experiencing rapid redevelopment. Although many plots had already been subdivided in two, there is now a trend towards the development of cluster homes. This redevelopment is sanctioned by the City of Johannesburg's Regional Spatial Development Framework. The city sees many positive aspects to the redevelopment, but it is not uncontroversial and has resulted in the destruction of many traditional houses. ==Demographics== ===Religion=== As with many suburbs in the North-East of Johannesburg,Johannesburghttp://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/28071/Complete.pdf?sequence=13 Houghton has historically been known for being a Jewish area, and has a shul known as West Street Shul.The mosque next door | News | Mail & GuardianWest Street Shul South Africa As apartheid ended many Muslims moved to the Northern Suburbs of Johannesburg, including Houghton.
