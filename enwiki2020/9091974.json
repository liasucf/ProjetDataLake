    "text": "Alonso Andrada (1590 - 20 June 1672) was a biographer and ascetic writer. Andrada was born in Toledo, Spain. Before entering the Society of Jesus (1612) he read philosophy in Toledo, was afterwards rector of Plascensia and minister in foreign countries. In his declining years, he wrote some thirty-four volumes on different subjects, some worthy of note for their learning, excellence of doctrine, and style, which to some extent conceal his carelessness and excessive simplicity. He is chiefly known as the continuator of Nuremberg's Varones Ilustres, biographies of distinguished members of the Society of Jesus. His Guia de la Virtud e Imitacion de Nuestra Senora deserves special mention. He died in Madrid. ==References== Category:1590 births Category:1672 deaths Category:People from Toledo, Spain Category:Spanish Jesuits Category:17th-century Roman Catholic priests Category:17th-century Spanish people ",
