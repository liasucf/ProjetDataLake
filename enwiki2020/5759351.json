Naxos.com 2011. Retrieved 7 September 2011. where he gained his first two degrees. His international reputation as a composer developed from his early career as a programme maker at the BBC, during which he produced many award-winning programmes and developed a style known for its direct connection with audiences. His close association with the BBC Philharmonic resulted in three large-scale commissions for voices and orchestra. His \"Son of God Mass\" has had many performances worldwide, especially in the US and Europe. In 2005, The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra with the Choir of Clare College Cambridge, under Leonard Slatkin, premiered his largest choral work Annelies, a setting of the Diary of Anne Frank, at London's Cadogan Hall to wide critical acclaim. The work was later re-scored in an alternative chamber version which was premiered in The Netherlands on Anne Frank's 80th birthday by the British violinist Daniel Hope and the American soprano Arianna Zukerman. He wrote a number of works for the late British tenor Robert Tear, with whom he also collaborated as librettist, including a festal setting of the Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis for King's College, Cambridge, a cantata for the St Endellion Festival and three Christmas carols. Other major works include the choral work Luminosity, scored for choir, viola, organ, tanpura and percussion and The Seven Heavens for choir and orchestra, which portrays the life of C.S.Lewis in the imagery of the medieval planets. The Seven Heavens was premiered at the Ulster Hall with the Belfast Philharmonic and the Ulster Orchestra. Since 2006 his compositions have been performed in several major concerts devoted to his music at Westminster Choir College in Princeton, New Jersey with whom he continues to have a close association. In 2010 the Oxford-based chamber choir Commotio released a disc of his choral music on the Naxos label, Luminosity, which attracted much attention especially in the USA. In 2011, The Williamson Voices released the second Naxos choral disc, Living Voices with the Saxophonist Jeremy Powell, and Organist Ken Cowan under conductor James Jordan. 2013 saw the release on Naxos of Annelies, with Arianna Zukerman, The Lincoln Trio, Bharat Chandra and the Westminster Williamson Voices under James Jordan. Television credits include music for the BBC's coverage of the Queen Mother's funeral, and major BBC series Son of God. Among many international awards and achievements, he has earned three GRAMMY nominations (including Best Choral Performance for Annelies) and a Royal Television Society Award. He is Senior Research Fellow of St. Stephen's House, University of Oxford, and is a member of Oxford's Faculty of Music. In April 2020, he was appointed Director of Music at St Edmund Hall, Oxford. === Career highlights === * 2000 \u2013 winner of Sandford St Martin Premier Award (with poet Michael Symmons Roberts) for Pika. * 2001 \u2013 A Finer Truth \u2013 debut album of choral works sung by Clare College Choir Cambridge \u2013 released by Et'cetera. * 2001 \u2013 orchestral score of multi award-winning BBC1 series Son of God. * 2002 \u2013 Living Voices premiered in New York concert on the first anniversary of 9/11. * 2004 \u2013 set prayer by Desmond Tutu for the Commonwealth Observance, Westminster Abbey. * 2005 \u2013 movements from Annelies performed at the National Holocaust Commemoration, Palace of Westminster. * 2005 \u2013 World premiere of Annelies given in London with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra under Leonard Slatkin. * 2007 \u2013 U.
