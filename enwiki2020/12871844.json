The institution was established by the Government under the National Library Act, 1996 (Act No. 32) as a body corporate, under the Ministry of Arts and Culture. The National Library of the Republic of Mauritius was officially opened to the public in January 2000. ==Vision== The National Library of the Republic of Mauritius aims to be a top class library in the provision of information services to the nation, thus contributing to its development. ==Mission statement== The National Library would provide equal access to information to all Mauritian nationals, thus leveling educational opportunities and deepening the democratization process. The objectives of the National Library are to promote and encourage the use of library materials; to acquire new library materials generally, and, in particular, materials relating to Mauritius; to lend library materials to the public; to participate in planning library services in Mauritius; to promote research in library fields and provide assistance in information handling techniques; to act as the national bibliographic center and maintain the national bibliography; to act as an organizing agency for national and international lending and exchange of library materials; and to initiate and promote cooperation between the library and other libraries, both at national and international levels. ==Role of the National Library of Mauritius== The main role of the National Library of Mauritius is to build a comprehensive collection of our national heritage by collecting, receiving and preserving all publications and productions, printed and produced in Mauritius for present and future generations.
