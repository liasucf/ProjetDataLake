It is located in I\u0142awa County on the Sandela River, some southeast of I\u0142awa. == Geographical location == Lubawa is located in Che\u0142mno Land, approximately north-east of the town of Nowe Miasto Lubawskie, south-west of the town of Olsztyn and south-east of the regional centre of Gda\u0144sk, at an altitude of above sea level. ==History== Remains of the Lubawa Castle In 1214 the local Prussian landlord Surwabuno was christened by Christian of Oliva, the first Catholic bishop of Prussia. The latter is nowadays featured on the coat of arms of Lubawa. The town was first mentioned in a papal bull of January 18, 1216, issued by Pope Innocent III. Soon afterwards a wooden castle was built. Within the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights, the Bishopric of Culm was created in 1243 by William of Modena. In 1257 the town became a property of the church and the seat of the bishops of Culm (Che\u0142mno). In 1268 the castle was destroyed. Between 1301 and 1326 a new castle was built of stone by the local bishop named Arnold. In 1330 it was destroyed by an invasion of Lithuanian forces of Gediminas, but was rebuilt. The town of L\u00f6bau was captured by the Kingdom of Poland after the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 but returned to the Teutonic Order once the Polish-Lithuanian-Teutonic War ended. However the surrounding Land of Lubawa had gone partially to Masovia in the south. Gothic church St. Anna in Lubawa (1330). In 1440 the town joined the anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation, at the request of which King Casimir IV Jagiellon signed the act of incorporation of the region and town to Poland in 1454.Karol G\u00f3rski, Zwi\u0105zek Pruski i poddanie si\u0119 Prus Polsce: zbi\u00f3r tekst\u00f3w \u017ar\u00f3d\u0142owych, Instytut Zachodni, Pozna\u0144, 1949, p. XXXVII, 54 (in Polish) In the beginning of the Thirteen Years' War in 1454, the pro-Polish troops took over the local castle. The incorporation of the town to Poland was confirmed in the Second Peace of Toru\u0144 in 1466. It was part of the Che\u0142mno Voivodeship and soon afterwards became a centre of local trade and commerce. As such it became one of the seats of the bishops of Che\u0142mno. In 1533 it was razed to the ground by a great fire mentioned by Erasmus of Rotterdam, but it was soon rebuilt and between 1535 and 1539 Nicolaus Copernicus visited the bishop's castle in Lubawa several times. At that time, the castle also housed an astronomical observatory. It was in Lubawa that the decision was made to publish Copernicus' groundbreaking work De revolutionibus orbium coelestium. In 1545 the town and the castle were yet again destroyed by a fire. The town gained significant profits from the trade. In 1627 the castle was refurbished and became a Baroque style palace of Bishop Jan Zadzik. By 1640 construction of water works and sewers had been completed. The town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1772 through the First Partition of Poland. Part of the Duchy of Warsaw (1807\u201313) during the Napoleonic Wars, the town was again annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia after the dissolution of the duchy. In 1815 the palace was destroyed by a fire and in 1826 its walls were demolished. In 1820 the convent of the Benedictine Confederation was suppressed.Meyers Gro\u00dfes Konversations- Lexikon, 6th edition, Vol. 12, Leipzig and Vienna 1908, p. 641, no 1). In 1871 it became a part of the Prussian-led German Empire. During the Partitions of Poland, and until 1920 L\u00f6bau belonged to Kreis L\u00f6bau in the administrative district of Regierungsbezirk Marienwerder in the Province of West Prussia.
