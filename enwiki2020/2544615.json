    "text": "The Great Russian Race was a relay run from Vladivostok to Saint Petersburg, starting in Vladivostok on 28 May 2005 and ending in St. Petersburg on 8 September 2005. As well as the running challenge, the event aimed to pioneer and develop the culture of charitable giving and sponsorship in an area of the world where the concept is relatively new. A number of international and Russian charities, in particular Charities Aid Foundation (CAF), which specialise in the care of abandoned, orphaned and homeless children were selected by the World Race Trust trustees to administer a proportion of the funds raised, all of which were allocated to areas adjacent to the route of the Race. ==External links== *The Great Russian Race Category:Ultramarathons Category:Athletics competitions in Russia ",
