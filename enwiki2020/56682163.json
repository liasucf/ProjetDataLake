    "text": "The 2018 Winter Paralympics medal table is a list of National Paralympic Committees ranked by the number of medals won during the 2018 Winter Paralympics, which were held in PyeongChang, South Korea, in March 2018. In the standing men's 1.5 kilometre cross-country sprint, two bronze medals were awarded due to a tie. Host nation South Korea won its first gold medal at a Winter Paralympics. The next Winter Paralympics host nation China also won its first medal, a gold medal, at a Winter Paralympics. ==Medal table== Canadian Paralympic and Olympic athletes in the House of Commons of Canada. The ranking in the table is based on information provided by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and will be consistent with IPC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table will be ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a \"nation\" is an entity represented by a National Paralympic Committee [NPC]). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IPC country code. ==References== ==External links== *PyeongChang 2018 Medal table Category:South Korea sport-related lists Category:Winter Paralympics medal tables ",
