    "text": "Preservation Act 1 is a 1973 concept album by the English rock group the Kinks. It is their twelfth studio album. Preservation was not well received by critics and sold poorly (peaking on the Billboard 200 at No. 177), though the live performances of the material were much better received. Some more recent reviews of Preservation Act 1 have been more sympathetic to its ambitions, such as AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, who declared \"Sweet Lady Genevieve\" to be the \"real candidate for Davies' forgotten masterpiece\". The 1991 CD reissue on Rhino was a 2-CD set combining Preservation Act 1 with its 1974 follow-up Preservation Act 2, but with no bonus tracks other than an extended mix of \"Money & Corruption/I Am Your Man\", featuring an extra instrumental break. The 1998 CD reissue of Preservation Act 1 on Velvel includes the single versions of \"Preservation\" and \"One of the Survivors\", neither of which are available on the original vinyl release. ==Cultural references== The chorus from side 2's \"Money and Corruption\" was used by the hackers group Anonymous when attacking governmental websites during the 2014 World Cup. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;The Kinks *Ray Davies - vocals, guitar, harmonica *Dave Davies - guitar, vocals *John Dalton - bass *Mick Avory - drums *John Gosling - keyboards with: *Alan Holmes - brass *Laurie Brown - brass *John Beecham - brass *Krysia Kocjan, Lee Pavey, Lewis Rich, Pamela Travis, Sue Brown - other singers ;Technical *Dave Davies, Roger Beale - engineer *Pat Doyle - art direction *Chris Hopper - photography ==References== * Category:The Kinks albums Category:1973 albums Category:1974 albums Category:Rock operas Category:Concept albums Category:RCA Records albums Category:Albums produced by Ray Davies ",
