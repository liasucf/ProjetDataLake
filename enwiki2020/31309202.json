In 1950, the city of Los Angeles issued the largest single building permit at the time for the construction of the hotel, which cost over $15 million. The hotel quickly became a landmark of downtown Los Angeles, and over its 59-year lifespan attracted famous guests including President John F. Kennedy and Pope John Paul II. In 1954, two years after its opening, Hilton Hotels & Resorts purchased the Statler Hotels chain, renaming the hotel the Statler Hilton. In 1968 Hilton completed a $2.5 million renovation of the hotel and renamed it the Los Angeles Hilton, and later the Los Angeles Hilton and Towers. Reliance Group later purchased the hotel in 1983 and invested $30 million in renovations. Korean Air purchased the Los Angeles Hilton from Reliance in 1989. They changed the hotel's management and it became the Omni Los Angeles Hotel in 1995 and then later the Wilshire Grand Hotel in 1999. Wilshire Grand Hotel demolition, 2013 Seeking to revive the Wilshire Grand as a landmark and icon of Los Angeles, Chairman and CEO Cho Yang-ho of Korean Air conceived the idea of developing a new complex which would include the tallest building in Los Angeles, at . It is also part of an urban development effort to revitalize the Figueroa Street corridor of downtown Los Angeles as a vibrant light-and-sign district, similar to New York's Times Square. Deconstruction of the original building began on October 23, 2012, and continued for over a year until November 21, 2013, when a bottoming-out ceremony was held in the in which the tower will stand, officially ending the deconstruction of the former hotel. ==Design== Originally envisioned as two towers, the taller of which would have been tall, the complex is now a single , 73-story tower consisting of a mixed-use 889-room hotel, retail, observation deck and office space. The Los Angeles\u2013based architectural firm, A.C. Martin Partners, oversaw the project and prepared the current design. They took over from Thomas Properties, which managed the early proposals, but which was replaced when the owners became dissatisfied with their approach. A distinctive feature of the building is its sail-shaped crown which is illuminated with LED lighting at night. The tower will spearhead part of a new planned light and sign district that will extend along the Figueroa Corridor down to L.A. Live. According to recent renderings, it is unclear however to what extent LED lighting and advertising will be applied. Lead designer David C. Martin said that the spire and the entire exterior skin of the tower will be filled with programmable LED lighting.Aragon, Greg (February 22, 2013) \"New Wilshire Grand to Tower Above Downtown Los Angeles\" ENRCalifornia McGraw Hill Financial The spire weighs and adds in height to the building. The skyscraper is a distinctive part of the Los Angeles skyline, as it is the first building over 75 feet tall built since 1974 to not feature a \"flat roof\" design, an integral part of buildings in Los Angeles today. The pattern of buildings in Los Angeles to feature these \"flat roofs\" was the result of a 1974 fire ordinance which required all tall buildings in the city to include rooftop helipads in response to the devastating 1974 Joelma Fire in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, in which helicopters could not be used to effect rescues from the rooftop of the building because of the lack of a landing spot, and could otherwise have prevented many deaths. The Wilshire Grand was granted an exception by the Los Angeles City Fire Department however, as the building will include advances in fire safety and building technology (such as a reinforced concrete central core) which would exceed the city's current fire code. The elevators in Wilshire Grand Center are supplied by Otis Elevator Company. The four double- deck express cars servicing the hotel's main lobby on the 70th floor travel at 1600 feet per minute. ==Construction== West face of Wilshire Grand Tower, April 2017 Turner Construction received the contracts for both the demolition of the former hotel and the construction of the new tower, the latter of which began on February 15, 2014, when of concrete was poured over the course of 20 hours, creating an foundation for what will be the tallest building west of the Mississippi. Land use entitlements and construction staking services were provided by Psomas. The foundation is set on bedrock known as the Fernando Formation; this siltstone has been compressed by an ocean that formerly covered the area and is a good base for a building. On February 16, 2014, Guinness World Records announced that of concrete, or , was poured at the site the previous day, breaking a prior record of of concrete poured in one continuous pour, which was set in 1999 during the construction of The Venetian hotel in Las Vegas. On March 8, 2016, the topping out ceremony was held. On March 17, 2016, a construction worker died by suicide after jumping from the 53rd floor, landing on a vehicle below. On September 3, 2016, the Wilshire Grand became the tallest building in Los Angeles at 1,100 feet. The supertall building opened on June 23, 2017. The building, while recognized as \"tallest\" in the city by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, achieves this recognition through the height of its decorative sail and spire rather than highest occupiable floor space. From the ground, due to local topography, the Wilshire Grand sits visibly lower than other surrounding buildings. From the vantage of the building's 73rd floor observation deck, the US Bank Tower is markedly higher in elevation, and remains downtown Los Angeles' most prominent visual landmark. ==References== ==External links== * Wilshire Grand Center Category:Buildings and structures in Downtown Los Angeles Category:Skyscrapers in Los Angeles Category:Hotels in Los Angeles Category:Office buildings in Los Angeles Category:Wilshire Boulevard Category:Metamodernism Category:Neomodern architecture Category:InterContinental hotels Category:2017 establishments in California Category:Hotel buildings completed in 2017 Category:Office buildings completed in 2017 ",
