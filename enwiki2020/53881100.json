The composition of the seven groups in the qualifying group stage was decided by the draw held on 25 April 2017, with the teams seeded according to their coefficient ranking. The group was played in home-and-away round-robin format between 15 September 2017 and 4 September 2018. The group winners qualified for the final tournament, while the runners- up advanced to the play-offs if they were one of the four best runners-up among all seven groups (not counting results against the fifth-placed team). ==Standings== ==Matches== Times are CET/CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times, if different, are in parentheses). \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ==Goalscorers== ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *FIFA Women's World Cup Standings: 2017\u201319 qualifying, UEFA.com Group 6 Category:Italy at the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup ",
