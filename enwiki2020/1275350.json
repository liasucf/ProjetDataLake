    "text": "The Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum is the presidential library and burial place of Herbert Clark Hoover, the 31st President of the United States (1929-1933), located on the grounds of the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site in West Branch, Iowa. The library is one of thirteen presidential libraries run by the National Archives and Records Administration. In 1954, a group of Hoover's friends incorporated the Herbert Hoover Birthplace Foundation to raise money for the preservation of his birthplace and the area around it, and to plan for improvements to the site. One of their ideas was to build a small museum, and with Hoover's approval work began in the late 1950s. The architectural firm of Eggers and Higgins of New York drew the plans for the original building, a modest limestone structure of just over 4,000 square feet. While the museum at West Branch was still under construction, Hoover decided to expand it and to make it his Presidential Library.Nye, Frank T., Doors of Opportunity: The Life and Legacy of Herbert Hoover (West Branch, IA, Herbert Hoover Presidential Library Association, 1988). The Library and Museum was officially dedicated and opened to the public on August 10, 1962, Hoover's 88th birthday. Hoover and Former President Harry S. Truman were present at the dedication. Hoover began his speech by saying, > When the members of the Congress created these presidential libraries they > did a great public service. They made available for research the records of > vital periods in American historyand they planted these records in the > countryside instead of allowing their concentration on the seaboard. Already > the three libraries of President Roosevelt, President Truman, and President > Eisenhower, by their unique documentation, serve this purpose, and today we > dedicate a fourthmy own. Within them are thrilling records of supreme action > by the American people, their devotion and sacrifice to their ideals. > Santayana rightly said: \"Those who do not remember the past are condemned to > relive it.\" These institutions are the repositories of such experiencehot > off the griddle. In these records there are, no doubt, unfavorable remarks > made by our political opponents, as well as expressions of appreciation and > affection by our friends. We may hope that future students will rely upon > our friends. In any event, when they become sleepy they may be awakened by > the lightning flashes of American political humor.
