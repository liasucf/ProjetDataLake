Originally scheduled for 5 June 2020, the album's release was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The album is preceded by three singles: \"Worry About Me\", \"Power\" and \"Slow Grenade\", and features guest vocals from Blackbear, Diplo, Juice Wrld, Lauv, serpentwithfeet and Swae Lee. It is Goulding's first album since Delirium (2015). Brightest Blue received generally positive reviews from music critics and debuted at number one in the UK, number two in the Scotland and in the top ten in several other countries. To promote the album, Goulding is set to embark on the Brightest Blue Tour, beginning in April 2021. ==Background== In January 2017, Goulding announced that work on new music had begun. In April of the same year, producer BloodPop revealed on social media he was in the studio with Goulding. That same month, Goulding released a collaboration with Kygo entitled \"First Time\". On 24 October 2018, she released \"Close to Me\" with Diplo and Swae Lee. She told The Guardian in early 2019, \"It's very much written by me.\" She further discussed three new songs: \"Flux\", \"Love I'm Given\" and \"Electricity\". \"Flux\" was released on 1 March of the same year. In July 2019, Goulding stated that her next material to be released would be the songs \"Woman I Am\" and \"Start\". In November, she released her rendition of Joni Mitchell's Christmas song \"River\", which topped the UK Singles Chart, becoming her third UK number-one single and the last UK number one song of the 2010s. In a March 2020 interview with Heart, Goulding revealed that the album \"kind of comes in two parts,\" adding that she plays the guitar, bass and piano on the project. During an appearance on The Late Late Show with James Corden, she described the album as having two sides, revealing that the first side will features songs written entirely by her, while the second is described as being \"like an alter ego\" and contains the majority of singles released from 2018 to 2020. ==Release and promotion== On 27 May 2020, Goulding announced Brightest Blue as the album's title, alongside its cover artwork, release dates and formats, and track listing. The album's pre-order was made alongside the announcement. The first side, Brightest Blue, features 13 total tracks, while the second EG.0, features the previously- released \"Close to Me\", \"Hate Me\" and \"Worry About Me\", as well as two new tracks. Originally scheduled for release on 5 June 2020, it was later delayed to 12 June, and later to 17 July of the same year. On 13 July of the same year, she released a trailer for the album on YouTube. In support of the album, Goulding will embark on the Brightest Blue Tour, beginning in April 2021. For the album's physical release, Goulding and her team opted to have copies manufactured with as many environmentally-friendly materials as possible. According to Goulding's official digital store, a regular single- disc CD is packaged in a Digisleeve manufactured with FSC-certified recycled cardboard and is sealed in a \"plant-based\" wrap. Variations of formats such as cassette tapes and vinyl records have also been manufactured with minimised or recycled plastic materials and packaging. Goulding added \u201c[...] great progress has been made on this and I\u2019m pleased we've been able to push the industry forwards, but we are still pushing to do more.\u201d ===Singles=== On 13 March 2020, Goulding released \"Worry About Me\", a collaboration with Blackbear, as the first single from the album.
