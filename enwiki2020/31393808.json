This result is useful, in modified form, in quantum physics, probability theory, and harmonic analysis. == Physics version == In physics, the fundamental solution, (Green's function), or propagator of the Hamiltonian for the quantum harmonic oscillator is called the Mehler kernel. It provides the fundamental solution---the most general solutionPauli, W., Wave Mechanics: Volume 5 of Pauli Lectures on Physics (Dover Books on Physics, 2000) ; See section 44. to :\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\varphi}{\\partial x^2}-x^2\\varphi \\equiv D_x \\varphi ~. The orthonormal eigenfunctions of the operator are the Hermite functions, :\\psi_n = \\frac{H_n(x) \\exp(-x^2/2)}{\\sqrt{2^n n! \\sqrt{\\pi}}}, with corresponding eigenvalues (2+1), furnishing particular solutions : \\varphi_n(x, t)= e^{-(2n+1)t} ~H_n(x) \\exp(-x^2/2) ~. The general solution is then a linear combination of these; when fitted to the initial condition , the general solution reduces to : \\varphi(x,t)= \\int K(x,y;t) \\varphi(y,0) dy ~, where the kernel has the separable representation :K(x,y;t)\\equiv\\sum_{n\\ge 0} \\frac {e^{-(2n+1)t}}{\\sqrt\\pi 2^n n!} ~ H_n(x)H_n(y)\\exp(-(x^2+y^2)/2)~. Utilizing Mehler's formula then yields :\\displaystyle{\\sum_{n\\ge 0} \\frac {(\\rho/2)^n}{n!} H_n(x)H_n(y) \\exp(-(x^2+y^2)/2) = {1\\over \\sqrt{(1-\\rho^2)}} \\exp {4xy\\rho - (1+\\rho^2)(x^2+y^2)\\over 2(1-\\rho^2)}}~. On substituting this in the expression for with the value exp(\u22122) for , Mehler's kernel finally reads ~\\exp\\Bigl(-\\coth(2t)~(x^2+y^2)/2 + \\text{cosech}(2t)~xy\\Bigr). |border |border colour = #0073CF |bgcolor=#F9FFF7}} When = 0, variables and coincide, resulting in the limiting formula necessary by the initial condition, ::K(x,y;0)= \\delta(x-y)~. As a fundamental solution, the kernel is additive, :\\int dy K(x,y;t) K(y,z;t') = K(x,z;t+t') ~. This is further related to the symplectic rotation structure of the kernel .The quadratic form in its exponent, up to a factor of \u22121/2, involves the simplest (unimodular, symmetric) symplectic matrix in Sp(2,\u211d). That is, : (x,y) {\\mathbf M} \\begin{pmatrix}{x}\\\\\\\\{y}\\end{pmatrix} ~,~ where : {\\mathbf M} \\equiv\\text{cosech} (2t) \\begin{pmatrix} \\cosh (2t) &-1\\\\\\\\-1&\\cosh (2t)\\end{pmatrix} ~, so it preserves the symplectic metric, : {\\mathbf M}^\\text{T} ~ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 &1\\\\\\\\-1&0\\end{pmatrix} ~ {\\mathbf M} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 &1\\\\\\\\-1&0\\end{pmatrix} ~. == Probability version == The result of Mehler can also be linked to probability. For this, the variables should be rescaled as , , so as to change from the 'physicist's' Hermite polynomials (.) (with weight function exp(\u2212\u00b2)) to \"probabilist's\" Hermite polynomials (.) (with weight function exp(\u2212\u00b2/2)). Then, becomes : \\frac 1{\\sqrt{1-\\rho^2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\rho^2 (x^2+y^2)- 2\\rho xy}{2(1-\\rho^2)}\\right) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{\\rho^n}{n!} ~ \\mathit{He}_n(x)\\mathit{He}_n(y) ~. The left-hand side here is p(x,y)/p(x)p(y) where p(x,y) is the bivariate Gaussian probability density function for variables having zero means and unit variances: :p(x,y) = \\frac 1{2\\pi \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x^2+y^2)- 2\\rho xy}{2(1-\\rho^2)}\\right) ~, and are the corresponding probability densities of and (both standard normal). There follows the usually quoted form of the result (Kibble 1945) :p(x,y) = p(x) p(y)\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{\\rho^n}{n!} ~ \\mathit{He}_n(x)\\mathit{He}_n(y) ~. This expansion is most easily derived by using the two-dimensional Fourier transform of , which is : c(iu_1, iu_2) = \\exp (- (u_1^2 + u_2^2 - 2 \\rho u_1 u_2)/2)~. This may be expanded as : \\exp( -(u_1^2 + u_2^2)/2 ) \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac {\\rho^n}{n!} (u_1 u_2)^n ~. The Inverse Fourier transform then immediately yields the above expansion formula. This result can be extended to the multidimensional case (Kibble 1945, Slepian 1972, H\u00f6rmander 1985 ). ==Fractional Fourier transform== Since Hermite functions are orthonormal eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform, :\\mathcal{F} [\\psi_n](y)=(-i)^n \\psi_n(y) ~, in harmonic analysis and signal processing, they diagonalize the Fourier operator, :\\mathcal{F}[f](y) =\\int dx f(x) \\sum_{n\\geq 0} (-i)^n \\psi_n(x) \\psi_n(y) ~. Thus, the continuous generalization for real angle can be readily defined (Wiener, 1929;Wiener, N (1929), \"Hermitian Polynomials and Fourier Analysis\", Journal of Mathematics and Physics 8: 70\u201373. Condon, 1937Condon, E. U. (1937). \"Immersion of the Fourier transform in a continuous group of functional transformations\", Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 23, 158\u2013164. online), the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), with kernel :\\mathcal{F}_\\alpha = \\sum_{n\\geq 0} (-i)^{2\\alpha n/\\pi} \\psi_n(x) \\psi_n(y) ~. This is a continuous family of linear transforms generalizing the Fourier transform, such that, for , it reduces to the standard Fourier transform, and for to the inverse Fourier transform. The Mehler formula, for = exp(\u2212i), thus directly provides :\\mathcal{F}_\\alpha[f](y) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1-i\\cot(\\alpha)}{2\\pi}} ~ e^{i \\frac{\\cot(\\alpha)}{2} y^2} \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty e^{-i\\left(\\csc(\\alpha)~ y x - \\frac{\\cot(\\alpha)}{2} x^2\\right )} f(x)\\, \\mathrm{d}x ~. The square root is defined such that the argument of the result lies in the interval [\u2212\u03c0 /2, \u03c0 /2]. If is an integer multiple of , then the above cotangent and cosecant functions diverge. In the limit, the kernel goes to a Dirac delta function in the integrand, or , for an even or odd multiple of , respectively. Since \\mathcal{F}^2[ ] = (\u2212), \\mathcal{F}_\\alpha[ ] must be simply or for an even or odd multiple of , respectively. ==See also== *Oscillator representation#Harmonic oscillator and Hermite functions * Heat kernel * Hermite polynomials * Parabolic cylinder functions * Laguerre polynomial#Hardy-Hille formula ==References== * Nicole Berline, Ezra Getzler, and Mich\u00e8le Vergne (2013).
