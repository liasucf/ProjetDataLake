What others have to say about Maria: Jay Weissberg (Variety), met Ms. Dinulescu at Cannes in 2007 and he writes: \". . .it is very rare that jaded critics stand up and take notice, but quite a number of us remarked at the time that Dinulescu was an actress to watch.\" \"She has chosen roles wisely and has been fortunate in that several films she\u2019s starred in have been screened at the world\u2019s most important festivals, including Cannes, Venice and Toronto. This exposure has broadened her name recognition far beyond Romania\u2019s borders, and she is currently one of the most recognizable and watched actresses in the Romanian film industry \u2013 an industry, I should add, whose extraordinary renaissance in recent years has meant that every major International film festival actively seeks out Romanian films for their roster.\" Yale University Professor, David Chambers, states: \"As an actress, Maria Dinulescu is uncommonly protean, absolutely distinct and different in each role she plays. Her range of abilities as an actress is simply astounding: here a beguiling gamine, there an androgynous mystery woman, next a rebellious fury, then a delightfully comic trickster with a twinkle in her eye.\" Columbia University Professor, Andrei Serban, states: \"Maria Dinulescu is an extremely gifted actress with love for her craft and enthusiasm for her profession. I am impressed with her ardor and devotion to the classic roles as well as new characters she plays so charmingly on the big screen, which brought her impressive awards. Without hesitation I can declare that Maria Dinulescu is an outstanding actress with a skilled potential and upcoming career.\" Guillermo Arriaga, Writer & Director, Cannes Palme d'Or Winner and Oscar Nominated, writes: \"She is an extraordinary actress with a bright future ahead of her due to her great talent. She is sought after by several of the top directors for difficult roles. I am sure that Maria Dinulescu can bring many good things to the American cinema.\" ==Filmography== * Far from here (2016) * Smokers Die Slowly Together (2016) * Selfie 69 (2016) * Double (2016) * Rollover (2014) * Stepping Out (2013) * The Ridicule (2013) * Plongeur (2012) * Doina (2010) * Beyond America (2008) * L'enfance d'Icare (2008) * The Dot Man (2008) * Hooked (2008) * Blood and Chocolate (2007) * California Dreamin' endless (2007) * Examen (2006) * Impasse (2005) * Le tramway d'Andr\u00e9a (2005) * Gadj\u00e9 (2005) * Milionari de weekend (2004) * Camera ascuns\u0103 (2004) * Trafic (2004) * Forme aberrante (2003) * Green Oaks (2003) * Poveste la scara C (2003) * 17 minute \u00eent\u00e2rziere (2002) * Bucure\u015fti-Wien, 8-15 (2000) ===Series=== * \u00cen deriv\u00e3 (2010) * P\u0103catele Evei (2005) ==External links== * www.mariadinulescu.com * Category:Romanian actresses Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
