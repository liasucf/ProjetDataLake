    "text": "Winterboro, also spelled Winterborough, is an unincorporated community in Talladega County, Alabama, United States. ==History== The state of Alabama incorporated the Central Plank Road on January 30, 1850. It was planned to run from Montgomery to Guntersville via Talladega. Joseph Winter planned the road, but the people of Talladega did not give him their expected financial support. As a consequence, Winter ended the plank road at Winterboro and named the settlement for himself. A post office called Winterboro was established in 1853 and remained in operation until 1875. During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps cleared brush from pastures around Winterboro. Today, Winterboro is at the junction of Alabama State Route 21 and Alabama State Route 76. One structure in Winterboro, the Winterboro Stagecoach Inn, is listed on the National Register of Historical Places. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Talladega County, Alabama Category:Unincorporated communities in Alabama ",
