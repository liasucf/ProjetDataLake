    "text": "Mohamed Kedir (Amharic: \u121e\u1210\u1218\u12f5 \u12a8\u12f5\u122d; born September 18, 1954) is a former long- distance runner from Ethiopia, who won the bronze medal in men's 10,000 metres at the 1980 Summer Olympics. In the 5000 metres final, Kedir still led with 300 metres to go, then Ireland's Eamonn Coghlan passed him. Shortly after that, Kedir moved out to the second lane to let his teammate Miruts Yifter pass him, which Yifter did and sprinted past Coghlan. Moments after moving to the second lane, Kedir fell - apparently because he collided with another Ethiopian runner, Yohannes Mohamed. Having lost his rhythm, Kedir finished in 12th and last place. (See YouTube, 1980 Olympics 5000 metres). Kedir won men's long-distance cross country World Championship in 1982 (see below). His last major international race occurred in Helsinki, Finland, at the 1983 inaugural World Athletics Championships. There he finished ninth at 10,000 metres.
