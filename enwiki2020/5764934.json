He was a representative to the Congress of Tucum\u00e1n of 9 July 1816 which declared the Independence of Argentina. Rodr\u00edguez was born in San Pedro, Buenos Aires Province and was educated at a Franciscan school, joining the Order at 16. He became a priest in 1783 and entered the University of C\u00f3rdoba, where he held the chairs of theology and philosophy 1783-1790. In 1790 he returned to Buenos Aires and taught theology and physics at the Franciscan convent. His teachings are preserved at the convent of San Francisco and in Jujuy. Rodr\u00edguez was impressed by the patriots and revolutionaries of the early 19th century, even dedicating a poem to the slaves who helped defend the city against the British invasions. He became a friend, teacher and protector of Mariano Moreno. In 1810, he was appointed head of the public library by the First Junta, serving until 1814; yet, despite working for the revolution, he was also appointed provincial superior of the Franciscan Order. Rodr\u00edguez became provincial minister in 1811 and member of the Assembly of 1813, although it was dissolved shortly after. In 1813 he was elected to the General Constituent Assembly and edited the assembly's newspaper. He was elected by the city of Buenos Aires to the Tucum\u00e1n Congress in 1815 and proposed a motion to set up a committee to prepare its constitution.
