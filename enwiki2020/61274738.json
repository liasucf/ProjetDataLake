It was formed in 1951 and superseded the earlier Anglo- American Productivity Council, which was formally dissolved the next year. The Council was dissolved in 1999. ==Organisation== The Council's chairmanship alternated between a representative of the trade unions and one from the industry. It had many notable directors including Ewart Smith, Sir Lincoln Evans, William Carron, Thomas Jacomb Hutton, Bertram White (a director of Albright and Wilson) and Lord Williamson. Until 1973, it was funded by the UK government before it was reorganised into smaller Local Productivity Associations and renamed as the British Council of Productivity Associations. ==Activities== The Council produced many films and distributed a publication called Target aimed at educating workers and employers about better workplace practices and adapting to changing markets. It also started the National Productivity Year and the Quality and Reliability Year campaigns in 1962 and 1966 respectively. ==References== Category:Organizations established in 1951 Category:Business organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Organizations disestablished in 1999 Category:1951 establishments in the United Kingdom ",
