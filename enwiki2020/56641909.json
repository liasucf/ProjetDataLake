(She apparently entered British ownership in 1785, but Lloyd's Register was not published in 1785.) She then sailed as general merchantman. In the late 1790s she was a whaler. She is last listed in 1803, though the data is stale and she was last surveyed in 1797. ==Career== Lloyd's Register (1786) lists Neptune with P. Martin, master and owner, and trade London\u2013Jamaica, changing to London\u2013Maryland.Lloyd's Register (1786), Seq.\u2116N172. Lloyd's List, however, reported on 4 October 1784 that Neptune, Martin, master, from Suriname, had arrived at Hispaniola, and was expected to sail from Port au Prince to Quebec in mid-August.Lloyd's List \u21161713. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !

She had become very leaky.Lloyd's List \u21162096. Lloyd's Register for 1797 shows Neptunes master changing from J. French to T. Hopper, and her trade to London\u2013South Seas.Lloyd's Register (1797), Seq.\u2116N131. Captain Hopper sailed Neptune in 1797 on a whaling voyage to the East Coast of Africa. She was at Delagoa Bay in late June 1798. There, on 28 June 1798, Captain Sever, of the East Indiaman , chartered Neptune, Hopper, master, and two other English ships, London, Keen, master, and , Kerr, master, to carry Lions cargo back to England. Lion had been carrying a cargo from Madras and Columbo to England when she had put into Delagoa Bay in distress. Despite the efforts of the three other English ships and three American ships there, Lion could not be saved.White (1800). Neptune and Eliza towed Lion farther up the Maputo River and then remained for some weeks. Eventually, all three British whalers left with only a portion of the cargo. The bulk of Lions cargo was to go on Britannia, which had since arrived. ==Citations and references== Citations References *Clayton, Jane M.
