The reserve is at the western end of the wildebeest migration transit route, becoming a part of the \"wet season transition phase\". The reserve stands as a last turning point of wildebeest migration in the Tanzania side where migrant\u2019s with their calves passes between May and July yearly depending on the rains. Location of Kijereshi Game Reserve in Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem The Kijereshi Game Reserve covers nearly 66 square kilometres of lush and open plains. The reserve was gazetted on 10 June 1994 following the Tanzania Government Notice (G.N) No. 215. Protection of the area dates back 1964 when it was Maswa Game Controlled Area and later upgraded to game reserve due to its ecological and social \u2013 economical values. Additionally, the reserve is categorised as Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources (Category VI) under IUCN categories of protected areas. The name of Kijereshi came from the village bordering the reserve known as Kijilishi, a Sukuma tribe word with no specific meaning. From \"Kijilishi\" to \"Kijereshi\" it was just a mistake in pronunciation where the name was first used by the Asian investor who named his tented camp as \u201cKijereshi Tented Camp\u201d. Following the gazettement of the area as a Game Reserve in 1994, the officials from Wildlife Division (WD) of Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism adopted Kijereshi as the official name of the reserve. Therefore the reserve was named Kijereshi Game Reserve. == Location == 280x280px Kijereshi Game Reserve is located at south-west of Serengeti National ParkThirgood S., C. Mlingwa, E. Gereta, V.
