The Guardians Mark Lawson said while this was not the first exclusive on BBC's service, \"It clearly feels the most ambitious, and the one that might otherwise have been expected to be conventionally screened.\" The film ranked in the top twenty requested programmes on iplayer for January and racked up over a million requests in its first three months of release. It had its television premiere on BBC Two later in the year. ==Reception== Rachel Ward of The Daily Telegraph said of the film's comedy, \"The humour was gentle, coming from a wry recognition of the era's excesses.\" She said, \"The film expertly gave depth to the character of Davis, with Merrick managing to convey a controlled stillness, as the future six-time world champion grew from nerdy teenager to confident ace.\" ==References== ==External links== * *The Rack Pack at BBC Category:2016 television films Category:2010s sports comedy-drama films Category:British films Category:British sports comedy-drama films Category:British television films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in the 1980s Category:Snooker films Category:2016 drama films ",
