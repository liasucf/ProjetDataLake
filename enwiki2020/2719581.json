    "text": "Strange Angels is the fifth album overall and fourth studio album by performance artist and singer Laurie Anderson, released by Warner Bros. Records in 1989. With this release, Anderson attempted to move away from her previous image as a performance artist into a more musical realm. Although music had always been part of her performance, it was never brought to the fore as much as it was on Strange Angels. Anderson did more singing on this album than she did on previous albums. As a result, completion of this album was delayed for nearly a year when Anderson decided that she needed to take singing lessons; in the process she discovered that she was a soprano. The album includes contributions from vocal artist Bobby McFerrin. Its cover photo was shot by Robert Mapplethorpe, who died several months before the album's release. One of the songs on this album, \"The Dream Before\" (also known as \"Hansel and Gretel Are Alive and Well\") had been introduced several years earlier in her short film What You Mean We? while she had performed \"Babydoll\" and \"The Day the Devil\" years previously on Saturday Night Live. Reaction to Anderson's new direction was mixed, with some critics praising her new style, while some accused her of abandoning her performance art roots, even though Anderson soon began work on a major piece titled The Nerve Bible. Her next album would not be released for five years. Strange Angels received a nomination for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. \"Beautiful Red Dress\" was covered in Portuguese by the Brazilian singer Marina Lima, on her 2006 album 'La nos Primordios', titled \"Vestidinho Vermelho\" (Little Red Dress). \"The Dream Before\" contains the iconic phrase \"history is an angel being blown backwards into the future\" and further references and quotes Walter Benjamin's musing on Paul Klee's painting Angelus Novus, the ninth of Benjamin's Theses on the Philosophy of History. ==Track listing== All tracks composed by Laurie Anderson except where indicated # \"Strange Angels\" \u2013 3:51 # \"Monkey's Paw\" \u2013 4:33 # \"Coolsville\" \u2013 4:34 # \"Ramon\" \u2013 5:03 # \"Babydoll\" \u2013 3:38 # \"Beautiful Red Dress\" \u2013 4:43 # \"The Day the Devil\" (Anderson, Peter Laurence Gordon) \u2013 4:00 # \"The Dream Before\" \u2013 3:03 # \"My Eyes\" \u2013 5:29 # \"Hiawatha\" \u2013 6:53 ==Personnel== *Laurie Anderson \u2013 vocals, keyboards, drums on \"Coolsville\" *Arto Lindsay \u2013 guitar *Ray Phiri \u2013 guitar *John Selolwane \u2013 guitar *Chris Spedding \u2013 guitar *David Spinozza \u2013 guitar *Jim Tunnell \u2013 guitar *Gib Wharton \u2013 pedal steel guitar *Peter Scherer \u2013 bass, keyboards, and drum programming *Mark Dresser \u2013 bass *Mark Egan \u2013 bass *Bakithi Khumalo \u2013 fretless bass *Tony Levin \u2013 Chapman stick *Dave Lebolt \u2013 keyboards, synthesizers *Robby Kilgore \u2013 keyboards *Mike Thorne \u2013 keyboards, drum programming *Gene Tyranny \u2013 keyboards *Tom \"T-Bone\" Wolk \u2013 accordion *Joey Baron \u2013 drums *Anton Fier \u2013 drums *Steve Gadd \u2013 drums *Manolo Badrena \u2013 percussion *Cyro Baptista \u2013 percussion *Bill Buchen \u2013 percussion *Errol \"Crusher\" Bennett \u2013 percussion *Sue Hadjopoulus \u2013 percussion *David Van Tieghem \u2013 percussion *Nan\u00e1 Vasconcelos \u2013 percussion *Jimmy Bralower \u2013 drum programming *Leon Pendarvis \u2013 drum programming *Ian Ritchie \u2013 drum programming *Alex Foster \u2013 alto saxophone *Lenny Pickett \u2013 tenor saxophone and horn arrangements *Louis Del Gatto \u2013 baritone saxophone *Laurie Frink \u2013 trumpet *Earl Gardner \u2013 trumpet *Steve Turre \u2013 trombone, conch shell *Hugh McCracken \u2013 harmonica *Bobby McFerrin \u2013 vocals *Phil Ballou \u2013 backing vocals *Bennie Diggs \u2013 backing vocals *Lisa Fischer \u2013 backing vocals *Yolanda Lee \u2013 backing vocals *Meat Loaf \u2013 backing vocals, chant *Paulette McWilliams \u2013 backing vocals *B.J.

She later produced a music video for \"Beautiful Red Dress\". ==References== Category:1989 albums Category:Laurie Anderson albums Category:Warner Records albums Category:Albums produced by Mike Thorne ",
