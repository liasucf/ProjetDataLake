    "text": "Detail of a Ch\u00e2teau Gruaud-Larose 1967 label Ch\u00e2teau Gruaud-Larose is a winery in the Saint-Julien appellation of the Bordeaux region of France. It is also the name of the red wine produced by this property. The wine produced here was classified as one of fifteen Deuxi\u00e8mes Crus (Second Growths) in the original Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855. == History == The property has a younger history than most of its cohorts. Its origins date to 1725 and the knight Joseph Stanislas Gruaud. The property was called Fond-Bedeau, and was administered by two Gruauds; one a priest and the other a magistrate. The magistrate, the Chevalier du Gruaud, died in 1778 and his part of the property was deeded to Joseph Sebastian de La Rose, who renamed this property Gruaud-La Rose or Gruaud-Larose. This piece was classified as a Second Growth in 1855. Control of the property was split among multiple descendants, but the property remained intact until 1867 when it was split into Ch\u00e2teau Gruaud-Larose-Sarget (after the Baron Sarget) and Ch\u00e2teau Gruaud-Larose-Faure (after Adrien Faure, who married one Sophie Bethmann, heiress to a portion of the estate). The two ch\u00e2teaux were reunited by the Cordier family, who purchased the Sarget piece in 1917 and the Faure piece in 1935; the ch\u00e2teau became a centerpiece of the many Cordier properties along with Ch\u00e2teau Lafaurie-Peyraguey and Ch\u00e2teau Talbot. In 1983 it was purchased by the Compagnie de Suez, and in 1993 by Alcatel-Alsthom, and in 1997 by the Taillan Group, headed by Jacques Merlaut, which owns a number of other properties, most notably Ch\u00e2teau Haut-Bages- Liberal. == Vineyards == The vineyards cover Ch\u00e2teau Gruaud-Larose: Vintages , accessed October 9, 2008 and are planted with 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Merlot, 8% Cabernet Franc, 3% Petit Verdot and 2% Malbec.Ch\u00e2teau Gruaud- Larose: A Varying Blend of Several Grape Varieties , accessed October 9, 2008 == Second wine == The Ch\u00e2teau produces a second wine called Sarget du Ch\u00e2teau Gruaud-Larose, or Larose de Gruaud. Very confusing, there seems to be a third label of this ch\u00e2teau's wine: La Roseraie de Gruaud LaroseLa Roseraie de Gruaud Larose == References == == External links == *Ch\u00e2teau Gruaud-Larose official site Category:Bordeaux wine producers Category:Monuments historiques of Gironde ",
