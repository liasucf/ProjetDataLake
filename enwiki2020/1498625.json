    "text": "In mathematics, the Mellin inversion formula (named after Hjalmar Mellin) tells us conditions under which the inverse Mellin transform, or equivalently the inverse two-sided Laplace transform, are defined and recover the transformed function. == Method == If \\varphi(s) is analytic in the strip a < \\Re(s) < b, and if it tends to zero uniformly as \\Im(s) \\to \\pm \\infty for any real value c between a and b, with its integral along such a line converging absolutely, then if :f(x)= \\\\{ \\mathcal{M}^{-1} \\varphi \\\\} = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi i} \\int_{c-i \\infty}^{c+i \\infty} x^{-s} \\varphi(s)\\, ds we have that :\\varphi(s)= \\\\{ \\mathcal{M} f \\\\} = \\int_0^{\\infty} x^s f(x)\\,\\frac{dx}{x}. Conversely, suppose f(x) is piecewise continuous on the positive real numbers, taking a value halfway between the limit values at any jump discontinuities, and suppose the integral :\\varphi(s)=\\int_0^{\\infty} x^s f(x)\\,\\frac{dx}{x} is absolutely convergent when a < \\Re(s) < b. Then f is recoverable via the inverse Mellin transform from its Mellin transform \\varphi. == Boundedness condition == We may strengthen the boundedness condition on \\varphi(s) if f(x) is continuous. If \\varphi(s) is analytic in the strip a < \\Re(s) < b, and if |\\varphi(s)| < K |s|^{-2}, where K is a positive constant, then f(x) as defined by the inversion integral exists and is continuous; moreover the Mellin transform of f is \\varphi for at least a < \\Re(s) < b. On the other hand, if we are willing to accept an original f which is a generalized function, we may relax the boundedness condition on \\varphi to simply make it of polynomial growth in any closed strip contained in the open strip a < \\Re(s) < b. We may also define a Banach space version of this theorem. If we call by L_{ u, p}(R^{+}) the weighted Lp space of complex valued functions f on the positive reals such that :\\|f\\| = \\left(\\int_0^\\infty |x^ u f(x)|^p\\, \\frac{dx}{x}\\right)^{1/p} < \\infty where \u03bd and p are fixed real numbers with p>1, then if f(x) is in L_{ u, p}(R^{+}) with 1 < p \\le 2, then \\varphi(s) belongs to L_{ u, q}(R^{+}) with q = p/(p-1) and :f(x)=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi i} \\int_{ u-i \\infty}^{ u+i \\infty} x^{-s} \\varphi(s)\\,ds. Here functions, identical everywhere except on a set of measure zero, are identified. Since the two-sided Laplace transform can be defined as : \\left\\\\{\\mathcal{B} f\\right\\\\}(s) = \\left\\\\{\\mathcal{M} f(- \\ln x) \\right\\\\}(s) these theorems can be immediately applied to it also. ==See also== *Mellin transform *Nachbin's theorem ==References== * * * * * * == External links== * Tables of Integral Transforms at EqWorld: The World of Mathematical Equations.
