    "text": "The Nadela or Nadel (Serbian Cyrillic: \u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430 or \u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043b) is a system of canals and rivers in northern Serbia, an long left tributary to the Danube in the Banat region of the Vojvodina province. == Course == The Nadela originates from the Boto\u0161 sluice gate on the Canal Danube-Tisa-Danube-Tami\u0161 crossing, at an altitude of . This is just the first of the many sluice gates on the river's course (Toma\u0161evac, Uzdin, Putnikovo, Kova\u010dica, Debelja\u010da) which channel the waters into the southern direction. Near the village of Uzdin, Nadela's waters are used for the Uzdin fish pond. Until Debelja\u010da the Nadela (in this section also called Veliki kanal or big canal) flows as the real river, but after the Debelja\u010da catchment for the purpose of irrigation, the river shrinks in terms of volume and discharge to the level of a brooklet, which combined with the use of water for industry in Jabuka and Pan\u010devo down the stream and small inclination of the watershed (mouth at ) means that without sluice gates pumps to push the water, the river would stop flowing. The Nadela continues to the south, close to the villages (each with its own sluice gate) of Crepaja, Jabuka, the town of Pan\u010devo, Star\u010devo, Omoljica and Ivanovo, where it empties into the Danube, creating an ada (river island), Ivanovo Ostrvo. The Nadela receives several tributaries and canals, mostly in its latter section: Verovac, Dolova\u010dki Begej, Crepajski kanal, Srednji Begej, Ponjavica, etc. It belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin and it is not navigable. == Hydrosystem == The whole course of the Nadela is organized as one hydrosystem. Water is mostly used for irrigation of some of arable land and for the use in industrial facilities in Jabuka and Pan\u010devo. The river is also used as a drainage canal for the industrial waters (especially from the heavily industrialized Pan\u010devo) which results in the Nadela's extreme pollution in the lower course. In early 2016 a group of local enthusiasts and fishermen organized in an attempt to clean the area of Nadela between Star\u010devo and Omoljica. Up to that point, the area was severely polluted both from the industrial and agrarian pollution. The concrete overspill station, which kept the constant level of water in the river, was buried under the illegal waste dump so the river at one point completely dried out. They cleaned and dredged the canal, arranged the banks and the surrounding area, adapting it for picnics and recreation. The overspill was also cleaned and restored to its previous function, so the water level was raised by . That way, the lake-like widening of the river, with an area of was restored, while the surrounding basin of was revitalized and from the dried land restored to wetland. A series of sluice gates serve for several purposes: * in upper part of the course, to prevent the waters of the Tami\u0161 to spill over during high water levels in rainy years. * in central part, to prevent the Nadela to spill over itself, during rainy periods and abundance of underground waters. * in southern part, to prevent the waters of the Danube to spill over during high water levels and to constantly regulate inverse flow of the Danube waters as a result of the \u0110erdap hydroelectric power plant construction. == References == == External links == *Determining the relative role of different types of pollution at regional scale by using the AHP based participative decision-making model; B.
