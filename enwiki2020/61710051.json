He is also a full Botswana international, having made five appearances for the Zebras since his debut. Simisani began his football career in the Township Rollers academy in 2005. He was given his first senior appearance by then manager Madinda Ndlovu as a sixteen year old. After impressing Simisani would go on to become a mainstay in the Rollers defence, playing for them over twelve years and winning all of the cups on offer including six Premier Leagues, one FA Cup and two Mascom Top 8 Cups. He left Rollers in 2019 to join South African side Free State Stars but his contract was terminated after the club was relegated from the Absa Premiership and he returned to Rollers. ==Style of play== Throughout his career he has featured predominantly as a classic sweeper defender, mainly to his mobility and ability to tackle. Due to his size and height he is also dependable for ball clearance and is a constant goal threat especially in setpieces. ==Honours== ===Clubs=== ; Township Rollers *Botswana Premier League:6 ::2009-10, 2010-11, 2013-14, 2015-16, 2016-17, 2017-18 *FA Cup:1 ::2009-10 *Mascom Top 8 Cup:2 ::2011-12, 2017-18 ===Individual honours=== *FUB Player of the Season: 2017 *FUB Team of the Year: 2016, 2017 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Botswana footballers Category:Botswana international footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Botswana expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate soccer players in South Africa Category:Township Rollers F.C. players Category:Free State Stars F.C. players ",
