    "text": "Immunology and Cell Biology is an academic journal of the Australian and New Zealand Society of Immunology covering basic immunology research. The journal has a focus on cellular immunology, innate and adaptive immunity, immune responses to pathogens, tumour immunology, immunopathology, immunotherapy, immunogenetics and immunological studies in humans and model organisms (including mouse, rat, Drosophila etc.). The journal was founded in 1924 as the Australian Journal of Experimental Biology and Medical Science, and was converted in 1987 to Immunology and Cell Biology, making it one of the oldest speciality immunology journals in existence. Major historical contributions including publication by Donald Metcalf of the strategy for identifying colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) and the development of the clonal selection theory by Frank Macfarlane Burnet, in a series of more than 90 publications in the 1970s. The journal's editor-in-chief is Anne La Flamme, with Adrian Liston, Sammy Bedoui and Ian Parish serving as deputy editors. ICB has a sister journal, Clinical and Translational Immunology, which was founded in 2012 in response to a growing need for publishing clinically-orientated research papers in the field of immunology. ==References== Category:English- language journals Category:Monthly journals ",
