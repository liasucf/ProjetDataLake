    "text": "The Firozkohi (Dari: ) are a sub-tribe of the Chahar Aimaq ethnic group in Afghanistan, one of the four major Aimaq tribes which also include the Jamshidi, Taymani, and Taimuri. In 1987, the Firozkohi were the second-largest Aymaq tribe after the Taymani. The Hazaras of Qala-i Nau is also included in the Aimaq confederacy. Like the Aimaq Hazaras, the Firozkohi speak the Aimaq dialect of Dari Persian. They are named after Firozkoh, the medieval capital of the Ghurid dynasty. The Firozkohi are semi-nomadic, and inhabit the valleys of the Murghab river, largely in Badghis Province. ==Descent and origin== The traditional chiefs of the northern Firozkohi tribe are known as Zay \u1e24\u0101kem. The word 'zai' as a prefix is equivalent to 'tai' or 'dai'. The latter is most common among the Hazara tribal groups. ==See also== * Aimaq people * Hazara people ==References== Category:Aymaq Category:Ethnic groups in Badghis Province Category:Modern nomads ",
