The two-hour show was performed before 72,500Monsters of Rock Festivals spectators and included real cannons, the Hells Bell, an inflatable Rosie and an inflatable Angus. It was filmed in 35 mm Panavision and had 26 cameras that included one situated inside a helicopter. The DVD includes special features such as stereo and 5.1 surround sound, Iso-cam versions of certain songs for different band members, and audio commentary from Angus and Malcolm Young. Another option allows the viewer to focus on just one member for the length of a song. This option is available for Angus Young on \"Thunderstruck\", \"Back in Black\", and \"Highway to Hell\". The option is offered for Malcolm Young on \"T.N.T.\", Brian Johnson on \"Whole Lotta Rosie\" and Cliff Williams on \"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\". For unknown reasons, this option was not available for Chris Slade. One other feature is a full catalogue discography with audio interview of all international albums. Despite the commercial success of the DVD, many hardcore fans were disappointed that the audio was fixed, with many differences than the original video, though the DVD officially released in Brazil still has original audio. Tracks from Live at Donington on AC/DC Live have the original audio. The audio was used for the Harmonix game AC/DC Live: Rock Band Track Pack. ==Set list== #\"Thunderstruck\" #\"Shoot to Thrill\" #\"Back in Black\" #\"Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be\" #\"Heatseeker\" #\"Fire Your Guns\" #\"Jailbreak\" #\"The Jack\" #\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\" #\"Moneytalks\" #\"Hells Bells\" #\"High Voltage\" #\"Whole Lotta Rosie\" #\"You Shook Me All Night Long\" #\"T.N.T.\" #\"Let There Be Rock\" #\"Highway to Hell\" #\"For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)\" ==Personnel== *Brian Johnson - lead vocals *Angus Young - lead guitar, backing vocals on \"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\" and \"T.N.T.\" *Malcolm Young - rhythm guitar, backing vocals *Cliff Williams - bass guitar, backing vocals *Chris Slade - drums, percussion ==Other releases== ===Blu-ray=== This concert was released for the first time in high-definition on Blu-ray Disc by Sony BMG on October 16, 2007.
