He headed up the Central Committee's important Cadre (personnel and training) department between 1960 and 1989. ==Life== Fritz M\u00fcller was born in Forst (Lausitz), on the western shore of the Neisse River and roughly 25 km (15 miles) to the east of Cottbus, in what was then central Germany. His father made cigarettes. He left school and started on a commercial training in 1937. Germany had become a one-party dictatorship during the months following January 1933, and in 1938 Fritz M\u00fcller became a member of the ruling Nazi Party.Olaf Kappelt: \"Mein \"Weihnachtsgeschenk\" an Erich Mielke. \u00dcber die Reaktionen des MfS auf ein Buch \u00fcber Altnazis in der DDR\"Fritz M\u00fcller's party membership number (from which the date of his joining the party can be determined) was 7142801. He fought as a soldier in the Second World War, ending up as a Non-commissioned officer. The war ended in May 1945. Between May 1945 and December 1947 Fritz M\u00fcller was detained by the Soviet army as a prisoner of war. During this time he joined an Anti-Fascist circle at the Nizhny Tagil detention camp, and was employed in mining. When he returned home at the end of 1947, the frontier on each side of Poland had moved and Forst was now a frontier town, across the river from Poland. The entire eastern portion of what remained of Germany was now administered as the Soviet occupation zone, and following the contentious creation, in April 1946, of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands) was well on its way to reverting to one-party dictatorship. From his subsequent career it is apparent that at some stage, probably before the entire region was re-founded as the German Democratic Republic in October 1949, Fritz M\u00fcller joined the young country's ruling SED (party), but available sources are silent as to when this happened. Back in Forst, in December 1947 he obtained a job in the council planning department, becoming head of department three months later. In 1950 he took on the same job, but now at a regional level, for the Frankfurt (Oder) district. Shortly after this, in 1951, he became an instructor in the Economic Policy department of The Party's regional leadership for the whole of Brandenburg.Friederike Sattler: \"Wirtschaftsordnung im \u00dcbergang: Politik, Organisation und Funktion Teil 1\", 2002, p. 747 However, the regional tier of government was abolished in 1952 as part of a strategy to centralise party/government control, and in August 1952 M\u00fcller was given the same job in the city of Cottbus. He left after a few months, to begin in March 1953 a period of study at the Regional Party Academy in Ballenstedt. On graduating he remained at the Party Academy, now as a Deputy Head and Economics teacher between 1954 and 1955. In June 1955 Fritz M\u00fcller relocated to Berlin. Here he succeeded as :de:Liste der ZK- Abteilungen und ihrer Abteilungsleiter Leader of the Planning and Finance Department of the Party Central Committee. The country's classic Leninist constitutional arrangements insisted on the \"Leading role\" of the ruling party, which made the central committee the dominant element in ruling East Germany. In May 1960 Fritz M\u00fcller was appointed head of the Central Committee's Cadre Department, a position he would hold for nearly three decades. The post gave him responsibility for the further training of party officers and of officers of the approved mass movements that were a feature of the political structure applied in the Soviet Union and its satellite states.Hermann Weber: \"Die DDR 1945-1990\", 2006, S.100 He was also responsible for Personnel Strategy within the SED (party) and thereby also of the entire nomenklatura structure, embracing the relevant organisations and institutions.Olaf Kappelt: \"Das braune Erbe der PDS: Von NS-Mitmachern zu DDRSchrittmachern\", p. 73 (PDF; 416 kB) His own name first appeared on the candidate list for central committee membership in 1963. In 1967 he became one of the (by this time) 131 members of the Party Central Committee. Additionally, in April 1979 he succeeded as First Secretary in the Central Leadership of the Party Organisation in the Central Committee Apparatus. The changes of 1989/90 heralded the end of the German Democratic Republic as a standalone state, and they also signaled the end of Fritz M\u00fcller's political career. On 8 November 1989 the Central Committee Politburo resigned, M\u00fcller was relieved of his Central Committee duties on 28 November 1989. A few months later, on 10 February 1990, he was excluded from the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the name by which East Germany's old SED (party) was now in the process, slightly hesitantly, of trying to reinvent itself in anticipation of a more democratic future. ==Awards and honours== *1959: Patriotic Order of Merit in bronze *1964: Patriotic Order of Merit in silver *1969: Banner of Labor *1970: Patriotic Order of Merit in gold *1980: Patriotic Order of Merit gold clasp *1981: Banner of Labor *1984: Order of Karl Marx *1985: Order of Karl Marx ==References== Category:1920 births Category:2001 deaths Category:People from Forst (Lausitz) Category:People from the Province of Brandenburg Category:Nazi Party members Category:Members of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany Category:Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany) politicians Category:German military personnel of World War II Category:German prisoners of war in World War II held by the Soviet Union Category:Recipients of the Order of Karl Marx Category:Recipients of the Patriotic Order of Merit (honor clasp) Category:Recipients of the Banner of Labor ",
