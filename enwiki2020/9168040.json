    "text": "\u00c6thelstan (floruit 940-970) was an Anglo-Saxon nobleman. He served as an Ealdorman in southern Mercia in the reigns of Kings Eadwig and Edgar. He is referred to as \u00c6thelstan Rota (\u00c6thelstan the Red) in one charter, and is so known to distinguish him from \u00c6thelstan Half-King, and another \u00c6thelstan (fl. 940-949), who were Ealdormen in the same period. \u00c6thelstan rose to prominence in the reign of King Eadwig; \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d of Damerham, second wife of Eadwig's father King Edmund I, and thus Eadwig's stepmother, was married to this \u00c6thelstan. \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d was a woman of considerable influence, and not merely as a relict of King Edmund; her father \u00c6lfgar is described as a dux and Ealdorman of Essex. \u00c6thelstan appears to have had lands in Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. He is a frequent witness to charters of Kings Eadwig and Edgar. The Life of Saint Dunstan records a vision by a nobleman named \u00c6thelstan and Dunstan's interpretation of it as presaging the death of the king and ill times to come. It is not known whether this \u00c6thelstan or \u00c6thelstan Half-King is the \u00c6thelstan referred to. ==References== * Hart, Cyril, The Danelaw.
