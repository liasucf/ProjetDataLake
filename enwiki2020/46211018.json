Founded in 2012, the company's ice cream formula employs liquid nitrogen to freeze ingredients in less than a minute. == History == Lab Made was founded in July 2012 by Ronnie Cheng Hong-wang and Jennifer Chiu, former pharmacists. The couple discovered liquid nitrogen ice cream while working in England and later introduced the product to the Hong Kong market by opening their first shop in Tin Hau. In August 2013, Lab Made was noted in the South China Morning Post as an example of innovative entrepreneurship. According to the company's website, Lab Made no longer operates retail locations. The company provides catering services and educational entertainment shows. == Method == Lab Made's ice cream production process utilizes KitchenAid mixers to combine ingredients with liquid nitrogen. This process employs the low temperature of liquid nitrogen, -196 degrees Celsius, to emit a gas vapor which freezes the ice cream. == Products == Lab Made offers liquid nitrogen ice cream in a variety of flavors. Some of the company's past flavors have included apple crumble, Hong Kong crispy toast, mooncake, sticky toffee pudding and strawberry cheesecake. == Awards == *\u201cBest Desserts 2012\u201d - Time Out Magazine HK *\u201cBest Restaurant Awards 2012\u201d - OpenRice *\u201cBest (Hong Kong) Restaurant Awards 2012\u201d (Voted by Chinese Netizens) - OpenRice *\u201cYouth Business Award 2013\u201d (Silver Award Winner) - HSBC *\u201cMost Favourite Youth Business Award Online 2013\u201d - HSBC *\u201cBest Restaurant in Causeway Bay Awards 2014\u201d - OpenRice *\u201cBest Dessert Shop Awards 2014\u201d - OpenRice *\u201cBest (Hong Kong) Restaurant Awards 2014\u201d (Voted by Taiwanese Netizens) - OpenRice *\u201cBest-ever Dining Awards 2014\u201d - Weekend HK Magazine *\u201cHong Kong Emerging Service Brand 2014\u201d - Hong Kong Brand Development Council *\u201cRecommendation Restaurant 2014\u201d - Commanderies des Cordons Bleus de France *\u201cTop 10 SME Customer Service Excellence Award 2014\u201d - HKACE *\u201cCaring Company 2015\u201d - Hong Kong Council of Social Service *\u201cHong Kong\u2019s Most Valuable Companies Awards 2015\u201d - Mediazone == References == == External links == * Category:2012 establishments in Hong Kong Category:Food and drink companies of Hong Kong Category:Food and drink companies established in 2012 Category:Ice cream brands Category:Hong Kong brands ",
