    "text": "The Gameti First Nation is a T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb First Nations band government in the Northwest Territories. The band's main community is Gam\u00e8t\u00ec, known before 2005 as Rae Lakes, where 319 of its 366 members live. In 2005, Gameti became part of the T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb Government, and collectively holds title to 39,000 square kilometers of T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb land. The new Gam\u00e8t\u00ec Community Government has assumed most of the band's powers and responsibilities. However, the federal government still recognizes Gameti for Indian Act enrollment purposes. ==References== Category:First Nations in the Northwest Territories Category:Dene governments ",
