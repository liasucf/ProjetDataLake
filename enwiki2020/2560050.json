    "text": "The area of Savonian dialects The Savonian dialects (also called Savo Finnish) are forms of the Finnish language spoken in Savonia and other parts of Eastern Finland. It belongs to the eastern Finnish dialects and it is divided into more specific dialect groups. Savonian dialects are the most widely distributed dialects of Finnish. They are spoken in the Savonia region (Northern and Southern), but also in North Karelia, parts of P\u00e4ij\u00e4t-H\u00e4me, Central Finland, Kainuu, Koillismaa district of Northern Ostrobothnia, the lake section between Southern and Central Ostrobothnia as far north as Evij\u00e4rvi and in the municipalities of Pudasj\u00e4rvi and the Southern part of Ranua in Lapland. Also the language spoken by forest settlers in V\u00e4rmland and Norwegian Hedmark of Central Scandinavia belonged to the old Savonian dialects. The area of Savonian dialects makes up one third of the whole area of Finland. ==History== The Savonian dialects are of different origin than Western Finnish dialects. Savonian dialects form a dialect continuum with other Eastern dialects of Finnish and the Karelian language, with whom they have common ancestry in the Proto-Karelian language spoken in the coast of Lake Ladoga in the Iron Age. ==Features== Although the Savonian dialects are spread over a large geographical area with significant variations, they are rather different from the standard language and are recognized as local dialects. There are large variations between different Savonian dialects, but a few of the most stereotypical features are: *Re-development of palatalized consonants from consonant + i, which is denoted by digraphs with a 'j', e.g. , (standard Finnish , ). In conjunction, the word-final i is not generally added to stems ending in consonant + i. For example, standard \u00e4\u00e4ni is reflected as i\u00e4n. *Some long vowels and diphthongs have shifted with respect to the standard language; thus, where the standard language has a diphthong, Savo may have a long vowel, and vice versa. **Stressed (initial-syllable) become opening diphthongs, first , and in most varieties further . E.g. mua for Standard Finnish maa \"land, country, ground\", or pi\u00e4 for p\u00e4\u00e4 \"head\". ** as the 2nd element of a diphthong lowers to , e.g. laeta for laita \"side\", s\u00f6e for s\u00f6i \"ate\". ** lower similarly to or they may assimilate completely to produce a long vowel, e.g. kaoppa or kaappa for kauppa \"store\", t\u00e4\u00f6nn\u00e4 or t\u00e4\u00e4nn\u00e4 for t\u00e4ynn\u00e4 \"full\". **When unstressed, the bisyllabic combination of o/\u00f6/e + a/\u00e4 is smoothed to a monosyllabic long vowel. E.g. ruskee for ruskea \"brown\", kynt\u00f6\u00f6 for kynt\u00f6\u00e4 \"plowing (partitive case)\". (This change is not specific to Savonian dialects and is found in most forms of spoken Finnish today.) *Word- medial simple consonants are geminated after a short initial syllable. A native Savonian doesn't say he speaks savoa, he says he speaks savvoo. *The combined effect of the three features above is referred to as speaking like one with a \"crooked chin\" (vi\u00e4r\u00e4leuka cf. standard v\u00e4\u00e4r\u00e4leuka). Whereas standard Finnish has a \"declarative\" rhythm, Savo has an \"expressive\" rhythm. The different way of producing speech is noticeable even if the speaker speaks perfect standard Finnish. *The glottal stop replaces word-final , a trait common to many other Finnish varieties. For example, the genitive case is essentially marked by a glottal stop (e.g. is\u00e4' i\u00e4n vs. is\u00e4n \u00e4\u00e4ni). *All syllable-initial consonants except the last one (which contacts the nucleic vowel) are systematically and completely removed in loans, e.g. traktori as raktorj. *An epenthetic vowel is inserted after a medial syllable coda of , /h/ or, in certain cases, , e.g. vanaha. This vowel is identical in quality to the preceding vowel. The resulting medial consonant is exempt from gemination. *Loi plural, e.g. risti \u2013 ristil\u00f6it\u00e4 (standard: ristej\u00e4) Although standard and known elsewhere, the usage of verb compounds is particularly prevalent in Savo Finnish and a prolific source of creative expressions. The first verb is in the infinitive and indicates the action, and the second verb is declined and indicates the manner. For example, seist\u00e4 toljotat \"you stand there gawking\" consists of words meaning \"to-stand you-gawk\". ===Northern Savonian dialects=== Northern Savonian dialects are spoken in the municipalities of Hankasalmi (Eastern part), Haukivuori, Hein\u00e4vesi, Iisalmi, Joroinen, J\u00e4ppil\u00e4, Kaavi, Kangaslampi, Karttula, Keitele, Kiuruvesi, Konnevesi, (Eastern part), Kuopio, Lapinlahti, Lepp\u00e4virta, Maaninka, Muuruvesi (part of Juankoski since 1971), Nilsi\u00e4, Pieks\u00e4m\u00e4ki, Pielavesi, Pyh\u00e4salmi, Rantasalmi, Rautalampi, Riistavesi (part of Kuopio since 1973), Siilinj\u00e4rvi, Sonkaj\u00e4rvi, Suonenjoki, S\u00e4yneinen (part of Juankoski since 1971), Tervo, Tuusniemi, Varpaisj\u00e4rvi, Varkaus, Vehmersalmi, Vesanto, Vierem\u00e4 and Virtasalmi. ===Southern Savonian dialects=== Southern Savonian dialects are spoken in the municipalities of Anttola, Hirvensalmi, Juva, Kangasniemi, Mikkeli, M\u00e4ntyharju, Pertunmaa, (Eastern part) Puumala, Ristiina, Sulkava and Suomenniemi. ===Middle dialects of Savonlinna area=== Middle dialects of Savonlinna area are spoken in the Eastern Savonia, the municipalities surrounding the city of Savonlinna between Southern Savonia and North Karelia: Enonkoski, Kerim\u00e4ki, Punkaharju, Savonranta and S\u00e4\u00e4minki (part of Punkaharju and Savonlinna since 1973). The dialect spoken in Enonkoski has many similarities with the dialects of Northern Savo, while the dialect spoken in the Southern parts of Punkaharju resembles South-Eastern dialects in many ways. The difference between dialects in Savonlinna district has its roots in the colonization history. The area of greater Kerim\u00e4ki (which consisted Enonkoski, Punkaharju and Savonranta) was settled by Karelian people till the 16th century, but from the 14th century the Savonian has started to settle to the Eastern side of Lake Pihlajavesi and the coasts of Puruvesi. The differences between natural and governmental borders goes together in many ways. In Enonkoski the dialect is more Savonian in the Northern side of Hanhivirta. The other reason to this is that the Northern villages of Enonkoski belonged to Hein\u00e4vesi in the 19th century, while the Southern villages were part of Kerim\u00e4ki. The Northern border of Puruvesi goes through Lake Puruvesi. So the old Karelian-based dialect features have kept in Punkaharju much better than in Kerim\u00e4ki, which is located in the Northern side of Puruvesi. ===Eastern Savonian dialects or the dialects of North Karelia=== Eastern Savonian dialects or the dialects of North Karelia are spoken in North Karelia in the municipalities of Eno, Ilomantsi, Joensuu, Juuka, Kes\u00e4lahti, Kiihtelysvaara (now part of Joensuu), Kitee, Kontiolahti, Korpiselk\u00e4 (now part of Russia, little part of Tohmaj\u00e4rvi since 1946), Outokumpu, Liperi, Nurmes, Pielisj\u00e4rvi (part of Lieksa since 1973), Polvij\u00e4rvi, Pyh\u00e4selk\u00e4, P\u00e4lkj\u00e4rvi (now part of Russia, little part of Tohmaj\u00e4rvi since 1946), Rautavaara, Ruskeala (now part of Russia), Soanlahti, Tohmaj\u00e4rvi, Tuupovaara (now part of Joensuu) and Valtimo. ===Dialects of Kainuu=== Kainuu dialects are spoken in Hyrynsalmi, Kajaani, Kuhmo, Kuusamo, Paltamo, Posio, Pudasj\u00e4rvi, Puolanka, Ranua (Southern part), Ristij\u00e4rvi, Sotkamo, Suomussalmi, Taivalkoski and Vaala. ===Dialects of Middle Finland=== Dialects of Middle Finland are spoken in Hankasalmi (Western part), Karstula, Kinnula, Kivij\u00e4rvi, Konginkangas (part of \u00c4\u00e4nekoski since 1993), Konnevesi (Western part), Kyyj\u00e4rvi, Laukaa, Multia, Pihtipudas, Pylk\u00f6nm\u00e4ki, Saarij\u00e4rvi, Sumiainen, Uurainen, Viitasaari and \u00c4\u00e4nekoski. ===Dialects of P\u00e4ij\u00e4t-H\u00e4me=== P\u00e4ij\u00e4t-H\u00e4me Savonian dialects are spoken in Joutsa, Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, J\u00e4ms\u00e4, Korpilahti, Koskenp\u00e4\u00e4 (part of J\u00e4ms\u00e4nkoski since 1969), Kuhmoinen, Leivonm\u00e4ki, Luhanka, Muurame, Pertunmaa (Western part), Pet\u00e4j\u00e4vesi, Sysm\u00e4 and Toivakka. ===Middle dialects of Keuruu-Evij\u00e4rvi=== Middle dialects of Keuruu-Evij\u00e4rvi are spoken in Alaj\u00e4rvi, Evij\u00e4rvi, Keuruu, Lappaj\u00e4rvi, Lehtim\u00e4ki, Pihlajavesi, Soini, Vimpeli and \u00c4ht\u00e4ri. This sub-dialect area is wedge shaped in the middle of Ostrobothnia, which has its own dialects and also Swedish-speaking population. This is the influence of Savonian slash-and-burn farmers who colonized the lake section in Southern Ostrobothnia in the 17th century. ===V\u00e4rmland Savonian dialects=== The expansion of Savonian slash-and-burn agriculture, which started in the beginning of Modern era, expanded to Central Scandinavia. Mostly in the beginning of the 17th century Savonian settlers, mainly from the parish of Rautalampi, settled in V\u00e4rmland, Sweden. In the beginning of the 19th century tens of thousands of people spoke the Savonian language as their mother tongue. These \"Forest Finns\" were an interesting group from a linguistic point of view because their language was kept safe from other influences. The practice of slash and burn agriculture was prohibited in Sweden in the middle of the 17th century and no new Finnish settlers moved to the area. The language of Forest Finns lacked the Schwa vowel and gemination, which are used now in the dialect spoken in Rautalampi. Nowadays the Savonian dialect of V\u00e4rmland is extinct. The last Savonian speakers were Johannes Johansson-Oinonen (died in 1965) and Karl Persson (died 1969). ==Music== The band Verjnuarmu performs melodic death metal in the Savo dialect, while V\u00e4rttin\u00e4 perform folk music in the dialect. The folk song \"Ievan polkka\" is in the dialect, as well. ==Sources== * Suomen murrealueet ('Finnish dialects' - in Finnish) ===References=== Category:Finnish dialects Category:Savonia (historical province) ",
