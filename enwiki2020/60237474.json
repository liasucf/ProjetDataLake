    "text": "Republican Front () was a Catalan left-wing and republicanist electoral alliance formed for the April 2019 Spanish general election by Free People (), We Are Alternative () and Pirates of Catalonia and the support of La Forja. ==History== The coalition was presented on March 15, 2019 at the headquarters of the \"Escarr\u00e9 International Center for Ethnic and National Minorities\" (CIEMEN) and included Free People, We Are Alternative and Pirates of Catalonia. It was presented in the 2019 Spanish general election and was led by Albano Dante Fachin, Maribel Rodr\u00edguez, Guillem Fuster, Mireia Cald\u00e9s and Roger Espa\u00f1ol. The coalition fielded candidates in all four Catalan constituencies in the election. It won 113,807 votes, 2.8% of the total vote in Catalonia, placing eighth overall. However, the coalition fell below the 3% electoral threshold in all but one constituency (Girona), and failed to elect any deputies. On May 15, 2019 the three constituent parties of the Republican Front decided to dissolve the coalition. Poble Lliure and the Pirates have both endorsed the candidacy of Popular Unity Candidacy (Catalan: Candidatura d'Unitat Popular, CUP) for the November 2019 election. ==Composition== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:97%;\" |- ! colspan=\"2\"| Party |- | width=\"1\" bgcolor=\"\"| | Free People (PL\u2013PPCC) |- | bgcolor=\"\"| | We Are Alternative (Som Alternativa) |- | bgcolor=\"\"| | Pirates of Catalonia (Pirata.cat) |} ==Electoral results== ===Cortes Generales=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:97%; text-align:center;\" |- | colspan=\"11\"| Cortes Generales |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Election ! colspan=\"7\"| Congress ! colspan=\"2\"| Senate ! rowspan=\"2\"| Status |- !
