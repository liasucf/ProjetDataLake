Showing flags of the 8 establishing countries: Kingdom of Egypt, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Mutwakilite Kingdom of Yemen, Hashimite Kingdom of Syria, Hashimite Kingdom of Iraq, Hashimite Kingdom of Jordan, Republic of Lebanon and Palestine In its early years, the Arab League concentrated mainly on economic, cultural and social programs. In 1959, it held the first Arab Petroleum Congress, and in 1964, established the Arab League Educational, Cultural, and Scientific Organization. In 1974, despite objections by Jordan, the league recognized the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of all Palestinians. The League was weakened over the years by internal dissensions on political issues, especially those concerning Israel and the Palestinians and later on by the three Gulf wars. After Egypt signed a separate peace treaty with Israel on March 26, 1979, other Arab League members met in Baghdad and voted to suspend Egypt's membership and transfer the League's headquarters from Cairo to Tunis. In May 1989, nine years later, Egypt was readmitted and resumed membership. The headquarters returned to Cairo in 1990.Arab Unity - \"Peace after the Yom Kippur War?\" - Al Jazeera - Retrieved 31 January 2011. This step was sharply disputed as members of the League were deeply divided over the Kuwait crisis and the invitation extended by Saudi Arabia to the United States, which allowed foreign military build-up in its Eastern province. The League was effectively paralyzed by the eruption of the Gulf crisis, and its future as a regional organization became highly uncertain. Until the Israeli\u2013Lebanese war in the summer of 2006, the League had started making positive moves and was starting to regain respect with the Jewish public and media. ==Foundation== Arab citizens in general perceive themselves as one people divided among a number of states with history, geography, language, culture, and socio- economic interests propelling them to forge one great Arab Nation (Arabism). The British Empire realized this in the early part of the twentieth century, which helped them secure the cooperation of the Arabs, leading them to revolt (Arab Revolt) against the Turkish Ottoman Empire during World War I. The British promised to help the Arabs establish a united Arab kingdom under Sherif Hussein of Mecca, which would encompass the Asian part of the Arab World (including the modern day Arabian peninsula, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel and Jordan). After winning the war, however, the British betrayed Sharif Hussein and instead helped divide the region into mini states, implementing their policy of \"Divide and Rule\".(Sykes\u2013Picot Agreement). The British needed Arab cooperation once more during World War II, and again returned to play the Pan Arabism card by encouraging the formation of the League. Many Arab intellectuals believe that the British did not want the League to act as a step towards Arab unity, but actually used the League to prevent it. ==Proposed names== Several suggestions were made for the name of the organization: Iraq suggested Arab Union; Syria suggested Arab Alliance; and Egypt proposed the Arab League. Egypt's proposal was adopted, and later amended to the League of Arab States. ==Timeline== * 1942: The United Kingdom promotes the idea of an Arab League in an attempt to win over Arabs as allies in war against Germany. * 1944: Official representatives from Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, North Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and Transjordan meet in Alexandria, Egypt, and agree to form the League of Arab States. * 1945: Arab states sign the Arab League Pact, formally inaugurating the League. * 1945: Arab league member states declare a boycott of Jewish businesses in Palestine (continued after the establishment of Israel as the Arab League boycott). * 1946: Arab League members sign the Cultural Treaty. * 1947: The Arab League adopted the \"Draft Law\" governing the dispossession, de-naturalization and internment of Jews in Arab League States. * 1948: 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. * 1950: League members sign the Joint Defense and Economic Cooperation Treaty. * 1953: Members establish the Economic and Social Council; Libya joins the Arab League. * 1956: Sudan joins the Arab League. * 1958: Morocco and Tunisia join the Arab League; The United Nations recognizes the League and designates it as the United Nations' organization for education, science and culture in the Arab region. * 1961: Kuwait joins the Arab League. * 1962: Algeria joins the Arab League. * 1964: The first summit convenes in Cairo; the Arab League Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization (ALECSO) forms; a second league summit that autumn welcomes the establishment of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). * 1967: South Yemen joins the Arab League. * 1967: The Arab League summit convenes in Khartoum.
