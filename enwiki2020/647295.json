She was constructed in 1806 at the Washington Navy Yard, was commissioned sometime in 1807, Master Commandant John Smith in command. In 1812 she captured , but was immediately herself captured. The British took her into service first as HMS Loup Cervier and then as HMS Peacock. She was lost, presumed foundered with all hands, in mid-1814. ==US Service== In 1808 Wasp was heavily involved in supporting Jefferson's Embargo, including delivering an army garrison from New York City to Passamaquoddy in June, patrolling Casco Bay, Maine, in the winter of 1808-1809, and remaining at Portland until May, 1809. Until 1809 she was commanded by Master Commandant John Smith. In the final weeks of 1810, she was operating from the ports of Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia, presumably patrolling the waters along southern Atlantic coast. In 1811, she sailed to Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she and the brig joined frigates and in forming a squadron commanded by Commodore Stephen Decatur.U.S.Navy, DANFS, Wasp prgh.1 On 9 March 1812 Wasp sailed from New York for France to deliver an adventurer named John Henry who had sold correspondence to President Madison indicating Britain's interest in determining if the New England states wished to secede from the union. The correspondence, known as the Henry Papers, helped build outrage in Congress against Britain that led to the declaration of war. USS Wasp boarding HMS Frolic Wasp, under the command of Master Commandant Jacob Jones continued to operate along the coast of the middle states after the United States went to war with Britain in June 1812.Roosevelt, 1883 p.100 Her single action came in October. On 13 October, she sailed from the Delaware River and two days later encountered a heavy gale that tore away her jib boom and also washed two crewmen overboard. The following evening, Wasp encountered a squadron of ships and, in spite of the fact that two of their number appeared to be large men-of-war, made for them straight away. She finally caught the enemy convoy the following morning and discovered six merchantmen under the protection of a 22-gun sloop-of-war, HMS Frolic.Roosevelt, 1883 pp.104-106U.S.Navy, DANFS, Wasp prgh.3 At half past eleven in the morning of 18 October, Wasp and Frolic closed to do battle, commencing fire at a distance of . In a short, sharp, fight, both ships sustained heavy damage to masts and rigging, but Wasp prevailed over her adversary by boarding her. Unfortunately for Wasp, a British 74-gun ship-of- the-line, , appeared on the scene. Frolic was crippled and Wasps rigging and sails were badly damaged. At 4:00 PM Jones had no choice but to surrender Wasp; he could neither run nor fight such an overwhelming opponent.Malcomson, 2006 p.429 ==British service== Wasp was briefly given the name Loup Cervier on her capture.Winfield (2008), p.273.Loup cervier is the French name for the Canada lynx. She was commissioned in 1813 on the Halifax station under Captain Charles Gill. Captain William William Mends succeeded Gill, taking command on 26 February 1813. In June Loup Cervier was off New London, where she helped blockade the squadron under Commodore Stephen Decatur. James Biddle, who had been first lieutenant of Wasp, had become captain of . He issued a challenge to Mends that their two vessels meet in an engagement. Decatur forbade the engagement until he was sure that it would be an even match. The day after he gave his assent Loup Cervier left New London to patrol elsewhere.Dennie (2009), Vol. 3, pp.400-1. Thereafter Loup Cervier captured or recaptured four vessels. On 27 June she captured the schooner Little Bill, John Roach master, which had been sailing from St Bartholomew to North Carolina. She was carrying a cargo of sugar and molasses. Little Bill was restored.Essex Institute, Vol. 46, p.318. Another report gives the vessel's name as Little Bell.Lloyd's List, no.4803, - accessed 2 February 2014. Then on 28 August Loup Cervier captured the ship Hope, of 468 tons (bm), J. Emery master. Hope was sailing from Lisbon to Newport, Rhode Island with a cargo of salt. She too was restored.Essex Institute, Vol. 46, p.268. On 29 October Loup Cervier recaptured the brig John and Mary, T. Collins, master.Essex Institute, Vol. 46, p.272. Lastly, Loup Cervier was one of four British warships that shared in the capture of the sloop Emeline, of 44 tons (bm), O. Adams, master. Emeline was sailing from New York to Rhode Island with a cargo of 240 barrels of flour.Essex Institute, Vol. 46, p.158. At some point Loup Cervier was renamed Peacock, Hornet having captured and sunk the in February 1813. Mends was appointed to command of on 23 March 1814.Mends (1899), p.350. Peacock may then have been briefly under the command of Captain G. Donnett. In April or shortly thereafter Commander Richard Coote of was promoted to post captain and transferred to Peacock.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 37, p.190. Peacock was one of the five British warships that on 21 April 1814 captured the Swedish brig Minerva. Then on 15 May, Peacock recaptured the Swedish ship Providentia, of four guns, 400 tons, and 17 men. She had been sailing from Amelia Island to Lisbon with a cargo of pine, cedar, etc. when an American privateer had captured her. That same day, Peacock recaptured the Russian ship Hendrick, of eight guns, 80 tons, and 13 men. She had been sailing from Amelia Island to Amsterdam with a cargo of pine and cotton when captured. ==Fate== Peacock was under Coote's command when she disappeared off the Virginia Capes.Hepper (1994), p.150. She apparently had foundered on 23 July 1814. ==Notes, citations, and references== ===Notes=== ===Citations=== ===References=== * * Url * Dennie, Joseph (2009) The Port Folio. (Books LLC).
