    "text": "Beddis soil series is a coarse, well to rapidly drained soil which occurs on eastern Vancouver Island and the adjacent Gulf Islands. Its parent material is eolian, fluvial or marine sand. The soil texture is usually loamy sand or sandy loam, but pure sand horizons may also be encountered. The usual soil classification is Orthic Dystric Brunisol.http://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/publications/surveys/bc/bc43-1/index.html Soils of the Gulf Islands of British Columbia Volume 1 Soils of Saltspring Island, page 29 A Gleyed Humo-Ferric Podzol example is also known, although that profile does not have the eluvial (Ae or E) horizon characteristic of classic Podzol development.http://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/publications/surveys/bc/bc43-1/index.html Soils of the Gulf Islands of British Columbia Volume 1 Soils of Saltspring Island, page 118 Drier parts of the Comox Sandhills are mapped as Beddis series.https://governmentofbc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=cc25e43525c5471ca7b13d639bbcd7aa In these soils, well defined Ae (E) horizons are common in less disturbed areas and the B horizon may be locally cemented. Such soils look like classic Podzols and were mapped as such (Kye component of Kye-Custer complex) in 1959.http://sis.agr.gc.ca/cansis/publications/surveys/bc/bc6/index.html == References == Category:Vancouver Island Category:Gulf Islands ",
