He became a member of the Architectural Students' Society, and a skilled draughtsman and colourist, winning the Royal Academy silver medal in 1814 with drawings of the Mansion House. In 1815 he won the silver medal of the Society of Arts. In the same year he travelled to Paris where he studied at the school of Achille Lecl\u00e8re and entered the monthly competition of the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts. He then travelled in Italy and Sicily for several years preparing drawings that were later published. Following his return to Britain he exhibited a drawing of the transverse section of St Peter's, Rome, for which he later received a gold medal from the Pope. == Career == Goldicutt worked with Henry Hakewill until Hakewill's death in 1830, as well as working on his own projects. He submitted drawings for the design of the new Post Office building (1820), the Cambridge University observatory (1821), the Middlesex Lunatic Asylum (1829), the Fishmongers' Hall (1830) and for Nelson monument (1841). John Henry Hakewill (1811\u20131880) was later Goldicutt's pupil. Goldicutt showed 35 architectural drawings at the Royal Academy between 1810 and 1842. In 1820, his drawing Ruins of the Great Hypaethral Temple, Salinuntum, Sicily, was etched by Bartolomeo Pinelli and appeared in Goldicutt's The Antiquities of Sicily (1819). One of Goldicutt's last designs was for St James' Church, Sussex Gardens, Paddington, (c. 1841) which was finished by George Gutch after Goldicutt's death. Goldicutt's original scheme was for a neo-classical design in yellow brick, influenced by his travels in Italy. The yellow brick was used but Gutch changed the style to Gothic.
