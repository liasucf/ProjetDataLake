On 14 March 2011, he was attacked and seriously wounded in the head. At 00:30 local time, he and his spokeswoman Buket \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 were shot at by unknown assailants after leaving the offices of the private Turkish channel Beyaz TV following his weekly television show. As they entered their vehicle, Tatlises was hit with a bullet that entered the back of his skull and exited through the front. \u00c7ak\u0131c\u0131 was also hit in the neck, but survived the attack. The perpetrators carried Kalashnikov rifles and escaped in a black car. He was taken to the Ac\u0131badem Hospital in Istanbul for emergency treatment. He underwent a four-hour operation to have the bullet removed, after which he was in stable condition. He regained consciousness five days later. After a week, the doctors announced that he was recovering well. Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan visited him and also announced that he was recovering well. The police in Turkey arrested around 20 people involved in the attack. On April 7, Tatl\u0131ses left Ac\u0131badem Hospital with a police escort and travelled to Atat\u00fcrk International Airport, where he was boarded the Ministry of Health's Hawker 900XP air ambulance for Germany, to receive intensive rehabilitation at the Murnau Trauma Clinic. ===Business=== Tatl\u0131ses is involved in the restaurant and tourism businesses, as well as in construction projects with business partner Ali Sariyildiz in Iraq. He is the owner Of Zakho FC. ===Kurdish issue=== In the 1980s the Turkish government had banned the use of Kurdish; at a concert in Sweden in December 1986, he had sung folk songs in Kurdish and was thus prosecuted for separatist propaganda, but found not guilty in 1987. The charge was dismissed after he showed regret. In 1988, he was asked by businessman Mehmet Y\u0131lmaz at a cultural festival in U\u015fak to sing a Kurdish folk song, but refused, saying \"I am a Kurd, but the laws ban me for singing in Kurdish\". For this, he was indicted on September 19, 1988. In 1994 there was evidence that Turkish counter-guerrilla organizations targeted Kurdish businessmen, including Tatl\u0131ses, \u0130dris Ozbir, Halis Toprak, and Necdet Ulucan. In 1998 it was reported that Tatl\u0131ses offered to be an intermediary between the government and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) during the armed conflict. He recorded a song with Iranian Kurdish musician Abdollah Alijani Ardeshir. ==Discography== * 1970: Kara K\u0131z/Beni Yakma Gel G\u00fczelim * 1974: Sevdim de Sevilmedim * 1976: Ashab Gecesi * 1976: Urfa Emektaro\u011flu Bant St\u00fcdyosu * 1977: Aya\u011f\u0131nda Kundura * 1977: Can Hatice * 1977: Huzurum Kalmad\u0131 * 1978: Doldur Karde\u015f \u0130\u00e7elim * 1979: Topra\u011f\u0131n O\u011flu Sabuha * 1980: Bir Mumdur * 1980: Ceylan * 1981: Gelme \u0130stemem * 1981: G\u00fclmemiz Gerek * 1982: Ya\u015famak Bu De\u011fil * 1983: Yalan * 1984: Benim Hayat\u0131m * 1985: Mavi Mavi * 1986: G\u00fcl\u00fcm Benim/G\u00fcl\u00fcmse Biraz * 1987: Allah Allah/H\u00fclya * 1988: Kara Zindan * 1988: Fosforlu Cevriyem * 1989: \u0130nsanlar * 1990: S\u00f6ylim mi? * 1991: Vur Gitsin Beni/Yemin Ettim * 1992: Ah Ke\u015fkem * 1993: Mega A\u015fk * 1994: Haydi S\u00f6yle * 1995: KlasikleriCaglar Keyder Istanbul: Between the Global and the Local 1999 - 1461637937 p.138 \"S-Muzik is Raks's elite arabesk division, recording and distributing Ibrahim Tatlises (whose recent \u201cKlasikleri\u201d alone is believed to have sold six million copies), Zeki Muren, Bulent Ersoy, Kayahan, and many more.\" * 1996: Bende \u0130sterem * 1996: T\u00fcrk\u00fc Dinle,S\u00f6yle,Oyna * 1998: At Gitsin * 1999: Selam Olsun * 2001: Yetmez Mi? * 2003: Tek Tek * 2004: Aramam * 2005: Sizler \u0130\u00e7in * 2006: \u0130mparator Siler de Ge\u00e7er * 2007: Bulamad\u0131m * 2008: Neden? * 2009: Ya\u011fmurla Gelen Kad\u0131n * 2011: Hani Gelecektin * 2014: Tatl\u0131ses Klasi\u011fi ==Filmography== ===Actor=== * 1978: Sabuha * 1978: Aya\u011f\u0131nda Kundura * 1978: Topra\u011f\u0131n O\u011flu * 1979: Kara Yazma * 1979: Kara \u00c7ad\u0131r\u0131n K\u0131z\u0131 * 1979: Fadile * 1980: \u00c7ile * 1980: Ayr\u0131l\u0131k Kolay De\u011fil * 1981: Seni Yakacaklar * 1981: Ya\u015famak Bu De\u011fil * 1981: T\u00f6vbe * 1982: Yalan * 1982: Ali\u015fan * 1982: Nas\u0131l \u0130syan Etmem * 1983: Yorgun * 1983: G\u00fcnah * 1983: Futboliye * 1984: Sevdaland\u0131m * 1984: Ay\u015fem * 1985: Mavi Mavi * 1985: Sevmek * 1985: Yaln\u0131z\u0131m * 1986: G\u00fcl\u00fcmse Biraz * 1986: Y\u0131k\u0131lm\u0131\u015f\u0131m Ben * 1986: Sarho\u015f * 1987: G\u00fcl\u00fcm Benim * 1987: Allah Allah * 1987: Dertli Dertli * 1988: H\u00fclya * 1988: A\u015f\u0131ks\u0131n * 1988: Bir Kulum \u0130\u015fte * 1988: Kara Zindan * 1988: Ben \u0130nsan De\u011fil Miyim * 1989: Ceylan * 1989: Fosforlu * 1992: A\u015f\u0131k Oldum * 1993: Tetik\u00e7i Kemal * 1997: F\u0131rat (mini) TV Series * 2003: Hayat Bilgisi (Mini) TV Series * 2009: Hicran Yaras\u0131 ===Director=== * 1982: Yalan * 1983: Yorgun * 1983: G\u00fcnah * 1984: Ay\u015fem * 1986: Sarho\u015f * 1986: G\u00fcl\u00fcmse Biraz * 1986: G\u00fcl\u00fcm Benim * 1987: Dertli Dertli * 1988: H\u00fclya * 1988: A\u015f\u0131ks\u0131n * 1997: F\u0131rat (mini) TV Series * 2003: Hayat Bilgisi Konuk Oyuncu TV mini series * 2009: Hicran Yarasi 5 Bolum Konuk Oyuncu ===Writer=== * 1983: G\u00fcnah * 1998: At Gitsin * 1999: Selam Olsun * 2001: Yetmez Mi? ===Producer=== * 1982: Yalan ==References== ==Sources== * * * * ==External links== * *Abdollah Alijani Ardeshir on Istanbul Technical University (thm\u015ft)no:122567/978thm *Harem Ft. \u0130brahim Tatl\u0131ses - Kop Gel G\u00fcnahlar\u0131ndan - (Official Video) Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Turkish male singers Category:Turkish folk musicians Category:Turkish pop musicians Category:Turkish male film actors Category:Turkish film directors Category:Turkish businesspeople Category:Turkish Muslims Category:People from \u015eanl\u0131urfa Category:Turkish people of Kurdish descent Category:Turkish people of Arab descent Category:Shooting survivors Category:Musicians with physical disabilities Category:Turkish pop-folk singers ",
