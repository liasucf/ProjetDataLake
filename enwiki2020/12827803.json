She was born in Aurora, Illinois on September 11, 1883, to William S. and Julia (Brady) Beaupr\u00e9. She received her B.A. from Smith College in 1904. ==The Book House for Children== In 1919 Miller established a company, The Book House for Children, to publish popular children\u2019s literature edited by herself to meet her standards: *\"First,--To be well equipped for life, to have ideas and the ability to express them, the child needs a broad background of familiarity with the best in literature. *\"Second,--His stories and rhymes must be selected with care that he may absorb no distorted view of life and its actual values, but may grow up to be mentally clear about values and emotionally impelled to seek what is truly desirable and worthwhile in human living. *\"Third,--The stories and rhymes selected must be graded to the child's understanding at different periods of his growth, graded as to vocabulary, as to subject matter and as to complexity of structure and plot.\" Earlier versions of The Book House contained some short stories (such as Little Black Sambo and The Tar Baby) which were later recognized to be racist and were removed from the set, and replaced with newer stories of, e.g. The U.S. Space Program. The company was also remarkable for its large female staff at a time when most women did not work outside the home. Illustrators for the series included Maude and Miska Petersham, Donn Philip Crane, Hilda Hanway, Milo Winter, and Peter Newell.My Book House: Through Fairy Halls, Vol. 3, Olive Beaupr\u00e9 Miller, Editor.
