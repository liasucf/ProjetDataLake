    "text": "Wissenschaftlicher Assistent, often shortened to Assistent, literally \"scientific assistant\", usually translated as assistant professor in English, was formerly an academic position at German universities for researchers with doctoral degrees and additional academic qualifications, who were typically employed to conduct research to qualify themselves for the Habilitation and thus a full Professorship. The position was abolished in 2005 and replaced with the title Juniorprofessor (\"junior professor\"). Like professors, the position formed part of the pay grade (Besoldungsordnung) C of the higher civil service (h\u00f6herer Dienst), with a rank within the civil service equal to major in the military. The position was partially comparable to a postdoctoral researcher in many universities today, and partially to assistant professors in the North American system. When a person obtained an Habilitation (or in some cases, equivalent qualifications), he or she would be eligible to become Adjunct Full Professor (au\u00dferplanm\u00e4\u00dfiger Professor), Professor Extraordinarius (au\u00dferordentlicher Professor) or even Professor Ordinarius (ordentlicher Professor).
