She is from Chiba Prefecture, her birthday is November 28, 1978 and her nicknames are Asuka and Fukui.

However, her main development is when she was in Flower Troupe, where she participated a couple New Actor shows: Elisabeth are among those. Like Kanami Ayano, she steadily became the second tier musumyaku and join Mao Ayabuki in her first Bow Hall starring, Naked City. She got her applause portraying as Yvette d'Amboise in Marrakech: A Crimson Tombstone and later on, she rejoined with Juri in the latter's final Takarazuka performance, Ernest in Love as Gwendolen Fairfax. When Miyo Fuzuki, the musumeyaku top star of Flower Troupe from 2003 to 2006, announced her resignation, the public expected that she would be the next top star.
