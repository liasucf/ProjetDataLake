    "text": "In Scientology, Operating Thetan (OT) is a spiritual state above Clear. It is defined as \"knowing and willing cause over life, thought, matter, energy, space and time (MEST).\"The State of Operating Thetan (Church of Scientology) According to religious scholar J. Gordon Melton, \"[i]t's basically a variation of the Gnostic myth about souls falling into matter and the encumbrances that come with that\". ==Description== OT Levels are part of \"The Bridge\", which is the set of ranks within Scientology. After having removed one's own \"reactive mind\" and thus attaining the state of \"Clear\", Scientologists may then go on to the OT levels.www.whatisscientology.org, Grade chart of Scientology courses, training and processing Scientology doctrine defines OT as the \"highest state there is\".Technical Dictionary of Dianetics and Scientology; L. Ron Hubbard; Bridge Publications; The Official Scientology and Dianetics Glossary definition of pre-OT levels; accessed 2008-02-03 (mirror ) Operating Thetan is described within Scientology as a state of godliness, and Scientologists are taught they will have godlike control over \"matter, energy, space and time\" (known in Scientology jargon as (MEST)). Hubbard claimed that thetans were tricked into following religions, which prevented them from using their own power to create and destroy universes. The Church claims that the OT is not dependent on the universe and Scientologists who are at the Operating Thetan level claim that they have control over their lives and can \"go exterior\" from their bodies. While there are fifteen levels listed in Scientology teaching, the Church only offers eight. According to former Scientologist and critic of the Church Mike Rinder, the promise of new levels has been used for decades to motivate church members to donate or repeat courses they have already taken in preparation. Rinder has said he doesn't believe these courses exist. The state of Operating Thetan is represented by a symbol consisting of the letters OT with the T inside the O and each of the points of the T ending at the O's circumference, which displays the level's initials, and is also intended to evoke the medieval O-T map representing the known world and, metaphorically, the entirety of the observable universe, over which a fully developed OT is believed to have immediate control. ==Levels== ===OT I=== \"This Solo-audited level is the first step a Clear takes toward full OT abilities, and that first step is a fresh causative OT viewpoint of the MEST universe and other beings.\"What is Scientology compiled by the staff of Church of Scientology International. c1998 published Bridge Publications Inc. pg. 840-841 The cost to move to level OT I was $2,750 as of 2013. ===OT II=== \"By confronting hidden areas of one's existence on the whole track [that is, by confronting past incarnations], vast amounts of energy and attention are released. Those on this Solo-audited level experience a resurgence of self-determinism and native ability. OT II unlocks the aberrative factors on the whole track that have allowed the thetan to lose his innate freedom and ability and one achieves the ability to confront the whole track.\" The cost to move from OT I to OT II was $5,225 as of 2013. ===OT III: The Wall of Fire=== Hubbard announced discovering an important breakthrough within less than a month of founding the Sea Org, the religious order of the church that consists of its most dedicated members. He described it as a \"means of erasing those mental factors that stand in the way of peace and toleration of mankind.\" The new material made up the new Operating Thetan III. \"This Solo-audited level goes through what is called the 'Wall of Fire' that surrounds a previously impenetrable whole track mystery. What prevents a being from being himself? This level answers that question. Once complete, a being is free of the whole track overwhelm that has trapped him. Here he confronts and eradicates the fourth dynamic engram that has plagued this universe for millennia.\" The cost to move from OT II to OT III was $8,910 as of 2013. Church dogma regards OT III as a dangerous process which can lead to pneumonia, to lack of sleep or even to death if not run correctly. In Church of Scientology of California v. Kaufman, it was noted that the defendant had been required to sign a waiver to the effect that \"the Scientology Organization, its branches and members, and L. Ron Hubbard are not responsible for anything that might happen to my body or mind on OT III\".Church of Scientology of California v. Kaufman, [1972] F.S.R. 591 per Goff J - in the Chancery Division of the High Court Within OT III is the secret doctrine of the church. Members must be invited to \"do it\", and they sign a contract of secrecy. ===OT IV: OT Drug Rundown=== \"This level handles the hidden problems and stops in a being's universe caused by the effects of drugs and poisons on the whole track. This is the final polish that rids one of any last vestige of the effects of drugs on the spirit. Ministered at Advanced Organizations or Flag. Approximately 12\u00bd to 25 hours.\" ===OT V: New Era Dianetics for OTs=== \"The Second Wall of Fire consists of 26 separate rundowns and has been described as dealing with 'living lightning, the very stuff of life itself.' This level addresses the last aspects of one's case that can prevent him from achieving total freedom on all dynamics. An audited level ministered at Advanced Organizations or Flag. Approximately 50 hours.\" ===OT VI: Hubbard Solo New Era Dianetics for OTs (Solo NOTs) Auditing Course=== \"The training one receives before starting to solo audit on New OT VII is so powerful that it actually constitutes an entire OT level. On Solo NOTs one is dealing with complexities intended to crush one's true power and abilities as a thetan. Solo NOTs auditors acquire a wide range of auditing skills to handle the vast phenomena that can occur on OT VIII. Approximately 3\u20134 weeks with the new Solo Auditor Course done.\" ===OT VII: Hubbard Solo New Era Dianetics for OTs Auditing=== \"On New OT VII one solo audits at home daily. This is a lengthy level, requiring a considerable amount of time to complete. It is the final pre-OT level, and culminates in attainment of the state of CAUSE OVER LIFE.\" ===OT VIII: Truth Revealed=== OT VIII, the highest level in Scientology is offered only aboard the Freewinds.https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/03/world/scientology-cruise- ship/index.html \"This Solo-audited level addresses the primary cause of amnesia on the whole track and lets one see the truth of his own existence. This is the first actual OT level and brings about a resurgence of power and native abilities for the being himself. This may be done at the Flag Ship Service Organization.\" ==Beyond Operating Thetan== Beyond the attainment of the state of Operating Thetan is that of Cleared Theta Clear, which Hubbard describes as such: ==Criticism== A growing number of former Scientologists have made public allegations that the church encourages its members to complete very expensive courses and expect wonderful results; when the improvements fail to happen, further courses are then promoted to facilitate the anticipated changes. Criticism stems from a pattern of cycles wherein members continue to pay increasing amounts for these courses, while some even put their families into debt chasing the elusive life-changing results under the stewardship of the church.Atack, Jon [1990] A Piece of Blue Sky, Carol Pub. Group, Chap 3, ===Legal issues and copyright=== In March 2008 WikiLeaks leaked the Church of Scientology's Operating Thetan documents.wikinews:Church of Scientology's 'Operating Thetan' documents leaked online The Church of Scientology portrayed hosting the documentation as a copyright violation implying that the collection is Church doctrine. A court found that it was legal to download, use, read, and practice these teachings outside the Church. In 1997 Zenon Panoussis, a resident of Sweden, sent copies of NOTs documents to various government authorities, thereby making the documents public according to the Swedish principle of public access to official records. The Church of Scientology responded by ordering members to continuously borrow the available copies in order to prevent non-members from reading them. The Church of Scientology also sued Panoussis for copyright infringement, since he had made the documents available online without authorization. ==See also== * Body thetan ==References== ==Further reading== * * ==External links== * * Full documents * * Summary of Operating Thetan levels 1-8 * The Fishman Affidavit Category:Scientology beliefs and practices ",
