He was previously director of the Department of Bacteriology at the pharmaceutical company Schering AG. == Career == He was a son of the noted bacteriologist Wilhelm Henneberg. He graduated as a medical doctor in Berlin in 1935 and obtained a doctoral degree in the same year. However, due to having a Jewish great-grandfather, he was denied a medical license. After complaining to the Ministry of the Interior, and enlisting the support of the noted physicians Victor Klingm\u00fcller and Ernst Rodebach, the authorities relented and he was given his medical license. After initial difficulty in finding work, he was employed at Schering AG, a company which employed several scientists of Jewish origin who were discriminated against elsewhere. At Schering he became director of the Department of Bacteriology and simultaneously head of the Schering works in Charlottenburg. In 1950, Henneberg earned his Habilitation at the Free University of Berlin, and became an Adjunct Professor (apl. Professor) at the Free University in 1956.
