    "text": "Augustus listening to the reading of the Aeneid by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1814) Caesar Augustus (63 BC \u2013 AD 14), also known as Octavian, was the first and among the most important of the Roman Emperors. Augustus' most visible impact on everyday culture is the eighth month of the year, which was renamed in Augustus' honor in 8 BC because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of Alexandria, occurred during this month.Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.12.35. ==Artwork== Augustus was one of the most widely depicted individuals in ancient times, appearing in coins, sculptures, cameos, plaques, and other media. His dominant portrait type is that of the serene, ageless Augustus of Prima Porta, introduced in 27 BCE. At its best, in Roland R. R. Smith's view, this \"type achieves a sort [of] visual paradox that might be described as mature, ageless, and authoritative youthfulness\". D. Boschung identified four other portrait types (the Actium or Alc\u00fadia type, the B\u00e9ziers-Spoleto type, the Forbes or MA 1280 type, and the Lucus Feroniae type), although Smith considers the B\u00e9ziers-Spoleto type to be a variant of the Alc\u00fadia type and the Lucus Feroniae type to be a category of dubious validity. The Alc\u00fadia portrait type is thought to have been developed around 40 BCE to coincide with the adoption of the patronymic title Divi Filius; Smith describes it as \"a youthful portrait with thick hair and probably some expression of vigour and energy\". Different scholars have argued whether the Forbes type, \"with distinctive short forehead hair,\" preceded or followed the Prima Porta type.
