    "text": "Jun-Muk Hwang (; born 27 October 1963) is a South Korean mathematician, specializing in algebraic geometry and complex differential geometry. ==Personal life== Hwang is the eldest son of gayageum musician Hwang Byungki and novelist Han Malsook. ==Education and career== Hwang received in 1993 from Harvard University his PhD under the direction of Yum-Tong Siu with thesis Global nondeformability of the complex hyper quadric. In the following years he held positions at the University of Notre Dame, the MSRI, and Seoul National University. Since 1999 he is a professor at the Korea Institute for Advanced Study. He was in 2006 an invited speaker with talk Rigidity of rational homogeneous spaces at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Madrid and in 2014 a plenary speaker with talk Mori geometry meets Cartan geometry: Varieties of minimal rational tangents at the ICM in Seoul. ==Awards and honors== * Fellow of the American Mathematical Society, since 2012 * Ho-Am Prize in Science, 2009 * Fellow of the Korean Academy of Science and Technology, since 2007 * Best Scientist / Engineer of Korea (Presidential), 2006 * Scientist of the Year Award (Korean National Assembly), 2006 * Korea Science Award (Presidential), 2001 * Award for Excellent Articles, Korean Mathematical Society, 2000 ==Selected publications== * Nondeformability of the complex hyperquadric.
