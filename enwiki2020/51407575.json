    "text": "Seesaw searchlights were an early electric powered searchlight first developed in the 1870s used in conjunction with coast artillery. The searchlight consisted of an electric carbon lamp, capable of a strong beam for target illumination, because the bulb was vulnerable to enemy fire, it was protected in a recessed emplacement whilst a large mirror, attached to the end of a 'see-saw' pivoting iron beam reflected the beam across the water to the target. The light was powered by steam engines usually housed in the nearby forts. Only a few of these were built anywhere in the British Empire, and were difficult to operate and were never successful and New Zealand's example had been abandoned by 1899. ==Surviving examples== No complete examples have survived but concrete emplacements can still be found at: *Fort Ballance, Wellington, New Zealand *Fort Victoria, Isle of Wight *Warden Point Battery on the Isle of Wight ==See also== *Military applications of searchlight **Canal Defence Light **Turbinlite **Leigh light **G-numbers **German searchlights of World War II ==References== Category:Coastal fortifications Category:Types of lamp ",
