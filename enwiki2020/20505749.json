It was established in 2000 by the Prague Society for International Cooperation and the Global Panel Foundation. It is named in honor of the Prague Society's President Marc S. Ellenbogen's mother. The award comes with a 150,000 crown cash prize, which the award recipient passes on to a young person who is embarking on his/her career who has already contributed to the development of international relations.

Nicholson lives in Canada and is finishing a book on ties between politics and organized crime. === Twentieth - Ing. Ivan M. Havel and Ing. Ivan Chvatik === thumb Ivan Havel is an important figure in the Czech academic community, as well as the editor-in-chief of the prestigious science magazine Vesm\u00edr. During communism Ivan invited dissidents and academics to his apartment overlooking the River Vltava, meetings at which Vaclav Havel was often present. But Ivan shied away from politics after 1989, choosing instead to stay in the world of science and academia. He is co-founder of the Center for Theoretical Studies, a dissident, scientist and the scion of the Havel Family. Ivan Chvatik was also the 19th recipient of the HRE Citizenship Award. Ivan Chvat\u00edk was born in Olomouc on 15 September 1941. He graduated from nuclear physics at the Czech Technical University in Prague. After being briefly employed at the Department of Logic at Aritma, he worked for more than twenty years as the head of the Technical Department of the Computer Centre of the Machine Technology Factories in Prague (1967-1989). He was in charge of the Swedish computer Datasaab, which he mastered, allowing him to demand and receive flexible working hours. That gave him enough time to focus on philosophy, to which he was mainly introduced by Jan Pato\u010dka. From autumn 1968 Chavtik attended Pato\u010dka\u2019s lectures at the Faculty of Arts of Charles University, and a year later he became Pato\u010dka\u2019s external research candidate. When Pato\u010dka was forced to leave the faculty in 1972. After Pato\u010dka\u2019s death in March 1977, he and his friends saved the philosophers writings, which they gradually worked on releasing in samizdat. They managed to publish 27 volumes in blue binding, now called the Archival Series of Jan Pato\u010dka\u2019s Works, before the Velvet Revolution. ==Reference== ==External links== * http://praguesociety.org/hanno-r-ellenbogen-citizenship-award/ *Hanno R.
