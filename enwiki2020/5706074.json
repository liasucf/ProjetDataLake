Between 1985 and 1989 he represented Altay SK, where he recorded 136 matches and 29 goals, and finished his career at Trabzonspor in 1989-90 with 37 matches and 9 goals in total. He is immensely disliked amongst the Fenerbah\u00e7e supporters because they view him as responsible for an injury suffered by R\u0131dvan Dilmen in 1990 during a league match between Fenerbah\u00e7e and Trabzonspor. R\u0131dvan never fully recovered despite undergoing sixteen operations, and eventually had to retire in 1995 at Fenerbah\u00e7e after painful years of injuries. Je\u0161i\u0107 had also accumulated a record number of bookings in his tenure in Turkish S\u00fcper Lig. Opponents claimed that he also injured many players in Turkey and gave him the nickname of \"Kasap Ye\u015fi\u00e7\", which means \"Je\u0161i\u0107 the Butcher.\" For the Yugoslav national team, he played in eight games and scored twice. ===International goals=== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! # !!
