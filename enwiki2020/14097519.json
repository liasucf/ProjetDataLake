    "text": "The Red Deer Royals are a Concert and Marching band based in the City of Red Deer, Alberta, Canada. They are Central Alberta's only Marching band for youth aged between 11 and 21. The Royals have been performing for the past 50 years and are currently under the direction of Michael Mann. They go on international tours every two to three years with the most recent tour to Europe in which the band competed in WMC kerkrade, Netherlands ==Members== The Band draws from 90-120 of Central Alberta's most ambitious young musicians to come together annually to create this community based marching show band. The Royals have members aged as young as 11 all the way up to 21 and they currently represent 20 School Band programs from the Central Alberta region. The members travel from many cities of Central Alberta, some as far south as Carstairs, Alberta, as far north as Edmonton, Alberta, as far west as Rocky Mountain House, and as far east as Stettler, Alberta. The band is composed of four groups; woodwinds, brass, percussion, and colour guard. ==Concert Season== From September to March, the Red Deer Royals perform as a concert band, performing at many different venues. They play for Remembrance Day ceremonies, Christmas festivals, and various events around Red Deer. During the concert season, the band is conducted by Michael Mann. Each year there is a concert master and assistant concert master selected to direct the band for a song. ==Parade Season== Starting in May the Red Deer Royals perform in parades throughout Central Alberta. Some of the locations of their parades are smaller rural communities such as Blackfalds, Sylvan Lake and Rocky Mountain House, but are also involved in the parades in the larger cities including Calgary, Edmonton, and (of course) Red Deer. In most of the smaller parades they are the only marching band performing; but larger and more advertised parades, such as the Calgary Stampede Parade, attract bands from across Canada, the continental U.S., and sometimes are honored to welcome performances from other bands and groups from overseas. The Red Deer Royals spend a great deal of time rehearsing their parade songs, incorporating actions into some of their songs, to be used in competition. ==Recent Awards== At the 2008 Calgary Stampede Parade, the Red Deer Royals won the following awards: Best Canadian Band, Best Senior Band, and Best Overall Band, as well as third place for Best Auxiliary., Calgary Stampede Website. At the 2008 and the 2009 Edmonton Capital Ex Parade, the Royals were judged as the best marching band and were also the musical Grand Champions, winning the Sig Hansen Musical Award., Capital Ex Website.
