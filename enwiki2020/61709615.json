    "text": "The Dog Rib Rae First Nation is a T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb (formerly known as Dogrib) First Nations band government in the Northwest Territories. The band's main community is Behchok\u01eb\u0300, known before 2005 as Rae-Edzo, where 2,396 of its 3,292 members live. By enrollment, it is the largest First Nation in the Canadian territories. In 2005, Dog Rib Rae became part of the T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb Government, and collectively holds title to 39,000 square kilometers of T\u0142\u0131\u0328ch\u01eb land. The new Behchok\u01eb\u0300 Community Government has assumed most of the band's powers and responsibilities. However, the federal government still recognizes Dog Rib Rae for Indian Act enrollment purposes. ==References== Category:First Nations in the Northwest Territories Category:Dene governments ",
