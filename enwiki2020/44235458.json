Miller eventually took over the studio in 1995 and renamed it Reign Dance Productions. Miller became certified by Dance Masters of America and became a member of Dance Masters of Pennsylvania Chapter #10 in 1986, but her membership was terminated in February 2012, with DMA saying Miller's reality-TV show Dance Moms was \"a total misrepresentation of our dance educators and their students and is detrimental to the dance profession.\" ==Career in reality television== In 2011, Miller began to appear in the Lifetime reality television show Dance Moms. Miller appeared on the show for seven seasons through February 2017. Dance Moms follows the practice sessions and performance competitions of young students of the Abby Lee Dance Company.

This caused Adriana Smith, the mother of Dance Moms season 8 dancer Kamryn, to share on Instagram that she and her daughter left the show because of their experience with Miller. \"A statement from her that sticks in my mind to this day during my time on DMS8 is 'I know you grew up in the HOOD with only a box of 8 crayons, but I grew up in the Country Club with a box of 64\u2014don't be stupid.'\" Smith wrote on Instagram. On June 3, 2020, another Dance Moms mother, Camille Bridges, accused Miller of treating her daughter Camryn differently because of her race and that the environment was \"extremely hostile\". She told E! News via e-mail that Miller \"tried to spin Camryn as being the poor one and there on scholarship. She would say the most terrible things on camera. It was a traumatic experience that I wish on no one.\" Miller has since deleted her Black Lives Matter post and on June 4, 2020, she issued an apology to \"Kamryn, Adriana, and anyone else I've hurt\", saying, \"I realize that racism can come not just from hate, but also from ignorance. No matter the cause, it is harmful, and it is my fault. While I cannot change the past or remove the harm I have done, I promise to educate myself, learn, grow, and do better. While I hope to one day earn your forgiveness, I recognize that words alone are not enough. I understand it takes time and genuine change.\" Reposting Miller's apology, Smith said that she did not accept it because she did not think it was sincere. \"I also fully support and standby Nia [Frazier; aka Nia Sioux], Camryn and Nicaya [Wiley] as well as any others who have been victims of racism at the hands of Abby Lee Miller or in the industry,\" Smith wrote. It was announced that on June 5, 2020, Lifetime decided to sever ties with Miller as a result of the allegations of the racist remarks she made.
