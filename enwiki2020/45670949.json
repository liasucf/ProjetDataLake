    "text": "\"Sex Metal Barbie\" is a song by American heavy metal band In This Moment. It is the third single taken from the band's fifth album Black Widow. ==About the song== It was first premiered live at the band's Knotfest appearance on October 25, 2014. The single was released to online retailers as the fourth instant preorder download track on November 4, 2014. A pink limited edition 7\" vinyl single was released for Record Store Day in 2015 on April 18, 2015. The single features the album version of the song and a remix. The song is about the negative feedback the band has encountered online, especially towards lead vocalist Maria Brink. Brink's approach on building the song was to go online and search for awful comments and rumors that target her and turn them into lyrics. It was revealed in March 2015 that the music video would be directed by Brink herself and shot in March after their European tour run. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Maria Brink \u2013 lead vocals, piano *Chris Howorth \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals *Randy Weitzel \u2013 rhythm guitar *Travis Johnson \u2013 bass guitar *Tom Hane \u2013 drums, percussions ==References== Category:2014 singles Category:2014 songs Category:Atlantic Records singles Category:In This Moment songs Category:Songs with feminist themes Category:Songs written by Kevin Churko ",
