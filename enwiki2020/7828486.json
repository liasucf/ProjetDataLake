    "text": "is a 1988 beat 'em up arcade game developed and published by Irem in Japan and Europe and published in North America by Data East. It is considered as a spiritual sequel to Irem's earlier Kung-Fu Master. ==Description== ===Plot=== The game takes place in downtown New York City. The game's plot involves a lone, professional martial artist who became a vigilante to fight an evil gang called the Skinheads ruled by a man known as the Giant Devil, in order to protect his \"turf\" and save a female hostage named Madonna, who was kidnapped by them. ===Gameplay=== Screenshot of Vigilante (arcade version). Players control the titular character using punches and kicks to defeat the Skinheads in a 2D platform manner, while sometimes picking up and using nunchaku against them. If players get hurt while holding nunchuku, they become unarmed. There are five stages in order of appearance: a street, a junkyard, the Brooklyn Bridge, a back street scene and on top of a building that is under construction. Skinheads with Mohawk or spiked hairdo attack the vigilante with knives, chains, motorbikes, rifles and other kinds of weapons. They will also cling to him if he stands too close to them. ==Ports and related releases== The arcade game was later ported to several different home computers and consoles. The Sega Master System version was ported by Arc System Works and published exclusively in North America and Europe by Sega, and is one of several games in the console to include an FM sound switch for enhanced music quality. In the Sega Master System version, Madonna was renamed \"Maria\" and the Skinheads were called the \"Rogues\". The ones for Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Atari ST, Amiga and the Amstrad CPC were reprogrammed by Emerald Software and published by U.S. Gold mostly in Europe. The MSX version was ported and published by Korean company Clover.Clover at Generation MSX - Software Database. Date retrieved October 31, 2009. The TurboGrafx-16 version was ported and published in Japan on January 14, 1989 by Irem and published in North America by NEC the same year. This port matches the arcade more than other ports. The TurboGrafx-16 version was later re-released globally for Nintendo's Virtual Console for the Wii in North America on February 5, 2007,https://web.archive.org/web/20111204214244/http://www.nintendo.com:80/games/gameGuide?download=classic&age;=18&page;=17&view;=grid&sort;=&source;=https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/v0KnrVb9sI9p1kuJzlCTOd5EnCF3O-7i#game- info in Japan on February 6, 2007,https://www.nintendo.co.jp/wii/vc/software/02.html in Europe on February 9, 2007, and in Australia on July 6, 2007, but was delisted on March 30, 2012 (on March 31 in Europe) before it returned in September 2013.
