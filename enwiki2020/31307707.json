Originally conceived as an ice and spumoni stand prior to World War II, it grew during the mid-1950s into a full-scale pizzeria that's known today primarily for its Sicilian pizza and ices. The restaurant has been featured on the show Man v. Food. NY Eater critic Robert Sietsema considers L&B; Spumoni Gardens a must- try Italian American restaurant in Brooklyn. They were featured on Andrew Zimmern\u2019s show The Zimmern List. ==History== Founder Ludovico Barbati came to the United States in 1917 from Torella dei Lombardi, Italy. In 1938, Barbati sold pizza from a horse and wagon. In 1939, he purchased a vacant property on 86th Street to make the spumoni and ice. By the mid 1950s, the location came to be L&B; Spumoni Gardens, with the spumoni factory, a pizzeria and a luncheonette all on site. In 2016, one of the co-owners, Louis Barbati, 61, was murdered outside his home in Dyker Heights. In 2019, another co-owner, Patricia Barbati Coffey, 56, died after a seven-year battle with ALS. ==See also== * List of restaurants in New York City ==References== ==External links== * Category:1939 establishments in New York (state) Category:Italian- American culture in New York City Category:Pizzerias in New York City Category:Restaurants established in 1939 Category:Restaurants in Brooklyn Category:Sicilian-American cuisine ",
