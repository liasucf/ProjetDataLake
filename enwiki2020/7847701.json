    "text": "Theta Ceti, Latinized from \u03b8 Ceti, is a solitary, orange-hued star in the equatorial constellation of Cetus. It is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 3.60. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 28.66 mas as seen from Earth, it is located about 114 light years from the Sun. At that distance, the visual magnitude is diminished by an extinction factor of 0.10 due to interstellar dust. With an age of about 2.2 billion years, this is an evolved, K-type giant star with a stellar classification of K0 III. It is a red clump star on the horizontal branch, which means it is generating energy through helium fusion at its core. The star has an estimated 1.8 times the mass of the Sun and has expanded to 10 times the Sun's radius. It is radiating 53 times the solar luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 4,660 K. ==Name== In the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi Al Mouakket, this star was designated Thanih al Naamat (\u062b\u0627\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0627\u062a - th\u0101n\u012b al-na\u02bd\u0101m\u0101t), which was translated into Latin as Secunda Struthionum, meaning the second ostrich. This star, along with \u03b7 Cet (Deneb Algenubi), \u03c4 Cet (Thalath Al Naamat), \u03b6 Cet (Baten Kaitos)and \u03c5 Cet, were Al Na\u02bd\u0101m\u0101t (\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0627\u062a), the Hen Ostriches.\u03b7 Cet as Aoul al Naamat or Prima Struthionum (the first ostrich), \u03b8 Cet as Thanih al Naamat or Secunda Struthionum (the second ostrich), \u03c4 Cet as Thalath al Naamat or Tertia Struthionum (the third ostrich), and \u03b6 Cet as Rabah al Naamat or Quarta Struthionum (the fourth ostrich). \u03c5 Cet should be Khamis al Naamat or Quinta Struthionum (the fifth ostrich) consistently, but Al Achsasi Al Mouakket designated the title the fifth ostrich to \u03b3 Gam with uncleared consideration. In Chinese, (), meaning Square Celestial Granary, refers to an asterism consisting of \u03b8 Ceti, \u03b9 Ceti, \u03b7 Ceti, \u03b6 Ceti, \u03c4 Ceti and 57 Ceti. \u4e2d\u570b\u661f\u5ea7\u795e\u8a71, written by \u9673\u4e45\u91d1.
