In April 2015, MCFN had an enrolled population of 2,330 people, 850 of whom lived on the MCFN Reserve. The first nation governs the 2,392.6-hectare parcel of New Credit 40A Indian Reserve known as Reserve 40B near Hagersville, Ontario. This reserve is located near the Six Nations of the Grand River in Brantford. In the 19th century, the Mississaugas wanted to move from a reserve in the present-day City of Mississauga. Unable to make an agreement with the colonial government of the time, the Six Nations Confederacy offered the Mississaugas of land inside their own property as a compensation to the Mississaugas for their authorization for the purchase of the land in 1784 that they currently reside on. The reserve is territory granted to Six Nations as gratitude for allying with the British during the American Revolutionary War by the Haldimand Proclamation. The Six Nations is the only reserve in the Canadian system with a subsection reserve. The Mississaugas eventually purchased the land gifted as well as an additional for a sum of $10,000.00 on June 15, 1903, for the all- time right of undisturbed use and occupancy of the land. The reserve as it stands today consists of lots 1 to 12 in the first and second concessions in the Township of Tuscarora, in the County of Brant, and lots 1-12 in the first and second concessions in the Township of Oneida. In 1997, MCFN purchased an additional bordering on Highway 6, Hagersville. The First Nation made claims to land on which Toronto sits through the disputed Toronto Purchase of 1787. In 2010, Canada agreed to pay for the lands, based on the historic value of the land, extrapolated to current dollars. The money was distributed to the band government, with each of the 1,700 present day Mississaugas receiving $20,000, with the rest placed in trust for future generations. The Band put a controversial hold on new band membership during this time, ostensibly to preserve the greatest financial gain possible. The multi-million dollar settlement was only given to previously registered members despite any valid claims to membership.Source: New Credit Band Council meeting minutes, 2010\u201311 On January 8, 2019 the Mississaugas of the New Credit announced that they would rename as The Mississaugas of the Credit. == Prominent members == * Harry LaForme, appellate court judge, served as head of the Indian Residential Schools Truth and Reconciliation Commission * Walt Secord, Australian politician. ==References== ==External links== *Official website of the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation *AANDC profile Category:First Nations governments in Ontario Category:Mississauga First Nation Category:Association of Iroquois and Allied Indians Category:Mississauga reserves in Ontario Category:Communities in Norfolk County, Ontario Category:Communities in Haldimand County ",
