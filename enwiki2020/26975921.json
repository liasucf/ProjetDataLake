Henry Behr of Hamburg, Germany initially established a piano company in New York alongside Leopold Peck (of \"Hardman Peck Piano Company\") in 1877, named \"Behr & Peck\", which operated until 1879. In 1880, Behr and his brother Edward Behr went into partnership to form \"H. Behr and Brother Piano Company\", although this later changed to \"Behr, Brother and Company\", followed by \"Behr Brothers & Company\". The company was taken over by Kohler & Campbell in 1910, who continued to produce pianos under the Behr name until the 1950s.
