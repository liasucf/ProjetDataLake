    "text": "Pulsar is a steel launched shuttle roller coaster at Walibi Belgium in Wavre, Belgium. It opened on 4 June 2016 as the first PowerSplash model by German manufacturer Mack Rides. ==Characteristics== A view of Pulsar's turntable station. While one side of the turntable is lined up with the rest of the track, a vehicle can load riders on the other side. Pulsar is in height, reaches a maximum speed of , and has a track length of . The ride has two cars, each of which seats 20 riders in 5 rows of 4 riders each. The ride can accommodate a maximum of 950 riders per hour. The ride uses a turntable that enables one vehicle to be loaded while the other is running the course. ===Ride experience=== Once riders are loaded, the turntable station rotates to align the car with the rest of the track. The car then accelerates backwards over a small hill before travelling through a straight section of track. This straight section of track forms the ride's splashdown pool, which is empty at this point in the ride. The car then travels part of the way up a vertical spike of track before travelling forwards over the hill. The car then launches forward into a second vertical spike and comes back down before entering a third backwards launch. While the car is on the vertical spike at the back end of the ride's layout, the splashdown pool fills with water in approximately six seconds. The car then travels down the spike and enters the splashdown pool, which is now filled with water. This serves to slow the car down before it re-enters the turntable to unload riders. ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Pulsar at Coaster-Net Category:Roller coasters introduced in 2016 Category:Roller coasters in Belgium ",
