He is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, class of 1997.

Mike Webster Webster was the first former NFL player diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).Late Steelers great Webster's case launched the CTE brain debate emotion based reference Pittsburgh Post-Gazette May 14, 2013 Since his death, he has become a symbol for head injuries in the NFL and the ongoing debate over player safety. His doctors were of the opinion that multiple concussions during his career damaged his frontal lobe, which caused cognitive dysfunction. Webster died in 2002 at the age of 50 of a heart attack. == Football career == Mike Webster was regarded as the best center in the Big Ten during most of his career at the University of Wisconsin. At 6-foot-1, 255 pounds, he was drafted in the fifth round of the 1974 NFL Draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. Serving as a backup at center and guard for two years while being mentored by veteran center Ray Mansfield, Webster became the team's starting center in 1976, where he remained for 150 consecutive games. He was the Steelers' offensive captain for nine years. This ended in 1986 when he dislocated his elbow, causing him to sit out for four games. With the Steelers winning Super Bowl IX, X, XIII, and XIV, Webster and Terry Bradshaw form one of the most well-known center\u2013quarterback pairs in history. Webster was honored as an All-Pro seven times and played in the Pro Bowl nine times. An avid weightlifter, Webster was known for playing with bare arms to keep opponents from grabbing his sleeves.Colin Webster. Reflections in Iron: Mike Webster\u2019s Training Methods. 2011. Webster is also perhaps the best-known of a long line of All-Pro centers for the Steelers. From 1964 to 2006, just four men started at that position: Mansfield, Webster, Dermontti Dawson and Jeff Hartings. In his last year in Pittsburgh, Webster returned the favor by mentoring the then-rookie Dawson in the same manner Mansfield had mentored Webster earlier in his career. === Retirement and legacy === Webster was a free agent after 1988 season. He was signed by the Kansas City Chiefs, who initially made him an offensive line coach before allowing him to return as the starting center. Webster played two seasons in Kansas City before announcing his retirement on March 11, 1991 after a 17-year career with a total of 245 games played at center.https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/12/sports/sports-people-pro-football- webster-retires.html At the time of his retirement, he was the last active player in the NFL to have played on all four Super Bowl winning teams of the 1970s Steelers. At the time of his retirement, he had played more seasons as a Steeler than anyone else in franchise history (15 seasons), one season ahead of Terry Bradshaw and Hines Ward. Ben Roethlisberger tied Webster's record in the 2018 season, and is poised to break it in 2020. While, at the time of his retirement, the Steelers were no longer officially retiring jerseys, Webster's No. 52 has not been reissued by the team since he retired. In 1999, he was ranked number 75 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. The football stadium at Rhinelander High School, his alma mater, is named Mike Webster Stadium in his honor.Hodag Facilities Foundation :: Home Webster was elected to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 2007. == Post- football life == Webster was proven to have been disabled before retiring from the NFL. After retirement, Webster had amnesia, dementia, depression, and acute bone and muscular pain. He lived out of his pickup truck or in train stations between Wisconsin and Pittsburgh, even though his friends and former teammates offered to rent apartments for him. Teammate Terry Bradshaw regularly covered expenses for Webster and his family, while Steelers owner Dan Rooney paid for a hotel room for Webster for over three months.Jeanne Marie Laksak, Concussion (2015). Nonetheless, Webster continued to disappear for weeks at a time without explanation and without contact with friends and family. He exhibited unusual changes in behavior, and became so agitated and restless that he used electroshock weapons on himself to induce sleep.Laksak, 2015 In his last years Webster lived with his youngest son, Garrett, who though only a teenager at the time, moved from Wisconsin to Pittsburgh to care for his father. Webster's wife Pamela divorced him six months before his death in 2002 of a heart attack at age 50.Frank Litsky. \"Mike Webster, 50, Dies; Troubled Football Hall of Famer\". The New York Times, September 25, 2002. Accessed December 26, 2015.\"Tyler Drenon. \"Mike Webster autopsy 'one of the most significant moments in the history of sports'\". SB Nation, October 8, 2013. Webster was cremated and his ashes were returned to his wife and their four children. === Illness === After death, Mike Webster was diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease.Researchers: Late NFL player had degenerative brain condition - ESPN Webster was the first former NFL player diagnosed with CTE. Dr. Bennet Omalu, a forensic neuropathologist, examined tissue from Webster and eight other NFL players and determined they all showed the kind of brain damage previously seen in people with Alzheimer's disease or dementia, as well as in some retired boxers. Webster's brain resembled those of boxers with \"dementia pugilistica\", also known as \"punch-drunk syndrome\". Omalu's findings were largely ignored by the NFL until Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chris Henry was diagnosed with CTE shortly after his death at age 26 in 2009.Chris Henry data sound football alarm , ESPN. com, Johnette Howard, June 29, 2010. Webster's son Garrett now serves as the administrator to the Brain Injury Research Institute in Pittsburgh, which is dedicated to encouraging individuals who have had head trauma to donate their brains after death as well as being an advocate to players who have similar conditions that his father had. It has been speculated that Webster's ailments were due to wear and tear sustained over his playing career; some doctors estimated he had been in the equivalent of \"25,000 automobile crashes\" in over 25 years of playing football at the high school, college and professional levels. His wife Pamela stated years later that she felt that she caused Webster's change in personality in the years before his death and placed guilt on herself over her decision to divorce Webster, until discovering after his death about the CTE diagnosis. Webster played during an era when protective equipment (especially helmets) was inferior, and head injuries were simply considered part of the game. At the time of his death, Webster was addicted to prescription medication. Nicknamed \"Iron Mike\", Webster's reputation for durability led him to play even through injuries. Contrary to rumors, Webster never admitted to using anabolic steroids during his career, even though they were legal at the time. His struggle with mental illness, as a result of CTE, at the end of his life was featured in the 2015 film Concussion. Webster was portrayed by David Morse and Dr. Bennet Omalu was portrayed by Will Smith. === Lawsuit === Webster's estate brought a lawsuit in Maryland's U.S. District Court against the National Football League. The estate contended that Webster was disabled at the time of his retirement, and was owed $1.142 million in disability payments under the NFL's retirement plan. On April 26, 2005, a federal judge ruled that the NFL benefits plan owed Webster's estate $1.18 million in benefits. With the addition of interest and fees, that amount was estimated to exceed $1.60 million. The NFL appealed the ruling. On December 13, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Virginia, affirmed the Baltimore federal judge's 2005 ruling that the league's retirement plan must pay benefits reserved for players whose disabilities began while they were still playing football. == References == ==External links== * Pro Football Hall of Fame: member biography Category:1952 births Category:2002 deaths Category:American Conference Pro Bowl players Category:American football centers Category:Pittsburgh Steelers players Category:Wisconsin Badgers football players Category:Kansas City Chiefs players Category:People from Tomahawk, Wisconsin Category:Players of American football from Wisconsin Category:Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Super Bowl champions Category:People from Rhinelander, Wisconsin Category:People with traumatic brain injuries Category:American football long snappers Category:Sportspeople with chronic traumatic encephalopathy ",
