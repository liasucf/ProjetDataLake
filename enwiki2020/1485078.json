    "text": "The desman, a snouted and naked-tailed diving insectivore of the tribe Desmanini (also considered a subfamily, Desmaninae), belongs to one of two Eurasian species of the mole family, Talpidae. This tribe consists of two monotypic genera of semiaquatic insectivores found in Europe: one in Russia and the other in the northwest of the Iberian peninsula and Pyrenees. Both species are considered to be vulnerable. They have webbed paws and their front paws are not well-adapted for digging. Desmans were much more diverse during the Miocene epoch, with one genus, Gaillardia, being present in North America. The list of species is: *Genus Desmana **Russian desman (D. moschata) *Genus Galemys **Pyrenean desman (G. pyrenaicus) * Galemys pyrenaicus MHNT.INS.29.jpg|Galemys pyrenaicus ==In the media== The bare snout of Galemys pyrenaicus * * ==References== Category:Talpidae Category:Aquatic mammals Category:Taxa named by Oldfield Thomas ",
