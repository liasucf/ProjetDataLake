The magazine was launched by Tom Symes who ran the brand from 1999-2003 when Jonathan Verk took over as Publisher. Verk ran the publication from 2003 - 2008 during which tome he introduced several new profitable events and published products including Boards U, The Boards Creative Workshops and a Post Production Resource Guide. Each issue of Boards contained several regular feature columns, including: \"Word\" (an editorial), \"Radar\" (industry news), \"Ideas\" (commentary on various aspects of advertising), interviews with various industry figures, as well as sections catering to the various sectors of the advertising industry (creative, music and sound, post-production and editing, animation, etc). In addition, starting in May 2009, \"Boards Online\" began publishing daily content updates such as \"behind the scenes\" features, video links, and commentary on awards ceremonies and particularly striking or successful advertising campaigns. Editors of the magazine made a number of attempts to improve brand awareness by holding various events. These included \"Boards U\", an educational event for junior producers; the \"Boards Creative Workshop\", a networking event bringing various industry figures together; and the \"First Boards Awards\", an annual awards ceremony celebrating the best new advertising campaigns. ==References== ==External links== *Boards website Category:Advertising industry Category:Monthly magazines published in Canada Category:Defunct magazines published in Canada Category:Magazines established in 1999 Category:Magazines disestablished in 2010 Category:Magazines published in Toronto Category:Professional and trade magazines Category:Magazines about advertising ",
