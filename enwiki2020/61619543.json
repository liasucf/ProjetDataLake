    "text": "Rory Shayne (born Berkhard Bateman; 23 March 1951) is a bank robber who gained notoriety for brazen heists committed in British Columbia and Quebec in the 1970s and 1980s. Shayne was born in Hamburg, Germany, to a Canadian father and German mother. Shayne's parents abandoned him when he was two years old, after which he was placed in a Hamburg orphanage and then a foster home. Shayne had scar tissue on his chest that he claimed was from his foster mother having cut his face when he was four years old, then burning his chest with boiling water to make the injuries appear as an accident. In Victoria, British Columbia, on 24 September 1970, Shayne led police on a daring chase which included a gunfight, hostage taking, and the commandeering of a sailing vessel. Taxi driver Dunc Addison picked up Shayne as a passenger in downtown Victoria and unknowingly drove him to the crime scene, a Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Shayne returned to the cab after robbing the bank and claimed he had to get to the airport by 1 pm. Addison did not realize what had happened until Shayne fired shots through the rear window at pursuing police officers. ==References== Category:1951 births Category:20th-century Canadian criminals Category:Canadian bank robbers Category:Canadian male criminals Category:German emigrants to Canada Category:People from Hamburg Category:Possibly living people ",
