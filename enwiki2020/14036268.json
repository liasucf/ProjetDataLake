    "text": "A Place to Land is the third studio album by American country music group Little Big Town. Released in 2007 as their second album on the independent Equity Music Group label, it features the single \"I'm with the Band\", which peaked at number 32 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts in late 2007. In 2008, the group left Equity Music Group for Capitol Records Nashville, which acquired the rights to the album. Capitol re-released the album on October 14, 2008 with extra tracks. One addition to the re-issue is a live cover of The Dream Academy's \"Life in a Northern Town\", which Little Big Town performed with Jake Owen and Sugarland in late 2007. This live rendition, though not released as a single, charted at number 28 on the country charts and number 43 on the Billboard Hot 100 in mid-2008. Following this live rendition were the singles \"Fine Line\" (which peaked at number 31) and \"Good Lord Willing\" (which peaked at number 43). ==Track listing== All songs written by Little Big Town and Wayne Kirkpatrick except where noted. ==Personnel== ;Little Big Town * Karen Fairchild \u2013 vocals * Kimberly Roads Schlapman \u2013 vocals * Phillip Sweet \u2013 vocals, acoustic guitar, stomping * Jimi Westbrook \u2013 vocals, acoustic guitar, Dobro, stomping ;Additional musicians * Dan Dugmore \u2013 Dobro, pedal steel guitar, lap steel guitar * Shannon Forrest \u2013 drums * Gordon Kennedy \u2013 acoustic guitar, electric guitar * Wayne Kirkpatrick \u2013 acoustic guitar, 12-string guitar, National steel guitar, mandolin, mando-guitar, banjo, dulcimer, Hammond B-3 organ, clavinet, tambourine, shaker, stomping, background vocals * Randy Kohrs \u2013 Dobro * Chris McHugh \u2013 drums * Phil Madeira \u2013 Hammond B-3 organ * Jimmie Lee Sloas \u2013 bass guitar ==Chart performance== ===Album=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
