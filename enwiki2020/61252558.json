The company is located on three sites in Manchester, Birmingham and London with their head office in Skipton, North Yorkshire. == History == The company was founded in 1827 by Antonio Fattorini an Italian speaking immigrant who was born in 1797, from Bellagio near Como in the north of Italy and who settled in Yorkshire where he began to trade in jewellery, watches and barometers. He was one of many Italian immigrants who came to in England between 1790s and 1851 at the time when the Napoleonic wars left northern Italy with a destroyed agriculture and much hardship. The regional origins of most of the Italian immigrants were the valleys around Como, and Lucca with the people from Como being skilled artisans, making barometers and other precision instruments. The first record of him trading was at Upton Yard off Briggate, Leeds 1826. The retail outlets that he established were consolidated in the first generation into three enterprises: Thomas Fattorini in Skipton established in 1827 with the assistance of his brother-in-law Baldisaro Porri who was also a barometer maker and merchant in Skipton, Fattorini and Sons in Bradford in 1829, and Antonio Fattorini in Harrogate in 1831. During the First World War the company manufactured badges for the armed forces, including the Royal Flying Corps (R.F.C) badge, and Home Front badges for civilians. Thomas Fattorini Ltd registered its punch at various Assay offices: Birmingham (1918), Edinburgh (date?), London (date?) and Chester (1898). == The birth of mail order retailing in Britain == Mail Order retailing was founded in Britain by both Thomas Fattorini in Skipton and Fattorini & Sons in Bradford. They were the first companies that offered collective purchasing arrangements and began with the famous 'Watch clubs'. The rule of these clubs made it possible for individuals to buy unaffordable goods, and latterly services, by regular instalments over a period of time. The first watch club was held in Skipton in 1869. (Citation to be added). The businesses grew rapidly in the 1920s. Two Fattorini companies Empire Stores plc and Grattan plc (previously known as Grattan Warehouses Ltd) were listed on the London stock exchange. == Manufacturers of badges, medals & trophies == With the expanding trade in Skipton for medals and awards, the company opened its first factory in 1919 in Hockley street in the Jewellery Quarter Birmingham. In 1928 they moved into a purpose built Jewellery Factory on Regent Street, which was designed by Mansell & Mansell architects and built for Adie & Lovekin Ltd in 1894 who were also manufacturing jewellers. They renamed the Factory \"Trafalgar Works\".
