    "text": "Il mondo della luna (The World of the Moon) is an opera (dramma giocoso) in 3 acts by Baldassare Galuppi. The Italian-language libretto was by Carlo Goldoni. It premiered on 29 January 1750 at the Teatro San Mois\u00e8, Venice. The music has been described as \"clear, with expressivity obtained through melodic and textural changes.\" Galuppi's music exploits \"the capacity of the music to illustrate and portray the text,\" with special attention for Buonafede, credulous old man who is the central character of the plot. The opera by Galuppi is the first based on Goldoni's libretto. The same libretto was later also set by several other composers, such as Pedro Ant\u00f3nio Avondano (1765), Giovanni Paisiello (1774 under the title Il credulo deluso, 1783), Gennaro Astarita (1774), Joseph Haydn (1777), (1790, libretto revised by Domenico Somigli), and Marcos Portugal (1791, in Portuguese, under the title O lun\u00e1tico iludido).Pierpaolo Polzonetti, Italian Opera in the Age of the American Revolution. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011. p. 30. Paisiello composed four different versions of operas based on this libretto (one of them, 1783, was a reduction in two acts by Marco Coltellini; another, 1774, was performed as Il credulo deluso). ==Roles== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Role !Voice type !Premiere cast, 29 January 1750According to the original libretto, carlogoldoni.it, University of Padua (Conductor: \u2013 ) |- ||Ecclitico, a would-be astrologer||bass|| Alessandro Renda |- ||Buonafede, credulous man||bass||Francesco Baglioni |- ||Flaminia, daughter of Buonafede||soprano||Dionisia Lepri |- ||Clarice, another daughter of Buonafede||contralto||Serafina Penni |- ||Lisetta, maid||soprano||Costanza Russignuoli |- ||Ernesto||soprano (breeches role)||Berenice Penni |- ||Cecco, servant of Ernesto||bass||Francesco Carrattoli |} ==Synopsis== See synopsis in Haydn's Il mondo della luna. ==Recordings== {| class=wikitable !colspan=2| 1997: Franco Piva, Intermusica Ensemble, Bongiovanni Cat: 2217/19 |- |valign=top style=\"border-right:none;\"|Ecclittico: Giorgio Gatti Buonafede: Gastone Sarti Flaminia: Paola Antonucci Clarice: Barbara di Castri |valign=top style=\"border-left:none;\"|Lisetta: Patrizia Cigna Ernesto: Enrico Pacini Cecco: Claudio Ottino |} ==References== Notes Sources * * (reproduced online at Opera Manager) ==External links== * * Category:Operas by Baldassare Galuppi Category:Italian-language operas Category:Operas Category:Drammi giocosi Category:1750 operas Category:Libretti by Carlo Goldoni Category:Science fiction operas Category:Moon in fiction Category:Works about the Moon ",
