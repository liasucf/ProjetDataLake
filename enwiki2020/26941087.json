The Council again welcomed the Dayton Agreement between Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and stressed the need for all parties to abide by that agreement. The role of UNPROFOR was also praised. Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Security Council extended UNPROFOR's mandate until 31 January 1996 pending further action on the implementation of the Dayton Agreement. The Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was invited to keep the Council informed on developments and submit reports on the implementation of the agreement and how it would affect the United Nations role. ==See also== * Bosnian War * Breakup of Yugoslavia * Croatian War of Independence * List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1001 to 1100 (1995\u20131997) * Yugoslav Wars ==References== ==External links== * *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org 1026 1026 Category:1995 in Yugoslavia Category:1995 in Bosnia and Herzegovina 1026 1026 1026 Category:November 1995 events ",
