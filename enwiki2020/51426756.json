    "text": "Leela is a name of Sanskrit origin. Like many Sanskrit words, it cannot be literally translated to English but can be loosely translated as \"play\" (noun). It is common to both non-dualistic and dualistic philosophical schools, but has a markedly different significance in each. Within non- dualism, Leela is a way of describing all reality, including the cosmos, as the outcome of creative play by the divine absolute (Brahman). ==Given name== * Leela Aheer (born 1970), Canadian politician * Leela Bunce (born 1980), British media personality * Leela Chitnis (1912\u20132003), Indian actress * Leela Corman, American cartoonist * Leela Desai (fl. 1937\u20131961), Indian actress * Leela Devi (1932\u20131998), Indian writer * Leela Devi Dookhun (born 1961), Mauritian cabinet minister * Leela Dube (1923\u20132012), Indian anthropologist * Leela Floyd, Singaporean-British writer * Leela Gandhi (born 1966), Indian- American academic * Leela Gilday, Dene-Canadian singer * Leela Grace (born 1977), American singer-songwriter * Leela Hamid (born 1984), Maldivian volleyball player * Leela Hazzah, Egyptian conservation biologist * Leela James (born 1983), American singer-songwriter * Leela Majumdar (1908\u20132007), Bengali writer * Leela Damodara Menon (born 1923), Indian politician * Leela Mishra (1908\u20131988), Indian actress * Leela Naidu (1940\u20132009), Indian actress * Leela Nambudiripad (born 1934), Indian children's author * Leela Omchery (born 1929), Indian singer and writer * Leela Roy (1900\u20131970), Indian politician * Leela Samson (born 1951), Indian dancer and writer * Leela Savasta, Canadian actress * Leela Soma, Indian-Scottish writer * Leela Sumant Moolgaokar (1916\u20131992), Indian social worker ==Surname== * Chindodi Leela (1937\u20132010), Indian actress and politician * Kulappulli Leela, Indian actress * P.
