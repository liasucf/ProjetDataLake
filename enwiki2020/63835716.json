I find it easier to communicate and collaborate when working with women. I grew up surrounded by amazing women, and my favorite films are led by women.\" Abbas also mentioned that the winner of the short film contest was filmmaker Sindha Agha. ==Release== In May 2020, The Hollywood Reporter released a first-look of the feature with major information.
