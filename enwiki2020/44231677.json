Unhappy at home and work, he begins keeping company with a co-worker, Myrna Duchane. He spends a great deal of time at home doing experiments in his basement. Atterbury's wife disappears one day. A lodger, law student Judy Carlton, arrives unexpectedly, having been rented a room by Atterbury's wife. Judy and a neighbor, Mrs. Lazlow, both begin to suspect foul play in Mrs. Atterbury's absence and express concerns to Cantrick, the town sheriff. Denying that anything is occurring in his cellar except work-related research, Atterbury is cleared of suspicion when his wife suddenly returns, having been away at a sanitarium. But as soon as all suspicions are averted, Atterbury begins to concoct a new experiment. == Cast == *Jonathan Kidd as Alvin Atterbury *Doris Dowling as Myrna Duchane *Barbara Turner as Judy Carlton *Irene Seidner as Mrs. Lazlow *Jaclynne Greene as Mrs. Atterbury *Wally Brown as Sheriff Cantrick *Taylor Holmes as Mr. Vanryzin *Max Rich as Max *Paul Smith as Ben Lazlow *Jack Grinnage as Delivery Boy *Lucien Littlefield as Old Man *Rodney Bell as Rand *Dick Nelson as Butler *Sam E.
