    "text": "Victoria Neave (born December 29, 1980) is an American attorney and a Democratic member of the Texas House of Representatives for District 107 in Dallas County, Texas. In the general election held on November 8, 2016, she unseated Republican Representative Kenneth Sheets in the most expensive Texas House race of the 2016 cycle. Neave was sworn into office on January 10, 2017. During the 2017 Legislative Session, State Rep. Victoria Neave attended Catholic mass at the Cathedral Shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe in Dallas, asked the priest for a blessing and received Holy Communion as she started a spiritual fast to oppose an anti \u201csanctuary city\u201d bill that the Texas House was going to debate. Neave was arrested in June 2017 on a Driving While Intoxicated charge after she allegedly crashed her BMW into a tree within district 107 at 11:30 p.m. She allegedly repeatedly told arresting officers that \"I love you and I want to fight for you, and I invoke the Fifth Amendment.\" Neave said after her arrest that she was \"deeply sorry, and will accept the consequences of my actions, and will work to make this right.\" As a local attorney and legislator, concerns were expressed at favoritism by police and prosecutors towards Neave. In its 2018 endorsement of Neve, the Dallas Morning News editorial board wrote that \"She accepted full responsibility and didn't use her role as an elected official to try to get out of trouble.\" Neave was reelected to her second term in the general election held on November 6, 2018, when she defeated the Republican candidate, Deanna Maria Metzger, 28,923 (57.1 percent) to 21,770 (42.9 percent). Neave was selected as one of seventeen speakers to jointly deliver the keynote address at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. ==References== |- Category:1980 births Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Living people Category:Members of the Texas House of Representatives Category:Politicians from Dallas Category:Texas Democrats Category:Texas lawyers Category:Thurgood Marshall School of Law alumni Category:Women state legislators in Texas ",
