He ended the 2010\u20132011 regular season as the second highest scorer of the team, with 9 goals, after Anorthosis' striker, Semedo Cafu, who scored 13 goals. ====Season 2011\u201312==== In the summer of 2011, Laban renewed his contract with Anorthosis for another five years. Laban scored his first goal of the season against Ethnikos Achna on 16 December 2011.

When the opportunity came up, he decided to represent his adopted nation and made his debut for Cyprus on 15 August 2012, in the 0-1 loss against Bulgaria in a friendly match. He scored his first ever International goal for the Cypriots in a 3-1 away defeat to Albania in the opening game of a 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification group game on 7 September 2012. His second ever Cypriot goal came in a 2-1 away defeat to Wales in a UEFA Euro 2016 qualification group game on 13 October 2014. Aware of the need to convince the rest of the country that he belonged in the national side, Laban admitted to feeling a great deal of pressure. \"I was scared of being out of place, of not being accepted by the fans and the team, of being seen as a foreigner who was taking the place of local players,\" he recalled. \"Every time I went to the national side, I had to prove that I deserved to wear the shirt. I also felt a little self-conscious about the fact I don\u2019t speak Greek very well, even though I understand it.\" Typically, however, Laban was determined to win the fans over: \"I asked myself how I might be able to reach out to them, so I decided to learn the national anthem. It was an important symbolic gesture as far as I was concerned, because it\u2019s a sign of your attachment to your country. That\u2019s why I learned it. I was so nervous, though. I focused hard on the words and did all I could not to make a mistake.\" The impact was immediate, as Cyprus\u2019 1.2 million fanatical football fans took Laban to their hearts. Three years on from his international debut, Laban has become one of the most popular players in the side and an inspirational force in Cyprus\u2019 surprisingly strong start to their UEFA EURO 2016 qualifying campaign. The Galanolefki lie third in Group B, behind Israel and Wales but ahead of Belgium, who have a match in hand. Also trailing in their wake are Bosnia and Herzegovina, who appeared at the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil and then lost at home to the unfancied Cypriots last September. \"We put in a terrific performance there, because they\u2019ve got the likes of Edin Dzeko and Miralem Pjanic and they\u2019re a very good side,\" said Laban, who celebrated his 30th birthday that day and is hoping for another dream result against Belgium in Brussels on Saturday. Acknowledging just how hard that task will be, he said: \"We\u2019ve made a good start to the qualifiers and I\u2019m hoping we can keep it going. It\u2019s going to be very tough, though. In football you have to be realistic and know your place.\" ===International goals=== :Scores and results list Cyprus' goal tally first. {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- ! # !! Date !! Venue !!
