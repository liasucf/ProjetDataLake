He loves Lucille (Ferguson), daughter of John Danby (MacDowell). Sales manager Richard Mower (Clary) is his rival for Lucille's affections. Bruce and the elder Danby quarrel, and Bruce is discharged, but Lucille stays faithful to him and they are married. Richard takes Bruce's place, but Danby is unaware that the promoted sales manager is stealing from him. The peace of Bruce's wedded life vanishes when Richard makes a call on Lucille. Bruce flares into a rage and makes such an exhibition of himself that his wife leaves him, returning to her father. The deserted husband goes fast downhill, but is still anxious to protect the Danby's from Richard's crooked work in the plant. Bruce, disguised, gets a job as a laborer in the plant and secures final evidence of Richard's guilt. Danby and his daughter enter the plant and witness a robbery executed by Richard and a confederate. Richard locks his employer and Lucille in a vault. Encountering Bruce outside, he fires a shot but misses him. The bullet strikes some fireworks and the plant explodes in sections. Bruce struggles desperately through the furnace of projectiles and exploding dynamite and rescues his wife and her father. ==Cast== *Frank Mayo as Bruce Henderson *Helen Ferguson as Lucille Danby *Melbourne MacDowell as John Danby *Charles Clary as Richard Mower *Albert MacQuarrie as Jones *Tom Kennedy as Ben ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1922 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American drama films Category:1922 drama films Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Films directed by Edward Sedgwick Category:American silent feature films Category:American black-and-white films ",
