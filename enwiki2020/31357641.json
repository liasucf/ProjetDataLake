    "text": "Chhatna is a village and a gram panchayat in the Chhatna CD block in the Bankura Sadar subdivision of the Bankura district in the state of West Bengal, India. ==History== According to the historian Binoy Ghosh, three places claimed to be the home of the medieval lyrical poet of Bengal, Chandidas \u2013 Chhatna in Bankura district, Nanoor in Birbhum district and Ketugram in Bardhaman district. The issue became more complicated with conflicting claims clouding the historical scenario. Three persons associated with the name of Chandidas emerged and they have been identified separately with the prefix \u2018Baru\u2019, \u2018Dwija\u2019 and \u2018Din\u2019.Ghosh, Binoy, Paschim Banger Sanskriti, , part I, 1976 edition, pages 369-374, Prakash Bhaban, Kolkata In the 14th-15th century, Chhatna was the capital of a kingdom named Samantabhum. The feudatory ruling family of Samantabhum was established by Sankha Roy. According to local hearsay, two brothers, Chandidas and Devidas came from outside and settled in Chhatna under the patronage of Hamir Uttar Roy, grandson of Sankha Roy. Devidas was appointed priest in the temple of Basuli Devi and Chandidas was a poet. In 1916, Basanta Ranjan Roy Bidvatballava of Beliatore found an unpublished manuscript of Chandidas, edited it and had it published under the title Srikrishnakirtan. Another factor in favour of Chhatna is the widespread worship of Basuli Devi in and around Chhatna, something not seen in the Birbhum-Bardhaman area. In Birbhum the deity worshipped was Bisalakshmi Devi. However, the name Basuli seems to have been derived from Bisalakshmi. Hamir Uttar Roy ruled from 1353 to 1404 AD. From the dates of composition of Srikrishnakirtan, it is evident that Chandidas lived during the rule of Hamir Uttar Roy. It is generally accepted that Baru Chandidas belonged to Chhatna. ==Geography== ===Location=== Chhatna is located at . ===Area overview=== The map alongside shows the Bankura Sadar subdivision of Bankura district.
