The game requires the use of the Renaissance Deluxe rulebook. From the back of the book : \"The Adventures of the Bow Street Runners in their Struggle Against the Minions of the Cthulhu Mythos London, 1749: A city of vice, crime and misery. Gangs of ruffians rule the streets, unopposed. Brothels proliferate. Child-beggars starve in filthy gutters. Corrupt night-watchmen and thief-takers turn a blind eye to wrongdoing. And dark creatures lurk in back alleys, called from beyond by the desperate with nothing left to lose. But there is a new force on the streets of London; for the author and magistrate Henry Fielding has teamed up with his brother John to form the city\u2019s first police force \u2013 the Bow Street Runners. The Fieldings have persuaded parliament to fund their crime-fighting endeavour, but they know that there is something behind the vice \u2013 for John Fielding\u2019s blind eyes can see things that others cannot \u2013 things that man was not meant to know.\"http://clockworkandchivalry.co.uk/games/renaissance-2/dark-streets/ == Game mechanics == The game uses the Renaissance Deluxe which is an Open Games Licence rules system, created by Cakebread & Walton with task rolls based on a percentile or D100 roll == Releases == * Dark Streets: Print and pdf - Core rules * Hellfire: Print and pdf - Adventure * The Case of the Missing Professor: pdf - Adventure * Tomes of Blasphemous Knowledge: pdf - Source material * Guardians of Blasphemous Knowledge: pdf - Source material ==References== == External links == * Dark Streets at Cakebread & Walton * Dark Streets review Category:Role-playing games introduced in 2012 Category:Campaign settings Category:Horror role-playing games Category:British role-playing games ",
