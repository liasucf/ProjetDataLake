Johnston and as Franz Johnston, (June 19, 1888July 19, 1949) was a member of the Group of Seven. ==Life and career== Frank Johnston was born on June 19, 1888 in Toronto, the son of Hugh Hans and Mary Elizabeth (Roderick) Johnston. He was educated at Central Technical School in Toronto, studying with Gustav Hahn, and the Central Ontario School of Art with William Cruikshank and George Agnew Reid. In 1908, he joined Grip Ltd. as a commercial artist. In 1910, he left for the United States where he studied art in Philadelphia and worked in commercial design in New York. Upon his return to Toronto in 1915, he used his spare time from commercial art to pursue landscape painting, through sketching trips around Toronto. In 1918, he was commissioned by the Canadian War Memorials to record Canadian flying personnel training for overseas duty. From 1918 on, he joined Lawren Harris and J.E.H. MacDonald on their journeys to Algoma. His paintings from those years express a strong decorative interpretation of the landscape, but he often employed tempera rather than oil paint to search out the pattern and texture of his subject. Johnston's rate of production was such that in the 1919 Algoma show at the Art Gallery of Toronto he contributed sixty works - more than any other artist. A few months later, he asserted his independence even more, having a large one-man show of 200 paintings at the T. Eaton Company Galleries. In 1920, he was invited to join the Group of Seven, but his association with it was brief. He did take part in the Group's first exhibition of 1920, but by 1921 he had left Toronto to become Principal at the Winnipeg School of Art. He claimed that he had no disagreement with the group, only that he wanted to go his own way with regard to exhibition. Pools of Sapphire Frank Johnston 1941 Group of seven artists: Frederick Varley, A. Y. Jackson, Lawren Harris, Fairley, Frank Johnston (artist), Arthur Lismer, and J. E. H. MacDonald In 1925, Johnston changed his name to the more exotic first name of 'Franz' Johnston. By 1927, he was back in Toronto, workng as the principal at the Ontario College of Art. In later years, the artist's style became more realistic and revealed a strong fascination with the qualities of light, especially light on snow. This theme recurred in later works, in large narrative paintings of the 1930s and 1940s as well as more intimate examinations of a river valley, the bright blue of the water contrasting with snow-laden banks. His subjects range from the pastoral countryside of the Wyebridge area, to northern Quebec, and the Northwest Territories. He had begun to hold regular solo exhibitions in the 1920s and his paintings found a great following among the public. Unlike many Canadian artists, Johnston was able to achieve considerable financial success in his own lifetime. He was made a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. He was also a member of the Ontario Society of Artists. His work is in many public collections such as the National Gallery of Canada. He died in Toronto in 1949 and buried with his fellow members of the Group of Seven at McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. Of his four children, two were artists: Francis-Anne Johnston and Paul Roderick. A retrospective of his work was organized at the Rothmans Art Gallery, Stratford (today called Gallery Stratford) in 1970. == References == === Bibliography === * * ==External links== * *A brief history of the Canadian Group of Seven * *CBC Digital Archives - The Group of Seven: Painters in the Wilderness *Ontario Plaques - Franz Johnston Category:1888 births Category:1949 deaths Category:20th-century Canadian painters Category:Canadian male painters Category:Artists from Toronto Category:Artists from Winnipeg Category:Canadian landscape painters Category:Members of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts Category:OCAD University faculty ",
