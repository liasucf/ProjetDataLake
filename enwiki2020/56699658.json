JurisTech started off in 1997, during the Asian Financial Crisis, offering data mining and analytical tools that might help banks generate more sales. However, the company's initial offering of data mining services was not very popular, due to the rising bad debt during that period. The company then started offering credit management and litigation software. Their debt recovery software solution was a success, which resulted in JurisTech becoming an MSC Malaysia company in 2003.https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/startup-scaleups/creating-financial- change?page=2 In 2014, JurisTech was selected at the New York City International Selection Panel to be a part of the Endeavor (non-profit) network.
