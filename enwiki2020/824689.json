    "text": "Vampire Tales was an American black-and-white horror comics magazine published by Magazine Management, a corporate sibling of Marvel Comics. The series ran 11 issues and one annual publication from 1973 to 1975, and featuring vampires as both protagonists and antagonists. A magazine rather than a comic book, it did not fall under the purview of the comics industry's self-censorship Comics Code Authority, allowing the title to feature stronger content \u2014 such as moderate profanity, partial nudity, and more graphic violence \u2014 than the color comics of the time that featured Dracula stories. ==Publishing history== Vampire Tales ran 11 issues cover-dated 1973 to June 1975. With sister titles including Dracula Lives, Monsters Unleashed and Tales of the Zombie, it was published by Marvel Comics' parent company, Magazine Management, and related corporations, under the brand emblem Marvel Monster Group. Published bi- monthly, the magazine cost 75 cents.Vampire Tales at the Grand Comics Database.Marvel Monster Group (brand emblem) at the Grand Comics Database.
