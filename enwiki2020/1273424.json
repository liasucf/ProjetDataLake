    "text": "Alan Ameche (; June 1, 1933 \u2013 August 8, 1988), nicknamed \"The Iron Horse\", or simply \"The Horse\", was an American football player who played six seasons with the Baltimore Colts in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison and won the Heisman Trophy during his senior season in 1954. He was elected to the Pro Bowl in each of his first four seasons in the league. He is famous for scoring the winning touchdown in overtime in the 1958 NFL Championship Game against the New York Giants, labeled \"The Greatest Game Ever Played.\" With colleague and former Colts teammate Gino Marchetti, Ameche founded the Gino's Hamburgers chain. He also founded the Baltimore-based Ameche's Drive-in restaurants. ==Early life== Born in Kenosha, Wisconsin, as Lino Dante Amici to Italian immigrant parents who came to the United States in the late 1920s, although they returned for a year to Italy during his childhood. The family then returned to Kenosha, where he attended Bradford High School. Ameche was a cousin of actor brothers Don and Jim Ameche. ==College career== Ameche earned consensus All-America honors at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, where he played linebacker as well as fullback in single-platoon days. In four years as a Badger, he gained 3,212 yards, then the NCAA record, scored 25 touchdowns, and averaged 4.8 yards per carry. He played in the program's first bowl game, the 1953 Rose Bowl, as a sophomore, rushing for 133 yards on 28 carries. Ameche won the Heisman Trophy in 1954, the first for the Badger program. Ameche is one of six Wisconsin football players to have a number retired by the program (35) and enshrined on the Camp Randall Stadium fa\u00e7ade as of 2008: fellow Heisman winner and current career rushing record holder Ron Dayne (33), Elroy Hirsch (40), Dave Schreiner (80), Allan Schafer (83), and Pat Richter (88) are the others. Ameche was inducted into the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1967, the College Football Hall of Fame in 1975, and the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in 2004. ==NFL career== Ameche was the third overall selection of the 1955 NFL Draft and played fullback for the Baltimore Colts from 1955 until 1960. Named NFL Rookie of the Year in , he was a four-time Pro Bowler (1955\u201358), and the only rookie named to the Associated Press All-Pro team in 1955. Ameche averaged 4.2 yards per carry over his career, and held the record for rushing yards in his first three NFL games until Carnell \"Cadillac\" Williams passed it in 2005. Ameche may be best remembered for his role in the 1958 NFL Championship Game at Yankee Stadium, often cited as \"The Greatest Game Ever Played.\" Ameche scored the winning touchdown for the Colts on a one- yard run with 6:45 left in overtime as the Colts beat the Giants, 23\u201317. It was his second touchdown of the day as he also scored a touchdown on a 2-yard run in the second quarter. His overtime touchdown was the last in championship history until Super Bowl LI in February 2017, when James White scored at 3:58 of overtime as the New England Patriots beat the Atlanta Falcons, 34\u201328. Due to an Achilles tendon injury in December 1960, Ameche finished a relatively short six-season NFL career with 4,045 rushing yards, 101 receptions for 733 yards and 44 touchdowns. He is one of only four players named to the National Football League 1950s All-Decade Team not elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. In 2015, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Ameche to the P.F.R.A. \"Hall of Very Good\" Class of 2015. ==Business career== Ameche's Drive-in was a fast-food restaurant chain based in Baltimore, founded by Alan Ameche. Ameche's had five locations, all located in Baltimore or its suburbs: * Governor Ritchie Highway and 5th Avenue, Glen Burnie * 5800 Reisterstown Road, Baltimore City * Loch Raven Boulevard and Taylor Avenue * 7700 Wise Avenue, Dundalk * York Road and Timonium Road, Timonium The restaurants were known for \"no charge\" carry out service, signature \"Powerhouse\" hamburgers (\"A banquet on a bun\") essentially a Big Mac (1968), about eight years ahead of time, and \"Cheerleader\" sandwiches (hot ham and Swiss cheese with mustard) and their onion rings. The Loch Raven and Taylor location was open during the Summer of 1960. The Powerhouse sandwich was the featured item. The restaurants were typical drive-ins, with car side order boxes. Orders were delivered by a carhop who attached a tray to the lowered window. The company trademark was a Big Boy-like football player (#35) running through the uprights carrying a hamburger. In addition, Ameche's secret sauce was sold in many local grocery stores. The company slogan was \"Meetcha at Ameche's!\" Ameche's restaurants were informally known by many teenaged patrons as \"UM-cheez.\" == See also == * Chicken George \u2013 a former fast food restaurant chain based in Baltimore, Maryland * Gino's Hamburgers \u2013 A local Baltimore establishment co-founded by Alan Ameche with Gino Marchetti. * List of fast food restaurants * List of defunct fast-food restaurant chains == Death == Ameche had undergone triple bypass surgery at age 46 in 1979. He died of a heart attack in 1988 at age 55 at Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas, a few days after undergoing another heart bypass surgery, under the care of Dr. Michael DeBakey. He is interred at Calvary Cemetery in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. == References == == Further reading == * * ==External links== * * * * * * Then and Now: Ameche's Drive-In * The Times: Ameche's Drive-in Category:1933 births Category:1988 deaths Category:American sportspeople of Italian descent Category:Sportspeople from the Milwaukee metropolitan area Category:Sportspeople from Kenosha, Wisconsin Category:Players of American football from Wisconsin Category:American football fullbacks Category:Wisconsin Badgers football players Category:All-American college football players Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Heisman Trophy winners Category:Baltimore Colts players Category:Western Conference Pro Bowl players ",
