He became a U.S. Coast Guard licensed yacht captain and navigator, worked as a professional yacht charter and sailboat delivery captain, and has sailed across the Atlantic three times on small yachts, once alone. This part of his life was recounted in his memoir, Sea Change; Alone Across the Atlantic in a Wooden Boat (1997).
