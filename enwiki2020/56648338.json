Venkov graduated from Leningrad State University in 1969 and received there in 1973 his Russian candidate degree (Ph.D.) under Ludvig Faddeev. He then became an academic at the Steklov Institute in Saint Petersburg, where he received in 1980 his Russian doctorate (higher doctoral degree) with dissertation Spectral theory of automorphic functions (Russian). He was a visiting scholar at IHES, at the University of G\u00f6ttingen, in Paris (University of Paris VI, \u00c9cole Normale Superieure, Institute Henri Poincar\u00e9), at the MSRI, at Stanford University, several times at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, at the University of Lille, and at the Aarhus University. Since 2001 he has been a lecturer at Aarhus University. Venkov's research deals with the spectral theory of automorphic forms and their applications in number theory and mathematical physics. He has proved partial results for the Roelcke- Selberg conjecture. In 1983 he was an Invited Speaker at the ICM in Warsaw. In 2006 he received the Humboldt Research Award. ==Selected publications== ===Articles=== *with V. L.
