He was later appointed as the Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Fisheries and Forests in 2009. Naupoto was appointed to replace Eroni Luveniyali, whom the Military suspended and later dismissed. According to a Fiji Sun report on 9 January 2007, the appointment was made in defiance of a High Court order that Luveniyali be reinstated. In an interview with the Fiji Sun published on 23 January 2007, Naupoto said that Fiji's immigration system was replete with loopholes that allowed illegal immigrants to enter the country easily. This fueled corruption in the country, he claimed. ==References== Category:Fijian civil servants Category:Fijian Naval Officers Category:Living people Category:Fijian military leaders Category:I-Taukei Fijian people Category:Government ministers of Fiji Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
