    "text": "Roberta Pinna Made In Italy by Roberta Pinna Serendipity - Roberta Pinna Roberta Pinna, is an Italian national contemporary artist and art adviser whose work explores gender, sexuality and identity. She is most known for her paintings of flying silhouettes. Pinna is widely associated with the re- emergence of the figurative and decorative in contemporary art. == Career == Roberta Pinna studied in Italy, France, and at the School of Visual Arts in New York. My figures are semi-realistically rendered symbolic representations of the contemporary canonic form of the feminine. My approach to work is minimalist and tended to synthesize elements and forms. == Work == Roberta Pinna is most widely known for her silhouettes and divers illustrated in a minimalist style. The process of Pinna's work is in the application of a great number of thin paint layers to create the liquid-like surface that she is known for. Her colour choice is designed to evoke abstraction whilst her choice of material and subject are typically indicative of Pop Art. == Featured Collections == Pinna's work has been requested for key collections. Her work is featured in a range of public and private collections, including Rizzoli Publishing, Amazon, Fiat Chrysler, (Sergio Marchionne,automotive executive for Chrysler and Fiat purchased Pinna's painting Serendipity through personal viewing for his private collection), J.P. Morgan, P&O; Cruises. Pinna's work Aquarium was chosen by Rizzoli Publishing as the cover image for the posthumous book of Italian actress Anna Marchesini'\u201c E\u2019 Arrivato l\u2019Arrotino\u201d' The aquamarine piece is one which depicts Pinna's signature diving figures. == Exhibitions == 2018 - Frieze London, 4\u20137 October 2018, UK 2018 - Art On Paper, Mar 8, 2018 \u2013 Mar 11, New York, USA 2017 \u2013 All Is Perfect \u2013 Solo show at Banca Mediolanum, October \u2013 December, Milano, IT 2017 \u2013 Art Basel \u2013 Messeplatz 10 \u2013 Basel \u2013 Switzerland, SZ 2016 \u2013 Palazzo della Ragione, Aquarium, March 19, Milano, IT 2016 \u2013 Art On Paper, 3\u20136 March, New York, USA 2016 \u2013 Aquarium, C.M.Sant\u2019Agostino, Milano Jan 19 \u2013 19 March, Milano, IT 2015 \u2013 Come in un Sogno, June, Museo Civica Rocca Flea, Gualdo Tadino, IT 2015 \u2013 Donne a Tratti, May \u2013 June, Individuals, Milano, IT 2014 \u2013 Miami Project, December 2\u20137, 110 NE 36th St, Miami, USA 2014 \u2013 Infinite possibilit\u00e0, C.M.Sant\u2019Agostino 29 September- 28 November 2014, Milano, IT 2014 \u2013 The Armory Show, 6\u20139 March, New York City, USA 2013 \u2013 Phyllis Harriman Mason Gallery, 6\u201322 December, New York, USA 2013 \u2013 Art Basel Miami Beach, 5\u20138 December, Miami, USA 2013 \u2013 \u201cForever M\u201d, M&C; Gallery- 1\u201330 November \u2013 Hatboro, Pennsylvania, USA 2013 \u2013 The CoffeeArtProject \u2013 Arcamfactory \u2013 8\u201316 October \u2013 Milano, IT 2013 \u2013 Spectrum, NYC, 3\u20136 October, Javits Center North, New York, USA 2013 \u2013 Galerie Francois Giraudeau \u2013 29/03 \u2013 30/09, La Rochelle, France, FR 2013 \u2013 New York Art Expo, March 21\u201324, New York, USA 2013 \u2013 The Armory Show, March 7\u201310, New York, USA 2012 \u2013 \u201d Divers\u201d, Decor Art Gallery, New York, USA 2011 \u2013 Adam Lister Gallery, Fairfax VA, USA 2011 \u2013 \u201d Costumate\u201d, It's My Place Gallery, Milano, IT 2010 \u2013 \u201d Figures\u201d, New Walk Museum, Leicester, UK == References == 2\\. ^ Roberta Pinna.
