    "text": "The 2017 Africa Cup of Nations Final was a football match to determine the winner of the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations. The match was held at the Stade de l'Amiti\u00e9 in Libreville, Gabon, on 5 February 2017 and was contested by Egypt and Cameroon. Cameroon won the match 2\u20131 for their fifth Africa Cup of Nations title. As winners, they represented CAF at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup in Russia. ==Background== Egypt appeared in their 23rd tournament, and their 9th final. They have previously won 7 (1957, 1959, 1986, 1998, 2006, 2008, 2010) and lost the 1962 final against Ethiopia at the Hail\u00e9 S\u00e9lassi\u00e9 Stadium in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Cameroon appeared in their 18th tournament, and their 7th final. They have previously won 4 (1984, 1988, 2000, 2002) and lost 2 (1986, 2008). Egypt and Cameroon had met in two Africa Cup of Nations finals before (the 1986 and 2008 tournaments). Egypt won both of those finals. Egypt were 35th in the FIFA World Rankings (3rd among African nations), while Cameroon were 62nd (12th among African nations). ==Route to the final== {| style=\"width:100%; text-align:center\" |- style=\"vertical-align:top; background:#99CCFF\" ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:40%\" | Egypt ! style=\"width:10%\" | Round ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:40%\" | Cameroon |- style=\"vertical-align:top;background:#C1E0FF\" | Opponent | Result | Group stage | Opponent | Result |- | | 0\u20130 | style=\"background:#C1E0FF\" | Match 1 | | 1\u20131 |- | | 1\u20130 | style=\"background:#C1E0FF\" | Match 2 | | 2\u20131 |- | | 1\u20130 | style=\"background:#C1E0FF\" | Match 3 | | 0\u20130 |- | colspan=\"2\" style=\"text- align:center\" | Group D winner | style=\"background:#C1E0FF\" | Final standings | colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center\" | Group A runner-up |- style=\"vertical-align:top;background:#C1E0FF\" | Opponent | Result | Knockout stage | Opponent | Result |- | | 1\u20130 | style=\"background:#C1E0FF\" | Quarter- finals | | 0\u20130 |- | | 1\u20131 | style=\"background:#C1E0FF\" | Semi-finals | | 2\u20130 |} ==Match== ===Summary=== Mohamed Elneny received the ball from Mohamed Salah and opened the scoring after 22 minutes when he cut in from the right and shot right-footed high to the roof of the net past Fabrice Ondoa on his left side. Cameroon were level after 59 minutes when substitute Nicolas Nkoulou rose highest to score with a header to the right corner of the net after a cross from the left by Benjamin Moukandjo. With 2 minutes left, Vincent Aboubakar got the winning goal when he controlled a long ball forward with his chest on the edge of the box, and flicked the ball over Ali Gabr before gathering and shooting right footed low to the right of the goalkeeper from 12 yards out. In summarising the \"thrilling, edgy\" final, BBC Sport noted that Egypt started comfortably, but allowed their opponents to come at them in the second half. Cameroon limited Egypt to mostly playing long balls, and their increasing pressure meant that the Egyptian players succumbed to fatigue in the closing stages of the match. CNN's match report concluded that Aboubakar being brought on at half time revitalised Cameroon's attack and was a turning point in the game. ===Details=== {| width=92% |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"40%\"| {| style=\"font-size:90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK ||1 ||Essam El-Hadary (c) |- |RB ||3 ||Ahmed Elmohamady |- |CB ||6 ||Ahmed Hegazy |- |CB ||2 ||Ali Gabr |- |LB ||7 ||Ahmed Fathy |- |CM ||8 ||Tarek Hamed |- |CM ||17||Mohamed Elneny |- |RW ||10||Mohamed Salah |- |AM ||19||Abdallah Said |- |LW ||21||Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet || || |- |CF ||22||Amr Warda |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- |MF ||14||Ramadan Sobhi || || |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=3| H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper |} |valign=\"top\"|300px |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size:90%; margin:auto\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=25| !!width=25| |- |GK ||1 ||Fabrice Ondoa |- |RB ||19||Collins Fai || |- |CB ||5 ||Michael Ngadeu-Ngadjui |- |CB ||4 ||Adolphe Teikeu || || |- |LB ||6 ||Ambroise Oyongo |- |CM ||15||S\u00e9bastien Siani |- |CM ||17||Arnaud Djoum |- |AM ||9 ||Jacques Zoua || || |- |RW ||13||Christian Bassogog || |- |LW ||8 ||Benjamin Moukandjo (c) |- |CF ||18||Robert Ndip Tambe || || |- |colspan=3|Substitutions: |- |DF ||3 ||Nicolas Nkoulou || || |- |FW ||10||Vincent Aboubakar || || |- |MF ||14||Georges Mandjeck || || |- |colspan=3|Manager: |- |colspan=3| Hugo Broos |} |} {| width=100% style=\"font-size:90%\" | Man of the Match: Benjamin Moukandjo (Cameroon) Assistant referees: Jerson Emiliano Dos Santos (Angola) Marwa Range (Kenya) Fourth official: Daniel Bennett (South Africa) Fifth official: Zakhele Siwela (South Africa) |} |style=\"width:60%; vertical-align:top;\"| Match rules *90 minutes. *30 minutes of extra time if necessary. *Penalty shoot-out if scores still level. *Maximum of three substitutions. |} ===Statistics=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |+First half |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px\" | Statistic ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:70px\" | Egypt ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:70px\" | Cameroon |- !scope=row|Goals scored |1 |0 |- !scope=row|Total shots |2 |5 |- !scope=row|Shots on target |2 |1 |- !scope=row|Saves |1 |1 |- !scope=row|Ball possession |37% |63% |- !scope=row|Corner kicks |0 |1 |- !scope=row|Fouls committed |7 |5 |- !scope=row|Offsides |0 |0 |- !scope=row|Yellow cards |0 |0 |- !scope=row|Red cards |0 |0 |} {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+Second half |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px\" | Statistic ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:70px\" | Egypt ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:70px\" | Cameroon |- !scope=row|Goals scored |0 |2 |- !scope=row|Total shots |2 |10 |- !scope=row|Shots on target |0 |2 |- !scope=row|Saves |0 |0 |- !scope=row|Ball possession |39% |61% |- !scope=row|Corner kicks |0 |5 |- !scope=row|Fouls committed |4 |9 |- !scope=row|Offsides |1 |0 |- !scope=row|Yellow cards |1 |3 |- !scope=row|Red cards |0 |0 |} {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+Overall |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px\" | Statistic ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:70px\" | Egypt ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:70px\" | Cameroon |- !scope=row|Goals scored |1 |2 |- !scope=row|Total shots |4 |15 |- !scope=row|Shots on target |2 |3 |- !scope=row|Saves |1 |1 |- !scope=row|Ball possession |38% |62% |- !scope=row|Corner kicks |0 |6 |- !scope=row|Fouls committed |11 |14 |- !scope=row|Offsides |1 |0 |- !scope=row|Yellow cards |1 |3 |- !scope=row|Red cards |0 |0 |} ===Records=== This final witnessed an end of several long-held records, like: #Egypt 's loss in this final against Cameroon is Egypt's first ever loss in the Africa cup of nations finals against Cameroon.
