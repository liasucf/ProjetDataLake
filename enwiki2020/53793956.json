    "text": "Troutbeck Bridge is a village in South Lakeland, Cumbria, England. It is situated north of Windermere on the A591 road running through the Lake District and was historically in the county of Westmorland. The main secondary school for Windermere and Ambleside, The Lakes School, is located in the village, as is the postal sorting office for the area. Troutbeck Bridge takes its name from where the road crosses the Trout Beck. The community is served by a petrol station and convenience store, a Mexican restaurant, a secondary school and a gym. == History == The Calgarth Estate was a wartime housing estate built to house the workers of the nearby flying boat factory at White Cross Bay. By the end of the Second World War the workers had returned to their homes throughout Britain and in 1945 three hundred child survivors of the Holocaust, later known as the Windermere Boys, arrived from Eastern Europe to the Calgarth Estate to begin new lives: a film of their experience titled The Windermere Children was released in 2020. The site is now occupied by The Lakes School. == Transport == The A591 road passes through Troutbeck Bridge, with Windermere to the south and Ambleside to the north. The nearest railway station is Windermere, away, which is well connected to the village by local bus services. == See also == *Listed buildings in Windermere, Cumbria (town) == References == Category:Villages in Cumbria Category:South Lakeland District Category:Westmorland ",
