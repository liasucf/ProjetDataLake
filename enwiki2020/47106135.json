    "text": "Middle Gujarati (AD 1500\u20131800), split off from Rajasthani, and developed the phonemes \u025b and \u0254, the auxiliary stem ch-, and the possessive marker -n-. Major phonological changes characteristic of the transition between Old and Middle Gujarati are: *i, u develop to \u0259 in open syllables *diphthongs \u0259i, \u0259u change to \u025b and \u0254 in initial syllables and to e and o elsewhere *\u0259\u0169 develops to \u0254\u0303 in initial syllables and to \u0171 in final syllables These developments would have grammatical consequences. For example, Old Gujarati's instrumental-locative singular in -i was leveled and eliminated, having become the same as Old Gujarati's nominative/accusative singular in -\u0259. ==References== Category:Gujarati language Category:Cultural history of Gujarat Category:Indo- Aryan languages Category:Languages attested from the 15th century ",
