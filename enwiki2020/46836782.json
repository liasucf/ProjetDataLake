    "text": "Century International Arms is an importer and manufacturer of firearms that is based in the United States. The company was founded in 1961 in St. Albans, Vermont, with offices in Montreal. In 1995, the company headquarters and sales staff moved to Boca Raton, Florida and to Delray Beach, Florida in 2004. ==History== The company was started after William Sucher, a typewriter repairman, took a Lee\u2013Enfield rifle in trade against a typewriter he had repaired for a customer. Having no need for the rifle, he posted a newspaper to sell it and received more queries about the rifle than he had for typewriters. He then sought sources of surplus rifles that he could sell for a profit. With his brother-in-law, Manny Weigensberg, Sucher made contacts in foreign countries for the importation of military surplus rifles and handguns and by the 1970s, Century became the single largest importer of firearms in the United States and Canada. When sources of importable surplus firearms have become scarce, Century has manufactured their own firearms. The company has manufactured versions of the G3, L1A1, AK-47 and sporterized Mausers among others. ==Firearms== Canik TP9 SFx 9mm pistol *C308 (a clone of the CETME rifle) *C39/C39V2 (clones of the AK-47) *L1A1 *RAS47 (clone of the AKM) *SKS rifle *SSG 82 *TP9 SF *TP9 SFx *TP9 SA *TP9 v2 *TP40 v2 *TP9 SF Elite *TP9 Elite Combat *TP9 Elite Combat Executive *TP9 Elite SC *TP9 DA *TP9 SFL *vz. 24 *vz. 50 *WASR-series rifles *Zastava M57 ==Ammunition== In addition to importing bulk surplus ammunition, Century is the US importer and distributor for Red Army Standard Ammunition. ==References== Category:Firearm importation companies of the United States Category:Firearm manufacturers of the United States ",
