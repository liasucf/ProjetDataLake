    "text": "The Icelandic Women's Super Cup (Icelandic: Meistarakeppni kvenna) is an annual football game between the reigning champions of the Icelandic League (\u00darvalsdeild) champions and the Icelandic Cup holders (or, if the same team holds both titles, between the title-holder and (usually) the team in second place in the \u00darvalsdeild or occasionally the second placed team in the Icelandic Cup). It generally takes place at the start of the Iceland domestic season, in May and has been running uninterrupted since 2003 (when the holders of the 2002 titles met). Before that the competition was uninterrupted between 1992 and 1998. Title-holders from 1999, 2000 and 2001 did not play for this title. The most successful team is Brei\u00f0ablik with a total of nine wins. == Past Finals == There were two games played in 1996, one in the spring and one in the autumn, with the spring-game covering the year before and the autumn- game covering the just-finished season. For easier understanding the years listed are always the year after a team won the \u00darvalsdeild or Cup (so the autumn games are listed as having been played the year after they were played). {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !
