John Dowson (London: Tr\u00fcbner and Co., 1872), 127-129; OCLC 3425271, available in full text from Google Books. the eighth volume is a geographical index.Salaam Knowledge The work is very scholarly, M\u012br-Khv\u0101nd used nineteen major Arabic histories and twenty-two major Persian ones as well as others which he occasionally quotes.Elliot, History, 129 His work was the basis for many subsequent histories including the works of Hajj\u012b Khalfah. :The Raw\u017cat a\u1e63-\u1e63af\u0101\u0304\u02be ought not to be confused with the Raw\u017cat al-b\u0304\u0304\u0101b f\u012b ta\u02ber\u012bkh al-ak\u0101bir w-al-ans\u0101b (\u2018The Garden of the learned in the history of great men and genealogies\u2019) by Ab\u016b Sulaym\u0101n Da\u02be\u016bd ibn Ab\u016b al-Fatal Mu\u1e25ammad al-Ban\u0101kat\u012b, which was written earlier, in 1317 AD. ==Style== M\u012br-Khv\u0101nd made little attempt at a critical examination of historical traditions, and wrote in a flowery and often bombastic style. It comprises seven large volumes and a geographical appendix; but the seventh volume, the history of the sultan \u1e24osayn, together with a short account of some later events down to 1523, cannot have been written by M\u012br-Khvv\u0101nd himself, who died in 1498. He may have compiled the preface, but it was his grandson, the historian Khv\u0101nd-Am\u012br (1475\u20131534), who continued the main portion of this volume and to whom also a part of the appendix must be ascribed. ===Manuscripts, editions and translations=== There are various different Persian manuscripts in Iran, Vienna, Paris, and London. A Persian edition was published in Paris in 1843 as Histoire des Samanides par Mirkhond. It was published fully in Persian in 1843 (Paris) and lithographed in Mumbai (1848 or 1852). The standard edition used in scholarship is the Persian edition Tarikh i Rawzat al-Safa (7 vols) by Abbad Parviz (Tehran, 1959).Andrew J.

Around 1596, Pedro Teixeira prepared a Spanish translation of the Raw\u017cat a\u1e63-\u1e63af\u0101\u0304\u02be.
