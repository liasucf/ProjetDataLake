    "text": "Paysandu Sport Club, or Paysandu, as they are usually called, is a Brazilian football team from Bel\u00e9m in Par\u00e1, founded on February 2, 1914. ==History== On February 2, 1914, members of Norte Club protested against a decision of the football federation of Par\u00e1 benefiting Remo by terminating the team and refounding other team. Unanimously, the assembly chose Hugo Le\u00e3o to chair the meeting. As leader of the movement, he proposed the name of Paysandu Foot-Ball Club for the new club. The name was chosen as a tribute to the unfortunate event in Paysand\u00fa, a Uruguayan city, which would take the start of the war against Paraguay. That year, the Norte Club held a good campaign and needed to beat Guarany to force an extra match against Grupo do Remo. After the tie at 1\u20131, the members of the Norte Club, unreconstructed, asked the Par\u00e1's Foot- Ball League the cancellation of the match due to various irregularities. However, the board of the Par\u00e1's Foot-Ball League dismissed the appeal. The decision did not like it one bit to the members of the Norte Club, which then decided to create a movement, under the leadership of Hugo Le\u00e3o, to the foundation of a new association, stronger, to be able to meet on equal terms their opponents. This movement did not like the members of Grupo do Remo, who tried to persuade Hugo Le\u00e3o to abandon the idea. In February 1914, the newspaper O Estado do Par\u00e1 made the call for the meeting of a new club. The call by the newspaper had an effect, causing those who attended the meeting 42 athletes, many of whom had built the Norte Club, in addition to other different associations. Chosen the name, the assembly elected the first president, Deodoro de Mendon\u00e7a, who headed the board during the year 1914. It was also chosen the committee to draft the Statutes of the Club, relapsing choosing the names of Mendon\u00e7a Deodoro, Eurico Amanaj\u00e1s and Arnaldo Morais. To write the status of the club assembly chose the following commission: Deodoro de Mendon\u00e7a, Eurico Amanaj\u00e1s and Arnaldo Moraes. The second meeting was held on the scheduled date, February 10, 1914 at the same location of the first and with the presence of large number of participants. He was sworn in the elected board, increasing the number of members to 100 and were considered founding partners, more than 15 new members who joined the Paysandu. At the third meeting, on 19 February 1914, the Paysandu, of \"Foot-Ball\" went to \"Sport Club\". To be read to the assembly, an office requesting membership of Paysandu the Par\u00e1's Football League, the idea of change, which, after heated debates, put to a vote, was approved by a majority vote. And so came the Paysandu Sport Club. In 1991 and 2001, Paysandu was the champion of the Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B. In 2002 the club was champion of Copa Norte, and, later, champion of Copa dos Campe\u00f5es. In 2003, Paysandu was eliminated by Boca Juniors on the second leg of a match for Copa Libertadores, after winning the first leg in La Bombonera. That was the club's first participation in the competition. In 2016, the club was champion of Copa Verde, conquering his second regional title. ==Symbols== ===Crest=== The crest is blue and white, with the PSC initials, in reference to the name Paysandu Sport Club. At the bottom, there is a winged foot (with wings), creating M\u00e1rio Bayma who explained its meaning: \"The team speed goal would never be equaled or surpassed by his opponents, because come the flight limits.\" Above the shield is three stars, two silver symbolizing the title of Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B of 1991 (left) and 2001 (right), and a gold (central) symbolizing the title of Copa dos Campe\u00f5es in 2002. ===Anthem=== The official anthem of Paysandu was composed in 1916 by the poet Jos\u00e9 Sim\u00f5es, while the music was made by Professor Manuel Lu\u00eds de Paiva. There is also the \"popular\" hymn, composed by Francisco Pires Cavalcanti, excited about the victory of Paysandu against Pe\u00f1arol in 1965, which is better known than the official team anthem. ===Traditional home kit=== The uniform was proposed by Hugo Le\u00e3o, first president of Paysandu, at the meeting held on February 10, 1914. The proposal was not approved by the General Assembly, by unanimous vote of the members, on February 19, 1914, seventeen days later the foundation of the club. The uniform follows the same model to the present day. ==Rivalries== Paysandu rivals are Remo and Tuna Luso.
