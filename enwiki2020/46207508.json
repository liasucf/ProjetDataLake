AS Tanda won their first league title, holding off ASEC Mimosas on the final day of the season. Entering with a one- point lead in the standings, Tanda defeated CO Korhogo 2\u20131 at home to clinch the title even though ASEC got a 0\u20131 road win at Sporting Gagnoa to keep the pressure on. The league comprised 14 teams, the bottom two of which will be relegated to the 2016 Ligue 2. Bouak\u00e9 and Stella each entered the final day of the season needing a win and to make up a large goal differential to avoid relegation, but both suffered road losses to seal their fate. ==Teams== A total of 14 teams will contest the league, including 12 sides from the 2013\u201314 season and two promoted from the 2013\u201314 Ligue 2, Bouak\u00e9 FC and Stade d'Abidjan. On the other hand, USC Bassam and CO Bouafl\u00e9 were the last two teams of the 2013\u201314 season and will play in Ligue 2 for the 2015 season. S\u00e9w\u00e9 Sport are the defending champions from the 2013\u201314 season. ===Stadiums and locations=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! Team ! Home city ! Stadium !
