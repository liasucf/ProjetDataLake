    "text": "Kv\u00e6sthusgade is a short street in the Nyhavn Quarter of central Copenhagen, Denmark. It runs from the mouth of the Nyhavn canal in the south to Ofelia Plads in the north. The rear side of the Royal Danish Playhouse dominates the east side of the street. The Zinn House at No. 3 and the neighbouring building at No. 5 are both listed in the Danish registry of protected buildings and places. == History == The location of the Kv\u00e6sthus seen on a map detail from the 1690s The street takes its name after the Kv\u00e6sthus, a military hospital, which relocated to the site in 1680. It is known that a hospital for boatsmen was founded in 1618 and it was then most likely situated at the Church of Holmen. It was moved to Gothersgade in 1628 and again in 1658 to Sejlhuset at Bremerholm. In 1668, the hospital moved to B\u00f8rnehuset in Christianshavn and in 1675 to Guldhuset in Rigensgade. Kv\u00e6sthuset in c, 1750 The name Kv\u00e6sthus was introduced with the inauguration of the new building for the institution at the corner of present day Kv\u00e6sthusgade and Sankt Ann\u00e6 Plads in 1685. It was designed by Hans van Steenwinckel the Youngest. The institution was later split into a S\u00f8kv\u00e6sthus for the Navy which remained in the old building and a Landkv\u00e6sthus for the Army, which took over K\u00f8benhavns Ladeg\u00e5rd, a former farm under Copenhagen Castle. The navel hospital relocated to the so-called S\u00f8kv\u00e6sthuset building on Christianshavn in 1777. The building in Kv\u00e6sthusgade was then for a while used as a warehouse for textiles that arrived to Copenhagen by ship. In 1827, the building came into use as military barracks. In 1872, it was acquired by DFDS. An area on the east side of the street was reclaimed and the Kv\u00e6sthusbroen Pier was built to increase the quayside area and the number of ships that could dock at the site. ==Notable buildings== No. 3: The Zinn House No. 1 was built in 1884-1886 with cellar og three storeys for J. P. von Osten. It was later used as headquarters for Em. Z. Svitzers Bjergningsenterprise.

No. 3 and No. 5 are both listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places. The former Kv\u00e6sthus Building (No. 7-11) is now home to the Danish Nurses' Organization. The building was adapted for DFDS in 1872. ==See also== * Em. Z.
