    "text": "CIDOB, acronym for Barcelona Centre for International Affairs, is a Spanish think-tank based in Barcelona and dedicated to researching and sharing the contents different areas of international relations and development studies. It defines itself as \"an independent, non-partisan centre that contributes to ongoing international debates from the perspective of a major Mediterranean metropolis\". Legally speaking, CIDOB is a public foundation with a board of trustees that includes among its members the main political institutions and universities of Catalonia and Barcelona, in addition to a number of ministries of the Spanish government. CIDOB is currently the oldest think-tank in Spain, and one of the most influential in its field. It is also a parent institution of the prestigious Institut Barcelona d'Estudis Internacionals (IBEI). == The acronym CIDOB and the centre\u2019s name == The centre's original name was, from 1973 onwards, Centre d'Informaci\u00f3 i Documentaci\u00f3 Internacionals a Barcelona (translated into English, Barcelona Centre for International Information and Documentation), thus giving rise to the acronym CIDOB. Later on, the centre was referred to with other names, including Centro de Relaciones Internacionales y Cooperaci\u00f3n Internacional (Centre of International Relations and International Cooperation), Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n de Relaciones Internacionales y Desarrollo (Research Centre on International Relations and Development) and, particularly until 2013, Centro de Estudios y Documentaci\u00f3n Internacionales de Barcelona (Barcelona Centre for International Studies and Documentation). These titles still appear in quotes and references from other media, thereby creating some confusion. Since 2013, the official name, in all cases and without translations, uses the English form Barcelona Centre for International Affairs. All these names no longer correspond to the historical acronym, though it has always been used exclusively to refer to the organisation. == History == CIDOB was born in 1973 as a non-profit association of a socio-cultural nature based on the personal experience of its founder, Josep Ribera i Pinyol, one of the promoters of the Catalan inter-diocesan movement Agermanament (Brothering), which was active in cooperation projects with countries in Africa and South America. This original CIDOB was known as CIDOB Tercer Mundo (CIDOB Third World) or CIDOB-TM. In 1979, as a result of the political transformations occurring in Catalonia and the rest of Spain, and upon a desire to \"energise the democratic fabric with respect to international cooperation\", CIDOB was legally constituted as a private foundation with a board of trustees, whose members, public and private, were representatives of the political and cultural life of Catalonia and Spain. Currently, the foundation is public. In the following years, CIDOB grew to become a research and documenting centre focused on international issues and global problems such as human development. With this aim in mind, CIDOB has taken full advantage of Barcelona's prominence as a Euro-Mediterranean capital that also has special links with Latin America. Since the 1990s, the centre has strengthened its networking connections with European initiatives on issues concerning cooperation, international relations, and security, as well as its academic activities, oriented toward the generation of ideas and specific political action. Josep Ribera continued to head CIDOB until December 2008, when he chose to step down after 35 years at the helm. His successor as director was, by decision of the foundation's board of trustees, Jordi Vaquer i Fan\u00e9s, an international relations doctor and researcher at CIDOB up to that time. Narc\u00eds Serra i Serra, former mayor of Barcelona, previous minister in the Spanish Government, and one-time leader of the Catalan Socialists, chaired the foundation from 2000 to May 2012, when he was succeeded by economist Carles A. Gas\u00f2liba i B\u00f6hm. In March 2010, Javier Solana Madariaga, until the previous year the EU's High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, was appointed honorary chairman of CIDOB, a newly created post outside the organisational structure. In December 2012, Jordi Vaquer, newly appointed head of the new Open Society Initiative for Europe (OSIFE), stepped down as director and Anna Estrada Bertran was named executive coordinator in his place. In June 2013, the board of trustees selected a new director, Dr. Jordi Bacaria i Colom, currently co-director of the Institute of European Integration Studies (IEIE) in Mexico and editor of the journal Foreign Affairs Latinoam\u00e9rica. == Organisation and installations == 200px ===Staff=== The foundation is headed by its chairman, Carles A. Gas\u00f2liba. The centre itself consists of a management team made up of the director, Jordi Bacaria, an executive coordinator, Anna Estrada, a managing director and coordinator for research, Eduard Soler. The working staff is made up of researchers and specific staff responsible for the sections of information and web services, publications, activities, press, and administration. As of June 2013, 30 people work at CIDOB. ===Board of Trustees=== The foundation's board is made up of the following institutional trustees, whose financial contributions represent most of the centre's annual budget: * Generalitat of Catalonia * Barcelona City Council * Barcelona Provincial Council * Barcelona Metropolitan Area * Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation * Spanish Ministry of Defence * Interuniversity Council of Catalonia === Installations === right CIDOB's offices are divided between two historic buildings \u2013 nearby but not adjoining \u2013 on calle Elisabets in Barcelona's Raval district, very close to La Rambla and Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya. They are Casa de la Miseric\u00f2rdia (Elisabets, 12) and Casa dels Infants Orfes (Elisabets, 24). The Casa de la Miseric\u00f2rdia has, since 1988, housed the centre's main installations, including the official head office, the archives and library, as well as Sala Maragall, the hall used for events. Originally, the building (which includes the old church) formed part of the School of St William of Aquitaine, founded by the Augustine Order in 1587, and later on it was used as a municipal primary school. During the Napoleonic invasion, it served as the clandestine headquarters of the citizen's movement against the French occupation. In more recent times, in 1910, it became the home of the Institute of Culture and People's Library for Women; later still, in 1940, the building became the head office of the Institute for Theatre, as well as being home to the Adri\u00e0 Gual Chair. The Casa dels Infants Orfes also dates back to the 16th century. It was built as the head office of the institution founded by Guillem dez Pou in 1370 to provide a home for orphans in the Diocese of Barcelona. It has an adjacent chapel, commissioned by Claudi Cosal in 1680 and redesigned in 1785. Among the building's later uses, it was a school run by the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul (1848) and a convent for the Carmelites of Charity (1875). The chapel lost all its religious furnishings and fittings during the Spanish Civil War. == Activities == === Fields of specialisation and events === Over the past decade, CIDOB has systematised its areas of research by maintaining its traditional subjects/regions of interest and adding other, more specific ones. Currently, CIDOB operates three major programmes: People and Frontiers; A more secure life; and Democratic Governance. Under these generic premises, research works cover both thematic and geographical areas. In the first group, the major topics are: Development; Environment; Energy; Human Security; Intercultural Dynamics; Migrations; Conflicts; Local Government; State, Democracy and Foreign Policy; and Regionalism. CIDOB has a particular focus on \"six fields of excellence\", namely: European Foreign Policy and Neighbourhood Relations; Security Sector Reform; Intercultural Dynamics; Migration Policy in Europe; International relations of cities and regions; and EU Enlargement. As for geographical specialisation, CIDOB follows in particular political issues from Europe (including the post-Soviet realm), the Mediterranean and Middle East, Latin America, and Asia (especially Central Asia). Four regional powers, one in each continent, receive priority: Brazil, China, Russia, and Turkey. The international political situation, world human development indicators, and Spanish international cooperation and foreign relations are also monitored on an ongoing basis. At a structural level, eight \"issues/regions\" are defined at the moment: Asia; Development; Europe; Intercultural Dynamics; Latin America; Mediterranean and Middle East; Migrations; and Security. Each issue/region is directed by a researcher or senior research fellow who works with other analysts, assistants, associate or visiting specialists, and external contributors. Some programmes also have a project manager. Research teams work with interdisciplinary scholar networks and generate their own academic activities, publications, and documentary collections. CIDOB's research work is conceived to be disseminated as widely as possible, and thus it is aimed not only at specialists and scholars but also at public organisations, mass media, NGOs, businesses, university students, and the public in general. Direct dissemination requires seminars, conferences, debates, and workshops. Also, CIDOB regularly announces calls for papers, issues policy papers, and introduces new publications. In its own words, CIDOB's vision consists of \"promoting good global governance based on democratic practices at the local, national, and supranational levels in order to ensure people\u2019s basic needs for freedom and a life without fear\". Meanwhile, the centre's mission is to \"offer information and ideas that help to shape policies that promote a safer, freer, and more just world for all\". Every year, CIDOB and the City Council of Barcelona jointly hold the international seminar War and Peace in the 21st Century, a series of debates attended by leading personalities from public functions, governments, and international academia. Other important annual events include the International Seminar on Security and Defence in the Mediterranean, organised jointly with the Spanish Institute for Strategic Studies (IEEE, which reports to the Spanish Ministry of Defence), and the Seminar on the Ibero-American Development Agenda (ADI), run with the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) and the Ibero-American General Secretariat (SEGIB). These three seminars have been held in 2002 and 2005 at the Palace of Pedralbes in Barcelona. === Publications === CIDOB edits and publishes a wide range of analytical and documentary material in different formats, in print edition and online. ==== Periodicals ==== Available on hard copy and/or in electronic format, published either exclusively by CIDOB or as joint publications: ===== Yearbooks ===== * CIDOB International Yearbook.

The courses available were: * Diploma in Development Cooperation. * Diploma in International Relations. * Master in International Studies. * Master in Development Studies. Currently, CIDOB's teaching activities take place within the academic programmes of the Institut Barcelona d'Estudis Internacionals (Barcelona Institute for International Studies, IBEI), a private foundation created by CIDOB in March 2004, whose members include the five Catalan universities (UB, UAB, UPC, UPF, and UOC) who sit on the Board of Trustees of CIDOB. This inter-university institute offers two postgraduate courses: Masters in International Relations and the Erasmus Mundus Masters Programme in Public Policy (Mundus MAPP); the latter is provided in association with the Central European University (CEU) of Budapest, the International Institute of Social Studies (ISS) of Rotterdam, and the University of York. The IBEI also holds two summer courses: Barcelona Summer School in International Politics and the Summer School of the Mediterranean. Furthermore, CIDOB is a member of the network of organising centres for the Master en Affaires Euro- M\u00e9diterran\u00e9ennes/Master in Euro-Mediterranean Affairs (MAEM-MEMA). === Documentation, BIBA, and information services === Since it was founded, one of CIDOB's basic services has been the maintenance of an extensive documentary collection specializing mainly in international relations and development, which is open to the public. These documentary and bibliographical collections are collectively known as the Biblioteca Internacional de Barcelona (International Library of Barcelona, BIBA); the library was created to support the teaching and research activities done by CIDOB and IBEI, as well as to provide a service to the university and research community as a whole, to journalists and other professional people interested in the subject. At present, CIDOB's documentation, library, and information area is organised for users into four sections: ==== Documentation Centre and Library ==== The Library contains a documentary collection specializing in international relations and development, particularly in the geographical and subject areas deemed to be priorities for CIDOB. The documents are the following: the approximately 400 international periodical publications to which CIDOB is a subscriber; another 600 titles that are no longer received; more than 12,000 volumes and monographs; and a further 11,000 documents in other formats. The library also contains all the publications published by the foundation. The online catalogue for the documentary collection enables users to browse lists of all the items acquired since 1985. The Documentation Centre analyzes the periodical publications that it receives in accordance with a list of its own descriptors, as well as managing specific databases of periodical publications and acronyms. The Documentation Centre also helps to create documentary appendices for some of CIDOB's own publications. ==== Digital Library ==== Set up in 2011, this is an online database with a search engine that enables users to access all content produced by CIDOB: maps, chronologies, acronyms, biographies, news and activities, dossiers, articles, and monographs on subjects under study. ==== Dossiers CIDOB ==== A non-periodical online publication focusing on international political current affairs. The dossiers are monographic studies of specific events of a national or international scope, created by the centre's researchers and information specialists. They contain analytical articles produced by CIDOB, links to external articles and news items and to official reference documents, as well as support material produced ex profeso. This information tool has been available exclusively through the web since 2009. ==== Biographies of Political Leaders ==== Biographical information service, online since 2001. Country leaders\u2019 profiles are situated \"in context\", by presenting and explaining the historical, political, economic, and social circumstances surrounding them. As of 2011, this web service features more than 600 biographies of political leaders from around the world. As with the Dossiers, the texts are designed so that they can be updated at any time. === Affiliations, agreements, and collaboration projects === CIDOB maintains an extensive network of memberships and affiliations with academic organisations in Spain and abroad.

CIDOB also contributes to the Migrant Integration Policy Index III (MIPEX III) and, as mentioned above, organises the Ibero-American Development Agenda (ADI), together with ECLAC. == Social influence == In 2009, Iberglobal \u2013 the portal for the internationalisation of business and the economy \u2013 ranked CIDOB third in a list of the most influential think-tanks in Spain. The centre was given 158 votes out of 1,313 in a survey of just over 500 readers. Fifteen Spanish think tanks were evaluated in the poll; among them, the Elcano Institute and the Foundation for International Relations and Exterior Dialogue (FRIDE) were ranked first and second. The 2010 edition of Global Go-to Think- Tanks - the prestigious list of think tanks around the world issued by the international relations program of the University of Pennsylvania - assessed 4,567 centres from around the world and placed CIDOB 37th out of the 50 best non-US think tanks, in the category Top 50 Think-Tanks \u2013 Worldwide (Non-US). In this list, the Barcelona centre was the only one from Spain and the third from southern Europe. According to the 2012 edition, CIDOB has been recognized as the most influential think tank in Southern Europe. This time, CIDOB was ranked 18th in the top 75 think tanks from Western Europe, 35th in the worldwide non-US category, and 64th among the 150 top think tanks worldwide, US and non-US.
