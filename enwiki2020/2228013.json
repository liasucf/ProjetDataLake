Founded in 1936, Mit\u00fa lies next to the Vaup\u00e9s River at 180 meters above sea level. It is where the core of the services (transport and trade) are provided to the Vaup\u00e9s Department.

The town served as a meeting point between different indigenous communities, in addition to being a center of rubber tree exploitation, fur trade and missionary center. Its main activity was the rubber trade for food, clothing and fuel. After being for a time a township, in 1963 Mit\u00fa became the capital of the Vaup\u00e9s Commissary (Comisaria).
