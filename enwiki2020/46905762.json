    "text": "thumb Wind power in Wisconsin started in 1990 with the installation of the Lincoln Turbines wind farm, and contributes to the state's renewable portfolio standard established in 1998. In 2016, Wisconsin had a wind generating capacity of 648 megawatts (MW), responsible for generating 2.4% of its electricity. In 2019, this increased to a capacity of 737 MW, and a 2.63% of generation. Regulations regarding the siting of wind turbines substantially hinder the development of wind farms in the state. A 98 MW wind farm, the Quilt Block Wind Farm, was under construction in southwest Wisconsin as of February 2017. ==Installations== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" || Site || County || Coordinates || Opened/Operated ||Size (MW) || Turbines: number, type and model || Notes |- | Glenmore || Brown || || 1998-2012 || 1.2 || 1 Tacke 600e || test projecthttp://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy00osti/28589.pdf |- | Lincoln Turbines || Kewaunee || || 1990-2018|| 9.2 || 14 Vestas V47 600 kW || |- | Rosiere Wind Farm || Kewaunee || || 1999-2018 || 11.2 || Vestas V47 600 kW || Madison Gas and Electrichttp://wiwindinfo.net/projects/rosiere.html |- | Byron || Fond du Lac || || 1999-2019 || 1.3 || Vestas V47, 600 kW || |- | Montfort Wind Farm|| Iowa || || 2001 | 30.0 || Enron (GE) 1.5 || We Energies |- | Cedar Ridge Wind Farm || Fond du Lac || || 2008 || 68.0 || Vestas V82, 1.65 || |- | Blue Sky Green Field || Fond du Lac || || 2008|| 145.2 || Vestas V82, 1.65 || We Energies |- | Butler Ridge || Dodge || || 2009 | 54.0 || 36 GE Wind Energy (GE) 1.5 XLE || NextEra Energy Resourceshttp://www.nexteraenergyresources.com/content/where/portfolio/pdf/ButlerRidge.pdfhttp://wiwindinfo.net/projects/butlerridge.html |- | Forward Wind || Dodge & Fond du Lac || || 2008 || 129.0 || GE sle 1.5|| Invenergy |- | Shirley Wind || Brown || || 2011 || 20.0 || 8 Nordex 2.5 || Duke Energy declared a health hazard in 2014 |- | Glacier Hills Wind || Columbia || || 2011 || 162.0 || 90 Vestas V90, 1.8 || We Energieshttps://www.we- energies.com/home/glacierhills_windpark.pdfhttp://wiwindinfo.net/projects/glacier.html |- | Cashton Greens Wind || Monroe || || 2012 || 5.0 || 2 || Cashton community |- | Epic's Galactic Wind || Dane || || 2012 || 9.9 || Vestas V82 1.65 || |- | Quilt Block Wind || Lafayette || Darlington || 2017 || 98 || Vestas 2.0 || Dairyland Power Cooperative |} ==See also== *Solar power in Wisconsin *Wind power in the United States *Renewable energy in the United States ==References== ",
