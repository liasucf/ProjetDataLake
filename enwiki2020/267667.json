    "text": "L\u00fc Meng () (178 \u2013 January or February 220), courtesy name Ziming, was a military general who served under the warlord Sun Quan during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. Early in his career, he fought in several battles under the banner of Sun Ce, Sun Quan's elder brother and predecessor. Although he had been noted for his bravery, he was still deemed as nothing more than a \"mere warrior\" for his lack of literacy skills. Later, with encouragement from Sun Quan, L\u00fc Meng took up scholarly pursuits to improve himself, gradually becoming a learned and competent military leader. In 217, he succeeded Lu Su as the frontline commander of Sun Quan's forces in Jing Province. Two years later, in a carefully calculated military operation, L\u00fc Meng led an invasion of Liu Bei's territories in southern Jing Province, swiftly and stealthily capturing all the lands from Liu Bei's general Guan Yu, who was captured and executed after his defeat. L\u00fc Meng enjoyed his finest hour after the victory but died a few months later because he was already seriously ill before the campaign. ==Early life== L\u00fc Meng was from Fupo County (), Runan Commandery (), which is located southeast of present-day Funan County, Anhui. His family migrated to the south of the Yangtze River when L\u00fc Meng was young. L\u00fc Meng lived with his brother-in-law, Deng Dang (), who served as a military officer under Sun Ce. When he was 14 or 15, he secretly followed Deng Dang to the battles against the Shanyue tribes. Deng Dang was shocked to see his teenage brother-in-law in battle, so he scolded L\u00fc Meng and warned him to stop. L\u00fc Meng refused to listen so Deng Dang told L\u00fc Meng's mother about this. When she wanted to punish him, L\u00fc Meng said: \"It is difficult to survive in poverty. If we can prove ourselves through hard work, then wealth will come eventually. How can we catch the tiger cub if we don't enter the tiger's den?\" L\u00fc Meng's mother sighed and let him have his way.(\u5442\u8499\u5b57\u5b50\u660e\uff0c\u6c5d\u5357\u5bcc\u9642\u4eba\u4e5f\u3002 ... \u5c11\u5357\u6e21\uff0c\u4f9d\u59ca\u592b\u9127\u7576\u3002\u7576\u70ba\u5b6b\u7b56\u5c07\uff0c\u6578\u8a0e\u5c71\u8d8a\u3002\u8499\u5e74\u5341\u4e94\u516d\uff0c\u7aca\u96a8\u7576\u64ca\u8cca\uff0c\u7576\u9867\u898b\u5927\u9a5a\uff0c\u5475\u53f1\u4e0d\u80fd\u7981\u6b62\u3002\u6b78\u4ee5\u544a\u8499\u6bcd\uff0c\u6bcd\u605a\u6b32\u7f70\u4e4b\uff0c\u8499\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u8ca7\u8ce4\u96e3\u53ef\u5c45\uff0c\u812b\u8aa4\u6709\u529f\uff0c\u5bcc\u8cb4\u53ef\u81f4\u3002\u4e14\u4e0d\u63a2\u864e\u7a74\uff0c\u5b89\u5f97\u864e\u5b50\uff1f\u300d\u6bcd\u54c0\u800c\u820d\u4e4b\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. At the time, an official scorned L\u00fc Meng because of his young age and often insulted him by saying things like: \"What can he do? His behaviour will only result in him feeding himself to the tigers.\" L\u00fc Meng killed the official one day when he lost control of his anger. Initially, he took shelter under Zheng Chang () but later turned himself in to Yuan Xiong (), a colonel under Sun Ce. Yuan Xiong pleaded with his lord to spare L\u00fc Meng's life. Sun Ce interviewed L\u00fc Meng and was so impressed with him that he pardoned L\u00fc Meng and appointed him as a close aide.(\u6642\u7576\u8077\u540f\u4ee5\u8499\u5e74\u5c0f\u8f15\u4e4b\uff0c\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u5f7c\u8c4e\u5b50\u4f55\u80fd\u70ba\uff1f\u6b64\u6b32\u4ee5\u8089\u9927\u864e\u8033\u3002\u300d\u4ed6\u65e5\u8207\u8499\u6703\uff0c\u53c8\u86a9\u8fb1\u4e4b\u3002\u8499\u5927\u6012\uff0c\u5f15\u5200\u6bba\u540f\uff0c\u51fa\u8d70\uff0c\u9003\u9091\u5b50\u912d\u9577\u5bb6\u3002\u51fa\u56e0\u6821\u5c09\u8881\u96c4\u81ea\u9996\uff0c\u627f\u9593\u70ba\u8a00\uff0c\u7b56\u53ec\u898b\u5947\u4e4b\uff0c\u5f15\u7f6e\u5de6\u53f3\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. A few years later, after Deng Dang died, Zhang Zhao recommended L\u00fc Meng to replace Deng Dang, so L\u00fc Meng was appointed as a Major of a Separate Command (). In the year 200, after Sun Ce was assassinated, his younger brother Sun Quan succeeded him as the warlord ruling the territories in the Jiangdong region. Sun Quan planned to reorganise his army by merging small units into larger garrisons. When L\u00fc Meng heard about it, he collected funds to purchase elaborately designed armour for his troops. When Sun Quan came to inspect L\u00fc Meng's unit, he was so impressed that he placed more soldiers under L\u00fc Meng's command, thus saving L\u00fc Meng's troops from being merged into another unit.(\u6578\u6b72\uff0c\u9127\u7576\u6b7b\uff0c\u5f35\u662d\u85a6\u8499\u4ee3\u7576\uff0c\u62dc\u5225\u90e8\u53f8\u99ac\u3002\u6b0a\u7d71\u4e8b\uff0c\u6599\u8af8\u5c0f\u5c07\u5175\u5c11\u800c\u7528\u8584\u8005\uff0c\u6b32\u5e76\u5408\u4e4b\u3002\u8499\u9670\u8cd2\u8cb0\uff0c\u70ba\u5175\u4f5c\u7d73\u8863\u884c\u7e22\uff0c\u53ca\u7c21\u65e5\uff0c\u9673\u5217\u8d6b\u7136\uff0c\u5175\u4eba\u7df4\u7fd2\uff0c\u6b0a\u898b\u4e4b\u5927\u6071\uff0c\u589e\u5176\u5175\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. L\u00fc Meng participated in Sun Quan's conquest of Danyang Commandery (\u4e39\u694a\u90e1; around present-day Xuancheng, Anhui) and made many contributions in battle. He was promoted to Commandant Who Pacifies the North () and appointed as the Chief () of Guangde County.(\u5f9e\u8a0e\u4e39\u694a\uff0c\u6240\u5411\u6709\u529f\uff0c\u62dc\u5e73\u5317\u90fd\u5c09\uff0c\u9818\u5ee3\u5fb7\u9577\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. ==Battle of Jiangxia== In the spring of 208, L\u00fc Meng was assigned to be the navy commandant when Sun Quan launched a campaign against Huang Zu, the Administrator () of Jiangxia Commandery (present-day eastern Hubei). During the battle, Ling Tong and Dong Xi destroyed Huang Zu's two large mengchongs while L\u00fc Meng's unit defeated Huang Zu's navy. L\u00fc Meng killed Huang Zu's subordinate Chen Jiu () in the midst of battle. Huang Zu attempted to flee after learning of Chen Jiu's death, but was captured by Sun Quan's soldiers. After the battle, Sun Quan deemed L\u00fc Meng's contributions to be the most significant because Chen Jiu's death secured their victory. L\u00fc Meng was promoted to General of the Household Who Sweeps Across the Wilderness () and awarded 10 million coins.(\u5f9e\u5f81\u9ec3\u7956\uff0c\u7956\u4ee4\u90fd\u7763\u9673\u5c31\u9006\u4ee5\u6c34\u8ecd\u51fa\u6230\u3002\u8499\u52d2\u524d\u92d2\uff0c\u89aa\u689f\u5c31\u9996\uff0c\u5c07\u58eb\u4e58\u52dd\uff0c\u9032\u653b\u5176\u57ce\u3002\u7956\u805e\u5c31\u6b7b\uff0c\u59d4\u57ce\u8d70\uff0c\u5175\u8ffd\u79bd\u4e4b\u3002\u6b0a\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u4e8b\u4e4b\u514b\uff0c\u7531\u9673\u5c31\u5148\u7372\u4e5f\u3002\u300d\u4ee5\u8499\u70ba\u6a6b\u91ce\u4e2d\u90ce\u5c07\uff0c\u8cdc\u9322\u5343\u842c\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. ==Red Cliffs campaign== In the winter of 208, L\u00fc Meng participated in the Battle of Red Cliffs, in which the allied forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei defeated the forces of the northern warlord Cao Cao at Wulin (\u70cf\u6797; in present-day Honghu, Hubei). Cao Cao perfunctorily retreated to northern China, leaving behind his general Cao Ren to defend Nan Commandery (\u5357\u90e1; around present-day Jingzhou, Hubei). Sun Quan's forces, led by Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu, pressed on their attack and besieged Cao Ren in Nan Commandery.(\u662f\u6b72\uff0c\u53c8\u8207\u5468\u745c\u3001\u7a0b\u666e\u7b49\u897f\u7834\u66f9\u516c\u65bc\u70cf\u6797\uff0c\u570d\u66f9\u4ec1\u65bc\u5357\u90e1\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. Around the time, Xi Su (), a military officer from Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), brought along his men to defect to Sun Quan's side. Zhou Yu proposed to Sun Quan to let L\u00fc Meng take charge of Xi Su's troops. However, L\u00fc Meng praised Xi Su as a courageous person and declined to take over command of Xi Su's men. He believed it was disrespectful to do so because Xi Su had come a long way to join them. Sun Quan agreed with L\u00fc Meng and returned Xi Su's troops to him.(\u76ca\u5dde\u5c07\u8972\u8085\u8209\u8ecd\u4f86\u9644\uff0c\u745c\u8868\u4ee5\u8085\u5175\u76ca\u8499\uff0c\u8499\u76db\u7a31\u8085\u6709\u81bd\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u6155\u5316\u9060\u4f86\uff0c\u65bc\u7fa9\u5b9c\u76ca\u4e0d\u5b9c\u596a\u4e5f\u3002\u6b0a\u5584\u5176\u8a00\uff0c\u9084\u8085\u5175\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. During the siege of Nan Commandery, Zhou Yu ordered Gan Ning to lead a detachment to take control of Yiling (\u5937\u9675; present-day Yichang, Hubei), but Gan Ning came under attack by a separate enemy force led by Cao Ren's subordinates. When Gan Ning sent a messenger to Zhou Yu's camp to request for relief forces, most of Sun Quan's officers saw that they did not have enough men to spare, so they refused to help Gan Ning. L\u00fc Meng, however, insisted on saving Gan Ning. He told Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu: \"I suggest we leave Ling Tong behind while I follow you to help Gan Ning. It is imperative that we lift the siege (on Gan Ning) because he may not be able to hold out for long. I assure you that Ling Tong can defend our current position for at least ten days.\" L\u00fc Meng also suggested to Zhou Yu to send 300 men to block the enemy's retreat route with huge logs. When the reinforcements arrived at Yiling, they killed over half of the total number of enemy troops and forced the surviving ones to retreat at night. However, the enemy encountered the huge logs and were unable to cross over on horseback, so they had to dismount and proceed on foot. Sun Quan's pursuing forces arrived at the blockade and seized about 300 horses left behind by the enemy, which they transported back to their camp on boats. The morale of Zhou Yu's army improved greatly, so they crossed the Yangtze River, set up a garrison near the enemy base, and then engaged Cao Ren's forces in battle. Cao Ren lost the battle and eventually ordered his troops to abandon their position and retreat. Sun Quan's forces captured Nan Commandery and gained control over central Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan). Upon his return, L\u00fc Meng was promoted to Lieutenant-General () and appointed as the Prefect () of Xunyang County (\u5c0b\u967d\u7e23; southwest of present-day Huangmei County, Hubei).(\u745c\u4f7f\u7518\u5be7\u524d\u64da\u5937\u9675\uff0c\u66f9\u4ec1\u5206\u8846\u653b\u5be7\uff0c\u5be7\u56f0\u6025\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f7f\u8acb\u6551\u3002\u8af8\u5c07\u4ee5\u5175\u5c11\u4e0d\u8db3\u5206\uff0c\u8499\u8b02\u745c\u3001\u666e\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u7559\u6de9\u516c\u7e3e\uff0c\u8499\u8207\u541b\u884c\uff0c\u89e3\u570d\u91cb\u6025\uff0c\u52e2\u4ea6\u4e0d\u4e46\uff0c\u8499\u4fdd\u516c\u7e3e\u80fd\u5341\u65e5\u5b88\u4e5f\u3002\u300d\u53c8\u8aaa\u745c\u5206\u9063\u4e09\u767e\u4eba\u67f4\u65b7\u96aa\u9053\uff0c\u8cca\u8d70\u53ef\u5f97\u5176\u99ac\u3002\u745c\u5f9e\u4e4b\u3002\u8ecd\u5230\u5937\u9675\uff0c\u5373\u65e5\u4ea4\u6230\uff0c\u6240\u6bba\u904e\u534a\u3002\u6575\u591c\u9041\u53bb\uff0c\u884c\u9047\u67f4\u9053\uff0c\u9a0e\u7686\u820d\u99ac\u6b65\u8d70\u3002\u5175\u8ffd\u8e59\u64ca\uff0c\u7372\u99ac\u4e09\u767e\u5339\uff0c\u65b9\u8239\u8f09\u9084\u3002\u65bc\u662f\u5c07\u58eb\u5f62\u52e2\u81ea\u500d\uff0c\u4e43\u6e21\u6c5f\u7acb\u5c6f\uff0c\u8207\u76f8\u653b\u64ca\uff0c\u66f9\u4ec1\u9000\u8d70\uff0c\u9042\u64da\u5357\u90e1\uff0c\u64ab\u5b9a\u834a\u5dde\u3002\u9084\uff0c\u62dc\u504f\u5c07\u8ecd\uff0c\u9818\u5c0b\u967d\u4ee4\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. ==Scholarly pursuits== The Jiang Biao Zhuan () recorded that Sun Quan once told L\u00fc Meng and Jiang Qin: \"Both of you are commanders now so you should enrich yourself with knowledge.\" L\u00fc Meng replied: \"I have many things to attend to in the army, so I am afraid I won't have time to read.\" Sun Quan then said:(\u6c5f\u8868\u50b3\u66f0\uff1a\u521d\uff0c\u6b0a\u8b02\u8499\u53ca\u8523\u6b3d\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u537f\u4eca\u4e26\u7576\u5857\u638c\u4e8b\uff0c\u5b9c\u5b78\u554f\u4ee5\u81ea\u958b\u76ca\u3002\u300d\u8499\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u5728\u8ecd\u4e2d\u5e38\u82e6\u591a\u52d9\uff0c\u6050\u4e0d\u5bb9\u5fa9\u8b80\u66f8\u3002\u300d\u6b0a\u66f0\uff1a ...) Jiang Biao Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 54. L\u00fc Meng was so inspired by Sun Quan's words that he began to study diligently and acquire more knowledge. He eventually surpassed some Confucian scholars in terms of the number of texts he read.(\u8499\u59cb\u5c31\u5b78\uff0c\u7be4\u5fd7\u4e0d\u5026\uff0c\u5176\u6240\u89bd\u898b\uff0c\u820a\u5112\u4e0d\u52dd\u3002) Jiang Biao Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 54. ===Meeting with Lu Su=== In 210, after Lu Su succeeded Zhou Yu (who died of illness earlier that year) as the frontline commander of Sun Quan's forces, he passed by L\u00fc Meng's garrison on his way to Lukou (\u9678\u53e3; at Lushui Lake near present-day Chibi, Hubei). Lu Su had all along regarded L\u00fc Meng with contempt, but someone told him: \"General L\u00fc's fame and glory are increasing day by day. You shouldn't view him in the same light now as you did in the past. You should visit him soon.\" Lu Su then headed to L\u00fc Meng's camp. After some drinks, L\u00fc Meng asked Lu Su, \"You have received an important appointment and you are going to be stationed near Guan Yu. Have you made any contingency plans to deal with unforeseen circumstances?\" Lu Su lackadaisically replied, \"I will adapt to the situation when the time comes.\" L\u00fc Meng then said: \"The east and the west may be one family now, but Guan Yu is a person with the might of bears and tigers. How can you not make preparations beforehand?\" L\u00fc Meng then proposed five strategies to Lu Su on how to deal with Guan Yu. Lu Su left his seat, came closer to L\u00fc Meng, placed his hand on his shoulder and said, \"L\u00fc Ziming, I never knew you had such insights until I came here.\" He also visited L\u00fc Meng's mother and became friends with L\u00fc Meng.(\u9b6f\u8085\u4ee3\u5468\u745c\uff0c\u7576\u4e4b\u9678\u53e3\uff0c\u904e\u8499\u5c6f\u4e0b\u3002\u8085\u610f\u5c1a\u8f15\u8499\uff0c\u6216\u8aaa\u8085\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u5442\u5c07\u8ecd\u529f\u540d\u65e5\u986f\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u4ee5\u6545\u610f\u5f85\u4e5f\uff0c\u541b\u5b9c\u9867\u4e4b\u3002\u300d\u9042\u5f80\u8a63\u8499\u3002\u9152\u9163\uff0c\u8499\u554f\u8085\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u541b\u53d7\u91cd\u4efb\uff0c\u8207\u95dc\u7fbd\u70ba\u9130\uff0c\u5c07\u4f55\u8a08\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u5099\u4e0d\u865e\uff1f\u300d\u8085\u9020\u6b21\u61c9\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u81e8\u6642\u65bd\u5b9c\u3002\u300d\u8499\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u4eca\u6771\u897f\u96d6\u70ba\u4e00\u5bb6\uff0c\u800c\u95dc\u7fbd\u5be6\u718a\u864e\u4e5f\uff0c\u8a08\u5b89\u53ef\u4e0d\u8c6b\u5b9a\uff1f\u300d\u56e0\u70ba\u8085\u756b\u4e94\u7b56\u3002\u8085\u65bc\u662f\u8d8a\u5e2d\u5c31\u4e4b\uff0c\u62ca\u5176\u80cc\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u5442\u5b50\u660e\uff0c\u543e\u4e0d\u77e5\u537f\u624d\u7565\u6240\u53ca\u4e43\u81f3\u65bc\u6b64\u4e5f\u3002\u300d\u9042\u62dc\u8499\u6bcd\uff0c\u7d50\u53cb\u800c\u5225\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. ===Jiang Biao Zhuan account=== The Jiang Biao Zhuan recorded a slightly different account of the meeting between Lu Su and L\u00fc Meng. Lu Su placed his hand on L\u00fc Meng's shoulder and said: \"I heard you were previously a mere warrior. But now, you have taken up scholarly pursuits and you are no longer that Meng under Wu.\" L\u00fc Meng replied:(\u5f8c\u9b6f\u8085\u4e0a\u4ee3\u5468\u745c\uff0c\u904e\u8499\u8a00\u8b70\uff0c\u5e38\u6b32\u53d7\u5c48\u3002\u8085\u62ca\u8499\u80cc\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u543e\u8b02\u5927\u5f1f\u4f46\u6709\u6b66\u7565\u8033\uff0c\u81f3\u65bc\u4eca\u8005\uff0c\u5b78\u8b58\u82f1\u535a\uff0c\u975e\u5fa9\u5433\u4e0b\u963f\u8499\u3002\u300d) Jiang Biao Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 54. He then presented three strategies to Lu Su on how to counter Guan Yu. Lu Su respected L\u00fc Meng so he kept the strategies to himself and did not reveal them.(\u5bc6\u70ba\u8085\u9673\u4e09\u7b56\uff0c\u8085\u656c\u53d7\u4e4b\uff0c\u7955\u800c\u4e0d\u5ba3\u3002) Jiang Biao Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 54. The Chinese idioms \"Ah Meng from Wu\" () and \"rub one's eyes and look\" () originated from this conversation. The former is used to describe an unlearned person who achieves improvement through diligent study while the latter means to see a person in a different light, especially after the person has made remarkable improvement. ==Battles of Wan County and Ruxu== Cao Cao appointed Xie Qi () as the Agricultural Officer () of Qichun County and ordered him to station at Wan County (\u7696\u7e23; present-day Qianshan County, Anhui) to harass the border of Sun Quan's domain. L\u00fc Meng tried to induce Xie Qi into surrendering but failed, so he attacked Xie Qi. Xie Qi lost the battle and retreated. His subordinates, Sun Zicai () and Song Hao (), brought along several civilians and surrendered to L\u00fc Meng.(\u9b4f\u4f7f\u5eec\u6c5f\u8b1d\u5947\u70ba\u8604\u6625\u5178\u8fb2\uff0c\u5c6f\u7696\u7530\u9109\uff0c\u6578\u70ba\u908a\u5bc7\u3002\u8499\u4f7f\u4eba\u8a98\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f9e\uff0c\u5247\u4f3a\u9699\u8972\u64ca\uff0c\u5947\u9042\u7e2e\u9000\uff0c\u5176\u90e8\u4f0d\u5b6b\u5b50\u624d\u3001\u5b8b\u8c6a\u7b49\uff0c\u7686\u651c\u8ca0\u8001\u5f31\uff0c\u8a63\u8499\u964d\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. In 213, L\u00fc Meng followed Sun Quan to Ruxu (\u6fe1\u9808; north of present-day Wuwei County, Anhui) to guard against Cao Cao's advances. Sun Quan wanted to construct a dock at Ruxu, but his subordinates said, \"We should land on the other side of the river and attack the enemy, then return to our ships. Why build a dock?\" However, L\u00fc Meng supported the idea of building a dock and he said: \"Battles are unpredictable and we might not always win. If we lose and the enemy closes in, and we don't have time to retreat to the riverbank, how can we even board our ships?\" Sun Quan agreed with L\u00fc Meng and had the dock constructed to make boardings and landings more convenient. With this, Sun Quan's army defended their positions against Cao Cao's approaching forces, who retreated after several failed attempts to overcome the enemy.(\u5f8c\u5f9e\u6b0a\u62d2\u66f9\u516c\u65bc\u6fe1\u9808\uff0c\u6578\u9032\u5947\u8a08\uff0c\u53c8\u52f8\u6b0a\u593e\u6c34\u53e3\u7acb\u5862\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5099\u5fa1\u751a\u7cbe\uff0c\u66f9\u516c\u4e0d\u80fd\u4e0b\u800c\u9000\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54.(\u5433\u9304\u66f0\uff1a\u6b0a\u6b32\u4f5c\u5862\uff0c\u8af8\u5c07\u7686\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u4e0a\u5cb8\u64ca\u8cca\uff0c\u6d17\u8db3\u5165\u8239\uff0c\u4f55\u7528\u5862\u70ba\uff1f\u300d\u5442\u8499\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u5175\u6709\u5229\u920d\uff0c\u6230\u7121\u767e\u52dd\uff0c\u5982\u6709\u9082\u9005\uff0c\u6575\u6b65\u9a0e\u8e59\u4eba\uff0c\u4e0d\u6687\u53ca\u6c34\uff0c\u5176\u5f97\u5165\u8239\u4e4e\uff1f\u300d\u6b0a\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u5584\u3002\u300d\u9042\u4f5c\u4e4b\u3002) Wu Lu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 54. ==Battle of Lujiang== Around 214, Cao Cao retreated from Ruxu, he appointed Zhu Guang () as the Administrator () of Lujiang Commandery (\u5eec\u6c5f\u90e1; around present-day Lujiang County, Anhui) and ordered him to station at Wan County (\u7696\u7e23; present-day Qianshan County, Anhui). Zhu Guang developed the area for agricultural use, while bribing bandits from Poyang County to cause trouble in Sun Quan's territories. L\u00fc Meng warned Sun Quan: \"The lands in Wan County are very fertile so the enemy's numbers will rise after they gain a bountiful harvest. Within a few years time, Cao Cao's military prowess would have increased significantly, so we should eliminate them soon.\" Sun Quan heeded L\u00fc Meng's advice and personally led a campaign to attack Lujiang Commandery. Before the battle, Sun Quan summoned all his officers and asked them for their opinions.(\u66f9\u516c\u9063\u6731\u5149\u70ba\u5eec\u6c5f\u592a\u5b88\uff0c\u5c6f\u7696\uff0c\u5927\u958b\u7a3b\u7530\uff0c\u53c8\u4ee4\u9593\u4eba\u62db\u8a98\u9131\u967d\u8cca\u5e25\uff0c\u4f7f\u4f5c\u5167\u61c9\u3002\u8499\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u7696\u7530\u80a5\u7f8e\uff0c\u82e5\u4e00\u6536\u5b70\uff0c\u5f7c\u8846\u5fc5\u589e\uff0c\u5982\u662f\u6578\u6b72\uff0c\u64cd\u614b\u898b\u77e3\uff0c\u5b9c\u65e9\u9664\u4e4b\u3002\u300d\u4e43\u5177\u9673\u5176\u72c0\u3002\u65bc\u662f\u6b0a\u89aa\u5f81\u7696\uff0c\u5f15\u898b\u8af8\u5c07\uff0c\u554f\u4ee5\u8a08\u7b56\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. The officers suggested to pile up earth to form small hills and replenish their equipment. However, L\u00fc Meng disagreed: \"It will take several days to build the hills and replenish our equipment. By then, the enemy would have reinforced their defences and their relief forces would have arrived, and we can't defeat them. The rainwater has flowed in, and the water level will subside if we linger on for days. By then, it will be very difficult for our ships to retreat and we may be in danger. As of now, I observe that the fortress's defences are weak, so we can achieve victory if we attack it from all directions when our army's morale is still high. We can retreat via the water route after that. That's the way to secure total victory.\" Sun Quan heeded L\u00fc Meng's suggestion.(\u5433\u66f8\u66f0\uff1a\u8af8\u5c07\u7686\u52f8\u4f5c\u571f\u5c71\uff0c\u6dfb\u653b\u5177\uff0c\u8499\u8da8\u9032\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u6cbb\u653b\u5177\u53ca\u571f\u5c71\uff0c\u5fc5\u6b77\u65e5\u4e43\u6210\uff0c\u57ce\u5099\u65e3\u8129\uff0c\u5916\u6551\u5fc5\u81f3\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u5716\u4e5f\u3002\u4e14\u4e58\u96e8\u6c34\u4ee5\u5165\uff0c\u82e5\u7559\u7d93\u65e5\uff0c\u6c34\u5fc5\u5411\u76e1\uff0c\u9084\u9053\u8271\u96e3\uff0c\u8499\u7aca\u5371\u4e4b\u3002\u4eca\u89c0\u6b64\u57ce\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u751a\u56fa\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e09\u8ecd\u92b3\u6c23\uff0c\u56db\u9762\u4e26\u653b\uff0c\u4e0d\u79fb\u6642\u53ef\u62d4\uff0c\u53ca\u6c34\u4ee5\u6b78\uff0c\u5168\u52dd\u4e4b\u9053\u4e5f\u3002\u300d\u6b0a\u5f9e\u4e4b\u3002) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 54. L\u00fc Meng recommended Gan Ning to lead the assault on Wan County while he followed behind with the elite troops. When they attacked at dawn, L\u00fc Meng himself beat a war drum to boost the soldiers' morale. They captured the fortress by noon. Around the same time, Cao Cao's general Zhang Liao was leading reinforcements from Hefei to help Zhu Guang. When he reached Jiashi (), he heard that Wan County had fallen to the enemy so he withdrew his troops. Sun Quan praised L\u00fc Meng for his bravery and appointed him as the Administrator of Lujiang Commandery. L\u00fc Meng gained 600 households from Xunyang County (\u5c0b\u967d\u7e23; southwest of present-day Huangmei County, Hubei) for his tuntian system and had 30 more subordinates placed under his command.(\u8499\u4e43\u85a6\u7518\u5be7\u70ba\u5347\u57ce\u7763\uff0c\u7763\u653b\u5728\u524d\uff0c\u8499\u4ee5\u7cbe\u92b3\u7e7c\u4e4b\u3002\u4fb5\u6668\u9032\u653b\uff0c\u8499\u624b\u57f7\u67b9\u9f13\uff0c\u58eb\u5352\u7686\u9a30\u8e0a\u81ea\u5347\uff0c\u98df\u6642\u7834\u4e4b\u3002\u65e3\u800c\u5f35\u907c\u81f3\u593e\u77f3\uff0c\u805e\u57ce\u5df2\u62d4\uff0c\u4e43\u9000\u3002\u6b0a\u5609\u5176\u529f\uff0c\u5373\u62dc\u5eec\u6c5f\u592a\u5b88\uff0c\u6240\u5f97\u4eba\u99ac\u7686\u5206\u8207\u4e4b\uff0c\u5225\u8cdc\u5c0b\u967d\u5c6f\u7530\u516d\u767e\u6236\uff0c\u5b98\u5c6c\u4e09\u5341\u4eba\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. When L\u00fc Meng returned to Xunyang County, he heard that some bandits were causing trouble in Luling Commandery (\u5eec\u9675\u90e1; southwest of present- day Ji'an, Jiangxi), and that many of Sun Quan's officers had been unsuccessful in defeating the bandits. Sun Quan remarked: \"A hundred birds of prey are not comparable to one osprey.\" He then ordered L\u00fc Meng to attack the bandits. L\u00fc Meng achieved success and killed the bandit chiefs but released the others and allowed them to revert to normal civilian life.(\u8499\u9084\u5c0b\u967d\uff0c\u672a\u671f\u800c\u5eec\u9675\u8cca\u8d77\uff0c\u8af8\u5c07\u8a0e\u64ca\u4e0d\u80fd\u79bd\uff0c\u6b0a\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u9dd9\u9ce5\u7d2f\u767e\uff0c\u4e0d\u5982\u4e00\u9d9a\u3002\u300d\u5fa9\u4ee4\u8499\u8a0e\u4e4b\u3002\u8499\u81f3\uff0c\u8a85\u5176\u9996\u60e1\uff0c\u9918\u7686\u91cb\u653e\uff0c\u5fa9\u70ba\u5e73\u6c11\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. ==Sun\u2013Liu territorial dispute== Around 212, Sun Quan's ally Liu Bei embarked on a campaign to seize control of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) from its governor, Liu Zhang. He left Guan Yu behind to defend his territories in southern Jing Province during his absence. After Liu Bei completely took over Yi Province in 214, Sun Quan perceived that he was \"lending\" territories in Jing Province to Liu Bei per an earlier agreement in 210 so he wanted the territories back because Liu Bei already had a new base in Yi Province. When Liu Bei refused, Sun Quan ordered L\u00fc Meng to lead troops to seize three commanderies \u2013 Changsha (), Lingling (\u96f6\u9675; around present-day Yongzhou, Hunan) and Guiyang (\u6842\u967d; around present-day Chenzhou, Hunan).(\u662f\u6642\u5289\u5099\u4ee4\u95dc\u7fbd\u93ae\u5b88\uff0c\u5c08\u6709\u834a\u571f\uff0c\u6b0a\u547d\u8499\u897f\u53d6\u9577\u6c99\u3001\u96f6\u3001\u6842\u4e09\u90e1\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. L\u00fc Meng wrote to the administrators of the three commanderies to ask them to submit to Sun Quan. They all agreed except Lingling's administrator, Hao Pu (). Liu Bei returned to Jing Province when he heard of L\u00fc Meng's advances and garrisoned troops at Gong'an County while ordering Guan Yu to lead an army to take back the three commanderies. At the time, Sun Quan was at Lukou (\u9678\u53e3; at Lushui Lake near present-day Chibi, Hubei) and he sent Lu Su to lead 10,000 troops to Yiyang to block Guan Yu. Sun Quan also sent an urgent order to L\u00fc Meng, ordering him to give up on Lingling and lead his troops to Yiyang to assist Lu Su.(\u8499\u79fb\u66f8\u4e8c\u90e1\uff0c\u671b\u98a8\u6b78\u670d\uff0c\u60df\u96f6\u9675\u592a\u5b88\u90dd\u666e\u57ce\u5b88\u4e0d\u964d\u3002\u800c\u5099\u81ea\u8700\u89aa\u81f3\u516c\u5b89\uff0c\u9063\u7fbd\u722d\u4e09\u90e1\u3002\u6b0a\u6642\u4f4f\u9678\u53e3\uff0c\u4f7f\u9b6f\u8085\u5c07\u842c\u4eba\u5c6f\u76ca\u967d\u62d2\u7fbd\uff0c\u800c\u98db\u66f8\u53ec\u8499\uff0c\u4f7f\u6368\u96f6\u9675\uff0c\u6025\u9084\u52a9\u8085\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. When L\u00fc Meng pacified Changsha, he passed by Ling County (\u9143\u7e23; east of present-day Hengyang, Hunan) and met Deng Xuanzhi (), an old friend of Hao Pu. He planned to use Deng Xuanzhi to trick Hao Pu into surrendering. That night, L\u00fc Meng summoned all his officers and gave them instructions on how to attack Lingling the following morning, without telling them that Sun Quan had given orders for them to give up on Lingling and move to Yiyang. He lied to Deng Xuanzhi that Liu Bei was besieged in Hanzhong by Cao Cao's general Xiahou Yuan and that Guan Yu was occupied in a battle at Nan Commandery. He then asked Deng Xuanzhi to help him persuade Hao Pu to give up on Lingling. Deng Xuanzhi went to see Hao Pu later and conveyed L\u00fc Meng's message. Hao Pu became afraid when he heard that he had been isolated, so he agreed to surrender and asked Deng Xuanzhi to lead him to L\u00fc Meng. When L\u00fc Meng met Hao Pu, he revealed the truth, clapped his hands and laughed. Hao Pu became wrecked with guilt when he learnt that both Liu Bei and Guan Yu were actually free to reinforce Lingling but it was too late. L\u00fc Meng left Sun He () behind to guard the three commanderies while he headed towards Yiyang per Sun Quan's order.(\u521d\uff0c\u8499\u65e3\u5b9a\u9577\u6c99\uff0c\u7576\u4e4b\u96f6\u9675\uff0c\u904e\u9143\uff0c\u8f09\u5357\u967d\u9127\u7384\u4e4b\uff0c\u7384\u4e4b\u8005\u90dd\u666e\u4e4b\u820a\u4e5f\uff0c\u6b32\u4ee4\u8a98\u666e\u3002\u53ca\u88ab\u66f8\u7576\u9084\uff0c\u8499\u7955\u4e4b\uff0c\u591c\u53ec\u8af8\u5c07\uff0c\u6388\u4ee5\u65b9\u7565\uff0c\u6668\u7576\u653b\u57ce\uff0c\u9867\u8b02\u7384\u4e4b\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u90dd\u5b50\u592a\u805e\u4e16\u9593\u6709\u5fe0\u7fa9\u4e8b\uff0c\u4ea6\u6b32\u70ba\u4e4b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u77e5\u6642\u4e5f\u3002\u5de6\u5c07\u8ecd\u5728\u6f22\u4e2d\uff0c\u70ba\u590f\u4faf\u6df5\u6240\u570d\u3002\u95dc\u7fbd\u5728\u5357\u90e1\uff0c\u4eca\u81f3\u5c0a\u8eab\u81ea\u81e8\u4e4b\u3002\u8fd1\u8005\u7834\u6a0a\u672c\u5c6f\uff0c\u6551\u9143\uff0c\u9006\u70ba\u5b6b\u898f\u6240\u7834\u3002\u6b64\u7686\u76ee\u524d\u4e4b\u4e8b\uff0c\u541b\u6240\u89aa\u898b\u4e5f\u3002\u5f7c\u65b9\u9996\u5c3e\u5012\u7e23\uff0c\u6551\u6b7b\u4e0d\u7d66\uff0c\u8c48\u6709\u9918\u529b\u5fa9\u71df\u6b64\u54c9\uff1f\u4eca\u543e\u58eb\u5352\u7cbe\u92b3\uff0c\u4eba\u601d\u81f4\u547d\uff0c\u81f3\u5c0a\u9063\u5175\uff0c\u76f8\u7e7c\u65bc\u9053\u3002\u4eca\u4e88\u4ee5\u65e6\u5915\u4e4b\u547d\uff0c\u5f85\u4e0d\u53ef\u671b\u4e4b\u6551\uff0c\u7336\u725b\u8e44\u4e2d\u9b5a\uff0c\u517e\u8cf4\u6c5f\u6f22\uff0c\u5176\u4e0d\u53ef\u6043\u4ea6\u660e\u77e3\u3002\u82e5\u5b50\u592a\u5fc5\u80fd\u4e00\u58eb\u5352\u4e4b\u5fc3\uff0c\u4fdd\u5b64\u57ce\u4e4b\u5b88\uff0c\u5c1a\u80fd\u7a3d\u5ef6\u65e6\u5915\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f85\u6240\u6b78\u8005\uff0c\u53ef\u4e5f\u3002\u4eca\u543e\u8a08\u529b\u5ea6\u616e\uff0c\u800c\u4ee5\u653b\u6b64\uff0c\u66fe\u4e0d\u79fb\u65e5\uff0c\u800c\u57ce\u5fc5\u7834\uff0c\u57ce\u7834\u4e4b\u5f8c\uff0c\u8eab\u6b7b\u4f55\u76ca\u65bc\u4e8b\uff0c\u800c\u4ee4\u767e\u6b72\u8001\u6bcd\u6234\u767d\u53d7\u8a85\uff0c\u8c48\u4e0d\u75db\u54c9\uff1f\u5ea6\u6b64\u5bb6\u4e0d\u5f97\u5916\u554f\uff0c\u8b02\u63f4\u53ef\u6043\uff0c\u6545\u81f3\u65bc\u6b64\u8033\u3002\u541b\u53ef\u898b\u4e4b\uff0c\u70ba\u9673\u798d\u798f\u3002\u300d\u7384\u4e4b\u898b\u666e\uff0c\u5177\u5ba3\u8499\u610f\uff0c\u666e\u61fc\u800c\u807d\u4e4b\u3002\u7384\u4e4b\u5148\u51fa\u5831\u8499\uff0c\u666e\u5c0b\u5f8c\u7576\u81f3\u3002\u8499\u8c6b\u52d1\u56db\u5c07\uff0c\u5404\u9078\u767e\u4eba\uff0c\u666e\u51fa\uff0c\u4fbf\u5165\u5b88\u57ce\u9580\u3002\u9808\u81fe\u666e\u51fa\uff0c\u8499\u8fce\u57f7\u5176\u624b\uff0c\u8207\u4ff1\u4e0b\u8239\u3002\u8a9e\u7562\uff0c\u51fa\u66f8\u793a\u4e4b\uff0c\u56e0\u62ca\u624b\u5927\u7b11\uff0c\u666e\u898b\u66f8\uff0c\u77e5\u5099\u5728\u516c\u5b89\uff0c\u800c\u7fbd\u5728\u76ca\u967d\uff0c\u6159\u6068\u5165\u5730\u3002\u8499\u7559\u5b6b\u6cb3\u59d4\u4ee5\u5f8c\u4e8b\u3002\u5373\u65e5\u5f15\u8ecd\u8d74\u76ca\u967d\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. The territorial dispute between Sun Quan and Liu Bei was eventually resolved when both sides agreed to divide Jing Province between their respective domains along the Xiang River. Sun Quan released Hao Pu and returned Lingling Commandery to Liu Bei. L\u00fc Meng received Xunyang () and Yangxin () counties as his personal estate.(\u5289\u5099\u8acb\u76df\uff0c\u6b0a\u4e43\u6b78\u666e\u7b49\uff0c\u5272\u6e58\u6c34\uff0c\u4ee5\u96f6\u9675\u9084\u4e4b\u3002\u4ee5\u5c0b\u967d\u3001\u967d\u65b0\u70ba\u8499\u5949\u9091\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. ==Battles of Xiaoyao Ford and Ruxu== In 214, after returning from Jing Province, L\u00fc Meng joined Sun Quan in a campaign to conquer Hefei, which was defended by Cao Cao's general Zhang Liao. By 215, Sun Quan's forces had failed to breach Hefei's walls and had also sustained heavy casualties in the earlier engagements with the enemy. When a plague broke out in his army, Sun Quan decided to withdraw. While retreating, Sun Quan was caught up in a fierce counterattack by Zhang Liao, but managed to break out of the encirclement and reach safety when his officers, including L\u00fc Meng, fought with their lives to protect their lord at all costs.(\u5e2b\u9084\uff0c\u9042\u5f81\u5408\u80a5\uff0c\u65e3\u5fb9\u5175\uff0c\u70ba\u5f35\u907c\u7b49\u6240\u8972\uff0c\u8499\u8207\u6de9\u7d71\u4ee5\u6b7b\u625e\u885e\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. Later, in 217, Cao Cao personally led a large army to invade Sun Quan's garrison at Ruxu (\u6fe1\u9808; north of present-day Wuwei County, Anhui). Sun Quan led his forces to resist the enemy and placed L\u00fc Meng in charge of the army. L\u00fc Meng arrived at the dock, which was constructed earlier in 213, and stationed thousands of archers there to rain arrows on the enemy when they approached. He also attacked the camp of Cao Cao's vanguard force before the enemy established a foothold and succeeding in destroying the camp. Cao Cao saw that he could not overcome Sun Quan and eventually retreated. L\u00fc Meng was promoted to General of Tiger's Might () and appointed as Left Protector of the Army ().(\u5f8c\u66f9\u516c\u53c8\u5927\u51fa\u6fe1\u9808\uff0c\u6b0a\u4ee5\u8499\u70ba\u7763\uff0c\u64da\u524d\u6240\u7acb\u5862\uff0c\u7f6e\u5f4a\u5f29\u842c\u5f35\u65bc\u5176\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ee5\u62d2\u66f9\u516c\u3002\u66f9\u516c\u524d\u92d2\u5c6f\u672a\u5c31\uff0c\u8499\u653b\u7834\u4e4b\uff0c\u66f9\u516c\u5f15\u9000\u3002\u62dc\u8499\u5de6\u8b77\u8ecd\u3001\u864e\u5a01\u5c07\u8ecd\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. ==Succeeding Lu Su== In 217, when Lu Su died, L\u00fc Meng took over command of the former's troops, numbering over 10,000, and moved west to the garrison at Lukou (\u9678\u53e3; at Lushui Lake near present-day Chibi, Hubei). L\u00fc Meng was also appointed as the Administrator () of Hanchang Commandery (\u6f22\u660c\u90e1; southeast of present-day Pingjiang County, Hunan) and received Xiajun (), Liuyang (), Hanchang and Zhouling () counties as his personal marquisate. He was stationed near the Sun-Liu border, which was guarded by Liu Bei's general Guan Yu on the other side. L\u00fc Meng was aware of Guan Yu's military prowess and his intention of seizing Sun Quan's territories in Jing Province. He also knew that Guan Yu was in a strategic position on the upstream of the Yangtze River. He recognised that the temporary stability and truce between Sun Quan and Liu Bei would not last long.(\u9b6f\u8085\u5352\uff0c\u8499\u897f\u5c6f\u9678\u53e3\uff0c\u8085\u8ecd\u4eba\u99ac\u842c\u9918\u76e1\u4ee5\u5c6c\u8499\u3002\u53c8\u62dc\u6f22\u660c\u592a\u5b88\uff0c\u98df\u4e0b\u96cb\u3001\u5289\u967d\u3001\u6f22\u660c\u3001\u5dde\u9675\u3002\u8207\u95dc\u7fbd\u5206\u571f\u63a5\u5883\uff0c\u77e5\u7fbd\u9a4d\u96c4\uff0c\u6709\u5e76\u517c\u5fc3\uff0c\u4e14\u5c45\u570b\u4e0a\u6d41\uff0c\u5176\u52e2\u96e3\u4e46\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. Previously, Lu Su had advocated the maintenance of friendly relations between Sun Quan and Liu Bei to sustain their alliance against Cao Cao. L\u00fc Meng wrote a secret letter to Sun Quan:(\u521d\uff0c\u9b6f\u8085\u7b49\u4ee5\u70ba\u66f9\u516c\u5c1a\u5b58\uff0c\u798d\u96e3\u59cb\u6406\uff0c\u5b9c\u76f8\u8f14\u5354\uff0c\u8207\u4e4b\u540c\u4ec7\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u5931\u4e5f\uff0c\u8499\u4e43\u5bc6\u9673\u8a08\u7b56\u66f0\uff1a ...) Sanguozhi vol. 54. Sun Quan agreed with L\u00fc Meng and wanted to accept his suggestion. Later, he sought L\u00fc Meng's advice on attacking Cao Cao in Xu Province, to which L\u00fc Meng replied:(\u6b0a\u6df1\u7d0d\u5176\u7b56\uff0c\u53c8\u804a\u5fa9\u8207\u8ad6\u53d6\u5f90\u5dde\u610f\uff0c\u8499\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a ...)

When L\u00fc Meng was at Lukou, he treated his neighbours generously and maintained friendly ties with Guan Yu.(\u53ca\u8499\u4ee3\u8085\uff0c\u521d\u81f3\u9678\u53e3\uff0c\u5916\u500d\u8129\u6069\u539a\uff0c\u8207\u7fbd\u7d50\u597d\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. ==Invasion of Jing Province== In 219, Guan Yu led an army to attack Cao Cao's fortress at Fancheng (\u6a0a\u57ce; present-day Fancheng District, Xiangyang, Hubei), which was defended by Cao Ren. He left behind his subordinates Shi Ren and Mi Fang to defend Gong'an County and Nan Commandery (\u5357\u90e1; around present-day Jingzhou, Hubei) respectively. When L\u00fc Meng heard about that, he wrote to Sun Quan:(\u5f8c\u7fbd\u8a0e\u6a0a\uff0c\u7559\u5175\u5c07\u5099\u516c\u5b89\u3001\u5357\u90e1\u3002\u8499\u4e0a\u758f\u66f0\uff1a ...) Sanguozhi vol. 54. Sun Quan agreed to L\u00fc Meng's plan and played along by openly approving his request to return to Jianye for medical treatment.(\u9042\u7a31\u75c5\u7be4\uff0c\u6b0a\u4e43\u9732\u6a84\u53ec\u8499\u9084\uff0c\u9670\u8207\u5716\u8a08\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. Guan Yu fell for the ruse and withdrew the backup forces and advanced towards Fancheng. When Cao Cao heard of the attack at Fancheng, he sent Yu Jin to lead an army to relief Cao Ren, but Yu Jin lost the battle and surrendered to Guan Yu. Guan Yu's troops increased in numbers after his victory so he lacked food supplies. He sent his men to seize grain from one of Sun Quan's depots along the Xiang River. When Sun Quan heard about it, he sent L\u00fc Meng ahead to invade Jing Province while he followed up behind. L\u00fc Meng arrived at Xunyang County (\u5c0b\u967d\u7e23; southwest of present-day Huangmei County, Hubei), where he ordered his elite soldiers to disguise themselves as merchants and sail towards Nan Commandery. On the journey, they captured the watchtowers set up by Guan Yu along the river to prevent the defenders from learning of their approach. Guan Yu was totally unaware of this.(\u7fbd\u679c\u4fe1\u4e4b\uff0c\u7a0d\u64a4\u5175\u4ee5\u8d74\u6a0a\u3002\u9b4f\u4f7f\u4e8e\u7981\u6551\u6a0a\uff0c\u7fbd\u76e1\u79bd\u7981\u7b49\uff0c\u4eba\u99ac\u6578\u842c\uff0c\u8a17\u4ee5\u7ce7\u4e4f\uff0c\u64c5\u53d6\u6e58\u95dc\u7c73\u3002\u6b0a\u805e\u4e4b\uff0c\u9042\u884c\uff0c\u5148\u9063\u8499\u5728\u524d\u3002\u8499\u81f3\u5c0b\u967d\uff0c\u76e1\u4f0f\u5176\u7cbe\u5175[][]\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u767d\u8863\u6416\u6ad3\uff0c\u4f5c\u5546\u8cc8\u4eba\u670d\uff0c\u665d\u591c\u517c\u884c\uff0c\u81f3\u7fbd\u6240\u7f6e\u6c5f\u908a\u5c6f\u5019\uff0c\u76e1\u6536\u7e1b\u4e4b\uff0c\u662f\u6545\u7fbd\u4e0d\u805e\u77e5\u3002\u9042\u5230\u5357\u90e1\uff0c\u58eb\u4ec1\u3001\u9e8b\u82b3\u7686\u964d\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. Shi Ren, who was defending Gong'an County, surrendered to L\u00fc Meng after Yu Fan, an official under Sun Quan, persuaded him to do so. Earlier on, Guan Yu had punished Mi Fang for negligently causing some weapons to be destroyed in a fire. Although the incident was over, Mi Fang still feared Guan Yu. L\u00fc Meng showed understanding towards Mi Fang and convinced him to surrender as well.(\u5433\u66f8\u66f0\uff1a\u5c07\u8ecd\u58eb\u4ec1\u5728\u516c\u5b89\u62d2\u5b88\uff0c\u8499\u4ee4\u865e\u7ffb\u8aaa\u4e4b\u3002\u7ffb\u81f3\u57ce\u9580\uff0c\u8b02\u5b88\u8005\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u543e\u6b32\u8207\u6c5d\u5c07\u8ecd\u8a9e\u3002\u300d\u4ec1\u4e0d\u80af\u76f8\u898b\u3002\u4e43\u70ba\u66f8\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u660e\u8005\u9632\u798d\u65bc\u672a\u840c\uff0c\u667a\u8005\u5716\u60a3\u65bc\u5c07\u4f86\uff0c\u77e5\u5f97\u77e5\u5931\uff0c\u53ef\u8207\u70ba\u4eba\uff0c\u77e5\u5b58\u77e5\u4ea1\uff0c\u8db3\u5225\u5409\u51f6\u3002\u5927\u8ecd\u4e4b\u884c\uff0c\u65a5\u5019\u4e0d\u53ca\u65bd\uff0c\u70fd\u706b\u4e0d\u53ca\u8209\uff0c\u6b64\u975e\u5929\u547d\uff0c\u5fc5\u6709\u5167\u61c9\u3002\u5c07\u8ecd\u4e0d\u5148\u898b\u6642\uff0c\u6642\u81f3\u53c8\u4e0d\u61c9\u4e4b\uff0c\u7368\u5b88\u7e08\u5e36\u4e4b\u57ce\u800c\u4e0d\u964d\uff0c\u6b7b\u6230\u5247\u6bc0\u5b97\u6ec5\u7940\uff0c\u70ba\u5929\u4e0b\u8b4f\u7b11\u3002\u5442\u864e\u5a01\u6b32\u5f91\u5230\u5357\u90e1\uff0c\u65b7\u7d55\u9678\u9053\uff0c\u751f\u8def\u4e00\u585e\uff0c\u6848\u5176\u5730\u5f62\uff0c\u5c07\u8ecd\u70ba\u5728\u7b95\u820c\u4e0a\u8033\uff0c\u5954\u8d70\u4e0d\u5f97\u514d\uff0c\u964d\u5247\u5931\u7fa9\uff0c\u7aca\u70ba\u5c07\u8ecd\u4e0d\u5b89\uff0c\u5e78\u5b70\u601d\u7109\u3002\u300d\u4ec1\u5f97\u66f8\uff0c\u6d41\u6d95\u800c\u964d\u3002\u7ffb\u8b02\u8499\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u6b64\u8b4e\u5175\u4e5f\uff0c\u7576\u5c07\u4ec1\u884c\uff0c\u7559\u5175\u5099\u57ce\u3002\u300d\u9042\u5c07\u4ec1\u81f3\u5357\u90e1\u3002\u5357\u90e1\u592a\u5b88\u9e8b\u82b3\u57ce\u5b88\uff0c\u8499\u4ee5\u4ec1\u793a\u4e4b\uff0c\u9042\u964d\u3002) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 54.(\u5433\u9304\u66f0\uff1a\u521d\uff0c\u5357\u90e1\u57ce\u4e2d\u5931\u706b\uff0c\u9817\u711a\u71d2\u8ecd\u5668\u3002\u7fbd\u4ee5\u8cac\u82b3\uff0c\u82b3\u5167\u754f\u61fc\uff0c\u6b0a\u805e\u800c\u8a98\u4e4b\uff0c\u82b3\u6f5b\u76f8\u548c\u3002\u53ca\u8499\u653b\u4e4b\uff0c\u4e43\u4ee5\u725b\u9152\u51fa\u964d\u3002) Wu Lu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 54. After entering Nan Commandery, L\u00fc Meng treated the civilian population well, among whom included family members of Guan Yu's troops. He also gave strict orders to his men, forbidding them from disturbing the people. In one incident, L\u00fc Meng executed one of his soldiers for stealing from a civilian household, even though that soldier was an old acquaintance of his. He shed tears after that. This incident shocked the other soldiers in L\u00fc Meng's unit and they did not dare to defy his orders. L\u00fc Meng won the hearts of the people by showing kindness towards them \u2013 he provided necessities such as food and clothing to the elderly and the poor, and distributed medicine to the sick.

Guan Yu was returning to Nan Commandery when he heard that his territories in Jing Province had fallen to L\u00fc Meng. He sent messengers to meet L\u00fc Meng, who brought them on a tour of the city. When the messengers returned to Guan Yu, they spread the word that their families were well. Guan Yu's troops lost their fighting spirit after hearing that L\u00fc Meng treated their families better than how Guan Yu treated them in the past. Guan Yu knew that he had lost and was isolated, so he withdrew to Maicheng (\u9ea5\u57ce; around present-day Maicheng Village, Lianghe Town, Dangyang, Hubei). When they reached Zhang District () in the west, Guan Yu's men deserted and surrendered to Sun Quan's forces. Sun Quan sent Zhu Ran and Pan Zhang to block Guan Yu's retreat route. Guan Yu and his son Guan Ping were captured by Sun Quan's forces in an ambush and subsequently executed. Liu Bei lost all his territories in Jing Province to Sun Quan.(\u7fbd\u9084\uff0c\u5728\u9053\u8def\uff0c\u6578\u4f7f\u4eba\u8207\u8499\u76f8\u805e\uff0c\u8499\u8f12\u539a\u9047\u5176\u4f7f\uff0c\u5468\u6e38\u57ce\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bb6\u5bb6\u81f4\u554f\uff0c\u6216\u624b\u66f8\u793a\u4fe1\u3002\u7fbd\u4eba\u9084\uff0c\u79c1\u76f8\u53c3\u8a0a\uff0c\u54b8\u77e5\u5bb6\u9580\u7121\u6059\uff0c\u898b\u5f85\u904e\u65bc\u5e73\u6642\uff0c\u6545\u7fbd\u540f\u58eb\u7121\u9b2c\u5fc3\u3002\u6703\u6b0a\u5c0b\u81f3\uff0c\u7fbd\u81ea\u77e5\u5b64\u7aae\uff0c\u4e43\u8d70\u9ea5\u57ce\uff0c\u897f\u81f3\u6f33\u9109\uff0c\u8846\u7686\u59d4\u7fbd\u800c\u964d\u3002\u6b0a\u4f7f\u6731\u7136\u3001\u6f58\u748b\u65b7\u5176\u5f91\u8def\uff0c\u5373\u7236\u5b50\u4ff1\u7372\uff0c\u834a\u5dde\u9042\u5b9a\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. ==Death== For his achievements in the conquest of Jing Province, L\u00fc Meng was appointed as the Administrator () of Nan Commandery.

Earlier on, Sun Quan threw a feast at Gong'an County to celebrate the victory, but L\u00fc Meng did not want to attend because he was ill. Sun Quan laughed and said: \"Ziming, you deserve the honour of capturing Guan Yu. You have achieved victory but haven't received any reward yet, so how can you leave now?\" He ordered the soldiers to play music, and personally selected subordinates for L\u00fc Meng and the equipment required for the ceremony. After the ceremony, all the soldiers lined up along the path when L\u00fc Meng took his leave, with music playing in the background. That was L\u00fc Meng's finest hour.(\u6c5f\u8868\u50b3\u66f0\uff1a\u6b0a\u65bc\u516c\u5b89\u5927\u6703\uff0c\u5442\u8499\u4ee5\u75be\u8fad\uff0c\u6b0a\u7b11\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u79bd\u7fbd\u4e4b\u529f\uff0c\u5b50\u660e\u8b00\u4e5f\uff0c\u4eca\u5927\u529f\u5df2\u6377\uff0c\u6176\u8cde\u672a\u884c\uff0c\u8c48\u9091\u9091\u90aa\uff1f\u300d\u4e43\u589e\u7d66\u6b65\u9a0e\u9f13\u5439\uff0c\u52d1\u9078\u864e\u5a01\u5c07\u8ecd\u5b98\u5c6c\uff0c\u5e76\u5357\u90e1\u3001\u5eec\u6c5f\u4e8c\u90e1\u5a01\u5100\u3002\u62dc\u7562\u9084\u71df\uff0c\u5175\u99ac\u5c0e\u5f9e\uff0c\u524d\u5f8c\u9f13\u5439\uff0c\u5149\u8000\u4e8e\u8def\u3002) Jiang Biao Zhuan annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 54. L\u00fc Meng rejected the coins and gold, but Sun Quan insisted that he accept. He became ill again before he was enfeoffed as a marquis. Sun Quan was at Gong'an County then so he had L\u00fc Meng brought to his personal residence to stay with him. He also offered 1,000 jin of gold as a reward to any person who could cure L\u00fc Meng. Sun Quan became more worried as L\u00fc Meng's condition deteriorated over time. He wanted to see L\u00fc Meng but felt that it was too troublesome to keep moving around, so he had a hole drilled in the wall to observe L\u00fc Meng's room. He was happy when he saw L\u00fc Meng having his meals, but could not sleep at night when he saw that L\u00fc Meng did not eat anything. When L\u00fc Meng's condition improved slightly, he was so happy that he ordered his subjects to visit L\u00fc Meng and wish him well. He even invited Taoist priests to perform rituals to increase L\u00fc Meng's lifespan. Despite Sun Quan's efforts, L\u00fc Meng eventually died in Gong'an County at the age of 42 (by East Asian age reckoning). Sun Quan was extremely grieved by L\u00fc Meng's death. Before L\u00fc Meng died, he had instructed his family to store all their prized possessions \u2013 including gifts from Sun Quan \u2013 in a vault and return them to his lord after his death. He had also asked for a simple funeral.

However, L\u00fc Meng never hated Cai Yi for treating him with contempt. When Gu Shao (), the Administrator of Yuzhang Commandery, died, L\u00fc Meng recommended Cai Yi to Sun Quan to replace Gu Shao.

When L\u00fc Meng heard about it, he told Sun Quan: \"The Empire has yet to be pacified. Fierce generals like Gan Ning are hard to come by.

Chen Shou, who wrote L\u00fc Meng's biography in the Sanguozhi, commented on him as follows: \"L\u00fc Meng was courageous and witty, decisive and well-versed in military strategy. Deceiving Hao Pu and capturing Guan Yu \u2013 those were his finest moments. Initially, he was rash and reckless, but eventually he managed to exercise self-restraint. He possessed the magnanimity of a great statesman and was not a mere warrior! Sun Quan's comments on L\u00fc Meng, both positive and negative, were befitting, hence I included them in this record.\"(\u5442\u8499\u52c7\u800c\u6709\u8b00\uff0c\u65b7\u8b58\u8ecd\u8a08\uff0c\u8b4e\u90dd\u666e\uff0c\u79bd\u95dc\u7fbd\uff0c\u6700\u5176\u5999\u8005\u3002\u521d\u96d6\u8f15\u679c\u5984\u6bba\uff0c\u7d42\u65bc\u514b\u5df1\uff0c\u6709\u570b\u58eb\u4e4b\u91cf\uff0c\u8c48\u5f92\u6b66\u5c07\u800c\u5df2\u4e4e\uff01\u5b6b\u6b0a\u4e4b\u8ad6\uff0c\u512a\u52a3\u5141\u7576\uff0c\u6545\u8f09\u9304\u7109\u3002) Sanguozhi vol. 54. ==In Romance of the Three Kingdoms== L\u00fc Meng appears as a character in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period.

Purple-bearded coward, do you still recognise me?\" Sun Quan's subordinates immediately rush forth to save their lord. The possessed L\u00fc Meng shoves Sun Quan away and sits on his seat. With a furious expression on his face, he booms, \"Since defeating the Yellow Turban rebels, I have fought in wars for over 30 years. But I lost my life because you used an evil scheme against me. I can't feast on your flesh when I was still alive, but I can still seize L\u00fc Meng's soul after death! I am Guan Yunchang, the Marquis of Hanshou Village.\" Sun Quan and the others are so terrified that they sink to their knees. L\u00fc Meng collapses and dies, bleeding from seven body orifices.
