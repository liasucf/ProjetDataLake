    "text": "The Atom Station () is a novel by Icelandic author Halld\u00f3r Laxness, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1955. The initial print run sold out on the day it was published, for the first time in Icelandic history.'At\u00f3mst\u00f6\u00f0in', \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0viljinn, 69 (March 23rd, 1948), 1. ==Plot summary== Ugla, an unrefined girl from the countryside, moves from an outlying area of Northern Iceland to the capital city of Reykjav\u00edk in order to work for B\u00fai \u00c1rland, a member of parliament, and to learn how to play the organ. She\u2019s met with a world that\u2019s completely foreign to her: politicians and the military move freely about the city, and she views city residents as spoiled, snobbish and arrogant. In contrast, she comes from a rural area where the Icelandic Sagas of the Middle Ages constitute the majority of what people discuss and ponder and are viewed as more important than reality. These historical backgrounds are certainly important and provide crucial patterns. The prime minister subsequently carries out secret dealings with the Americans and \u201csells\u201d the country. Ugla, however, also confronts other current issues, above all in the organ player\u2019s house. There, she comes in contact with communist and anarchist mindsets and likewise protests the construction of an atom station in Iceland. After a short relationship with B\u00fai \u00c1rland, Ugla decides to return to the \u201cselfconscious policeman\u201d, who is the father of her recently born child. ===Cast=== ====In Eystridalur==== * Ugla Falsd\u00f3ttir, her mother and father * The priest ====At the home of B\u00fai \u00c1rland==== * B\u00fai \u00c1rland * B\u00fai's wife * B\u00fai's cook and her daughter * Their children: Arngr\u00edmur (Landalj\u00f3mi), Gu\u00f0n\u00fd (Aldinbl\u00f3\u00f0, 'Fruit-Blood'), \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0ur (Gullhr\u00fatur, 'gold ram'), \u00de\u00f3rgunnur (Daggeisli) * Visiting politicians: the Prime Minister, \u00d3li f\u00edg\u00fara, other politicians, and Americans ====At the Organist's house==== * Organistinn (The Organist) * The Organist's mother * Kleopatra * benjam\u00edn the atom-poet (a god) (maf\u00eda F.F.F.) * briljant\u00edn the atom-poet (a god) (maf\u00eda F.F.F.) * Tv\u00f6 hundru\u00f0 \u00fe\u00fasund naglb\u00edtar ('Two hundred thousand pliers') (maf\u00eda F.F.F.) * L\u00f6gregluma\u00f0ur feiminn ('The Selfconscious Policeman') * L\u00f6gregluma\u00f0ur \u00f3feiminn ('The Unselfconscious Policeman') == Background == The Atom Station, written in 1946 and 1947, was published in 1948. The historical background of the novel is the British and later American occupation of Iceland during World War II, including the urbanisation and monetization of the Icelandic economy it stimulated. Many viewed Iceland\u2019s independence as threatened due to the United States\u2019 request in 1946 to establish a military base in Keflav\u00edk for 99 years, and pressure on Iceland to join NATO. Laxness was critical of the fact that Icelandic jurisdiction was not applicable to the area within the military base. But above all, he saw a threat to Icelandic life, because, in the event of an atomic war, Iceland would become a potential target due to the military base. These fears are based on the impression left by the two atomic bombs which had been recently dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Laxness began writing the novel shortly after these events; however, the Icelandic Parliament (the Althing) eventually agreed to the request and concluded the Keflav\u00edk Contract, provoking the 1949 anti-NATO riot in Iceland. Many of the characters in the novel can be understood as satires of real figures in Icelandic business and politics at the time, or otherwise modelled on Laxness's friends and acquaintances, though the work is too sophisticated simply to be read as a roman \u00e0 clef.Peter Hallberg, Halld\u00f3r Laxness (Twayne, 1971), pp. 163--64. According to Laxness's biographer Hannes H\u00f3lmsteinn Gissurarson,'Segir At\u00f3mst\u00f6\u00f0ina eiga s\u00e9r fyrirmynd \u00ed t\u00e9kkneskri b\u00f3k', Morgunbla\u00f0i\u00f0, 22.10.2004, http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2004/10/22/segir_atomstodina_eiga_ser_fyrirmynd_i_tekkneskri_b/. * One model for the main character, Ugla, was Arnhei\u00f0ur Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir. * The Organist was inspired primarily by Laxness's friends Erlendur Gu\u00f0mundsson \u00ed Unuh\u00fasi (to whom the book is dedicated) and \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0ur Sigtryggsson. * The main models for B\u00fai \u00c1rland would mainly be Gu\u00f0mundur Vilhj\u00e1lmsson, the chairman of Eimskip, and P\u00e1lmi Hannesson, rector of Menntask\u00f3linn \u00ed Reykjav\u00edk. * The Prime Minister is based on \u00d3lafur Thors (and the novel, amongst other things, a transparent attack on \u00d3lafur). * Landalj\u00f3mi is based on Thor Vilhj\u00e1lmsson. * The god Briljant\u00edn is based on Ragnar Fr\u00edmann Kristj\u00e1nsson * Kle\u00f3patra's model is Gu\u00f0munda Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir. * Tv\u00f6 hundru\u00f0 \u00fe\u00fasund naglb\u00edtar (Two Hundred Thousand Pliers) is a combination of Sigurj\u00f3n P\u00e9tursson and J\u00f3hann \u00de. J\u00f3sefsson. ==Reception== First English-language edition Early Icelandic reviewers read the book primarily as a satire on the politics of the day; it has traditionally been seen as one of Laxness's weaker works,Giuliano D\u2019Amico, 'The Whole World Is One Atom Station: Laxness, the Cold War, Postcolonialism, and the Economic Crisis in Iceland', Scandinavian Studies, 87 (2015), 457-88 (p. 459), https://muse.jhu.edu/article/616175. though it has long been read as Iceland's first urban novel, foreshadowing the prominence of Reykjav\u00edk in more recent literature.\u00c1str\u00e1\u00f0ur Eysteinsson and \u00dafhildur Dagsd\u00f3ttir, 'Icelandic Prose Literature, 1940--2000', in A History of Icelandic Literature, ed. by Daisy Nejmann, History of Scandinavian literatures, 5 (University of Nebraska Press: 2007), pp. 404--70 (p. 411). However, more recent critics have seen it as offering more enduring theological,John Macqueen, \u201cTheology and The Atom Station\u201d, in Afm\u00e6liskve\u00f0jur heiman og handan.

Laxness endured political persecution for the novel: the Al\u00feingi withdrew his state writer's stipend; he was prosecuted for describing an abortion; and 'Icelandic and American authorities even started investigating his periods of residence in America, with the hope of finding some fiscal irregularities and ruining him'. He also struggled to get the novel translated.Giuliano D\u2019Amico, 'The Whole World Is One Atom Station: Laxness, the Cold War, Postcolonialism, and the Economic Crisis in Iceland', Scandinavian Studies, 87 (2015), 457-88 (p. 461), https://muse.jhu.edu/article/616175. ==Influence and adaptations== At\u00f3mst\u00f6\u00f0in has been characterised as 'what many readers and critics gradually came to think of as the exemplary Reykjav\u00edk novel', focusing on urban Icelandic life for the first time.\u00c1str\u00e1\u00f0ur Eysteinsson and \u00dafhildur Dagsd\u00f3ttir, 'Icelandic Prose Literature, 1940--1980', in A History of Icelandic Literature, ed. by Daisy Nejmann, History of Scandinavian literatures, 5 (University of Nebraska Press: 2007), pp. 404--70 (p. 411). . Laxness dubbed one of his characters, benjam\u00edn, an at\u00f3msk\u00e1ld ('atom-poet'), as a derogatory reference to modernist poets. The name came to be applied to a real group of poets, the Atom Poets.Eysteinn \u00deorvaldsson, 'Icelandic Poetry Since 1940', in A History of Icelandic Literature, ed. by Daisy Nejmann, History of Scandinavian literatures, 5 (University of Nebraska Press: 2007), pp. 471-- (p. 474). . The book was adapted as a film by \u00deorsteinn J\u00f3nsson in 1984.At\u00f3mst\u00f6\u00f0in (1984) - IMDb Through the film, the book has been seen to have continued resonances in twenty-first-century Iceland: 'the powerful imagery is coincidentally linked to the 2009 protests ... following the Icelandic banking crisis'.Helga \u00de\u00f3rey J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir, 'Atomic Station', in World Film Locations: Reykjav\u00edk, ed. by Jez Connolly and Caroline Whelan (Bristol: Intellect Books, 2012), pp. 14-15 (14). ==See also== * GIUK gap ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:1948 novels Category:Icelandic novels Category:Novels by Halld\u00f3r Laxness Category:Novels set in Iceland Category:Icelandic-language novels Category:Icelandic books ",
