    "text": "In the V\u00f6lundarkvi\u00f0a, Wayland Smith and his brothers marry valkyries who dress in swan skins. The swan maiden is a mythical creature who shapeshifts from human form to swan form. The key to the transformation is usually a swan skin, or a garment with swan feathers attached. In folktales of this type, the male character spies the maiden, typically by some body of water (usually bathing), then snatches away the feather garment (or some other article of clothing), which prevents her from flying away (or swimming away, or renders her helpless in some other manner), forcing her to become his wife. There are parallels around the world, notably the V\u00f6lundarkvi\u00f0a and Grimms' Fairy Tales KHM 193 \"The Drummer\". There are also many parallels involving creatures other than swans. ==Legend== ===Typical legend=== The hunter recognizes his bride amongst the parade of identical maidens. Illustration from Jacobs's Europa's Fairy Book by John D. Batten The folktales usually adhere to the following basic plot. A young, unmarried man steals a magic robe made of swan feathers from a swan maiden so that she will not fly away, and marries her. Usually she bears his children. When the children are older they sing a song about where their father has hidden their mother's robe, or one asks why the mother always weeps, and finds the cloak for her, or they otherwise betray the secret. The swan maiden immediately gets her robe and disappears to where she came from. Although the children may grieve her, she does not take them with her. If the husband is able to find her again, it is an arduous quest, and often the impossibility is clear enough so that he does not even try. In many versions, although the man is unmarried (or, very rarely, a widower), he is aided by his mother, who hides the maiden's magical garment (or feather cloak). At some point later in the story, the mother is convinced or forced to give back the hidden clothing and, as soon as the swan maiden puts it, she glides towards the skies - which prompts the quest. ===Germanic legend=== The stories of Wayland the Smith describe him as falling in love with Swanhilde, a Swan Maiden, who is the daughter of a marriage between a mortal woman and a fairy king, who forbids his wife to ask about his origins; on her asking him he vanishes. Swanhilde and her sisters are however able to fly as swans. But wounded by a spear, Swanhilde falls to earth and is rescued by the master- craftsman Wieland, and marries him, putting aside her wings and her magic ring of power. Wieland's enemies, the Neidings, under Princess Bathilde, steal the ring, kidnap Swanhilde and destroy Wieland's home. When Wieland searches for Swanhilde, they entrap and cripple him. However he fashions wings for himself and escapes with Swanhilde as the house of the Neidings is destroyed. Another occurrence in Germanic legend of the maiden with the magic swan-shirt that allows her avian transformation involves the legendary Valkyries. The first tale concerns valkyrie Brynhild.Cox, Marian Roalfe. An introduction to Folk- Lore. London: Charles Scribner's Sons. 1895. p. 120. In the V\u00f6lsunga saga, King Agnar withholds Brynhild's magical swan shirt, thus forcing her into his service as his enforcer.Chantepie de La Saussaye, P. D. The Religion of the Ancient Teutons. Translated from the Dutch by Bert J. Vos. Boston; London: Ginn & Company. 1902. pp. 311-312. A second tale with a valkyrie is the story of K\u00e1ra and Helgi Haddingjaskati, attested in the Kara-lied.Hertz, Wilhelm. Gedichte. Hoffman und Campe. 1859. pp. 190-201.Leland, Charles Godfrey. Legends of the Birds. New York: H. Holt & co. 1874. p. 6 (footnote nr 1). ===Swan maiden as daughter or servant to an antagonist=== The second type of tale involves the swan maiden helping the hero against an antagonist. It can be the maiden's mistress, e. g., a witch, as in a tale published by illustrator Howard Pyle in The Wonder Clock,Pyle, Howard; Pyle, Katharine. The Wonder Clock: Or, Four & Twenty Marvellous Tales, Being One for Each Hour of the Day. New York: Printed by Harper & Brothers. 1915 (1887). pp. 231-240. or the maiden's father, e. g., the character of Morskoi Tsar in Russian fairy tales.Ralston, William Ralston Shedden. Russian folk-tales. London: Smith, Elder, & co.. 1873. pp. 129-130. In a Gaelic story, a prince plays a round of shinty with an old man named Bodach Glas. In the third round, the old man commands the youth to find him. Not knowing of the Bodach's dwelling place, the prince's stepmother suggests he requests the help of her sons. His oldest stepbrother informs him that in a nearby lake three swans come to bathe, but in reality they are the daughters of Bodach Glas, who take off their garments to bathe. The stepbrother suggests the prince seizes the opportunity to steal the youngest maiden's clothing and force her to take the prince to her father's abode.\"The Tale of the 'Bodach Glas', translated from the Gaelic, by Mrs. Mackellar\". In: The Celtic Magazine. Edited by Alexander McBain. Vol. XII. Inverness: A. and W. Mackenzie. 1887. pp. 12-16 and 57-64. The rest of the tale follows The Master Maid, or Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index ATU 313, \"The Magical Flight\". Folklorist Katharine Mary Briggs reported a similar story from Scotland, titled Green Sleeves. In it, the prince loves to gamble and one day gambles with a man named Green Sleeves, who wins the bet and in return asks for the youth as an apprentice/slave/servant. In order to find Green Sleeves's house, the prince fetches the swan garments of a bathing maiden, named Blue Wing, who was one of the daughters of Green Sleeves.Briggs, Katharine M. An Encyclopedia of Fairies: Hobglobins, Brownies, Bogies and Other Supernatural Creatures. New York: Pantheon Books. 1976. pp. 202-204. Katharine Mary Briggs, in the same book, cited The Green Man of Knowledge as another tale containing the character of the swan maiden as the daughter of the tale's nemesis (ogre, giant, wizard, fairy king, etc.).Briggs, Katharine. An Encyclopedia of Fairies: Hobglobins, Brownies, Bogies and Other Supernatural Creatures. New York: Pantheon Books. 1976. p. 308. In the Celtic story \"The Tale of the Son of the King of Ireland and the Daughter of the King of the Red Cap\" (Gaelic: Sgeulachd air Mac Righ \u00c9irionn agus Nighean R\u00edgh a' Churraichd Ruaidh), the prince of Ireland falls in love with the White Swan of the Smooth Neck, also called Sunshine, the young daughter of the King of the Red Cap, as he saw her coming to bathe in a lake.Waifs and strays of Celtic tradition. Vol. III. London: David Nutt. 1889. pp. 145-157 (in English) and 167-186 (in Gaelic). In an Irish tale, The Story of Grey Norris from Warland, John, a king's son, plays ball three times with \"an old man with a long grey beard\" named Grey Norris from Warland, who wins the third round and sets the prince a task: the youth must find Grey Norris's castle by the end of the year. After some time, he rescues an eagle that informs him that three maidens will come to bathe in the water in the form of swans; he should hide the youngest's garment, because she is Grey Norris's daughter.Britten, James. \"Irish Folk-Tales\". In: The Folk-Lore Journal Vol. 1. London: Publ. by Folk- Lore Society. 1883. pp. 316-324. In a Flemish fairy tale, Het zwanenmeisje van den glazen berg (\"The Swan Maiden of the Glass Mountain\"), a young hunter fetches the swan garment of a bathing maiden, who asks for it in return. When she wears it, she tells the hunter to find her in the Glass Mountain. After he succeeds in climbing the mountain, the youth recognizes his beloved swan maiden and asks her mother forher daughter's hand in marriage. The mother assures the human he will be able to marry her daughter, after doing three difficult chores.de Meyere, Victor. De Vlaamsche vertelselschat. Deel 2. 1ste druk. 1927. pp. 195-199. ===Other fiction=== The swan maiden has appeared in numerous items of fiction. ====In legend==== In the Irish Mythological Cycle of stories, in the tale of The Wooing of \u00c9taine, a similar test involving the recognition of the wife among lookalikes happens to Eochu Airem, when he has to find his beloved \u00c9taine, who flew away in the shape of a swan. A second Irish tale of a maiden changing into a swan is the story of hero \u00d3engus, who falls in love with Caer Ibormeith, in a dream. In a Tatar poem, there appears the character of The Swan-Women, who develops an inimical relationship with hero Kartaga.Dixon-Kennedy, Mike (1998). Encyclopedia of Russian and Slavic myth and legend. pp. 146 and 274. ABC-CLIO. .Manning, Clarence Augustus. \"The Tauric Maiden and Allied Cults\". In: Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association 51 (1920): 45. Accessed August 22, 2020. doi:10.2307/282870. 19th century folkloristic publications mentioned a tale about Grace's Well, a well whose caretaker's carelessness led her to be turned into a swan by the fairies. The well was reported to be near Glasfryn lake, somewhere in Wales.\"Grace's Well\". In: Thomas, William Jenkyn. The Welsh Fairy Book. [1908]Rhys, John. Celtic folklore: Welsh and Manx. Oxford: Clarendon Press. 1901. pp. 370 and 375. ====In folklore==== British folklorist Katharine Mary Briggs, while acknowledging the universality of the tale, suggested the character seemed more prevalent in the Celtic fairy tale tradition of the British Islands.Briggs, Katharine. An Encyclopedia of Fairies: Hobglobins, Brownies, Bogies and Other Supernatural Creatures. New York: Pantheon Books. 1976. pp. 202-204. In the same vein, William Bernard McCarthy reported that in Irish tradition the tale type ATU 400 (\"Swan Maiden\") is frequently merged with ATU 313 (\"The Master Maid\", \"The Magical Flight\", \"The Devil's Daughter\").McCarthy, William Bernard. Cinderella in America: a book of folk and fairy tales. The University Press of Mississippi. 2007. p. 386. In a Celtic tale (Gaelic: Mac an Tuathanaich a Th\u00e0inig a Raineach; English: \"The Farmer's son who came from Rannoch\"), the farmer's son sees three swan maidens bathing in water and hides their clothing, in exchange for the youngest of them (sisters, in all) to marry him.Waifs and strays of Celtic tradition. Vol. III: Folk & hero tales from Argyllshire. London: David Nutt. 1889. pp. 286-289. Another occurrence of the motif exists in Russian folktale Sweet Mik\u00e1ilo Iv\u00e1novich the Rover: Mikailo Ivanovich goes hunting and, when he sets his aim on a white swan, it pleads for its life. Then, the swan transforms into a lovely maiden, Princess M\u00e1rya, whom Mikail falls in love with.Hapgood, Isabel Florence. The Epic Songs of Russia. London: C. Scribner's sons. 1886. pp. 214-231. A version of the plot of the Swan Maiden happens in Swabian tale The Three Swans (Von drei Schw\u00e4nen): a widowed hunter, guided by an old man of the woods, secures the magical garment of the swan-maiden and marries her. Fifteen years pass, and his second wife finds her swan-coat and flies away. The hunter trails after her and reaches a castle, where his wife and her sisters live. The swan-maiden tells him that he must pass through arduous trials in the castle for three nights, in order to break the curse cast upon the women.Meier, Ernst. Deutsche Volksm\u00e4rchen aus Schwaben. Stuttgart. 1852. pp. 38-42. The motif of staying overnight in an enchanted castle echoes the tale of The Youth who wanted to learn what Fear was (ATU 326). Flemish fairy tale collections also contain two tales with the presence of the Swan Maiden: De Koning van Zevenbergen (\"The King of Sevenmountains\")de Cock, Alfons; de Mont, Pol. Dit zijn Vlaamsche wondersprookjes, het volk naverteld. Gent: 1896. Tale nr. 11. and Het Zwanenmeisje van den glazen Berg (\"The Swan Maiden from the Glass Mountain\").de Meyere, Victor. De Vlaamsche vertelschat. Vol. 2. 1927. Johannes Bolte, in a book review of Pol de Mont and Alfons de Cock's publication, noted that their tale was parallel to Grimms' KHM 193, The Drummer.Bolte, J. \"Vlaamsche Wonder-Sprookjes\". In: Zeitschrift des Vereins f\u00fcr Volkskunde. Berlin: Verlag von A. Asher & Co. 1896. p. 224. In an Iberian tale (The Seven Pigeons), a fisherman spots a black-haired girl combing her hair in the rocks. Upon the approach of two pigeons, she finishes her grooming activity and turns into a swan wearing a crown on her head. When the three birds land on a nearby ship, they regain their human forms of maidens.Sellers, Charles. Tales from the lands of nuts and grapes (Spanish and Portuguese folklore). London: Field. 1888. pp. 133-149. The character of the swan-maiden also appears in an etiological tale from Romania about the origin of the swan,Gaster, Moses. Rumanian bird and beast stories. London: Sidgwick & Jackson. 1915. pp. 246-255. and a ballad with the same theme.Gaster, Moses. Rumanian bird and beast stories. London: Sidgwick & Jackson. 1915. pp. 256-258. The usual plot involves a magical bird-maiden that descends from heavens to bathe in a lake. However, there are variants where the maiden and/or her sisters are princesses under a curse, such as in Finnish story Vaino and the Swan Princess,\"Vaino and the Swan Princess\". In: Bowman, James Cloyd and Bianco, Margery. Tales from a Finnish tupa. Chicago: A. Whitman & Co. 1964 (1936). pp. 34-41. or in the German tale collected by Johann Wilhelm Wolf (German: Von der sch\u00f6nen Schwanenjungfer; English: The tale of the beautiful swan maiden). In the German narrative, a hunter in France sights a swan in a lake who pleads not to shoot her. The swan also reveals she is a princess and, to break her curse, he must suffer dangerous trials in a castle.Wolf, Johann Wilhelm. Deutsche Hausm\u00e4rchen. G\u00f6ttingen/Leipzig 1851. pp. 216-224. Other example of multiple swan princesses can be found in the Finnish tale of prince Tuhkimo (a male Cinderella; from Finnish tuhka, \"ashes\") who marries a shapeshifting frog (ATU 402, \"The Animal Bride\" tale), but, when he burns her enchanted skin, his wife, now human, metamorphoses into a swan and flies away with her eight swan sisters (ATU 400, \"The Quest for the Lost Wife\").\"Le Cendrillon et sa fianc\u00e9e la grenouille\". In: Beauvois, Eug\u00e9ne. Contes populaires de la Norv\u00e8ge, de la Finlande & de la Bourgogne, etc. Paris: E. Dentu, \u00c9diteur. 1862. pp. 180-194. A Native American tale has the character of the Red Swan, a bird of reddened plumage. The bird attracts the attention of a young warrior, who goes on a quest to find her.Schoolcraft, Henry Rowe. The Indian fairy book, from the original legends. New York, Frederick A. Stokes company. 1916. pp. 42-71. In a Belgian fairy tale, reminiscent of the legend of the Knight of the Swan, The Swan Maidens and the Silver Knight, seven swans - actually seven princesses cursed into that form - plot to help the imprisoned princess Elsje with the help of the Silver Knight. Princess Elsje, of her own accord, wants to help the seven swan sisters regain her human form by knitting seven coats and staying silent all the while for the enchantment to work.Griffis, William Elliot. Belgian fairy tales. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell company. [1919?] pp. 17-30. In the Irish fairy tale The Three Daughters of the King of the East and the Son of a King in Erin, three swan maidens come to bathe in a lake (Loch Erne) and converse with a king's elder son, who was fishing at the lake. His evil stepmother convinces a young cowherd to stick a magic pin to the prince's clothes to make him fall asleep. The spell works twice, and in both occasions the swan maidens try to help the prince come to.Curtin, Jeremiah. Myths and folk-lore of Ireland. London: S. Low, Marson, Searle [and] Rivington. 1890. pp. 129-138. A similar narrative is the Irish tale The Nine-Legged Steed.Larminie, William. West Irish folk-tales and romances. London: E. Stock. 1893. pp. 219-231. In a tale collected in Wimpfen, near the river Neckar (Die drei Schw\u00e4ne), a youth was resting by the edge of a lake when he sighted three snow-white swans. He fell asleep and, whan he woke up, noticed he was transported to a great palace. He then was greeted by three fairy women (implied to be the swans).Gottschalck, Friedrich. Die Sagen und Volksm\u00e4hrchen der Deutschen 1 [mehr nicht erschienen]. Halle 1814. pp. 201-211. In a Danish tale (Jomfru Lene af S\u00f8ndervand), three sons, Poul, Peder and Esben stand guard in their father's field to discover who has been dancing and trampling the crop in the past nights. The two elder brothers fail, but Esben Askefis finds out it was a group of swan-princesses. Esben fetches the thin, web-like veils of the maidens.Grundtvig, Svend. Danske Folke\u00e6ventyr, Fundne I Folkemunde Og Gjenfortalte. Ny samling. Kj\u00f8benhavn: C.A. Reitzel, 1878. pp. 19-34. The tale was translated as The Lass of S\u00f6ndervand, in Danish Fairy Tales, and the characters were renamed as Peter, Paul, Esbeen Ashfiest and Lena. Lena and her sisters were princesses, cursed by a witch, and used to live in castle where the field is now located.Grundtvig, Svend;and Gustav Hein. Danish Fairy Tales. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell company. 1914. pp. 27-41. A second translation of the Danish tale named it Maid Lena.Wiggin, Kate Douglas Smith; Smith, Nora Archibald. Magic Casements: a second fairy book.

In a Swedish fairy tale, The Swan-Maiden, the king announces a great hunting contest. A young hunter sights a swan swimming in a lake and aims at it, but the swan pleads not to shoot it. The swan transforms into a maiden and explains she is enchanted into that form, but the hunter may help her to break the spell.Fifty-two fairy tales: wonder stories, legends, visions and fables: from German, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, Oriental, classical, ancient and modern sources. Edited by Alfred H. Miles. London: Hutchinson & Co. [1892] pp. 109-115. ====Literary fairy tales (K\u00fcnstm\u00e4rchen) and other works==== The Swan maiden story is believed to have been the basis for the ballet Swan Lake, in which a young princess, Odette and her maidens are under the spell of an evil sorcerer, Von Rothbart, transforming them into swans by day. By night, they regain their human forms and can only be rescued if a young man swears eternal love and faithfulness to the Princess. When Prince Siegfried swears his love for Odette, the spell can be broken, but Siegfried is tricked into declaring his love for Von Rothbart's daughter, Odile, disguised by magic as Odette, and all seems lost. But the spell is finally broken when Siegfried and Odette drown themselves in a lake of tears, uniting them in death for all eternity. While the ballet's revival of 1895 depicted the swan-maidens as mortal women cursed to turn into swans, the original libretto of 1877 depicted them as true swan-maidens: fairies who could transform into swans at will.Wiley 1991, p. 321 Several animated movies based on the ballet, including The Swan Princess and Barbie of Swan Lake depict the lead heroines as being under a spell and both are eventually rescued by their Princes. The Swan Princess rides upon the waves of Buyan. Illustration by Boris Zvorykin. The magical swan also appears in Russian poem The Tale of Tsar Saltan (1831), by Alexander Pushkin. The son of the titular Tsar Saltan, Prince Gvidon and his mother are cast in the sea in a barrel and wash ashore in a mystical island. There, the princeling grows up in days and becomes a fine hunter. Prince Gvidon and his mother begin to settle in the island thanks to the help of a magical swan called Princess Swan, and in the end of the tale she transforms into a princess and marries Prince Gvidon. A variant of the swan maiden narrative is present in the work of Johann Karl August Mus\u00e4us,Mus\u00e4us, Johann Karl August. Contes De Musaeus. Tome I. Paris: Moutardier. 1826. p. xiii.Mus\u00e4us, Johann Karl August. Contes De Musaeus. Tome V. Paris: Moutardier. 1826. pp. 127-216. a predecessor to the Brothers Grimm's endeavor in the early 1800s. His Volksm\u00e4rchen der Deutschen contains the story of Der geraubte Schleier (\"The Stolen Veil\"). Museaus tale was translated into English as The Stealing of the Veil, or Tale \u00c0 La Montgolfier (1791)Popular Tales of the Germans: Translated from the German. In Two Volumes. Vol. I. London: John Murray. 1791. pp. 162-264. and into French as Voile envol\u00e9, in Contes de Muse\u00e4us (1826). containing \"La Chronique des trois Soeurs\", \"Richilde\", \"Les \u00c9cuyers de Roland\", \"Libussa\", \"La Nymphe de la Fontaine\", \"Le Tr\u00e9sor du Hartz\", \"L\u00e9gendes de Rubezahl\", \"La Veuve\", \"L'Enl\u00e8vement (Anecdote)\", \"La Poule aux OEfs d'or\", \"L'Amour muet\", \"Le D\u00e9mon-Amour\", \"M\u00e9lechsala\" and \"Le Voile enlev\u00e9\". In a short summary: an old hermit, who lives near a lake of pristine water, rescues a young Swabian soldier; during a calm evening, the hermit reminisces about an episode of his adventurous youth when he met in Greece a swan-maiden, descended from Leda and Zeus themselves - in the setting of the story, the Greco-Roman deities were \"genies\" and \"fairies\". The hermit explains the secret of their magical garment and how to trap one of the ladies. History repeats itself as the young soldier sets his sights on a trio of swan maidens who descend from heavens to bathe in the lake. John Bauer (1908) for Helena Nyblom's tale Svanhammen. Swedish writer Helena Nyblom explored the theme of a swan maiden who loses her feathery cloak in Svanhammen (The Swan Suit), published in 1908, in Bland tomtar och troll (Among Gnomes and Trolls), an annual anthology of literary fairy tales and stories. In a literary work by Adrienne Roucolle, The Kingdom of the Good Fairies, in the chapter The Enchanted Swan, princess Lilian is turned into a swan by evil Fairy Hemlock.Roucolle, Adrienne. The Kingdom of the Good Fairies: Fairy Tales. Cincinnati: The Editor Publishing Company. 1898. pp. 101-120. ===Male versions=== The fairytale The Six Swans could be considered a male version of the swan maiden, where the swan skin isn't stolen but a curse, similar to The Swan Princess. An evil step-mother cursed her 6 stepsons with swan skin shirts that transform them into swans, which can only be cured by six nettle shirts made by their younger sister. Similar tales of a parent or a step-parent cursing their (step)children are the Irish legend of The Children of Lir, and The Wild Swans, a literary fairy tale by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen. An inversion of the story (humans turning into swans) can be found in the Dolopathos: a hunter sights a (magical) maiden bathing in a lake and, after a few years, she gives birth to septuplets (six boys and a girl), born with gold chains around their necks. After being expelled by their grandmother, the children bathe in a lake in their swan forms, and return to human form thanks to their magical chains. Another story of a male swan is Prince Swan (Prinz Schwan), an obscure tale collected by the Brothers Grimm in the very first edition of their Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen (1812), but removed from subsequent editions. Czech author Bo\u017eena N\u011bmcov\u00e1 included in the first volume of her collection National Tales and Legends, published in 1845, a tale she titled The Swan (O Labuti), about a prince who's turned into a swan by a witch because his evil stepmother wanted to get rid of him. N\u011bmcov\u00e1, Bo\u017eena. N\u00e1rodn\u00ed B\u00e1chorky a Pow\u011bsti Prague: Jaroslav Posp\u00ed\u0161il 1845 Vol. 1 Tale n\u00ba 4 Brazilian tale Os tr\u00eas cisnes (\"The Three Swans\"), collected by Lindolfo Gomes, tells the story of a princess who marries an enchanted prince. After his wife breaks a taboo (he could never see himself in a mirror), he turns into a swan, which prompts his wife on a quest for his whereabouts, with the help of an old woodcutter.Gomes, Lindolfo. Contos Populares Brasileiros. Brasil, S\u00e3o Paulo: Edi\u00e7\u00f5es Melhoramentos. 1953 [1931]. pp. 149-154 (in Portuguese). ==Folklore motif and tale types== Established folkloristics does not formally recognize \"Swan Maidens\" as a single Aarne- Thompson tale type. Rather, one must speak of tales that exhibit Stith Thompson motif index \"D361.1 Swan Maiden\", which may be classed AT 400, 313, or 465A. Compounded by the fact that these tale types have \"no fewer than ten other motifs\" assigned to them, the AT system becomes a cumbersome tool for keeping track of parallels for this motif. Seeking an alternate scheme, one investigator has developed a system of five Swan Maiden paradigms, four of them groupable as a Grimm tale cognate (KHM 193, 92, 93, and 113) and the remainder classed as the \"AT 400\" paradigm. Thus for a comprehensive list of the most starkly-resembling cognates of Swan Maiden tales, one need only consult Bolte and Pol\u00edvka's Anmerkungen to Grimm's Tale KHM 193 the most important paradigm of the group. Each of them using different methods, i.e. observation of the distribution area of the Swan Maiden type or use of phylogenetic methods to reconstruct the evolution of the tale, Gudmund Hatt, Yuri Berezkin and Julien d'Huy independently showed that this folktale would have appeared during the Paleolithic period, in the Pacific Asia, before spreading in two successive waves in America. In addition, Yuri Berezkin and Julien d'Huy showed that there was no mention of migratory birds in the early versions of this tale (this motif seems to appear very late).Gudmund Hatt (1949). Asiatic influences in American folklore. K\u00f8benhavn: I kommission hos ejnar Munksgaard, p.94-96, 107; Yuri Berezkin (2010). Sky-maiden and world mythology. Iris, 31, pp. 27-39Julien d'Huy (2016).

Mythologie fran\u00e7aise, 265, pp. 4-11 or here. ==Animal wife motif== ===Antiquity and origin=== It has been suggested the romance of apsara Urvasi and king Pururavas, of ancient Sanskrit literature, may be one of the oldest forms (or origin) of the Swan-Maiden tale.Smith, S. Percy. \"Aryan and Polynesian Points of Contact. The Story of Te Niniko,\" in The Journal of the Polynsian Society. Vol. XIX, no. 2. 1910. pp. 84-88.Tuzin, Donald F. The Cassowary's Revenge: The life and death of masculinity in a New Guinea society. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. 1997. pp. 71-72. The antiquity of the swan-maiden tale was suggested in the 19th century by Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould, postulating an origin of the motif before the separation of the Proto-Indo-European language, and, due to the presence of the tale in diverse and distant traditions (such as Samoyedic and Native Americans), there was a possibility that the tale may be even older.Baring-Gould, Sabine. The book of were-wolves: Being an Account of a Terrible Superstition. London: Smith, Elder and Co. 1865. pp. 178-177. Another theory was supported by Charles Henry Tawney, in his translation of Somadeva's Kathasaritsagara: he suggests the source of the motif to be old Sanskrit literature; the tale then migrated to Middle East, and from there as an intermediate point, spread to Europe.Tawney, Charles Henry. The ocean of story, being C.H. Tawney's translation of Somadeva's Katha sarit sagara (or Ocean of streams of story). Book 8. London, Priv. print. for subscribers only by C.J. Sawyer. 1924-1928. Appendix I. p. 234. According to Julien d'Huy, such a motif would also have existed in European prehistory and would have a buffalo maiden as a heroine. Indeed, this author finds the motif with four- legged animals in North America and Europe, in an area coinciding with the area of haplogroup X.Julien d'Huy (2011). \u00ab Le motif de la femme-bison. Essai d'interpr\u00e9tation d'un mythe pr\u00e9historique (1\u00e8re partie) \u00bb, Mythologie fran\u00e7aise, 242, pp. 44-55; et Julien d'Huy (2011). \u00ab Le motif de la femme- bison.

The swan maiden also serves as ancestress for peoples and tribes of Siberia and Central Asia, as attested in ethnogenetic myths of the Buryat people.*Curtin, Jeremiah. A Journey in Southern Siberia: The Mongols, Their Religion and Their Myths.Boston: Little, Brown and Company. 1909. pp. 98-99. Professor Hazel Wigglesworth, who worked with the many languages of the Philippines archipelago, stated that the character of the mortal male is sometimes named Itung or Beletamey, and he represents a cultural hero or ancestor of the Manobo people.Wrigglesworth, Hazel J (1980). \"Rhetorical devices distinguishing the genre of folktale (fiction) from that of oral history (fact) in Ilianen Manobo narrative discourse\". In: Philippine Journal of Linguistics 11 (1). pp. 45-79. ===Distribution and variants=== The motif of the wife of supernatural origin (in most cases, a swan maiden) shows universal appeal, being present in the oral and folkloric traditions of every continent.Frobenius, Leo.

In East Asia, it is also known featuring maidens who transform into various bird species. In Russian fairy-tales there are also several characters, connected with the Swan-maiden, as in The Sea King and Vasilisa the Wise, where the maiden is a dove. In the Japanese legend of Hagoromo, it is a heavenly spirit, or Tennin, whose robe is stolen.Iwao Seiichi, Sakamato Tar\u014d, H\u014dgetsu Keigo, Yoshikawa Itsuji, Akiyama Terukazu, Iyanaga Teiz\u014d, Iyanaga Sh\u014dkichi, Matsubara Hideichi, Kanazawa Shizue. 18.

Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. 1921. pp. 385-387. A tale from Northeastern Asia, collected among the Chukchi people, also attests the motif of the bird-wife. Russian professor Valdemar Bogoras collected a tale from a Yukaghir woman in Kolyma, in which three Tungus sisters change into \"female geese\" in order to pick berries. On one occasion, the character of \"One-Side\" hides the skin of the youngest, who cannot return to goose form. She eventually consents to marry \"One-Side\".Bogoraz, Valdim\u00efr Germanovich.

In a second Tewa story (a retelling, in fact), the son of the cacique wishes to travel to the Land of Parrots to obtain a parrot. His mission is successful and he returns home with a \"Parrot Girl\" that helps him on the homeward journey. When he arrives at his parents house, the Parrot Girl becomes a beautiful human girl and marries him.James, Ahlee. Tewa Firelight Tales. New York [etc.]: Longmans, Green and co., 1927. pp. 138-149.

In one occasion, seven males steal the crab disguises of the seven crab maidens and marry them.Dixon, Roland B. The Mythology Of All Races. Vol. IX - Oceanic. Boston, MA: Marshall Jones Company. 1916. pp. 206. A second one is close to the Swan maiden narrative, only with parakeets instead of swans; the hero is called Magoenggoelota and the maiden Kapapitoe.Dixon, Roland B. The Mythology Of All Races. Vol. IX - Oceanic. Boston, MA: Marshall Jones Company. 1916. pp. 206-207. ===In mythology=== One notably similar Japanese story, \"The crane wife\" (Tsuru Nyobo), is about a man who marries a woman who is in fact a crane (Tsuru no Ongaeshi) disguised as a human. To make money the crane-woman plucks her own feathers to weave silk brocade which the man sells, but she became increasingly ill as she does so. When the man discovers his wife's true identity and the nature of her illness, she leaves him. There are also a number of Japanese stories about men who married kitsune, or fox spirits in human form (as women in these cases), though in these tales the wife's true identity is a secret even from her husband. She stays willingly until her husband discovers the truth, at which point she must abandon him.For reference of the animal or mystical bride in Japanese tales, see The motif of the swan maiden or swan wife also appears in Southeast Asia, with the tales of Kinnari or Kinnaree (of Thailand) and the love story of Manohara and Prince Sudhana.Schiefner, Anton; Ralston, William Shedden.

Cambridge, Mass.: and New York, American folk-lore society, 1923. pp. 142-160. ====Oceania==== There have been collected at least thirty-three variants from Papua New Guinea, published in local newspaper Wantok Niuspepa, in a section about traditional tales.Mitchell, Roger E. \"[Review:] Slone, Thomas H., translator, editor. One Thousand One Papua New Guinean Nights: Folktales from Wantok Newspaper\". In: Asian Folklore Studies 63, no. 1 (2004): 154-156. Gale Literature Resource Center (accessed August 3, 2020). Sometimes the swan garment is replaced by a cassowary skin or a bird-of-paradise.Slone, Thomas H. (translator, editor). One Thousand One Papua New Guinean Nights: Folktales from Wantok Newspaper.

For instance, the tale of The Cassowary Wife was stated by anthropologist Margaret Mead to be the local version of the Swan maiden.Mead, Margaret. The Mountain Arapesh. New Brunswick, New Jersey: Transaction Publishers. 2002 [1938]. pp. 264-265. The character of the swan maiden (and her variants) is spread among the many traditions of Oceania, such as in Micronesia.Winduo, Steven Edmund. \"Reconstituting Indigenous Oceanic Folktales\". In: University of Hawaii Manoa International Symposium; Folktales and Fairy Tales: Translation, Colonialism, and Cinema. Honolulu, Sep. 2010. Address. http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/handle/10125/16460 ====America==== In a tale of the Cochiti people, a coyote (possibly the Coyote of legend) helps a youth in getting a wife: one of three pigeon girls who bathe in a lake.Benedict, Ruth. Tales of the Cochiti Indians. Washington: U.S. Govt. Print. Off.. 1931. pp. 170-176. In a variant, the coyote leads the youth to three dove maidens.Benedict, Ruth. Tales of the Cochiti Indians. Washington: U.S. Govt. Print. Off.. 1931. p. 246. In a tale of the Musquakie people, some male youths bathe and play in the water while some beautiful girls approach them. One of the male youths gets one of the girls and the others, frightened, turn into black-headed ducks and fly away.Owen, Mary Alicia. Folk-Lore of the Musquakie Indians of North America and Catalogue of Musquakie Beadwork and other Objects in the Collection of the Folk-Lore Society. London: David Nutt. 1904. pp. 90-91. In a tale collected by Silvio Romero in Rio de Janeiro (Cova da Linda Fl\u00f4r), a king gambles with another monarch. He loses everything and consults with a hermit on how to proceed. The hermit advises to kill a special kind of bird from which a piece of paper will drop with instructions: three princesses, daughters of the monarch, in the form of ducks bathe in a lake, and the king should take the duck skin of the youngest (whose name is Cova da Linda Fl\u00f4r).Romero, S\u00edlvio. Contos populares do Brazil. Livraria de Francisco Alves e Cia. 1907. pp. 146-154. In a Mexican tale, Blanca Flor (\"White Flower\"), youth Juan loves to gamble and wins the devil's favor to grant him unbeatable luck for the period of five years. When the date is due, the youth must find the devil \"in the Plains of Berl\u00edn at the Hacienda of Qui-quiri- qui\". He goes on a pilgrimage and asks three hermits (the king of fishes, the king of animals of the earth and the king of birds of the air) its location. The eagle, answering its sire's question, knows where it is. The eagle carries Juan to the Plains of Berl\u00edn and informes that three doves, the devil's three daughters, will come to bathe.Dobie, James Frank. Puro Mexicano. Austin: Texas folk-lore society, 1935. pp. 61-66. In a tale from Guyana, The man with a vulture wife, a young hunter comes across a large house where people were playing sports and dancing to music. In reality, they were vultures that shed their skins to decorate the place. The youth becomes entranced by one of the maidens and captures her. Their marriage is not a happy one, and the tale ends on a darker note.Roth, Walter E. The Animism and Folklore of the Guiana Indians. The Caribbean Press. 2011 [1915]. pp. 164-167. ===Non-swan maidens=== Despite the near universality of the tale of the swan maiden (or maiden who transforms into any other kind of bird), there are tales where the human male still holds the maiden's garments, but the narrative does not mention whether she transforms or not. In a tale titled The Iron Eagle, a young hunter reaches the sandy shores on the edge of a forest. He then sees three maidens arriving in a flash of light to take a bath \"in the golden sunrise\". The hunter steals their clothing, unaware that one of the maidens is \"The Daughter of the Sun\". In exchange for her garment back, she will grant one out of four wishes.

[1900] pp. 181-187. ====Western Europe==== The tale of the swan maiden is believed to be attested in Lady Featherflight, a tale obtained from an English storyteller (an old aunt).* Lady Featherflight helps the hero against her giant father and both escape (ATU 313 The Magical Flight). Emmanuel Cosquin collected a French tale titled Chatte Blanche (English: \"White Cat\"), where the hero Jean is informed that \"Plume Verte\", \"Plume Jaune\" and \"Plume Noir\" come to bathe in the lake in the Black Forest, and is tasked with getting the robes of \"Plume Verte\".Cosquin, Emmanuel. \"Contes populaires lorrains recueillis dans un village du Barrois \u00e0 Montiers-sur-Saulx (Meuse) (Suite)\".

The Oak-tree Fairy Book: Favorite Fairy Tales. Boston: Little, Brown, and Company. 1905. pp. 63-82. W. W. Newell commented that in the French counterpart of the story, La Plume Verte (English: \"The Green Feather\"), the name is an indication of her status as bird-maiden. However, it has been noted that, as it happened in both versions, the swan maiden's feathery cloak was replaced by the garment, yet a reminiscence of it is retained in their names. A similar occurrence appear in a fairy tale from Brittany, La Demoiselle en Blanc (\"The Lady in White\"), collected by Paul S\u00e9billot: the young man sees three human maidens bathing, and nearby there are three dresses, a white one, a gray one and a blue one.S\u00e9billot, Paul. Contes populaires de la Haute-Bretagne. Premier s\u00e9rie. Paris: G. Charpentier. 1880. pp. 197-205. It has been noted that the tale contains a nearly identical episode of the maidens bathing, instead of the bird-maidens.MacInnes, Donald, and Alfred Tr\u00fcbner Nutt. Folk And Hero Tales. Waifs and Strays of Celtic Tradition. Argyllshire Series - Vol. II. London: Publications of the Folk-lore society. 1890. p. 437. In Irish tale Yellow Lily, the son of the king of Erin gambles his head against the cruel Giant of Loch Lein, and must travel to the giant's castle after losing the bet.

Selected and edited by Laure Claire Foucher. New York: Moffat, Yard and Company. 1917. pp. 123-159. ====Southern Europe==== In a Galician tale, Brancafrol, a gambling youth bets and loses his soul, and receives a deadline to surrender his soul to the winner. After giving alms to an old lady, she informs him of three magical maidens bathing in the sea: two Moorish women, and a Christian woman, who have set their dresses on the shore (the Moorish women's green ones and the Christian woman's white one).Carre Alvarelllos, Lois. Contos Populares da Galiza. Porto: Museu de Etnografia de Porto. 1968. pp. 43-49. Francisco Maspons y Labr\u00f3s collected a Catalan variant titled Lo castell del Sol (\"The Castle of the Sun\"), where a young count bets and loses his wealthy and must find his way to \"The Castle of the Sun\". Not knowing of its location, he is helped by an old lady and her sons, who tell of a lake where three maidens come to bathe. When escaping from her family, the count calls his wife \"Rosa florida\".Maspons y Labr\u00f3s, Francisco. Lo Rondallayre: Cuentos Populars Catalans. Barcelona: Llibreria de Don Alvar Verdaguer. 1871. pp. 45-50. ====Central Europe==== In an Austrian (Tirol) tale collected by Joseph and Ignaz Zingerle, Der gl\u00e4serne Berg (\"The Glass Mountain\"), a forester's son, while hiding in the bushes, sees three maidens bathing, and fetches their cloaks. Later, the maidens arrive at his house and ask for their garments back. He returns to two of the maidens, retaining the youngest's and marrying her. The couple live quite happily until, one day, the husband forgets to lock the cabinet where he hid her cloak garment, and she finds it. The maiden writes him a note that, if he loves her, he should seek her in \"The Glass Mountain\".Zingerle, Ignaz Vinc. und Josef. Kinder- und Hausm\u00e4rchen aus Tirol. Innsbruck: Schwick, 1911. pp. 205-215. ====Eastern Europe==== In a Polish tale by A. J. Glinski, The Princess of The Brazen Mountain, \"Von der Peitsche, die jeden Auftrag erf\u00fcllt, von den Stiefeln, die allein springe, von der Zauberm\u00fctze und vom Kupferberg\".

On their wedding day, she is given back the wings and flies back to the Brazen Mountain.Polish Fairy Tales. Translated from A. J. Glinski by Maude Ashurst Biggs. New York: John Lane Company. 1920. pp. 69-78. In a tale collected by Francis Hindes Groome (The Witch) from a Polish-Gypsy source, the prince dreams of a place where lovely maidens were bathing. He decides to travel the world to find this place. He does so and hides the wings of the youngest maiden. After his wife escapes, he follows her to her family's home, and must work for her sorcerous mother.Groome, Francis Hindes. Gypsy folk-tales. London: Hurst and Blackett. 1899. pp. 188-197 In Russian folktale Yelena The Wise, the titular princess and her maid, both possessing wings, were made prisoners by a six-headed serpent, until they were accidentally released by Ivan, the soldier. Ivan informs the six-headed serpent of her escape and the monster says the princess is cunning. Hot on her trail, he uses a flying carpet to reach a beautiful garden with a pond. Soon after, Yelena and her maid arrive and take off their wings to bathe.Curtin, Jeremiah. Myths and Folk-tales of the Russians, Western Slavs, and Magyars. Boston: Little, Brown, and Company. 1890. pp. 218-227. In a Wallachian tale collected by Arthur and Albert Schott, Der versto\u00dfene Sohn, a youth shoots a raven, which falls in the snow. The striking image makes the boy long for a bride \"of white skin, red cheeks and hair black as a raven's feathers\". An old man tells him of such beauty: three \"Waldjungfrauen\" (\"forest-maidens\") will come to bathe in the lake, and he must secure the crown of one of them. He fails twice, but succeeds in his third attempt. The youth and the forest maiden live together for many years, she bears him two sons, but, during a village celebration, she asks for her crown back. When she puts on her head, she begins to ascend in flight with their two children and asks her husband to come find them.Schott, Arthur; Schott, Albert. Walachische M\u00e4rchen.

Their source was a \" herrn Draguesku\", a Wallachian from Orawitza (p. 82). ====Greece==== In a Greek fairy tale from Epiros, first collected by Johann Georg von Hahn (Von dem Prinzen und der Schwanenjungfrau)Hahn, Johann Georg von. Griechische und Albanesische M\u00e4rchen 1-2. M\u00fcnchen/Berlin: Georg M\u00fcller, 1918 [1864]. pp. 79-91. and translated by Reverend Edmund Martin Geldart (The Prince and the Fairy), a king's son opens a trapdoor in the mountain and arrives at another realm. He sees a palace in the distance, where an old man is trapped. He releases the old man who gives him the keys to the apartments. Behind a closed door, three fairies come to bathe in \"a hollow place filled with water\".Geldart, Edmund Martin. Folk-lore of modern Greece: the tales of the people. London: W. Swan Sonnenschein & Co.. 1884. pp. 88-91. Von Hahn also collected similar stories from Ioannina and Zagori, and called the swan maiden-like character \"Elfin\".Hahn, Johann Georg von. Griechische und Albanesische M\u00e4rchen 1-2. M\u00fcnchen/Berlin: Georg M\u00fcller. 1918 [1864]. pp. 336-337. ====Armenia==== In an Armenian folktale (\"Kush-Pari\"), a prince seeks the titular Kush-Pari, a Houri-Pari or \"Fairy-Bird\" (\"a nymph of paradise in the shape of a bird\", \"a golden human-headed bird ... radiant as the sun\"), as a present to the king he serves. After being captured, the Kush-Pari reveals to the king she transforms into a maiden after undonning her feather cloak and proposes she becomes his queen after his servant rescues her maid and brings back the fiery mares. Kush-Pari intends to use the fiery mares' milk for a special ritual: the king dies, but the prince survives, who she marries. At the end of the story, her new husband tells his wife that his father is blinded, but she reveals she was the cause for his blindness.Downing, Charles. Armenian Folk-tales and Fables. London: Oxford University Press. 1972. pp. 28-39. ====Asia==== In a tale collected from a Dagur source, in China, a man tells his three sons of a dream he had: a white horse that appeared, circled the sun and vanished into the sea. His sons decide to find this horse. The youngest succeeds in capturing the horse, but it says it will feel lonely away from its home, so the horse decides to bring one of his sisters with him. The youth and the horse await at the beach for the arrival of ten fairies, who take off their clothes to play in the sea. Soon enough, the youth seizes the clothing of the youngest.\"Three Brothers\". In: Kevin Stuart, Xuewei Li, Shelear. China's Dagur Minority: Society, Shamanism, & Folklore.

He soon notices the \"dove-skin\" of the maiden and hides it. They marry and raise a family with several children. One day, one of their children finds their mother's magical garment and delivers it to her.Certeux, A. and Carnoy, Henry. L'Alg\u00e9rie traditionnelle. Tome I. Paris: Maisonneuve et Leclerc. 1884. pp. 87-89. ====America==== In a tale collected from the Sahaptin, a boy becomes poor. Later, he plays cards with a Black storekeeper. The boy wins the Black man's store and livestock. He then bets himself: if he loses, he becomes the boy's servant. The Black man wins back the store and the livestock, and the boy as his servant, but the Black man dismisses him and tells the by to go to a place across the river. An old woman stops him from crossing the river and tries to help the boy by \"ask[ing] different things\": the dishes, the spoons, the cat, the rooster and the geese. The woman translates what the geese informed: the boy must seek some bathing maidens and he must secure the \"blue-green garters\" of the last bathing girl.Jacobs, Melville. Northwest Sahaptin Texts. Vol. I. New York: Columbia University press, 1934. pp. 263-268. In a Jamaican tale, Jack and the Devil Errant, protagonist Jack loses a bet against the titular Devil Errant and is ordered to find him in three months. An old man helps him by informing that the Devil Errant's three daughters will come to bathe in a lake, but he should only steal the clothing of the youngest.Beckwith, Martha Warren; Roberts, Helen Heffron. Jamaica Anansi stories. New York: American Folk-Lore Society. 1924. pp. 135-139. In another Jamaican tale, with a heavy etiological bent and possibly starring legendary trickster hero Anansi, the protagonist, a young man, wins against a \"headman\" (an African king) and the youth's nurse warns him that the king mey be planning some trap. The nurse, then, advises the youth that he should take \"the river-road\" and reach a stream where the king's youngest daughter will be bathing. He steals the clothing twice: the first time, the youth lies that a thief was nearby; the second time, that a gust of wind blew them away.Lewis, Matthew Gregory. Journal of a West-India Proprietor: Kept During a Residence in the Island of Jamaica. London: John Murray. 1834. pp. 301-307. ==The celestial maiden or heavenly bride== A second format of the supernatural wife motif pertains to tales where the maiden isn't a shapeshifting animal, but instead a creature or inhabitant of Heaven, a Celestial Realm, or hails from the place where the gods live. Japanese folklorist Seki Keigo names this story \"The Wife from the Upper World\", in his index of \"Types of Japanese Folktales\". Professor Alan L. Miller calls it \"The Divine Wife\", which can also refer to the Swan Maiden tales.* Western works commonly translate the characters in question as \"fairies\" or \"nymphs\". ===India and South Asia=== The motif of the swan maiden is also associated with the Apsaras, of Hinduism, who descend from Heaven or a Celestial Realm to bathe in an earthly lake.Tuttle, Hudson; Tuttle, Emma Rood. Stories From Beyond the Borderlands. Berlin Heights, Ohio: The Tuttle Publishing Company. 1910. pp. 175-176.Cox, Marian Roalfe. An introduction to Folk-Lore.

A folk song collected from the state of Chhattisgarh, The Ballad of flower-maid Bakaoli, contains the episode where a male (Lakhiya) is informed by a sadhu about the seven daughters of Indra Raj\u00e1 (one of which is Bakaoli) who bathe in a lake.Elwin, Verrier. Folk Songs Of Chhattisgarh. Oxford University Press. 1946. pp. 316-337. A tale of Dravidian origin tells the story of Prince Jagatalapratapa, who has an encounter with the daughter of Indra and her maids in a grove in forest.S. M. Natesa Sastri. The Dravidian Nights Entertainments: Being a Translation of Madanakamarajankadai. Madras: Excelsion Press. 1886. pp. 84-91, 106-107 and 115-119. A second story of The Dravidian Nights Entertainment, by Natesa Sastri, shows the episode of the prince stealing clothes from a celestial maiden, as part of the prince's search for a special flower.S. M. Natesa Sastri. The Dravidian Nights Entertainments: Being a Translation of Madanakamarajankadai. Madras: Excelsion Press. 1886. pp. 146-151. A story obtained from Santal sources (Toria the Goatherd and the Daughter of the Sun) tells of goatheard Toria, who is invited by the maidens to join them in their leisure in water. While they are distracted, Toria hides the clothing of one of them.Arch\u00e6ological Survey of India., Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland. Indian antiquary. Vol. 4. 1875. Bombay: Popular Prakashan. pp. 10-12. In a Bengali tale, from Dinajpur (The Finding of the Dream), prince Siva Das receives a premonitory dream about a maiden.

In a tale from the Karbi people, Harata Kunwar, the youngest of seven brothers, flees for his life from home, after his brothers and father threaten to take his life, and takes refuge with an old lady. After doing his chores, he plans to take a bath in the river, but was told not to go upstream. He does so and sees the six daughters of the King of the Great Palace descending fom the heavens and undressing their clothings to bathe and frolic in the water.Stack, Edward; Lyall, Charles James, Sir. The Mikirs; from the papers of the late Edward Stack. London, D. Nutt. 1908. pp. 55-70. In an Indian tale of unknown source, The Perfumer's Daughter, the prince's wife asks for her ring and flies off to unknown parts. Burdened with grief, the prince wanders the world until he finds an old ascetic master. The ascetic tells the prince that, on the full moon night, his wife and her handmaidens will descend from the heavens to bathe in the lake, and the youth must acquire his wife's shawl.Thornhill, Mark. Indian fairy tales. London: Hatchards. [1888] pp. 15-66. The Indian folktale collection Kathasaritsagara contains at least two similar tales involving Apsaras: the tale of Marubh\u00fati who, instructed by a hermit, steals the clothing of one of some heavenly nymphs who came to bathe in the river, and the hermit becomes the mortal husband of the Vidyadhara.Tawney, C. H. The Katha Sarit Sagara. Vol. 2. 1880. pp. 452-453. In a second story, deity Bhairava commands Thinth\u00e1kar\u00e1la to steal the garments of the Apsaras that were bathing in \"the holy pool of Mah\u00e1k\u00e1la\". After the deed is done, the Apsaras protest and beg for their garments to be returned, but the youth sets a condition: he will return them in exchange for the youngest Apsara, Kal\u00e1vat\u00ed, daughter of Alambush\u00e1, to become his wife.Tawney, C. H. The Katha Sarit Sagara. Vol. 2. 1880. pp. 576-577. In another Indian tale, The Wood-seller and the Seven Fairies, the wood-seller takes a moment to rest in the forest, and soon sees seven fairies bathing a well. He soon steals their garments and asks for their help in order to impress a visiting queen he wishes to marry.Venkataswami M. N. Heeramma And Venkataswami Or Folktales From India.

In Bengkulu, in the island of Sumatra, the legend of Malin Deman is quite close to the motif of the \"Celestial Wife\": hero Malin Deman steals the wings and the clothes of the youngest of \"Seven Angels\" who have come to the terrestrial plane to bathe. They soon marry and have a child, but, year later, returns to her celestial realm.Kartomi, Margaret. \"The Minangkabau South Coast: Home of the Mermaid and the Earth Goddess.\" In: Musical Journeys in Sumatra.

Other tales are attested in the many traditions of the archipelago:Danandjaja, James. \"A Comparative Study of Japanese and Indonesian Folklores\". In: Southeast Asian Studies, Vol. 33, No.3, December 1995. p. 211. from the Island of Halmahera, the episode of \"stealing maiden's clothing while in a bath\" occurs as part of the quest of the youngest of seven brothers for a remedy for his father;Dixon, Roland B. The Mythology Of All Races. Vol. IX - Oceanic.

Indian Influences On The Literature Of Java And Bali. Calcutta: Calcutta Oriental Press. 1934. pp. 342-343. ===East Asia=== East Asian folkloric traditions also attest the occurrence of similar tales about celestial maidens, such as the Korean folktale of The Fairy and the Woodcutter.Chang, Duk-soon. The Folk Treasury of Korea: Sources in Myth, Legend and Folktale. Ed. Republic of Korea: Society of Korean Oral Literature. 1970. pp. 167-173.American Myths, Legends, and Tall Tales: An Encyclopedia of American Folklore. Vol. 3: Q-Z.Fee, Christopher R. and Webb, Jeffrey B. (eds.). Santa Barbara, California; Denver, Colorado: ABC-CLIO. 2016. pp. 1063-1064. A tale from Lew Chew sources tells of a farmer, Ming-Ling-Tzu, who owns a pristine fountain of the purest water, when he sights a maiden fair bathing in the water source and possibly soiling it.Dennys, Nicholas Belfield. Folk-lore of China, and its affinities with that of the Aryan Semitic races. London: Tr\u00fcbner. 1876. pp. 140-141. ====China==== Another related tale is the Chinese myth of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl,Nai-tung TING. A Type Index of Chinese Folktales in the Oral Tradition and Major Works of Non-religious Classical Literature. (FF Communications, no. 223) Helsinki, Academia Scientiarum Fennica, 1978.Haase, Donald. The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairy Tales: A-F. Greenwood Publishing Group. 2007. p. 198. in which one of seven fairy sisters is taken as a wife by a cowherd who hid the seven sisters' robes; she becomes his wife because he sees her naked, and not so much due to his taking her robe. Chinese literature and mythology attest at least two similar stories: Tian Xian Pei (\"The Fairy Couple\"; \"The Marriage of the Fairy Princess\" or \"Dong Yong, the Filial Son\"), and a untitled version in Soushen Ji, as the fifteenth tale in Volume 14.Gan Bao. In Search of the Supernatural: The Written Record. Translated into English by Kenneth J. DeWoskin and James Irving Crump. Stanford University Press, 1996. Hsieh, Daniel. Love and Women in Early Chinese Fiction. The Chinese University Press. 2008. pp. 123-136. ====Japan==== James Danandjaja relates the Japanese tale of Amafuri Otome (\"The Woman who came from the Sky\"), as a similar tale of the unmarried mortal man who withholds the kimono from a bathing lady in exchange for her becoming his wife. He also compares it to the Swan Maiden and to the myth of The Cowherd and the Weaver.Danandjaja, James. \"A Comparative Study of Japanese and Indonesian Folklores\". In: Southeast Asian Studies, Vol. 33, No.3, December 1995. pp. 210-211. Professor Hazel Wigglesworth wrote that there were 46 versions of the tale collected in Japanese oral sources, and the oldest register of the tale is present in the Fudoki, an ancient book on provincial and oral accounts. Tales collected from \u014cmi Province (Ika no Woumi) and Suruga Province (Miho Matsubara) are close to the human husband/swan spouse narrative, whereas in a story from Tango Province (Taniha no Kori) it is an elderly couple who strand the celestial maiden on Earth and she becomes their adopted daughter to keep them company.Palmer, Edwina. \"'Slit belly swamp': a Japanese myth of the origin of the Pleiades?\" Asian Ethnology 69, no. 2 (2010): 313-315. Gale Literature Resource Center (accessed July 26, 2020). ===Africa=== ====Southeast Africa==== The narrative of the Sky-Maiden was collected in song form from the Ndau people, titled Legend and Song of the Sky-Maiden: the daughter of a powerful chief who lived in the sky and her attendants go down to Earth to bathe, and it becomes a dare amongst the royal princes to see who can fetch her plume/feather - the symbol of her otherwordliness. The victor is a poor man who, as a subversion of the common narrative, gets to live with his sky-wife in her abode.Burlin, Natalie Curtis. Songs and tales from the dark continent, recorded from the singing and the sayings of C. Kamba Simango ... and Madikane Cele. New York; Boston: G. Schirmer. 1920. pp. 51-53. A version of the tale in narrative form was given as The Sky-People (Vasagole) by Frans Boas and C. Kamba Simango in the Journal of American Folk-Lore.Boas, Frans; Simango, C. Kamba. \"Tales and Proverbs of the Vandau of Portuguese South Africa\". In: Journal of American Folk-lore 35 (1922): 199-201. In Tshinyama's Heavenly Maidens, two winged maidens descend from the heavens to an earthly watering hole - an event witnessed by a mortal man.Aardema, Verna. Behind the back of the mountain; Black folktales from southern Africa. New York: Dial Press. 1973. pp. 19-25. ====Madagascar==== In a Malagasy tale, obtained from V\u00e0kin-Ankar\u00e3tra (The way in which Adrian\u00f2ro obtained a wife from Heaven), the hero Adrianoro is informed that three maidens bathe in a lake, and tries to set a snare (trap) for them by shapeshifting into fruits or seeds.Sibre Junior, Rev. James. \"On the Oratory, Songs, Legends, and Folk-tales of the Malagasy\". In: The Folk-Lore Journal. Vol. I. January-December 1883. London: Elliot Row. 1883. pp. 202-208. ===Europe=== ====Greece==== In a tale from Greece, a human goatherd named Demetros dances with ten fairies three nights, and in the third night, on a full moon, he dances with them and accidentally touches the handkerchief of Katena. Her companions abandon her to the mortal world and she becomes Demetros's wife, bearing him a daughter. For seven years, Demetros has hidden the handkerchief, until his wife Katena asks him for it. She takes the handkerchief and dances with it in a festival, taking the opportunity to return home and leave her mortal husband. Years later, their daughter follows her mother when she turns fifteen years old.\"III. The Fairy Wife\". In: Gianakoulis, Theodore P. and MacPherson, Georgia H. Fairy Tales of Modern Greece. new York City: E. P. Dutton & Co. [1930]. pp. 34-47. ====Bulgaria==== A Bulgarian folk song (The Samodiva married against her will) features a Samodiva: three girls, not related to each other, doff their magical garments to bathe, but are seen by a shepherd that takes their clothing. Each girl separately try to plead and convince the youth to return the clothing. He does so - but only to the first two; the third maiden he chose to wed after she revealed she was an only child. After the wedding, the village insists she dances for the amusement of everyone else, but the samodiva says she cannot dance without her garment. Once her husband delivers her the clothing, she flies away.Garnett, Lucy Mary Jane. The women of Turkey and their folk-lore: The Christian Women. London: David Nutt,. 1890. pp. 352-355. ====Eastern Europe==== In The Youth and the Vila, the youngest son, who is considered a fool by his two elder brothers, manages to pluck the golden hairs of a vila who has been eating the silver pears of his father's garden.Houghton, Louise Seymour. The Russian grandmother's wonder tales. New York: C. Scribner's sons. 1906. pp. 190-195. In a second tale, The Vila in the Golden Castle, a father asks his three sons to guard his flower garden at night, because swans have been eating the flowers (in reality, the vilas were).Houghton, Louise Seymour. The Russian grandmother's wonder tales. New York: C. Scribner's sons. 1906. pp. 196-202. ===North America=== In a Yuchi tale, A Hunter Who Captured a Woman from the Sky, collected in 1931, a man was hunting when he saw something descending from heavens carrying people with it, some pretty woman among them. He captured and married one of the women.Grantham, Bill. Creation Myths and Legends of the Creek Indians [electronic resource]. 2002. pp. 189-191. In a Creek tale from Alabama, The Celestial Skiff, recorded in 1929, a group of people descend from the sky in a canoe. At one time, a man manages to capture one woman of that group and has many children with her. Years later, the woman tries to climb onto the canoe to return to the sky.Grantham, Bill. Creation Myths and Legends of the Creek Indians [electronic resource]. 2002. pp. 191-193. ==The Star Wife or Star Women== A third occurrence of the supernatural spouse from above is the Star Women. Scholars see a possible relation of this character with the Swan Maiden legend.Lankford, George E. Reachable stars: patterns in the ethnoastronomy of eastern North America. The University of Alabama Press. 2007. pp. 196-200. ===Native American=== The motif of the Star Maiden can be found in Native American folklore and mythology,Lankford, George E. Reachable stars: patterns in the ethnoastronomy of eastern North America. The University of Alabama Press. 2007. pp. 182-196. as the character of the Star Wife: she usually descends from heaven in a basket along with her sisters to play in a prairie or to bathe in a lake, and a mortal male, entranced by her figure, plans to make her his own. It is later discovered that she is a maiden from the stars or a star herself who came down to Earth.\"The Celestial Sisters\". In: Schoolcraft, Henry Rowe; Mathews, Cornelius. The Indian fairy book: from the original legends. New York, Allen Brothers. 1869. pp. 7-15. \"The Celestial Sisters: a Shawnee tale\". In: Schoolcraft, Henry Rowe. Algic Researches: Comprising Inquiries Respecting the Mental Characteristics of the North American Indians. First Series. Indian Tales And Legends. New-York: Harper, 1839. pp. 67-73.\"The Star Maiden\". In: Manning-Sanders, Ruth. Red Indian Folk And Fairy Tales. New York: Roy Publishers, 1962 [1960?]. pp. 15-23. In a Sioux legend, the human hunter marries the Star Wife and fathers a son. Mother and child escape to the Star- realm, but begin to miss the human father. Her father suggests they bring him there to reunite the family, and they do so.Nixon-Roulet, Mary F. Indian Folk Tales. New York, Cincinnati, etc: American book company. [ca. 1911] pp. 21-27. In a third variation, an inversion occurs: the hunter is taken in a basket to the Star-country in order to live with his Star Wife. However, he begins to miss his human mother. So, with the aid of a pair of red swan's wings for him and his wife, they return to the human world.Kennedy, Howard Angus. The new world fairy book. London: Dent. 1904. pp. 174-186. In a tale attributed to the Wyandot people, seven Star Sisters (the Pleiades) descend to Earth in a basket. One day, a human hunter captures the youngest by her girdle while their sisters escape in the basket. The maiden promises to become the hunter's wife, but before that he must accompany her to the sky (\"the Sun's lodge\").Olcott, Frances Jenkins; Richardson, Frederick. The red Indian fairy book for the children's own reading and for story-tellers. Boston; New York: Houghton Mifflin Co.. 1917. pp. 285-287. In a tale from Canada, The Daughters of the Star, hunter Waupee, the White Hawk, manages to capture a maiden who descended from the sky in a wicker basket along with eleven other maidens.Bemister, Margaret. Thirty Indian Legends of Canada. Vancouver: Douglas & McIntyre. 1912. pp. 47-50. ===Philippines=== In a tale collected from the \"Nabaloi\" (Ibaloi people) (The star wives), an indigenous ethnic group in the Philippines, the stars themselves descend from heaven and bathe in a lake in Batan. The local males hide the stars' clothing, which allow the stars to fly, and marry them. Eventually the men grow old, but the stars retain their youth, regain their clothings and return to the skies.Moss, C. R. Nabaloi Tales. University of California Publications in American Archaeology and Ethnology. Vol. 17, No. 5. Berkeley, California: University of California Press. 1924. pp. 258-261. In another tale, from the Tinguian (Itneg people), in the Phillipines, the star maiden Gaygayoma descends from the sky with other stars in a sugar-cane field to eat the produce. The plantation belong to a human named Aponitolau, who had a mortal wife, Aponibolinayen. One night, he goes to the fields to check on the bamboo fence and sees many stars, \"dazzling lights\" falling from the sky, and one that \"looked like a flame of fire\" who left her garment near the fence. The human farmer Aponitolau frightens the many stars, which return to the skies, and sits on the maiden's garment. She introduces herself as the daughter of Bagbagak and Sinag, two celestial beings, and reveals she wishes to take him as her husband.\"The Story of Gaygayoma who Lives up Above\". In: Cole, Mabel Cook. Philippine Folk Tales. Chicago: A. C. McClurg & co. 1916. pp. 37-43. In a similar tale, among the Bontoc Igorot (\"The Stars\"), the stars descend to eat a sugar-cane plantationthat belongs to a human farmer. The human captures the star maiden and marries her. After bearing him five sons, she spends her time sewing back her wings to wear them and return to the sky.Seidenadel, Carl Wilhelm. The first grammar of the language spoken by the Bontoc Igorot, with a vocabulary and texts, mythology, folklore, historical episodes, songs. Chicago: The Open court publishing company. 1909. pp. 548-551. ==Popular culture== ===Literature and fantasy novels=== Modern writer Rosamund Marriott Watson, under the nom- de-plume Graham R. Tomson, wrote a ballad from the point of view of an Inuit hunter who marries the grey gull maiden and laments her departure.\"Ballad of the Bird-Bride\". Watson, Rosamund Marriott. The bird-bride: a volume of ballads and sonnets. London, New York, Longmans, Green, and co. 1889. pp. 1-5. Victorian novelist and translator William Morris wrote his poetic ouvre The Earthly Paradise, in which there is a narration by a bard of the romance between a human and a swan maiden, comprising an episode of the poem The Land East of the Sun and West of the Moon.Morris, William. The earthly paradise, a poem. London, Reeves and Turner. 1890. pp. 198-228. Silver, Carole. \"\"East of the Sun and West of the Moon\": Victorians and Fairy Brides.\" Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature 6, no. 2 (1987): 283-98. Accessed August 4, 2020. doi:10.2307/464273.Silver, Carole G. Strange and Secret Peoples: Fairies and Victorian Consciousness. Oxford University Press. 1999. pp. 108-109. Folklorist Lafcadio Hearn adapted the Inuit legend of the bird wife (gull maiden) for his book Stray leaves from strange literature.Hearn, Lafcadio. Stray leaves from strange literature : stories reconstructed from the Anvari- Sohe\u00efli, Bait\u00e1l, Pach\u00eds\u00ed, Mahabharata, Pantchatantra, Gulistan, Talmud, Kalewala, etc.. Boston: J.R. Osgood. 1884. pp. 41-45. Pop culture appearances include modern novels of the fantasy genre such as Three Hearts and Three Lions. Recently, swan-men in the Anita Blake series, including Kaspar Gunderson. They are also called swan mays or swanmays in fantasy fiction and Dungeons and Dragons. In the Mercedes Lackey book Fortune's Fool, one swan maiden (named Yulya) from a flock of six is kidnapped by a Jinn. ===Film and animation=== The animal bride theme is explored in an animated film called The Red Turtle (2016). Princess Pari Banu from the 1926 German silhouette animation film The Adventures of Prince Achmed appears very similar to a swan maiden, having a peacock skin that transforms her and her handmaids, though she is referred to as a fairy or genie, in the original 1001 Nights. Modern appearances of the swan maiden include television such as Astroboy Episode 5. An episode of children's television programming Super Why adapted the tale of the Swan Maiden. ===Eastern media=== The anime/manga Ceres, Celestial Legend (Ayashi no Ceres) by Yu Watase is a similar story about an angel whose magic source is stolen as she bathes and she becomes wife to the man who stole it. The story follows one of her descendants now carrying the angel's revenge- driven reincarnated spirit inside her. The manhwa Faeries' Landing translates the Korean folktale of The Fairy and the Woodcutter to a modern setting. ===Video games=== The theme is also explored in modern fantasy video game Heroine's Quest. The eleventh installment of hidden object game series Dark Parables (The Swan Princess and the Dire Tree), published by Eipix mixes the motif of the swan maidens and the medieval tale of The Knight of the Swan. The sixteenth installment, Portrait of the Stained Princess, introduces the Knight of Swan himself, enchanted to never reveal his true name to his beloved. ==See also== * Prince as bird (the bird is a prince and woos the maiden) * Jorinde and Joringel (the maiden is transformed into a bird by the witch) * The Love for Three Oranges (fairy tale) (the love interest is turned into a bird by the false bride) * The Nine Peahens and the Golden Apples * The White Duck (a witch curses the queen into a duck form) * The Raven (Brothers Grimm) (a princess changed into a raven) * Melusine (a mermaid wife) * Undine (a mermaid wife) * Knight of the Swan (alternatively named Helias or Lohengrin) ==References== ==Bibliography== * Baughman, Ernest Warren.
