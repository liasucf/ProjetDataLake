The village is split between two parishes, Rickinghall Inferior and Rickinghall Superior, which join with Botesdale to make a single built-up area. There used to be many pubs, but now only The Bell Inn and The Greyhound (Botesdale) remain. The White Horse was converted to private accommodation in November 2016. Rickinghall was the birthplace of Sir Mackenzie Bowell, Prime Minister of Canada from 1894\u20131896. The adjoining village of Botesdale has one school, St Botolph's CEVCP, which serves Rickinghall, Botesdale, Redgrave and other local villages. Children from this school generally attend the Hartismere High School in Eye from the age of eleven. The Botesdale After School Club operates after school hours at Botesdale village hall which also houses the Botesdale and Rickinghall pre-school from 9.00 - 3.00. The villages of Rickinghall and Botesdale are very well serviced with a Co-op local store, Chinese takeaway, fish and chip shop, estate agent and several hairdressers amongst others.
