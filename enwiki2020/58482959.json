    "text": "Roberta Perkins (1949 \u2013 26 June 2018) was an Australian sociologist, writer, and transgender rights and sex worker rights activist. She wrote several books and multiple academic articles on the semi-nomadic lives of transgender sex workers, and established the first assistance center for transgender people in Australia. == Biography == Perkins completed her BA honours dissertation at Macquarie University in Sydney, in 1981 . Her dissertation surveyed the lives and experiences of drag queens and transsexuals, and was one of the first ever theses by an openly transgender woman in Australia. In the 1980s, she was an early member of the then newly-created Australian Transsexual Association, which supported trans people by lobbying for social and legal reform. In 1983, she published her first book, The Drag Queen Scene: Transsexuals in Kings Cross, a survey of 146 drag queens based upon her dissertation. Frank Walker, New South Wales Labor Assembly person and at that time Minister for Youth and Community Services, read the book, and invited Perkins to meet. She told him about the poverty, homelessness and violence experienced by transgender sex workers, many of them youths; about the rape, beatings, harassment, and evictions, and how trans women could find no aid in either men's or women's shelters.Roberta Perkins (1940\u20132018), Katherine Cummings, June 2018. Retrieved 14 September 2018 Walker understood the gravity of the situation, and expressed his commitment to help. As a result, Perkins received a grant of AU$80,000 to open a center that would operate as a shelter for transgender sex workers. The home, originally called \"Tiresias House\", opened in Sydney with 12 beds, which were immediately filled. The center quickly grew, and within a few years included four houses, and had on permanent staff a registered nurse and a community worker. After six years, its name changed to the Gender Centre.Trans Sex Worker Activist Roberta Perkins Mourned By Community, Jesse Jones, Star Observer, 28 June 2018. Retrieved 14 September 2018. Perkins left the Gender Centre in 1985, to concentrate on writing and publishing books and articles in academic publications about transgender women and sex workers. She was a noted figure in the struggle for sex worker rights in New South Wales and Australia as a whole. She was a founding member of the Australian Prostitutes Collective NSW, which advocated for decriminalization of sex work and for the improvement of sex workers' lives. The collective's work is continued today by the Sex Worker Outreach Project (SWOP) NSW. Perkins died on 26 June 2018, at the age of 78. Her obituaries called her a \"trail-blazer\" and \"a woman of action\" who laid the groundwork for sex worker advocacy in her country, and benefited \"countless\" trans people and sex workers. == Publications == * The Third Sex and Sanctified Persons: A Cross-Cultural Survey, Comparison and Analysis of Transvestism and Transsexuality.
