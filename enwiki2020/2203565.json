They are the descendants of an Indo- Aryan group and have been isolated until recent times. Their total population is estimated to be 500,000. They are one of the oldest known ethnic minorities in Afghanistan.http://www.sil.org/asia/ldc/parallel_papers/ju-hong_yun.pdf ==Geography== They are mainly concentrated in the northern parts of Laghman and Nangarhar, also parts of Kunar, Kapisa, Parwan, Nuristan, and a bit of Panjshir.

Many Pashai consider themselves Pashtuns speaking a special language,Pashai, Ethnic identity in Afghanistan, on nps.edu and many are bilingual in Pashto. Pashai communities can also be found in the Chitral district of northwestern Pakistan. ==History== Pashayis and Nuristanis were native to Kunar and Laghman valleys near Jalalabad in the north-east Afghanistan, until they were displaced to less fertile mountainous region by successive wave of immigration by Ghilji Pashtuns.The state and tribe in Afghanistan in the nineteenth century:The reign of Amir Dost Muhammad Khan: pp 161 Today, the majority of Pashai are Sunni Muslims, and are often referred to as Kohistani, while a minority are Nizari Ismaili Muslims. The Pashayi people originally practiced Buddhism and Ancient Hinduism, along with tribal religions. Per Tabakat-i-Akbari of Nizamuddin Ahmad, Mughal Emperor Akbar had dispatched his younger brother Mirza Muhammad Hakim, who was a staunch adherent of the missionary-minded Naqshbandi Sufi order, against the infidels of Katwar in 1582. Hakim was a semi-independent governor of Kabul. The Sifat-nama-yi Darvi\u0161 Muhammad H\u0101n-i \u011e\u0101z\u012b of Kadi Muhammad Salim who accompanied the expedition mentions its details. The Sifat-nama gives Muhammad Hakim the epithet of Darvi\u0161 Khan Gazi. Muhammad Darvish's invasion fought its way from Laghman to Alishang, and is stated to have conquered and converted 66 valleys to Islam. After conquering Tajau and Nijrau valleys in Panjshir area, the crusaders established a fort at Islamabad at confluence of Alishang and Alingar rivers. They continued the raid up to Alishang and made their last effort against the non-Muslims of Alingar, fighting up to Mangu, the modern border between Pashai and Ashkun-speaking areas. ==Notable individuals== * Northern Alliance commander Hazrat Ali ==See also== * Pashayi languages * Dardic languages ==References== ==External links== Category:Dardic peoples Category:Pashai people Category:Ethnic groups in Afghanistan Category:Social groups of Pakistan Category:Ethnic groups in Nangarhar Province ",
