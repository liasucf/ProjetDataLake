    "text": "Reventaz\u00f3n River Codo del Diablo murders is a political crime carried out in Costa Rica on December 19, 1948, in the area of Siquirres, Lim\u00f3n Province, known as El Codo del Diablo (\"Elbow of the Devil\"). Six political prisoners were kidnapped and extrajudicially killed due to their political affiliation with communism. The victims were Federico Picado S\u00e1enz, Tob\u00edas Vaglio Sardi, Lucio Ibarra, Octavio S\u00e1enz Soto, Narciso Sotomayor and \u00c1lvaro Aguilar (all Costa Ricans, except Sotomayor who was Nicaraguan), who were linked to the Communist Party Vanguardia Popular and were fighters of the \"Caldero- comunista\" side during the Costa Rican civil war of 1948 that had ended eight months before. The assassins were related to the winning side or \"Figueristas\" and the government was in the hands of the Founding Junta of the Second Republic, a de facto government. It is the only known case after 1948 in which the murder of Costa Rican citizens occurred due to their political ideas by persons linked to the State. Those who perpetrated the crime were Captain Manuel Z\u00fa\u00f1iga Jir\u00f3n and Deputy Luis Norberto Valverde Quir\u00f3s of the Public Force and as a driver, the Cuban-born Clarencio Auld Alvarado. The detainees were transferred from a police command in Lim\u00f3n in handcuffs to the Siquirres area on the banks of the Reventaz\u00f3n River known as \u201cCodo del Diablo\u201d where, aboard the train to the Atlantic of the Costa Rica Northern Railway Company, they were killed with a fire gun and their bodies thrown into the river where it was thought that they would not be found, however one of the bodies broke away from the wives and separated from the rest being found shortly after. An arrest warrant, imprisonment and trial against the culprits were issued, however they escaped from justice abroad, as reported, with the help of contacts they had in the government. On the anniversary of the event in 2012, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Villalta, then deputy of the left-wing Broad Front Party (which proclaimed itself to be the historic successor of the Communist Party) recalled the fact in the plenary and accused the government of the one then chaired by Jos\u00e9 Figueres Ferrer of having issued the order of the crime. ==References== Category:Anti-communism Category:History of Costa Rica Category:Political crimes ",
