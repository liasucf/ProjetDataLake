    "text": "John Wingate is an American author based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. His first book is Lost Boys of Hannibal: Inside America's Largest Cave Search, published by Wisdom Editions, a gripping account of the 1967 cave search for three lost boys in Mark Twain's boyhood home. The boys, two of whom were friends of Wingate, were never found. The incident remains one of the most vexing mysteries of 20th century America. Wingate's latest book - Souls Speak - was published by Calumet Editions during the summer of 2019, and listed as a top ten bestseller on Kindle for several weeks. Souls Speak is an astonishing true story of paranormal revelation and serial murder that changes a missing children case from missing to murder. The book identifies the boys as the earliest victims of notorious serial killer John Wayne Gacy. The year-long investigation identified a likely burial site for the three bodies two miles south of Hannibal, Missouri. GPS coordinates for the site have been turned over to law enforcement authorities in Marion County and Ralls County. Wingate currently is working on his third book, a series of short stories about mysteries and miracles, expected to be published in late 2020. His author website is CardiffHill.Com. Wingate can be followed on Facebook at authorjohnwingate and on Twitter at Wingate_author. A graduate of Illinois State University, Wingate spent 16 years as an award-winning broadcast journalist in Illinois and Minnesota before becoming a public relations/development communications specialist in 1991. He operates Wingate Communications Group, Inc. which helps organizations enhance visibility and fundraising outcomes. He also is a sought after speechwriter. Wingate has been awarded three national Telly Awards for outstanding video production.Verification of Telly Awards: ==References== ==External links== * Wingate Communications Category:Living people Category:Writers from Minneapolis Category:Illinois State University alumni Category:Communications consultants Category:American male writers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
