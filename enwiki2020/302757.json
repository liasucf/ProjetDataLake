    "text": "From Justin to Kelly is a 2003 American musical romantic comedy film written by Kim Fuller and directed by Robert Iscove. The film, starring American Idol first season winner Kelly Clarkson and runner-up Justin Guarini, won the Golden Raspberry Award for \"Worst 'Musical' of Our First 25 Years\" in 2005. This film is often regarded as one of the worst movies ever made. ==Plot== The film is set during spring break in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Texan singing waitress Kelly Taylor meets Pennsylvanian college student Justin Bell, who then fall for each other, and various romantic complications ensue. Kelly's friend Kaya falls in love with charming busboy Carlos; Kelly's other friend Alexa schemes to keep Justin and Kelly from meeting; Justin's friend Brandon is always getting on the wrong side of a sexy beach patrolwoman; and Justin's other friend Eddie tries to hook up with a cyber-pal. ==Cast== * Kelly Clarkson as Kelly Taylor * Justin Guarini as Justin Bell * Katherine Bailess as Alexa * Anika Noni Rose as Kaya * Brian Dietzen as Eddie * Greg Siff as Brandon * Jason Yribar as Carlos * Christopher Bryan as Luke * Theresa San- Nicholas as Officer Cutler * Justin Gorence as Greg * Kaitlin Riley as Ashley * Marc Macaulay as Mr. O'Mara * Jessica Sutta as Bracelet Girl * Zachary Woodlee and Robert Hoffman as Featured Dancers ==Release== Some theater chains threatened not to screen the film at all when distributor 20th Century Fox announced plans to rush it to VHS and DVD a mere six weeks after its opening weekend, but Fox ultimately relented and pushed the release date back a number of months. After underperforming its first weekend, Fox reinstated the original release schedule and the film was released via home media on August 26, 2003. ===Box office=== In its opening weekend, From Justin to Kelly grossed $2,715,848 in 2,001 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking #11 at the box office. By the end of its run on July 24, 2003, the film had grossed $4,928,883 in the domestic box office. Based on a $12 million budget, the film was a box office bomb. ===Critical reception=== The film has a 10% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 63 reviews; the average rating is 2.7/10. The consensus states: \"A notorious stinker, From Justin to Kelly features banal songs, a witless plot, and non-existent chemistry between its American Idol-sanctioned leads.\" The film has a score of 14 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 16 critics, indicating \"overwhelming dislike\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale. Entertainment Weekly film critic Owen Gleiberman wrote in his review, \"How bad is From Justin to Kelly? Set in Miami during spring break, it's like Grease: The Next Generation acted out by the food-court staff at SeaWorld.\" Time Magazine described the film as \"a monstrous Idol movie musical that in the most generous light is the worst film so far this century\".\"Miss Independent\" Josh Tyrangiel. Time Magazine February 05, 2006 (Subscription Required). ===Reception from Clarkson=== Clarkson has since stated that before the film went into production, she pleaded with the creator of American Idol to be relieved from the contractual obligation to star in a film, and that she has always disliked From Justin to Kelly.https://www.refinery29.com/2017/09/173883/kelly-clarkson-from-justin-to- kelly-american-idol In an interview, she admitted she joined the film only because she was contractually obligated to do so: \"I knew when I read the script it was going to be real, real bad, but when I won, I signed that piece of paper, and I could not get out of it.\" ===Accolades=== The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made. The choreography was considered so bad that a special Golden Raspberry \"Governor's Award\" was created as an excuse to present the film with a Razzie. However, the film was better received by the Teen Choice Awards, as it was nominated for two Choice Movie Breakout Stars (for Guarini and Clarkson) and Choice Chemistry. Total Film magazine ranked the film at number 16 in their list of 66 Worst Movies Of All Time.66 Worst Movies of All Time, Total Film. February 15th 2012.

However, a version of the song \"Timeless\", sung by Clarkson and Guarini, and recorded prior to the film, was included on Guarini's self-titled debut album.
