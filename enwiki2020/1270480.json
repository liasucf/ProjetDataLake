The municipal area encompasses Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport. ==Geography== It is located about southeast of the Berlin city centre, next to one of Berlin's two airports, Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld (SXF), which is to be replaced in 2020 by Berlin Brandenburg Airport (BER). The new airport is currently under construction and also to be located in Sch\u00f6nefeld, partly on land now occupied by the existing airport. In the north, Sch\u00f6nefeld adjoins to the Berlin boroughs of Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6neberg, Neuk\u00f6lln, and Treptow-K\u00f6penick with the localities of Lichtenrade, Gropiusstadt, Buckow, Rudow, Altglienicke, and Bohnsdorf. In the south, it borders Mittenwalde, in the west, Blankenfelde- Mahlow and in the east, Schulzendorf and Zeuthen. ===Civil parishes=== The Sch\u00f6nefeld municipal area comprises six districts (Ortsteile), former municipalities in their own right which were incorporated in 2003: *Sch\u00f6nefeld proper *Gro\u00dfziethen *Selchow *Kiekebusch *Waltersdorf *Wa\u00dfmannsdorf The settlement of Kienberg, part of Waltersdorf, was cleared of residents to permit expansion of the Berlin Brandenburg Airport and is to be developed as a commercial area. ==History and monuments== The first preserved mention of Sch\u00f6nefeld in the Mittelmark territory dates back to 1242. Sconenfelde, then a possession held by the Lords of Selchow, is documented in the 1375 Landbuch (domesday book) of Emperor Charles IV, when he also ruled as Elector of Brandenburg. The village church, rebuilt in 1904/05 according to plans designed by Franz Heinrich Schwechten, includes a large Baroque altar. Waltersdorf and Wa\u00dfmannsdorf also have village churches dating to the first half of the 13th century. From 1933 onwards the Henschel aircraft company moved from Johannisthal Air Field to Sch\u00f6nefeld and had three runways laid out next to the village. More than 14,000 warplanes were built at the site until 1945, when the premises were occupied by the Red Army. In the Gro\u00dfziethen cemetery is a memorial to 200 prisoners of war and forced laborers who died during World War II. The Soviet Air Forces used the air field from 1946, one year later the Soviet Military Administration ordered the buildup of a civil air service supplying East Berlin. Before German reunification Sch\u00f6nefeld shared its borders partly with boroughs of former West Berlin (present-day Neuk\u00f6lln and Tempelhof-Sch\u00f6nebergSource: \"ADAC StadtAtlas - Berlin-Potsdam\". ed. 2007 - pages 232, 233, 234 - ), and so from 1961 to 1990 it was separated from it by the Berlin Wall.Map and info about the wall on \"Berlin Wall Online\" Info, maps and pictures (see the sections \"Lichterfelde-Sch\u00f6nefeld\" and \"Sch\u00f6nefeld-East Side Gallery\") == Demography == File:Bev\u00f6lkerungsentwicklung Sch\u00f6nefeld.pdf|Development of Population since 1875 within the Current Boundaries (Blue Line: Population; Dotted Line: Comparison to Population Development of Brandenburg state; Grey Background: Time of Nazi rule; Red Background: Time of Communist rule) File:Bev\u00f6lkerungsprognosen Sch\u00f6nefeld.pdf|Recent Population Development and Projections (Population Development before Census 2011 (blue line); Recent Population Development according to the Census in Germany in 2011 (blue bordered line); Official projections for 2005-2030 (yellow line); for 2014-2030 (red line); for 2017-2030 (scarlet line) ==Economy and infrastructure== ===Transport=== *Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport, to be replaced with the new Berlin-Brandenburg Airport *Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld station, opened in 1951 on the Berlin outer ring, is currently served by regional (Regional-Express and Regionalbahn) and a few long-distance trains, as well as by the Berlin S-Bahn lines S45 and S9 *Another train station beneath the new airport terminal, and an S-Bahn station at Wa\u00dfmannsdorf, between there and the existing Sch\u00f6nefeld station, is under construction * The Sch\u00f6nefled interchange connects the autobahns A13, A113 with its A117 branch-off, and A10 (Berliner Ring). * Bundesstra\u00dfen B96A and B179 ===Business=== The Airport-Center, an industrial area in Waltersdorf, and Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport are important sources of revenue for Sch\u00f6nefeld.
