    "text": "The Council of Europe granted observer status to the Holy See on 7 March 1970, having maintained a lesser relationship since 1962, when the Apostolic Nuncio to Belgium was given the additional title Apostolic Delegate to the Council for Cultural Cooperation of the Council of Europe. In 1970, the Holy See established a diplomatic relationship with the European Economic Community and on 10 November appointed Archbishop Eugenio Cardinale as Nuncio to the Common Market. He was given a second charge and title as \"special envoy and permanent representative to the Council of Europe, the European consultative assembly in Strasbourg\". The nature and status of that position has evolved as the Vatican explored how best to manage its relationship with such international bodies and how to integrate such positions into its traditional hierarchy of representatives, delegates, and nuncios. Until 2019, Cardinale's successors representing the Holy See to the Council were not bishops, nor did they have the title nuncio or other responsibilities. Bressan in 1983 was named \"Special Envoy\" to the Council, and his successors were named \"Special Envoy with the role of Permanent Observer\" until the simpler formula was adopted in 2004: \"Special Envoy, Permanent Representative\". Full membership in the Council is likely precluded by the Holy See's lack of democracy and human rights guarantees. In 2007, the Holy See described its role vis-\u00e0-vis international organizations: It successfully argued that the Council\u2019s review of observer states recognize its \"special mission\" and remove language that said \"Its lack of democratic institutions and its position on certain human rights matters makes [sic] it a special case\". ;Permanent Observers * Eugenio Cardinale (10 November 1970 \u2013 24 March 1983) * Luigi Bressan (12 February 1983 \u2013 3 April 1989) * Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2 (14 April 1989 \u2013 3 April 1992) * Celestino Migliore (14 April 1992 \u2013 21 December 1995) * Michael Courtney (30 December 1995 \u2013 18 August 2000) * Paul Gallagher (18 August 2000 \u2013 22 January 2004) * Vito Rallo (27 January 2004 \u2013 12 June 2007) *Aldo Giordano (7 June 2008 \u2013 26 October 2013) * Paolo Rudelli (20 September 2014. \u2013 21 September 2019) * Marco Ganci (21 September 2019 \u2013 present) ==See also== * Apostolic Nunciature to the European Union ==Notes== ==References== Category:1970 establishments in France Council of Europe ",
