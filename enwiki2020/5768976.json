    "text": "Honningsv\u00e5g Airport, Valan (; ) is a regional airport serving Honningsv\u00e5g in Nordkapp, Norway. The airport is located at Valan, on the south side of Skipsfjorden, north of the town, and from the North Cape. The airport has a asphalt runway which is operated by the state-owned Avinor. Flights are operated by Wider\u00f8e to Troms\u00f8 with connecting fights to Oslo. The airline also fly to other communities within Finnmark, who serve the airport with Dash 8-100 and Q200 aircraft. The airport handled 13,487 passengers in 2014. Honningsv\u00e5g was served by a seaplane route in the late 1930s, but these never resumed after World War II. Valan Airport was planned as part of the construction of short take-off and landing airports in Finnmark, but did not open until 30 June 1977 because of airport's difficult terrain and landing conditions. Wider\u00f8e originally served the airport using the de Havilland Canada Twin Otter and the de Havilland Canada Dash 7, until the Bombardier Dash 8 was introduced in 1995. The routes have since 1997 been subsidized through public service obligations. A new terminal opened in 1989. The opening of the North Cape Tunnel in 1999 has resulted in a decrease of traffic at the airport. ==History== The first flight in Nordkapp took place during the summer of 1926, when a German cruise ship SS Oceania used its on-board Junkers F-13 seaplane to fly tourists sightseeing. The second was Gidsken Jakobsen and John Strandrud who used their Junkers seaplane to fly sightseeing for cruise tourists. Jakobsen established Nord-Norges Aero and applied for concession for a Northern Norway route, but Parliament instead chose to support Norwegian Air Lines (DNL). Their Bergen\u2013Troms\u00f8 route started in 1935 and the following year it was extended via Skjerv\u00f8y and Hammerfest to Honningsv\u00e5g. The Finnmark route was subcontracted to Wider\u00f8e, who flew an average of mail per trip between 11 June and 12 August. The Finnmark route was not carried out in 1937, but reopened the following year. In both 1938 and 1939 was operated from 1 July to 30 August. The 1940 schedule was terminated because of the German occupation of Norway, although twice a week a service was introduced from Trondheim via Troms\u00f8 and Honnignsv\u00e5g to Kirkenes. This was the first winter flights and lasted until early 1941 when the pilots fled to the United Kingdom for military service. The terminal DNL assumed the Finnmark route in 1947, but dropped Honningsv\u00e5g from the schedule. The municipal council approved plans in 1948 to reestablish the water aerodrome, which had been destroyed in the German retreat in 1944. Despite several local initiatives from Nordkapp during the 1950s and 1960s, Honningsv\u00e5g was not included in the seaplane routes. Following the opening av Alta Airport and Lakselv Airport, Banak in 1963, Norving applied to operate a feeder service from Honningsv\u00e5g to Alta and Hammerfest, but the ministry was not willing to issue subsidies for such a route. At the time travel time from Honningsv\u00e5g to Oslo via Lakselv was ten hours. Various public committees look into better aviation services in Finnmark during the 1960s. One such alternative was to build a heliport. Instead the government opted for constructing short take-off and landing airfields. The first of these were constructed in Helgeland in 1968. The ministry proposed in 1972 that six airports be built in northern Troms and Finnmark. The first five airports opened on 1 August 1974, but construction of Honningsv\u00e5g Airport was delayed. The reason was the difficult terrain and wind conditions and more time was needed to find a suitable site. In addition to Valan, sites at K\u00e5fjord and Skarsv\u00e5gfjellet was considered, in addition to the use of helicopters. Valan was chosen despite the poor conditions, which force approach to take place in a semi-circle. Construction cost 17.4 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which NOK 15.8 million was covered by the state and the remainder by Nordkapp Municipality and Finnmark County Municipality. The airport opened on 30 June 1977; it was initially operated by the municipality with the state operating the air navigation services. Approach at dusk Wider\u00f8e originally served the airport with nineteen-seat Twin Otters, serving Honningsv\u00e5g up to six times per day. The airport allowed for a travel time of four and a half hours from Honningsv\u00e5g to Oslo. Annual ridership was 20,000 for the first twelve months; it peaked at 25,316 in 1986 before falling to 17,000 in 1993. A new terminal was built in 1989. Honningsv\u00e5g Airport has used the term \"North Cape Airport\" because of its vicinity to the North Cape. A dispute between Honningsv\u00e5g and Lakselv arose in 1996 when the latter started using the same term for their airport. Wider\u00f8e introduced the Dash 8 in 1995 and from 1 January 1997 ownership and operations was taken over by the Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor). Flights to Honningsv\u00e5g have been subject to public service obligations since 1 April 1997. The North Cape Tunnel opened on 15 June 1999, providing a fixed link for Mager\u00f8ya to the mainland. This resulted in a significant fall in traffic, which hit a record low 10,846 in 2005. Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005. The safety areas were upgraded in 2010, followed by a new control tower in 2011. ==Future== After 2010 there are no new aircraft available for purchase with more than 19 seats which can use the runways common in Norway. The presently used Dash 8-100 and Q200 aircraft are assumed to be retired around 2030. Honningsv\u00e5g is one of the airports where there is no room for runway extension. Considering the fairly low number of passengers, the plan is to use small planes. ==Facilities== Aerial view of the airport in 2000 The airport is located at Valan, from Honningsv\u00e5g. The terminal has a capacity for 150 passengers per hour. The airport resides at an elevation of above mean sea level. The runway is designated 08/26 and has an asphalt surface measuring . The difficult terrain and wind conditions force aircraft to approach the airport in a semi-circle in both directions. The limited space also makes it impossible to extend the runway. Thirteen people worked at the airport as of 2008. ==Airlines and destinations== Honningsv\u00e5g is served by Wider\u00f8e, which operates Dash 8 (100 and Q200) aircraft to Troms\u00f8 and to some other communities in Finnmark. The routes are operated as public service obligations financed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. The airport served 13,487 passengers, 2,274 aircraft movements and handled 55 tonnes of cargo in 2014. Wider\u00f8e cooperate with SAS on connecting flights. The total flight time from Honningsv\u00e5g to Oslo, via Troms\u00f8, is 3:45 hours.https://www.wideroe.no/en Wider\u00f8e Airlines, official website Honningsv\u00e5g falls partially within the catchment area of Alta Airport, which is away by road. The driving time from Honningsv\u00e5g to Alta is 3:00 hours. The pass at Sennalandet is sometimes closed during snow storms in the winter time. If this happens, the alternative route takes over 6:00 hours, , so the weather forecast should be checked 6\u20138 hours before. Another option is the Lakselv Airport which is and 2:30 hours away by road and without a mountain pass, but has only seasonal flights to Oslo. ==Accidents and incidents== On 29 October 1990 at 14:30 a Twin Otter of the Royal Norwegian Air Force crashed during landing at Honningsv\u00e5g Airport. The pilots lost control during turbulence and strong wind and the aircraft crashed from the runway threshold. Three of the fifteen people on board were killed. The accident resulted in stricter wind restrictions at the airport. ==References== Category:Airports in Troms og Finnmark Category:Avinor airports Category:1977 establishments in Norway Category:Airports established in 1977 Category:Mager\u00f8ya Category:Nordkapp ",
