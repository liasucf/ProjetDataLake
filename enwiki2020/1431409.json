She then studied law at the University of Graz, Styria, graduating in 1993 (Magistra) and 1999 (doctorate) respectively. Glawischnig worked as a legal adviser for from 1992 until 1996.

Glawischnig has been a persistent critic of the Austrian government headed by Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel.

On 3 October 2008, Glawischnig became the Greens' federal spokeswoman following Alexander Van der Bellen's resignation.ORF: \"Van der Bellen sichtlich bewegt\" (in German) On 18 May 2017, she resigned as the Greens' federal spokeswoman and retired from politics, citing personal reasons.http://derstandard.at/2000057846796/Eva-Glawischnig-tritt- zurueckZeitpunkt-die-Fuehrung-abzugeben She has been working for Novomatic since 2018. ===Lawsuit against Facebook=== In 2016, Glawischnig requested Facebook to remove a post criticizing her in sharp terms. After Facebook failed to remove the post, she brought a claim in Vienna court, Eva Glawischnig-Pieszcek v. Facebook Ireland. The case became an important legal question of whether a court in the European Union could compel a social media company to globally censor a user's posting, even for viewers outside of the EU's jurisdiction. On October 3, 2019 the Court of Justice for the European Union decided that an Austrian court could indeed order the global removal of the offensive posts, and all future posts similar to them that are design to defame Glawishnig. Supporters of the Court's landmark ruling believe it empowers online users to defend themselves against defamation or other online abuse, while critics have called out the possibility of mass censorship due to the challenging nature of online rule enforcement. ==Notes and references== ==External links== * Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:People from Villach Category:Austrian women in politics Category:The Greens \u2013 The Green Alternative politicians Category:University of Graz alumni ",
