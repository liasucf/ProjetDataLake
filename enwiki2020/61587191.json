In line with the mission of AUA, the AUAYF is dedicated to addressing developmental issues in the Asian region, enhancing youth empowerment, and promoting cultural and academic exchanges among the AUA students. It aims to promote a vision of sustainability, innovativeness and collaboration through joint activities in a way that encourages the collective sharing of knowledge and the founding of multinational friendships. Each AUAYF focuses on a specific topic and theme drawn from the AUA Framework. === Asia Deep Dive Program === The Asia Deep Dive Program (ADDP) provides opportunities for students to have an immersive cultural experience in the country of the host university. The 2-week program aims to deepen students\u2019 understanding of Asia\u2019s various cultures and societies in order to improve communication and foster deeper cross cultural exchange and cooperation.

Each program centers around an AUA theme aiming to broaden students' knowledge of the selected disciplines and help them gain valuable insights and increased cultural savviness through the exchange of academic ideas with peers and professors of different countries. === Arts and Sports Events === Many AUA member universities have vibrant arts and sports communities.

Arts and Sports Events allow students to showcase their talents and share cross cultural experiences with one another. Through artistic endeavors and sportsmanship, these programs help students grow into creative and independent thinkers. == AUA Scholars Award Program== In March 2018, the AUA Scholars Award Program (AUASAP) was launched with the purpose of increasing the mobility of scholars among the AUA member universities. The Award is open to all faculty members and researchers of AUA universities. AUA provides financial support to up to 60 Scholars each year who wish to conduct short-term academic visits at another overseas AUA university. Scholars are encouraged to take this opportunity to advance research, share knowledge, conduct field study or establish international academic links in the community of AUA. == AUA Staff Exchange Program== In order to enhance communications between staff of the AUA members, AUA established the AUA Staff Exchange Program (AUASEP) in April 2018. The program provides financial support to up to 15 staff per year from an AUA member university or the Secretariat to carry out a one-week visit to another overseas AUA member or the Secretariat. == Research Collaboration== Each year, AUA supports its member institutions to hold academic conferences on topics drawn from the AUA themes.

AUA also supports member institutions to develop joint research initiatives as well as a document delivery service among libraries of member institutions. == Strategy & Policy == AUA is dedicated to providing a platform that generates quality discussions on university strategies, policies, and practices. Through the AUA Presidents Forum (AUAPF), which is held annually during the AUA Summit, university leaders congregate for high-level dialogues on the development of strategic plans, the improvement of management systems, and to address problems related to higher education. AUA also encourages developing dialogues and platforms for exchange among senior managers and staff of specific departments with the purpose of sharing best practices. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !List of AUA Presidents Forums !Theme !Date |- |AUA Presidents Forum 2019 |Session 1: Roles of Universities in the Sustainability Agenda Session 2: Innovation and Entrepreneurship Ecosystems: Asian Perspectives on Technological Stewardship and Higher Education |14 April 2019 |- |AUA Presidents Forum 2018 |The Rise of Asian Universities |10 April 2018 |- |AUA Presidents Forum 2017 |Shaping a Better Future for Asian Higher Education |29 April 2017 |} == Asian Higher Education Outlook (AHEO)== The Asian Higher Education Outlook (AHEO) report is published annually by AUA.
