    "text": "Quebec cider is crafted in the apple-producing regions of Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie, Eastern Townships, Chaudi\u00e8re-Appalaches, the Laurentides, Charlevoix and Capitale- Nationale, in Canada. The revival of cider is a relatively new phenomenon, since Quebec's alcohol regulating body, the R\u00e9gie des alcools, des courses et des jeux began issuing permits to produce craft cider only in 1988.ACAQ. \"Historique \", in the site of the Association des cidriculteurs artisans du Qu\u00e9bec, retrieved November 25, 2008 In 2008, some 40 cider makers were producing more than 100 apple-based alcoholic beverages.ACAQ. \"La Route des cidres\u2026suivez le guide! \", in the site of the Association des cidriculteurs artisans du Qu\u00e9bec, accessed November 25, 2008. == History == The honour of planting the first apple tree in the history of Quebec goes to Louis H\u00e9bert, apothecary from Paris and New France's first settler. He did so around 1617 on the site where Quebec City was founded in 1608.Martin, Paul-Louis, Les fruits du Qu\u00e9bec. Histoire et traditions des douceurs de la table, p. 35 A good number of the first French settlers to the colony were Normans who brought over the apple cider craft. Sizable orchards developed in the region of New France, particularly on \u00cele d'Orl\u00e9ans.Martin, p. 38. The Sulpicians, who settled on the Island of Montreal in 1657, possessed, beginning in 1666, a little orchard inside the fenced garden of the seminary on Notre-Dame Street. A bigger orchard was planted on the side of Mount Royal, in the mid-1670s.Martin, p. 41. On this site, the mission de la Montagne where Marguerite Bourgeoys had her school, they erected a fort, in 1685, where they were using two cider presses.Martin, p. 42. In 1705, the production of cider was about 30 barrels, and part was sold outside the religious community. In 1731, the orchards covered on the Island of Montreal, on the side of the mountain and around town.Martin, p. 40. From 1731 to 1781, the surface area occupied by the orchards rose from . The common cultivars at the time were the Calville blanc, Calville rouge, Famous, Reinette, Bourassa, Pomme blanche, Pomme grise of MontrealMartin, p. 59. and Sauvageon.Suzel Brunel (dir.) \u00c9tude de caract\u00e9risation de l'arrondissement historique et naturel du Mont-Royal , p. 44. These cultivars have been supplanted by others since. The British Conquest of 1760, confirmed by the cession of 1763, brought along all kinds of changes in the habits of French Canadians. Great Britain's protectionist trade policy, limiting exchanges within the British Empire, favoured the importation of alcohols from England (whisky, gin) and Antilles (rum), and discouraged all the artisanal productions of the inhabitants. Only beer, produced by industrialists from Great Britain (or of British origin), expanded significantly in the 19th century. On August 15, 1807, in Le Canadien of Quebec City, there was an article in which the author deplored that more efforts were not made to encourage the cultivation of apples on \u00cele d'Orl\u00e9ans and to export cider, which he judged \"superior or at least equal to that of Europe and the United States\". He suggested also that the production could serve to diminish the excessive consumption of rum, a \"source of disastrous ruins in a lot of families.\"Brunel, p. 58. The artisanal production of cider continued until the period of prohibition on alcohol in the middle of the 1910s. In April 1919, a great majority of Quebecers (78.62%) voted yes in a Quebec referendum asking them if \"beer, ciders, and light wines\" should be allowed, as excluded from the list of prohibited alcoholic beverages. However, in 1920, a legislative omission rendered cider illegal in the territory of Quebec. Indeed, the Canadian Alcoholic Beverages Act which ended prohibition and created the monopoly of the Commission des liqueurs du Qu\u00e9bec, did not legislate on cider, which consequently found itself in a judicial void. It was only in 1970, half a century later, that the situation was corrected. During this period, cider continued to be produced by several apple growers, but they were not legally permitted to sell it. When cider became legal again, Quebecers were served a cider produced industrially, which was disliked very much by many and gave it a bad reputation. Makers were unable to supply to the demand and inundated the market with products that had no maturity.ACAQ. \"Historique \", in the site of the Association des cidriculteurs artisans du Qu\u00e9bec, retrieved November 25, 2008 A whole generation experienced the Grand Sec d'Orl\u00e9ans,\"Pub Qu\u00e9bec - Le grand sec d'Orl\u00e9ans : bon comme c'est pas permis\", in YouTube, November 13, 2008 (1975 TV advertising) which to many, evoked what is most undrinkable when it comes to alcohol. Sales declined after a few years, and cider, barely gotten out of its \"dark age\", was plunged back into it. From about a year in 1971, the production dropped to per year in 1982.Jean-Gilles Jutras. \"Jean-Gilles Jutras \u00e0 la d\u00e9couverte : Le cidre \", in Plan\u00e8te Qu\u00e9bec, April 22, 2003 It was only at the end of the 1980s when the first craft production permits were issued by the R\u00e9gie des alcools, des courses et des jeux du Qu\u00e9bec, that Quebec cider was truly reborn, about the same time as beer and wine, for the same reason. The ciders crafted by small cider makers then multiplied, often avoiding to use the word cidre on the bottle to avoid alarming the consumers.VinoTV. \"Christian Barthomeuf, du Clos Saragnat : un pionnier de la production de cidre de glace \" (a pioneer in production of ice cider), in VinoTV.ca, September 18, 2008 The first Quebec ice cider was crafted by Christian Barthomeuf in Dunham in the Eastern TownshipsClos Saragnat. \"Un peu d'histoire... \", in the site of the Clos Saragnat, 2008 during the winter of 1989\u20131990. The first bottles bear the \"1990\" mill\u00e9sime. Ten years later, cider makers obtained the authorization to name their products cidre de glace (ice cider). A regulation on cider was finally adopted by the National Assembly of Quebec in November 2008.LaTerre.ca \"Le R\u00e8glement sur le cidre adopt\u00e9\", in LaTerre.ca, November 13, 2008.ANQ. R\u00e8glement sur le cidre. Loi sur la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des alcools du Qu\u00e9bec, \u00c9diteur officiel du Qu\u00e9bec, 2008. == Types == Quebec cider makers prepare various types of ciders, which are categorized according to the production method, the percentage of alcohol, the effervescence, or the residual sugar content.SAQ. \"Terroirs du Qu\u00e9bec. Pommes\" (apples), in SAQ.com, retrieved October 18, 2008. Cider is said to be light when it contains 7% of alcohol or less, strong when it contains 7% to 13%, and ap\u00e9ritif when between 13% to 20%. Flavoured cider, perfumed with aromas of berries, honey or maple, generally contains less than 10% alcohol. As it is with wine, cider can be still (without bubble) or sparkling (with bubbles). Sparkling apple cider is crafted either by injecting carbon dioxide, in closed vats using the Charmat process or the traditional champenoise method. The result is a cider said to be semi-sparkling when in impregnated naturally with carbon dioxide, under low pressure (less than ), carbonated semi-sparkling when impregnated artificially with carbon dioxide, also under low pressure. It is sparkling when impregnated naturally with carbon dioxide under a pressure between and carbonated sparkling, if artificially impregnated with carbon dioxide under of the same pressure of . Apple mistelle is a cider obtained from a must kept fresh, that is unfermented, to which alcohol is added. Ice cider, an innovation from Quebec, is crafted by pressing apples naturally frozen by winter's cold. Similar to the late harvest of grapes, apples picked during winter allow for a must with a high sugar content, when water, turned into ice, is separated from the apples. This step is called the cryoconcentration of sugar.La face cach\u00e9e de la pomme. \"cryoconcentration \", in the site of La face cach\u00e9e de la pomme, 2008 The final result, after the fermentation of the must, is a liqueur-like and mellow liquid, containing between 9 and 13% of alcohol. == Regions == Quebec counts six cider-producing regions, which correspond more or less with its apple-producing regions: the Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie, Eastern Townships, Chaudi\u00e8re- Appalaches, the Laurentides, Charlevoix, and Capitale-Nationale. == Apples == Cultivation of apples is well developed in Quebec, which produces in quantity several cultivars of apples, the McIntosh, Paula Red, Spartan, Cortland, Empire, Vista Bella and Jersey Mac being among the most common.FPPQ. \"Nos pommes \", in the site of La F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des producteurs de pommes du Qu\u00e9bec, retrieved October 18, 2008 == Notes == == See also == * Quebec beer == References == * Martin, Paul-Louis (2002).
