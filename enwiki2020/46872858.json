The forewings are pale ashen grey, with a darker brown base and with a narrow darker external line. This is followed by a broad pale area, which is widest in the inner marginal area. Here, a very broad, slightly darker postmedian area reaches all across the wing. This area is bounded externally by a white line. There is a dark subterminal line. The hindwings are pale grey, with much very fine brownish irroration (sprinkling).Bethune-Baker, G. T. 1927. Descriptions of new Heterocera from Africa and the East.
