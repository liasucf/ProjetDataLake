He primarily resides there. ==Approach to comedy== Bishop's comedy was originally based heavily on his observations of Irish society, supported by his talent for mimicking the regional variations of the Irish accent. His website says, \"Des has developed a unique style of observational comedy, most critical of his adopted home in Ireland and the America he left behind.\" www.desbishop.com Bishop's comedy has since grappled with social issues, such as poverty. In 2000, Bishop was diagnosed with testicular cancer; rather than shy away from this subject, Des went on to turn his experiences into comedy material. ==Life and career== Bishop has worked as a comic in Ireland since the late 1990s. He began hosting shows at the International Comedy Cellar - a venue set up by Irish comics such as Ardal O'Hanlon, Kevin Gildea and Barry Murphy. It was here that Bishop honed his act.

Bishop created a \"hip-hopera\" called \"RAP \u00c9IRE\" along with Arthur Riordan. \"Rap \u00c9ire\" was a satire following the story of an ambitious American who finds himself mixed up with a group of political types during the throes of early Celtic Tiger fervour. The show had two runs - firstly in the Project Arts centre in February 2001 and afterwards in the Andrews Lane Theatre the following summer. Bishop performed every night of the first run while receiving radiotherapy for testicular Cancer (the original premier date for the play at the Dublin Fringe Festival 2000 had to be cancelled as a result of the original diagnosis of cancer). Bishop appeared in the 2002 film In America, in which he played a high stockbroker rapping in the back of a NYC taxi cab. He reached a broader audience after his TV show The Des Bishop Work Experience screened on RT\u00c9 Two in 2004.
