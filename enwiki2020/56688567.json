    "text": "The Bolla Aqueduct was an aqueduct in Italy, measuring 8 kilometres. It connected Naples with a marshy depression near Mount Vesuvius, which was in turn supplied by an aquifer of pyroclastic and sedimentary deposits laid down in Vesuvius' many eruptions. It reached the city at Porta Capuana before splitting into a network of underground channels leading to private wells. Its date of construction is unknown, but is estimated sometime between the 5th century BC and the Middle Ages. It remained a major water source for the city until being replaced by the Serino aqueduct in the late 19th century. The Bolla still supplies water to outer areas of Naples for industrial use. ==External links== *http://www.romanaqueducts.info/aquasite/serino2/index.html category:Aqueducts in Italy category:History of Naples ",
