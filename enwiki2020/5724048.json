He was born in Berlin, Germany. He was Rector and Acting President at Bar-Ilan University from 1967 to 1977. ==Biography== Jammer studied physics, philosophy and history of science, first at the University of Vienna, and then from 1935 at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he received a PhD in experimental physics in 1942. He served in the British Army for the rest of the war. Jammer then returned to Hebrew University, where he lectured on the history and philosophy of science, before moving in 1952 to Harvard University. He subsequently became a lecturer there and a close colleague of Albert Einstein at Princeton University. He taught at Harvard, the University of Oklahoma, and Boston University, before in 1956 establishing the Department and becoming Professor of Physics at Bar-Ilan University in Israel. He was Rector and Acting President (succeeding Joseph H. Lookstein, and succeeded by Emanuel Rackman) at Bar-Ilan University from 1967 to 1977. He also co-founded the Institute for Philosophy of Science at Tel Aviv University, and was President of the Association for the Advancement for Science in Israel. He was Visiting Professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Z\u00fcrich, the University of G\u00f6ttingen, the Institut Henri Poincar\u00e9, Columbia University, the Catholic University of America in Washington, D. C., and other universities in the United States and Canada. He is the father of Rabbi Michael Yammer, Rosh Yeshiva, Yeshivat Shaalvim. ==Awards== Awards received by Jammer include: * the 1984 Israel Prize, awarded for history of science; * the 2003 EMET Prize awarded by the Prime Minister of Israel; * the 2007 Abraham Pais Prize for History of Physics, awarded by the American Physical Society; * the Monograph Prize of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; and * a prize for 'an outstanding book on theology and natural sciences' from the Templeton Foundation. ==Selected publications== : Concepts of Space: The History of Theories of Space in Physics.
