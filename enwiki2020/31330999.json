    "text": "Tripolitanian Republic (Arabic: , al-Jumhuriyat at-Trabulsiya), was an Arab republic that declared the independence of Tripolitania from Italian Libya after World War I. ==Background== The proclamation of the Tripolitanian Republic in autumn 1918 was followed by a formal declaration of independence at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. The idea began in the city of Misrata following a meeting of Sulayman al-Baruni, Ramadan Asswehly, Abdul Nabi Belkheir and Ahmad Almarid. This was the first formally declared republican form of government in Libya, but it gained little support from international powers and disintegrated by 1923. Italy managed to establish full control over Libya by 1930. Originally administered as part of a single colony, Italian Tripolitania was a separate colony from 26 June 1927 to 3 December 1934, when it was merged into Libya. ==Further reading== * ==References== Category:1918 establishments in Africa Category:Former countries in Africa Category:Italian Libya Category:History of Tripolitania Category:Former republics Category:Former polities of the interwar period Category:States and territories established in 1918 Category:States and territories disestablished in 1922 ",
