    "text": "William McCartney (born in Newmilns) was a Scottish footballer, whose regular position was as an inside left. He played for Rutherglen Glencairn, Ayr, Hibernian, Manchester United, and West Ham United. McCartney played once for Scotland, in a 5\u20131 win against Ireland in the 1902 British Home Championship. He also represented the Scottish League twice against the English League in 1902 and 1903. McCartney helped Hibs to win the 1901\u201302 Scottish Cup, but missed the final due to a broken leg, and the 1903 Scottish league championship. He was transferred to Manchester United in 1903, and then moved to West Ham United after one season. His single season at West Ham, the 1904\u201305 campaign, saw him make 28 Southern League First Division appearances. His two goals from open play came home and away against Southampton, and his only other goal for the club came from the penalty spot, against Bristol Rovers on 8 April 1905. He also made one FA Cup appearance for the Irons, a sixth-round qualifying match against Brighton and Hove Albion. ==References== ==External links== * *London Hearts profile *MUFCInfo.com profile Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:Place of death missing Category:Sportspeople from East Ayrshire Category:Scottish footballers Category:Scotland international footballers Category:Association football inside forwards Category:Hibernian F.C. players Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:West Ham United F.C. players Category:Rutherglen Glencairn F.C. players Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Scottish Football League representative players Category:English Football League players Category:Ayr F.C. players Category:Lochgelly United F.C. players Category:Clyde F.C. players ",
