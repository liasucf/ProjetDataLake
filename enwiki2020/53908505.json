He studied in the Department of History of Art at Cardinal Stefan Wyszy\u0144ski University of Warsaw (Warsaw Theological Academy at that time). In 1984 he defended his final M.A. thesis, under the supervision of the rev. prof. Janusz Pasierb and the assistant- professor Andrzej Olszewski, which dealt with Polish art of the first half of the 20th century. In his public activity he deals with resources, culture management, popularizing culture, conservation, and also the shaping of the environment.See, among others: Conservation Guidelines in the form of project concepts concerning The Market Square and The Town Hall Square in Niepo\u0142omice near Krak\u00f3w \u2013 1994-1995 (accessible in the archives of the Municipal Council in Niepo\u0142omice); Conservation Guidelines concerning the Clothmakers\u2019 House in Bielsko-Biala \u2013 1996. In the years 1991-1999 he was a Municipal Restorer in Cieszyn. Thanks to his creation and application of a conservation method, which was precursory at that time and which enabled the linking of activities of various fields, such as conservation, sociology and social studies as well as planning, it was possible to recover and retain the historic and original character of Cieszyn, which also visibly influenced the quality of the public space. Thanks to this the town became an example to follow in the region, as well as beyond it, when it comes to new solutions in art conservation and architecture.\u201cImpact of public administration on the space quality on the example of conservation effort in the 1990s in Cieszyn\u201d, Ochrona Zabytk\u00f3w, no 2 (269) LXIX, December 2016, p. 51 ; Archival conservation documentation, in the hands of The Office for Spatial Planning at the Department of Strategy and Town Development in The Municipal Council in Cieszyn In the area of scientific research, he is one of the discoverers of part of the mediaeval fortifications on Castle Hill in Cieszyn, including, especially, the cylindrical tower, the so-called Tower of Ultimate Defence from the 13th century.
