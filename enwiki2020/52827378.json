Discussing The Runagates Club, Brian Stableford praised \"The Green Wildebeest\" as \"a well-executed story\". Stableford also described \"Skule Skerry\", \"Tendebant Manus\", and \"Fullcircle\" as \"tales of subtle hauntings, told with a delicacy with Buchan rarely bothered to bring to his hurriedly-penned novels.\" Stableford, Brian, \"Buchan, John, (1st Baron Tweedsmuir of Elsfield)\", in David Pringle, St. James Guide to Horror, Ghost & Gothic Writers (London: St. James Press, 1998}, pp. 104 Andrew Lownie, in John Buchan: The Presbyterian Cavalier (2013) notes that this work, Buchan's only collection of post First World War short stories, is unique in including all of his major characters. He holds the stories to be beautifully self- contained, and to demonstrate \"the usual Buchan themes of an unwitting amateur drawn into adventure and the fragile division between civilisation and chaos\". ==References== ==External links== * *The Runagates Club at Project Gutenberg Australia Category:Works by John Buchan Category:1928 short story collections ",
