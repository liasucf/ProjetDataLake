    "text": "Alhamdulillah (, ') is an Arabic phrase meaning \"praise be to God\", sometimes translated as \"thank God\". This phrase is called Tahmid () or Hamdalah (). A longer variant of the phrase is al-\u1e25amdu l-ill\u0101hi rabbi l-\u02bf\u0101lam\u012bn (), meaning \"all praise is due to God, Lord of all the worlds\". It is frequently used by Muslims of every background, due to its centrality to the texts of the Quran and Hadith\u2014the words of the Islamic prophet Muhammad\u2014and its meaning and in- depth explanation have been the subject of much exegesis. It is also commonly used by non-Muslim speakers of the Arabic language. ==Meaning== Sini-Arabic script on an incense box, Qing Dynasty, 19th century, China. Adilnor Collection, Sweden. The phrase has three basic parts: *al-, the definite article, \"the\". *\u1e25amd(u), literally meaning \"praise\", \"commendation\". *li- ll\u0101h(i), preposition + noun All\u0101h. Li- is a dative preposition. The word All\u0101h () means \"The God\", and it is a contraction of the definite article al- and the word \u02beil\u0101h (, \"god, deity\"). As in English, the article is used here to single out the noun as being the only one of its kind, \"the God\" (the one and only) or \"God\". Therefore, All\u0101h is the Arabic word for \"God\". \u02beil\u0101h is the Arabic cognate of the ancient Semitic name for God, El. The phrase is first found in the second verse of the first sura of the Qur'an (Al-Fatiha). So frequently do Muslims and Arabic-speaking Jews and Christians invoke this phrase that the quadriliteral verb hamdala (), \"to say al-\u1e25amdu li-ll\u0101h\" was coined, and the derived noun \u1e25amdalah () is used as a name for this phrase. The triconsonantal root \u1e24-M-D (), meaning \"praise\", can also be found in the names Muhammad, Mahmud, Hamid and Ahmad. ==Translation== English translations of alhamdulillah include: * \"all praise is due to God alone\" (Muhammad Asad) * \"all the praises and thanks be to Allah\" (Muhammad Muhsin Khan) * \"praise be to Allah\" (Abdullah Yusuf Ali, Marmaduke Pickthall) * \"all praise is due to Allah\" (Saheeh International) *\u201cAll perfect praises belong to the Almighty alone.\u201d (A.

Rahman) ==Variants== Various Islamic phrases include the Tahmid, most commonly: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center |- ! style=\"width:33%;\"| Arabic * * * Qur\u02beanic Spelling || style=\"width:30%;\"| Transliteration * * * IPA || style=\"width:33%;\"| Phrase |- ||| \u02beal\u1e25amdu lill\u0101h * * * /\u0294al.\u0127am.du lil.la\u02d0.hi/ || All praise is due to God. |- | * * * || \u02beal\u1e25amdu lill\u0101hi rabbi l-\u02bf\u0101lam\u012bn * * * /\u0294al.\u0127am.du lil.la\u02d0.hi rab.bi\u203fl.\u0295a\u02d0.la.mi\u02d0.na/ || All praise is due to God, Lord of all the worlds. |- | * * * || sub\u1e25\u0101na -ll\u0101hi wa-bi-\u1e25amdih * * * /sub.\u0127a\u02d0.na\u203f\u026b.\u026ba\u02d0.hi wa.bi.\u0127am.di.hi\u02d0/ || Glorified is God and by His praise. |- | * * * || sub\u1e25\u0101na rabbiya l-\u02bfa\u1e93\u012bmi wa-bi-\u1e25amdih * * * /sub.\u0127a\u02d0.na rab.bi.ja\u203fl.\u0295a.\u00f0\u02e4i\u02d0.mi wa.bi.\u0127am.di.hi\u02d0/ || Glorified is my Lord, the Great, and by His praise. |- | * * * || sub\u1e25\u0101na rabbiya l-\u02bea\u02bfl\u0101 wa-bi-\u1e25amdih * * * /sub.\u0127a\u02d0.na rab.bi.ja\u203fl.\u0294a\u0295.la\u02d0 wa.bi.\u0127am.di.hi\u02d0/ || Glorified is my Lord, the Most High, and by His praise. |- |} ==Use in other historical sources== Jabir ibn Abd-Allah wrote in a hadith that Muhammad, said: \"The best remembrance of God is to repeat l\u0101 \u02beil\u0101ha \u02beill\u0101 ll\u0101h and the best prayer (du'a) is al-\u1e25amdu li-ll\u0101h.\" (Narrated by Nasa'i, Ibn Majah, and Hakim who declared its chain 'sound'.) Abu Huraira wrote that Muhammad said: \"Any matter of importance which is not begun with al-\u1e25amdu li-ll\u0101h remains defective.\" From Abu Dawood. Anas bin Malik wrote that Muhammad said: \"God is pleased with his slave who says, al-\u1e25amdu li-ll\u0101h when he takes a morsel of food and drinks a draught of water.\" ==See also== *Tasbih *Tahlil *Takbir *Tasmiyah *Salawat *Peace be upon him *Shahadah *Glossary of Islam *Hadha min fadli Rabbi *Hosanna *Hallelujah ==References== ==External links== *AlHamdulillah - Detailed Explanation from Tafseer Ibn Katheer - Surah Fatiha *Health benefits of saying Alhamdulillah *Everyday duas in Arabic with transliteration and translation *Alhamdulillah- Commentary Category:Arabic words and phrases Category:Islamic terminology Category:Gratitude ",
