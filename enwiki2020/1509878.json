    "text": "George Szirtes (; born 29 November 1948) is a British poet and translator from the Hungarian language into English. Originally from Hungary, he has lived in the United Kingdom for most of his life after coming to the country as a refugee at the age of eight. Szirtes was a judge for the 2017 Griffin Poetry Prize. ==Life== Born in Budapest on 29 November 1948, Szirtes came to England as a refugee in 1956 aged 8. After a few days in an army camp followed by three months in an off-season boarding house on the Kent coast, along with other Hungarian refugees, his family moved to London, where he was brought up and went to school, then studied fine art in London and Leeds. Among his teachers at Leeds was the poet Martin Bell. His poems began appearing in national magazines in 1973, and his first book, The Slant Door, was published in 1979. It won the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize the following year. In 2000, British composer Jane Sinclair Wells used his text for her work Air Kissing. He has won a variety of prizes for his work, most recently the 2004 T. S. Eliot Prize, for his collection Reel, and the Bess Hokin Prize in 2008 for poems in Poetry magazine. His translations from Hungarian poetry, fiction and drama have also won numerous awards. He has received an Honorary Fellowhsip from Goldsmiths College, University of London and an Honorary Doctorate from the University of East Anglia. He also won the Poetry and the People Award in Guangzhou, China in 2016. Szirtes lives in Wymondham, Norfolk, having retired from teaching at the University of East Anglia in 2013. He is married to the artist Clarissa Upchurch, with whom he ran The Starwheel Press and who has been responsible for most of his book jacket images. ==Prizes and honours== *1980 Faber Memorial Prize for The Slant Door *1982 Elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature *1984 Arts Council Travelling Scholarship, *1986 Cholmondeley Prize *1990 D\u00e9ry Prize for Translation The Tragedy of Man *1991 Gold Star of the Hungarian Republic *1992 Shortlisted for Whitbread Poetry Prize for Bridge Passages *1995 European Poetry Translation Prize for New Life *1996 Shortlisted for Aristeion Translation Prize New Life *1999 Sony Bronze Award, 1999 \u2013 for contribution to BBC Radio Three, Danube programmes *1999 Shortlisted for Weidenfeld Prize for The Adventures of Sindbad *2000 Shortlisted for Forward Prize Single Poem: Norfolk Fields *2002 George Cushing Prize for Anglo-Hungarian Cultural Relations *2002 Society of Authors Travelling Scholarship *2003 Leverhulme Research Fellowship *2004 Pro Cultura Hungarica medal *2004 T.
