    "text": "Fort Yawuh is an acoustic jazz album by American pianist and composer Keith Jarrett. Originally released in 1973 by Impulse! Records, it marks the beginning of the relationship between the label and the artist. The tracks were recorded live at the Village Vanguard on February 24, 1973 by the then- still-not-known as Jarrett's \"American Quartet\", Dewey Redman, Charlie Haden, Paul Motian plus Danny Johnson. The title of the album is an anagram of the phrase \"Fourth Way.\" == Background == At the time the recording was made, Danny Johnson had never worked as a professional musician. In an interview led by Ethan Iverson bassist Charlie Haden said that Johnson was \"a great, great painter, and a great friend, and someone who was at EVERY gig, and one day he suddenly asked to sit in with us at the Village Vanguard. Keith asked, \u201cWhat do you play?\u201d \u201cTriangle!\u201d said Danny Johnson. Keith said yes and Danny came down with a big oriental rug and sat like a sitar player with his triangle. And that was the night we recorded Fort Yawuh.\" One year later Johnson joined the group again on percussion (along Guilherme Franco) - this time for the studio recording of Treasure Island. ==Critical reception== Reviewing for Creem in 1974, Robert Christgau said that, while side one sounds like cluttered free jazz at first, it is in fact highlighted by the Ornette Coleman-like playing of saxophonist Dewey Redman. He found side two more accessible because of drummer Paul Motian's performance during \"De Drums\" and the attractive composition of \"Still Life Still Life\". In a retrospective review, Allmusic's Qa'id Jacobs wrote, \"Fans of Jarrett's avant-garde liberalism will find 'De Drums' to be the track most unlike the other four selections on this album. 'Still Life, Still Life' is more like a ballad in that it's very slow, but it still maintains the structural freedom featured in the 'Fort Yawuh,' '(If the) Misfits (Wear It),' and 'Roads Traveled, Roads Veiled.'\"Jacobs, Q. Allmusic Review accessed September 12, 2011 Writing for the former jazz magazine Jazz.com, in June 2008 Ted Gioia rated 90/100 the track (If The) Misfits (Wear It) stating that:Gioia, Ted (June 2008) Keith Jarrett: (If The) Misfits (Wear It) by Ted Gioia at Jazz.com accessed September 2020 == Track listing == :All compositions by Keith Jarrett Side One Side Two === Extended Release === The CD box set The Impulse Years: 1973-1974 expands Fort Yawuh to two CDs, including unedited versions of the takes chosen for the LP as well as additional tracks.
