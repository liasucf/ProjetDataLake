    "text": "The 2019\u201320 Celtic Cup was the second edition of the Celtic Cup rugby union competition, which features development regional and provincial teams from Ireland and Wales. It ran from August 2019 until October 2019, with a change to a single table format from the original conference system. Leinster A, winners of the inaugural edition, defended their title by beating first time finalists Ulster A in an all-Ireland final 31\u201310. ==Formation and purpose== The Irish Rugby Football Union and the Welsh Rugby Union created a new development competition, the Celtic Cup, for the emerging professional players from the four Irish provinces and four Welsh regions, announcing the tournament in August 2018. The tournament, which features development squads from Pro14 teams Connacht, Leinster, Munster, Ulster, Cardiff Blues, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets, aims to provide a learning environment for development players, coaches and referees by recreating the week-to-week challenges presented by senior professional rugby. ==2019\u201320 season== In a change from the 2018\u201319 tournament, the 2019\u201320 edition of the competition featured all eight teams in a single round-robin league format, rather than two conferences. Each team playing seven matches and the top two teams advanced to the final. ==Table== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !width=\"15\"| !style=\"width:200px\"|Team !width=\"30\"|P !width=\"30\"|W !width=\"30\"|D !width=\"30\"|L !width=\"30\"|PF !width=\"30\"|PA !width=\"30\"|PD !width=\"30\"|TF !width=\"30\"|TA !width=\"30\"|TB !width=\"30\"|LB !width=\"30\"|Pts |- style=\"background:#cfc\" | 1 || align=\"left\"| Leinster A (CH) || 7 || 7 || 0 || 0 || 351 || 140 || 211 || 55 || 22 || 7 || 0 || 35 |- style=\"background:#cfc\" | 2 || align=\"left\"| Ulster A (RU) || 7 || 5 || 0 || 2 || 198 || 170 || 28 || 28 || 23 || 5 || 0 || 25 |- | 3 || align=\"left\"| Connacht Eagles || 7 || 5 || 0 || 2 || 191 || 169 || 22 || 24 || 24 || 3 || 0 || 23 |- | 4 || align=\"left\"| Scarlets A || 7 || 4 || 0 || 3 || 217 || 194 || 23 || 29 || 28 || 4 || 2 || 22 |- | 5 || align=\"left\"| Dragons A || 7 || 2 || 0 || 5 || 205 || 236 || -31 || 30 || 34 || 5 || 2 || 15 |- | 6 || align=\"left\"| Munster A || 7 || 2 || 1 || 4 || 165 || 206 || -41 || 22 || 31 || 3 || 0 || 13 |- | 7 || align=\"left\"| Ospreys Development || 7 || 1 || 1 || 5 || 133 || 229 || -96 || 19 || 32 || 2 || 0 || 8 |- | 8 ||align=\"left\"| Cardiff Blues A || 7 || 1 || 0 || 6 || 109 || 225 || -116 || 17 || 30 || 2 || 1 || 7 |- |colspan=\"14\"| If teams are level at any stage, tiebreakers are applied in the following order - # number of matches won # the difference between points for and points against # the number of tries scored # the most points scored # the difference between tries for and tries against # the fewest red cards received # the fewest yellow cards received |- |colspan=\"14\" style=\"border:0px\"| Green background indicates teams that advance to the final (Q) Qualified for the final (CH) Champions (RU) Runners-up Updated: 5 October 2019 Source: Munster Rugby |} ==Pool Stage== ===Round 1=== ===Round 2=== ===Round 3=== ===Round 4=== ===Round 5=== ===Round 6=== ===Round 7=== ==Final== ==References== Category:Celtic Cup (2018 rugby union tournament) Category:2019\u201320 in European rugby union Celtic Cup Celtic Cup ",
