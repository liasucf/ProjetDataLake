    "text": "Armenia and Uzbekistan enjoy relatively strong relations, which is sometimes viewed to be among the wealthiest relationships between Armenia and a Turkic state. Both two embassies of two nations are accredited in Moscow. ==History== Armenians have a long presence in Central Asia since antiquity, in which Armenians, mostly traders, established trade and economic links with the Turks of Central Asia. It would have continued with little interruption, despite Armenia falling into the hands of the Byzantine Empire, Safavid dynasty and to the later Russian Empire, although it declined in the 19th century. Armenian and Russian research materials indicate that in 1890 more than 4,000 Armenians lived in Central Asia, many in what is today\u2019s Uzbekistan and its neighboring countries. This figure climbed to 5,000 in 1897 and to more that 25,000 in 1917, according to the same sources. The main Armenian communities were in the Uzbek cities of Bukhara, Khiva, Andijan, Kokand and Tashkent. Armenian immigrants moved in large number to the Central Asian region, especially during the World War I which occurred the Armenian Genocide. As part of Tsarist Russia and later Soviet Union, ethnic Armenians were trusted to ongoing immigration to the region, and Armenian immigration also met with little resistance from local Uzbeks. Uzbeks and Armenians were able to get along well until the rise of ethnic nationalism at 1990s that saw clashes between Armenians and Muslim peoples, mainly Tajiks but also a minority of Uzbeks, which ended deadly. However, with the erupt of Tajikistani Civil War, newly independent Uzbekistan tolerated and encouraged Armenians fighting against Tajik-backed forces in the war, mostly Islamists. Consequently, Uzbekistan had its own Armenian militias fighting on the side of Tashkent, and for its efforts, soon became recognized among Uzbek citizens. On the other hand, Uzbekistan was thought to have unofficially acknowledged the Armenian Genocide, though not proven. Uzbekistan served as transit for Armenians to transport weapons, ammunitions, and aids to Armenian forces fighting against Azerbaijani Armed Forces throughout the Nagorno-Karabakh War at 1990s. ==Today== Owned by this closeness, Armenia and Uzbekistan established official tie following the fall of USSR. This close relations was followed by Uzbekistan's embracing Armenian ethnic minority within the country, with its Armenian minority holds annual festivals in the country. There are several Armenian Churches in Uzbekistan, both are well-perceived by the host nation. Azerbaijan, a fellow Turkic nation close to Uzbekistan, has expressed its concern over Armenian activities in Uzbekistan which was believed to helping spread anti-Azerbaijani propaganda in Uzbekistan. ===Nagorno-Karabakh=== Uzbekistan has taken side on Azerbaijan over the ongoing cold war in Karabakh, but has refrained from criticisms against Armenia; instead urging Armenia and Azerbaijan to find the way to solve the problems. ==See also== *Armenians in Central Asia ==References== Uzbekistan Category:Bilateral relations of Uzbekistan ",
