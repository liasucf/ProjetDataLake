    "text": "The Lua programming language is a lightweight multi-paradigm language designed primarily for embedded systems and clients. This is a list of applications which use Lua for the purpose of extensibility. == Video games == In video game development, Lua is widely used as a scripting language by game programmers, perhaps due to its perceived easiness to embed, fast execution, and short learning curve. In 2003, a poll conducted by GameDev.net showed Lua as the most popular scripting language for game programming. On 12 January 2012, Lua was announced as a winner of the Front Line Award 2011 from the magazine Game Developer in the category Programming Tools. == Other uses == Among websites, the most popular website using Lua was HentaiHub, according to Wappalyzer.https://www.wappalyzer.com/technologies/lua Other applications using Lua include: * 3DMLW plugin uses Lua scripting for animating 3D and handling different events. * Adobe Photoshop Lightroom uses Lua for its user interface. * Aerospike Database uses Lua as its internal scripting language for its 'UDF' (User Defined Function) capabilities, similar to procedures * Apache HTTP Server can use Lua anywhere in the request process (since version 2.3, via the core mod_lua module). * Ardour hard disk recorder and digital audio workstation application uses Lua for scripting including the ability to process audio and Midi. * Artweaver graphics editor uses Lua for scripting filters. * Autodesk Stingray, a game engine which uses Lua for developing video games. * Awesome, a window manager, is written partly in Lua, also using it as its configuration file format * The Canon Hack Development Kit (CHDK), an open source firmware for Canon cameras, uses Lua as one of two scripting languages. * Celestia, the astronomy educational program, uses Lua as its scripting language. * Cheat Engine, a memory editor/debugger, enables Lua scripts to be embedded in its \"cheat table\" files, and even includes a GUI designer. * Cisco Systems uses Lua to implement Dynamic Access Policies within the Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), and also SIP normalization in Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM). * Conky, the Linux system monitoring app, uses Lua for advanced graphics. * Cocos2d uses Lua to build games with their Cocos Code IDE. * Codea is a Lua editor native to the iOS operating- system. * CRYENGINE uses Lua for user scripts. * Custom applications for the Creative Technology Zen X-Fi2 portable media player can be created in Lua. * Damn Small Linux uses Lua to provide desktop-friendly interfaces for command- line utilities without sacrificing lots of disk space. * The darktable open- source photography workflow application is scriptable with Lua. * The Daylon Leveller heightfield/terrain modeler uses embedded Lua to let plug-ins be more easily developed. * Dolphin Computer Access uses Lua scripting to make inaccessible applications accessible for visually impaired computer users with their screen reader, SuperNova. * Eyeon's Fusion compositor uses embedded Lua and LuaJIT for internal and external scripts and also plugin prototyping. * A fork of the NES emulator FCE Ultra called FCEUX allows for extensions or modifications to games via Lua scripts. * Flame, a large and highly sophisticated piece of malware being used for cyber espionage. * Foldit, a science-oriented game in protein folding, uses Lua for user scripts.
