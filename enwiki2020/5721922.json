Techotlalatzin was the first ruler of the Acolhua who actively adopted the prevailing culture of the Valley of Mexico, including the Nahuatl language.Davies (1980, p.129); Smith (1984, p.170). Smith himself further references Fernando de Alva Cort\u00e9s Ixtlilxochitl, Juan Bautista de Pomar, and Chimalpahin. The son of Quinatzin, Techotlalatzin was able to build a small Acolhua-dominated domain on the eastern side of Lake Texcoco, although this domain was apparently under the influence or even loose control of the Tepanec empire of his contemporary, Tezozomoc of Azcapotzalco. Techotlalatzin was succeeded by his son, Ixtlilxochitl I, who challenged the power of Tezozomoc and lost. Early sources for Techotlalatzin include Fray Juan de Torquemada, Fernando de Alva Cort\u00e9s Ixtlilxochitl, Juan Bautista de Pomar, and Codex Xolotl, although these sources at times present conflicting information (in fact, they are often internally inconsistent). ==Notes== ==References== * * * ==External links== * Category:Mesoamerican people Category:Texcoco (altepetl) Category:Tlatoque of Texcoco Category:Nahua people Category:1409 deaths Category:Year of birth unknown ",
