    "text": "Anna Anderson McCurley (n\u00e9e Gemmell; born 18 January 1943) is a Scottish politician. == Career == McCurley, a teacher by vocation, served as a councillor on Strathclyde Regional Council 1978\u201382. McCurley contested West Stirlingshire in 1979 and Glasgow Central in a 1980 by-election. She was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament for Renfrew West and Inverclyde in the landslide of 1983. She lost the seat to Labour candidate Tommy Graham in 1987. During her time in Parliament, she was described by The Scotsman newspaper as outspoken and formidable, and praised by her successor for her political independence and interest in her constituents. She contested the Chairmanship of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Association, the party's voluntary wing, in 1989 losing to Sir Michael Hirst, the former MP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, with whom she publicly opposed the parliamentary candidature of following a long rivalry. In 1997, she attempted to become the Conservative parliamentary candidate for the Eastwood constituency, but failed to make it to the shortlist stage, with Paul Cullen eventually taking the candidature. She explained her defeat by suggesting her \"views are more traditional Conservative than modern Conservative\". McCurley joined the Scottish Liberal Democrats in 1998 and stood as a candidate in the 1999 elections to the Scottish Parliament for Eastwood. ==References== ==Other sources== *Times Guide to the House of Commons 1983 * Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Scottish Conservative Party MPs Category:People from Renfrewshire Category:People from Stirling Category:Scottish Conservative Party councillors Category:Scottish Liberal Democrat politicians Category:Scottish schoolteachers Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Scottish constituencies Category:Female members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Scottish constituencies Category:UK MPs 1983\u20131987 Category:20th-century British women politicians ",
