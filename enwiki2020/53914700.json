    "text": "Two People was a mid-1980s British band consisting of Mark Stevenson (lead vocals/guitar) and Noel Ram (guitar/vocals). They released a number of singles between 1985 and 1987, scoring two minor hits in the UK Charts with the songs \"This is the Shirt\" and \"Heaven\". They featured on BBC Radio 1 In Concert in 1985, backed by their live band Brad Lang (bass), Ian Penman (keyboards) and Steve Creese (drums). Their record producers included Nigel Gray, Neil O'Connor and Chris Porter. They were signed to Polydor Records, but despite much promotion, their singles failed expectations and were dropped before releasing an album. In the 1990s, Noel Ram became a dance producer, performing and remixing a number of singles. == Discography == 7\" Singles: *Feb 1985 \"Rescue Me\" # \"Rescue Me\" # \"Back Into the Room of Blue\" *Apr 1985 \"This is the Shirt\" (UK No.87) # \"This is the Shirt\" # \"Sister Sister\" *Sep 1986 \"Mouth of an Angel\" # \"Mouth of an Angel\" # \"Let's Raise Murder\" *Jan 1987 \"Heaven\" (UK No.63) # \"Heaven\" # \"Run to Him\" *Apr 1987 \"This is the Shirt\" (re-issue) (UK No.98) # \"This is the Shirt\" # \"People in Love (Never Have Much Fun)\" 12\" Singles: *Feb 1985 \"Rescue Me\" # \"Rescue Me\" # \"Wonderful Thing\" # \"Back Into the Room of Blue\" # \"Broken Arms\" *Apr 1985 \"This is the Shirt\" # \"This is the Shirt\" # \"This is the Day (Part One)\" # \"Sister Sister\" # \"This is the Day (Part Two)\" *Sep 1986 \"Mouth of an Angel\" # \"Mouth of an Angel (Extended Mix)\" # \"Let's Raise Murder\" # \"Dig It\" *Jan 1987 \"Heaven\" # \"Heaven (Extended Mix)\" # \"Run to Him\" # \"Broken Arms\" == References == Category:English new wave musical groups Category:English musical duos Category:Musical groups established in 1984 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1987 Category:Musical groups from Liverpool ",
