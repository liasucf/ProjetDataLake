Both male and female same-sex sexual activity is illegal in Mauritania. Muslim men who have sex with men face stoning to death, though there have been no known cases of executions caused by homosexuality charges in the country; whereas women who have sex with women face prison. ==Law regarding same-sex sexual activity== Law in Mauritania is based in Islamic Sharia. According to the Article 308 of the 1983 Criminal Code, \"Any adult Muslim man who commits an impudent or unnatural act with an individual of his sex will face the penalty of death by public stoning\" (Rajm). Women face prison between three months to two years imprisonment, and a fine of 5,000 to 60,000 Mauritanian Ouguiya. ==Living conditions== The U.S. Department of State's 2011 human rights report found that, \"There were no criminal prosecutions during the year. There was no evidence of societal violence, societal discrimination, or systematic government discrimination based on sexual orientation. There were no organizations advocating for sexual orientation or gender-identity rights, but there were no legal impediments to the operation of such groups.\" ==Summary table== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | Same-sex sexual activity legal | No (Penalty: Execution for men, not enforced; prison and a fine for women) |- | Equal age of consent | No |- | Anti-discrimination laws in employment only | No |- | Anti-discrimination laws in the provision of goods and services | No |- | Anti-discrimination laws in all other areas (incl. indirect discrimination, hate speech) | No |- | Same-sex marriages | No |- | Recognition of same-sex couples | No |- | Stepchild adoption by same-sex couples | No |- | Joint adoption by same-sex couples | No |- | LGBT people allowed to serve openly in the military | No |- | Right to change legal gender | No |- | Access to IVF for lesbians | No |- | Commercial surrogacy for gay male couples | No |- | MSMs allowed to donate blood | No |} ==See also== *Human rights in Mauritania *LGBT rights in Africa *Capital punishment for homosexuality ==References== Mauritania Mauritania Category:LGBT in Mauritania Category:Human rights in Mauritania Category:Mauritanian law Mauritania Category:Persecution of homosexuals in Islam ",
