    "text": "Duration calculus (DC) is an interval logic for real-time systems. It was originally developed by Zhou Chaochen with the help of Anders P. Ravn and C. A. R. Hoare on the European ESPRIT Basic Research Action (BRA) ProCoS project on Provably Correct Systems.Zhou Chaochen, C. A. R. Hoare and Anders P. Ravn, A Calculus of Durations, Information Processing Letters, 40(5):269\u2013276, December 1991.Zhou Chaochen and Michael R. Hansen, Duration Calculus: A Formal Approach to Real-Time Systems. Springer-Verlag, Monographs in Theoretical Computer Science, An EATCS Series, 2003. . DC is mainly useful at the requirements level of the software development process for real-time systems. Some tools are available (e.g., DCVALID,DCVALID: A tool for model-checking Duration Calculus formulae, TIFR, India. IDLVALID,IDLVALID: Model checking dense time Duration Calculus formulae, TIFR, India. etc.). Subsets of Duration Calculus have been studied (e.g., using discrete time rather than continuous time). DC is especially espoused by UNU-IIST in Macau and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai, which are major centres of excellence for the approach. ==See also== *Interval Temporal Logic (ITL) *Temporal logic *Temporal Logic of Actions (TLA) *Modal logic ==References== ==External links== *Duration Calculus \u2014 Virtual Library entry Category:1991 introductions Category:Formal specification languages Category:Temporal logic ",
