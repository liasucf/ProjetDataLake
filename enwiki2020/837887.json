    "text": "ACC Loan Management Limited, formerly ACCBank plc, was originally a commercial bank in Ireland that focused on agriculture and SME lending, and later became a company that focussed on managing the lending facilities of its existing clients. The bank had its origins in the Agricultural Credit Corporation (Corpar\u00e1id an Chairde Talmha\u00edochta) set up in 1927 in the Irish Free State to finance agriculture; the bank was successful and led to the creation of the Industrial Credit Company, which was modelled on it and provided finance to industry. In the early 1990s, the company name was changed from \"Agricultural Credit Corporation plc\" to \"ACCBank plc\" in order to signify that the company was then targeting more than simply agricultural customers. In early 2002, the bank was sold by the Irish Government to Rabobank, it was one of the three entities of the Rabobank (Ireland). == Company history == 1927 The Agricultural Credit Corporation was founded in September 1927 and was one of the first creations of the Irish Free State. 1988 A new Agricultural Credit Act empowered the corporation to deploy up to 25% of its risk assets outside agriculture and the foundations of present-day ACCBank were laid. 2000 ACCBank refocused its business model on the SME and Agri sectors positioning the bank as a relationship bank in these sectors. 2002 ACCBank became a wholly owned subsidiary of Rabobank.Rabobank set to buy ACCBank www.independent.ie, 20 October 2001.

This meant the closure of current accounts and return of all deposits, including interest due. All Business Centres in Cork, Drogheda, Dublin, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Mullingar, Sligo and Waterford were closed to the public and the management of loan facilities was centralised instead of being dealt with the local business centres. ACCBank ceased to be a bank mid-2014 returning its banking licence but continued to manage its loan portfolio. After ACCBank returned its banking licence, it was regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland, but with an alternative status and not as a bank. Commenting on the changes, country manager Kevin Knightly for parent Rabobank found losses incurred by ACC Bank Plc because of the property crisis, a position emerging of its costs exceeding income during 2014 and that position was unsustainable for its parent, requiring immediate action to stem loses.
