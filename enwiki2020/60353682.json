Kuk Kalla, son of Kuk-Sharum, servant of Shilhaha\" The Sukkalmah Dynasty (c. 1900-1500 BCE), also Epartid Dynasty after the founder Eparti/Ebarat, was an early dynasty of West Asia in the ancient region of Elam, to the southeast of Babylonia. It corresponds to the latest part of the Old Elamite period (dated c.2700 \u2013 c. 1600 BC). The Sukkalmah dynasty followed the Shimashki Dynasty (2200-1900 BCE). The name of the dynasty comes from the name Sukkalmah meaning \"Grand regents\", the title used by Elamite rulers. Numerous cuneiform documents and inscriptions remain from this period, particularly from the area of Susa. ==The dynasty== The founder of the dynasty was a ruler named Shilhaha, who described himself as \"the chosen son of Ebarat\", who may have been the same as King Ebarti mentioned as the 9th King of the Shimashki Dynasty. Ebarat appears as the founder of the dynasty according to building inscriptions, but later kings rather seem to refer to Shilhaha in their filiation claims. The dynasty was roughly contemporary with the Old Assyrian Empire, and the Old Babylonian period in Mesopotamia. During this time, Susa was under Elamite control, but Akkadian-speaking Mesopotamian states such as Larsa and Isin continually tried to retake the city. Notable Sukkalmah dynasty rulers in Elam during this time include Sirukdukh (c. 1850), who entered into various military coalitions to contain the power of the south Mesopotamian states; Siwe-Palar-Khuppak, who for some time was the most powerful person in the area, respectfully addressed as \"Father\" by Mesopotamian kings such as Zimrilim of Mari, Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria, and even Hammurabi of Babylon; and Kudur-Nahhunte, who plundered the temples of southern Mesopotamia, the north being under the control of the Old Assyrian Empire. But Elamite influence in southern Mesopotamia did not last. Around 1760 BC, Hammurabi drove out the Elamites, overthrew Rim-Sin of Larsa, and established a short lived Babylonian Empire in Mesopotamia. Little is known about the later part of this dynasty, since sources again become sparse with the Kassite rule of Babylon (from c. 1595). ==Artifacts of the Sukkalmah== File:Baukeramik aus Iran, Susa, Wasserspeier, Sukkalmah-Periode, 1900-1600 v.C.
