    "text": "Altona refinery is an oil refinery in Victoria, Australia. It is operated by ExxonMobil. Its output is 14.5 million litres of refined oil products each day. Employing 350 staff, it is the smallest refinery in Australia, but also one of the oldest. There has been some talk of its closure, due to competition from other refineries in Asia. Output was limited during the 2020 covid-19 crises, due to weak demand. == References == Category:Oil refineries in Australia Category:Energy in Victoria (Australia) Category:ExxonMobil ",
