The founding president of the society was The Hon. Frederick Earle Winchcombe MLC. David Stead was one of four vice presidents and a very active founder of the society. The current president is Suzanne Medway, and the organisation publishes a quarterly magazine Australian Wildlife. The AWS is an all- volunteer registered, non-for-profit conservation organisation holding tax exemption status with the Australian Tax Office and is listed on the Register of Environmental Organisations. The society is totally committed to the preservation and protection of Australia's unique native fauna and flora in all its forms through national environmental education programs, community involvement, political lobbying and advocacy, as well as practical hands-on wildlife conservation projects. The society\u2019s members are dedicated to preserving Australia\u2019s native wildlife for future generations of young Australians. The society celebrated a centenary of wildlife conservation in 2009. In 2013 the WPSA was rebranded as the Australian Wildlife Society (AWS). In 2019 AWS celebrated its 110th Birthday and released a birthday video in collaboration with Design Centre Enmore TAFE New South Wales. ==Serventy Conservation Medal== The Serventy Conservation Medal was inaugurated in 1999 to commemorate conservation work by members of the Serventy family, the siblings Lucy, Dominic and Vincent Serventy.
