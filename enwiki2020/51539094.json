    "text": "Alexandru Dep\u0103r\u0103\u021beanu (February 25, 1834-January 9, 1865) was a Wallachian, later Romanian poet and playwright. Alexandru Dep\u0103r\u0103\u021beanu was a Romanian poet, politician and playwright. Born in Ro\u0219iorii de Vede, his parents were Petru Dep\u0103r\u0103\u021beanu and his wife Elisabeta (n\u00e9e Altanl\u00e2u). He studied in his native town and at Bucharest's Saint Sava College, after which he went to the University of Paris from 1856 to 1858, without earning a degree. From 1860 to 1865, Dep\u0103r\u0103\u021beanu was deputy prefect of Teleorman and T\u00e2rgului pl\u0103\u0219i, and in 1864 was a deputy to the Legislative Chamber. Dep\u0103r\u0103\u021beanu's contributions appeared in Buciumul, Seculul and Na\u021bionalul. Two books of his poetry were published in 1861: Ciocoii vechi \u0219i ciocoii noi and Doruri \u0219i amoruri. These were followed by his 1864 historical drama Grigorie Vod\u0103 \u2013 domnul Moldovei. Among the first translators from Spanish to Romanian, he worked with a few romancero texts, finding convincing equivalent terms. His poetry bears all the marks of a transitional era and suffers from the lexical uncertainties of a language under the impact of French influence. Nevertheless, pre-Eminescian and even pre-Symbolist tones are dimly perceptible. As a playwright (aside from the 1864 work, he wrote a comedy in 1852, Don Gulic\u0103 sau pantofiorii miraculo\u0219i, that was published posthumously), he shows sufficient talent for creating scenes, even managing beautiful sequences in the Romance drama style. These are comparable to the achievements of Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu and Vasile Alecsandri.Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic\u021bionarul biografic al literaturii rom\u00e2ne, vol. I, p. 478.
