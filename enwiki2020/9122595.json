The initial phase of NIT Talks covers alumni from NIT-Trichy, NIT-Warangal, and NIT-Calicut. == National Institutes of Technology== National Institutes of Technology (NITs) are colleges of engineering and technical education in India. They were originally called Regional Engineering Colleges (RECs). In 2002, the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development decided to upgrade all 17 Regional Engineering Colleges (RECs), renaming them National Institutes of Technology (NITs), on the lines of the prestigious Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs). These institutes are rated just next to the IITs in terms of student quality, research and placements. The Cabinet, at a meeting presided over by the then Prime Minister of India, Dr. Manmohan Singh, approved the proposal to introduce the National Institutes of Technology (NIT) Bill (2007) in Parliament to bring 19 such institutions within the ambit of the act. The locations of the NITs are deliberately scattered throughout the country with the government norm of an NIT in every major state of India for regional development. The individual NITs after the introduction of the NIT Act will function as an autonomous technical universities and hence draft their own curriculum and functioning policies. The mode of instruction in all NITs is English. This provides a single communication mode to students coming from diverse cultures and from all parts of country. ==Gallery== Zenith 2013 An image of Zenith 2013.
