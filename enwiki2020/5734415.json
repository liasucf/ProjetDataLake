    "text": "The Northern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic is a forest and savanna ecoregion of central Africa, part of the belt of transitional forest-savanna mosaic that lie between Africa's equatorial forests and the tropical dry forests, savannas, and grasslands that lie to the north and south. ==Geography== The Northern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic lies between the equatorial Congolian forests to the south and the drier East Sudanian savanna to the north. It extends from the Cameroon Highlands in the west, across central Cameroon and the southern Central African Republic to southwestern South Sudan and northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, where it is bounded on the east by flooded grasslands of the Sudd, the eastern block of the East Sudanian savanna, and the Albertine Rift montane forests. ==Protected areas== A 2017 assessment found that 104,288 km\u00b2, or 15%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas.Eric Dinerstein, David Olson, et al. (2017). An Ecoregion-Based Approach to Protecting Half the Terrestrial Realm, BioScience, Volume 67, Issue 6, June 2017, Pages 534\u2013545; Supplemental material 2 table S1b. Protected areas include Mbam Djerem National Park in Cameroon, Garamba National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Southern National Park in South Sudan, and Chinko Nature Reserve and Zemongo Faunal Reserve in the Central African Republic. ==External links== * ==References== Category:Afrotropic ecoregions Category:Ecoregions of Cameroon Category:Ecoregions of the Central African Republic Category:Ecoregions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Ecoregions of South Sudan Category:Ecoregions of Uganda * * * * * * * Category:Grasslands of Cameroon Category:Grasslands of the Central African Republic Category:Grasslands of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Grasslands of South Sudan Category:Grasslands of Uganda Category:Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands ",
