The EP was recorded and produced in Dublin and contains seven tracks spanning approximately 27 minutes. i think you think too much of me is the first of Ng's works to be released on physical media, as it was produced in two 12-inch vinyl formats, clear red and clear, in addition to Compact Cassette. The EP debuted at No. 43 on the Irish Albums Chart, becoming Ng's first charting album. The EP also charted in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. ==Background== The EP was announced after the conclusion of Ng's End Credits tour and release of his cover single \"Hey Ya\". As with his previous songs, the entirety of the EP was written and produced by himself. During production, he created three different versions of \"Drugs\" and two versions of \"Rock + Roll\". By contrast, \"And\" was written in \"a day or two\" and became one of the fastest songs he produced. The songs drew on a combination of past experiences. The singles \"Sex\" and \"Drugs\" were released on 10 June and 14 July 2016 respectively, with the former garnering praise from the singer Lorde who described \"Sex\" as \"messy and emotional and twitchy and kind of in love and definitely as freaked out as that situation feels.\"https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/listen-to-lorde-s-favourite-new- artist-rising-producer-eden Billboard live streamed \"Drugs\" on Facebook and released the single exclusively on their platform a day earlier than the worldwide release. The songs \"Fumes\", \"Circles\" and \"XO\" are updated versions of songs released under his old alias The Eden Project. The remastered version of \"Fumes\" features a collaboration with American musician Gnash. EDEN has stated that the EP \"is more of a realization than a journey\", while also noting that \"the songs are all intertwined, but in different ways.\" ==Promotion== In July 2016, there were reports of mysterious packages containing a virtual reality head set being sent to EDEN fans. It was later revealed that the headsets were included in the VIP packages for the Futurebound tour. On 7 September 2016, a 360-degree music video for \"Drugs\" was released. I Think You Think Too Much of Me was supported by the Futurebound Tour, which featured 33 performances in North America and Europe. ==Music videos== Three music videos were released for this album. The video for \"Sex\" was uploaded onto YouTube on 14 June 2016. The video takes place in Tokyo, Japan and Sydney, Australia. The music video for \"Drugs\" was filmed in Los Angeles and was released through YouTube on 18 August 2016.
