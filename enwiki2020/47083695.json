    "text": "Berlin Heart GmbH is a German company that develops, produces and markets ventricular assist devices (VADs). The devices mechanically support the hearts of patients with end-stage heart failure. Berlin Heart's products include the implantable INCOR VAD and the paracorporeal EXCOR VAD. To date, Berlin Heart produces the only device of its kind available for babies and children with severe heart failure.Berlin Heart VAD. Texas Children\u2019s Heart Center. Abgerufen am 25. Juni 2015. == History == Buddy Bear Berlin Heart' in front of the Head Office in Berlin In 1996, Mediport Kardiotechnik GmbH was founded by the German Heart Institute Berlin and was supported by private investors. Four years later, in 2000, Berlin Heart AG was founded after merging with its predecessor company, Mediport Kardiotechnik GmbH. The U.S. subsidiary, Berlin Heart Inc., was established in Texas in 2005. Due to a long-term private investor, Berlin Heart changed its legal structure in 2006 to a limited liability company (GmbH).Berlin Heart - History. Berlin Heart GmbH. Abgerufen am 25. Juni 2015. == Products == Berlin Heart manufactures two types of VADs: implantable and paracorporeal. INCOR is an axial-flow pump for support of the left ventricle. In this system, the pump is implanted directly next to the heart and is connected to the heart by cannula. The blood coming from the heart flows into the INCOR axial pump. The rotor in the pump has an active magnetic bearing while floating contact-free.Berlin Heart Incor . MyLVAD. Abgerufen am 25. Juni 2015. Due to the rotation, up to eight liters of blood per minute are continuously pumped through the body. A percutaneous driveline connects the pump with the external controller. The control unit and the two batteries are carried in a shoulder-bag. EXCOR is a paracorporeal, pulsatile flow VAD. The device provides left ventricular, right ventricular or biventricular assistance.VADs in Children . Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Abgerufen am 25. Juni 2015. The EXCOR system includes paracorporeal, pneumatically-driven polyurethane blood pumps. Each pump consists of a blood chamber and an air chamber which are separated by a multilayer flexible membrane. The movement of air in and out of the air chamber is controlled by a driving unit. It moves the membranes, which draw blood into the blood chamber and push it back into the body. Like the heart, EXCOR blood pumps have valves which ensure that the blood only flows in one direction. The blood pumps are connected to the heart and blood vessels via silicone cannula. The EXCOR product range covers blood pumps and cannula of various sizes and types. While EXCOR Adult is specifically designed for adults, EXCOR Pediatric includes devices for young patients (from newborns to adolescents). == Trivia == In 2018 Chloe Caldwell became the first pediatric patient to be flown for a medical treatment from the United States to Germany. Caldwell had been implanted a VAD manufactured by Berlin Heart after severe heart problems. A team of doctors at the Berlin's Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin (DHZB) removed the VAD successfully and she is expected to make a full recovery, without the need of a heart transplant. == Milestones == * In 1996, the EXCOR Stationary Driving Unit Ikus received CE approval. * In 1999, the EXCOR mobile driving unit received CE approval. * In 2000, the first child in the USA is supported by EXCOR Pediatric.Berlin Heart, Inc.
