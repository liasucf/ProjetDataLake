He represented Finist\u00e8re's 1st constituency in the National Assembly of France from 2007 to 2016, as a member of the Socialiste, radical, citoyen et divers gauche. ==Early life and education== Jean-Jacques Urvoas was born on 19 September 1959 in Brest. His father was a pharmacist general in the army. He describes himself as having been \"a real dunce\" at school. He studied, in turn, law at the University of Western Brittany in Brest, political science at the University of Rennes I, and political communication at Paris I. He turn proceeded to the Sorbonne where he wrote a dissertation on politicians Michel Rocard and Simone Veil. In 1996, he returned to Brest, where he earned a doctorate in political science with a thesis entitled \"Electoral Table of Western Brittany, 1973-1993\" and written under the direction of Jacques Baguenard. ==Career== In 1998, he became a lecturer in public law at the University of Western Brittany and the Brest Institute for General Administration (IPAG Brest). He taught constitutional law and political science in the law training and research unit (UFR). Since his election to the French National Assembly, he has been seconded from the public service. He joined the French Socialist Party (PS) for the first time in 1977 but left it because he was disappointed by the lack of an \"epic breath.\" He returned to it intermittently, however, until 1981. From 1984 to 1986, while he was a student, he worked as a parliamentary assistant in the National Assembly. In 1986, he became director of the Mutualit\u00e9 Finistere and in 1989, Bernard Poignant, who had been elected mayor of Quimper, asked him to become the director of his cabinet.Libert\u00e9s \u2013 Egalit\u00e9s (1/4) : \u00ab Un d\u00e9put\u00e9, pour quoi faire ? \u00bb; France Culture; Poignant-Urvoas.

In the spring of 2015, in a report to the Prime Minister, he opposed the reinstatement of the crime of \"national indignity\" to punish terrorists, which he saw as a \"secularization of excommunication\" that would only serve to strengthen the \"jihadist martyrology.\" In a May 2015 note to the Jean Jaur\u00e8s Foundation, he called for greater autonomy for the prosecutor's office vis-\u00e0- vis the executive branch and pleaded for constitutional reform that would strengthen judiciary independence.
