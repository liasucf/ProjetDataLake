To ensure the program was appropriate, every action made by mouse caused something to happen on screen as well the implementation of large pictures, visible motions, catchy music and bright colors. ===Educational Goals=== The game was designed to allow infants to interact with a computer without too much work, piquing their curiosity and stimulating them all the while forming a bond with parents. Implemented in the game were the elements of creativty, visual patterning and basic computer skills. Potentially the game could promote a baby's speech, language, growth, emotional development, social development and physical development. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Children's educational video games Category:The Learning Company games Category:1999 video games Category:Reader Rabbit Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Mac OS games ",
