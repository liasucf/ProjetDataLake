    "text": "Twelve Little Preludes (French: Douze petits Pr\u00e9ludes; German: '), BWV 924\u2013930, 939\u2013942 and 999, is a 19th-century compilation of short pieces, collected from various 18th-century manuscripts written by Johann Sebastian Bach and others. Notwithstanding their diverse origin and characteristics, they were published as a set of twelve keyboard preludes by Bach in, amongst others, the 36th volume of the Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe (BGA). Several collections of short keyboard preludes by Bach were published for didactic purposes from the 19th century. In the 20th century Ferruccio Busoni combined the Twelve Little Preludes with the Six Little Preludes, BWV 933\u2013938 into a set of 18 little preludes. ==History== Collections of short keyboard preludes by Johann Sebastian Bach had been around since the 18th century. For instance the Six Little Preludes, BWV 933\u2013938 are found as a group of six in manuscripts before they were published as a set in the 19th century.D-B Mus. ms. Bach P 528 and D-B Mus. ms.

LX The date of origin of the pieces in the Twelve Little Preludes collection is presumed to be around the first half of the 1720s, that is the period of Bach's later years in K\u00f6then and his first years in Leipzig, where he had become Thomaskantor in 1723. In January 1720 he had started the Klavierb\u00fcchlein (keyboard-booklet) for his eldest son Wilhelm Friedemann, who was nine years old at that time. ===Pieces from Wilhelm Friedemann Bach's Klavierb\u00fcchlein=== Seven of the Twelve Little Preludes were adopted from Wilhelm Friedemann's Klavierb\u00fcchlein:Alfred D\u00f6rffel, editor.

BWV 929 is not actually a Prelude: it is a Trio composed for a Minuet by Gottfried Heinrich St\u00f6lzel. All other pieces extracted from W. F. Bach's Klavierb\u00fcchlein are titled \"Praeambulum\" or \"Praeludium\" (both Latin expressions translated as \"Prelude\") in the manuscript. Together with BWV 931 and 932 (Nos. 29 and 28 in the Klavierb\u00fcchlein) this set is also known as (nine little preludes from the keyboard-booklet for Wilhelm Friedemann Bach).BWV2a (1998), p. 391 Other preludes contained in the Klavierb\u00fcchlein: * No. 3: chorale prelude Wer nur den lieben Gott l\u00e4sst walten, BWV 691 (also included in the Kirnberger Collection of chorale preludes, and as No. 11 in the 1725 Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach) * No. 5: chorale prelude Jesu, meine Freude, BWV 753 (unfinished) * Nos. 14\u201324: Praeludium 1\u2013[11], BWV 846a, 847/1, 851/1, 850/1, 855a/1, 854/1, 856/1, 848/1, 849/1, 853/1 and 857/1. These are (early versions of) preludes that were adopted, in a different sequence, in the Well-Tempered Clavier Book I, Nos. 1\u20136 and 8\u201312. * No. 26: \"Praeludium ex c\u266e\", BWV 924a (variant version of BWV 924) * Nos. 32\u201346: Praeambulum 1\u201315, BWV 772, 775, 778, 779, 781, 784, 786, 785, 783, 782, 780, 777, 776, 774 and 773. These are better known, in a different sequence, as the fifteen Two-part Inventions The first pieces entered in the Klavierb\u00fcchlein, including BWV 924 and 926, would have originated around 1720 (although at least some of it was apparently based on earlier work). Pieces were added to the manuscript until 1726. ===From the Five Little Preludes=== In the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (BWV) Nos. 939\u2013943 appear under the title \"F\u00fcnf kleine Pr\u00e4ludien\" (Five Little Preludes). P 804, Fascicle 53, a manuscript by an unknown scribe, is the only 18th-century source for BWV 939\u2013942. While this source does not mention a composer for these pieces, the attribution to Bach has been doubted.BWV2a (1998), p. 393BDW BDW BDW BDW 5 Kleine Pr\u00e4ludien, BWV 939-943 (Bach, Johann Sebastian) at IMSLP website * BWV 939 (Five Little Preludes No. 1) \u2192 Twelve Little Preludes No. 2 * BWV 940 (Five Little Preludes No. 2) \u2192 Twelve Little Preludes No. 6 * BWV 941 (Five Little Preludes No. 3) \u2192 Twelve Little Preludes No. 7 * BWV 942 (Five Little Preludes No. 4) \u2192 Twelve Little Preludes No. 12 The P 804 manuscript contained these four pieces in a different order, also containing a copy of BWV 927 (which is the only direct link to J. S. Bach, and to the preludes contained in the Klavierb\u00fcchlein, for Fascicle 53): BWV 940, 941, 939, 927, 942. 1726\u201327 is the assumed date of origin of BWV 939\u2013942. BWV 943 was printed after the Six Little Preludes in the BGA edition, so was never a part of the Twelve Little Preludes collection. ===Prelude for Lute, BWV 999=== According to its only extant 18th-century manuscript the Prelude in C minor, BWV 999 is a piece composed for lute:BDW 300px300px This prelude was added as No. 3 to the Twelve Little Preludes. Its composition date is estimated as 1717\u201323. Its 18th-century manuscript, Fascicle 19 of P 804, is a copy by Johann Peter Kellner, produced around the middle of the 1720s or later.Prelude in C minor, BWV 999 (Bach, Johann Sebastian) at IMSLP website ==Publication== Peters published the Twelve Little Preludes in 1843 as \"Douze petits Pr\u00e9ludes ou Exercices pour les commen\u00e7ans\", No. 16 in their 9th volume of Bach's complete (keyboard) works, edited by Friedrich Konrad Griepenkerl.Friedrich Konrad Griepenkerl, editor.

F. Bach's handwriting. It was probably part of the composition lessons he got from his father.BDW ==Reception== Collections of Bach's Little Preludes were republished as didactical material for starting piano students, for instance at the Conservatoire Royal de Bruxelles., editor. Petits Pr\u00e9ludes pour les commen\u00e7ants pour Piano par J. S. Bach: Nouvelle \u00c9dition revue, doigt\u00e9e et annot\u00e9e in R\u00e9pertoire du Conservatoire Royal de Bruxelles. Schott Fr\u00e8res, [1884] (contains BWV 924, 926, 928, 930, 933, 934, 938, 939, 941 and 942) Ferruccio Busoni combined the Twelve Little Preludes and the Six Little Preludes in a set of 18 kleine Pr\u00e4ludien (18 Short Preludes), followed by the Fughetta, BWV 961, which were published as part of the Bach-Busoni Editions in 1916 . When Wolfgang Schmieder compiled the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (first published in 1950) he split the Twelve Little Preludes in three BWV number ranges: BWV 924\u2013930 for the Klavierb\u00fcchlein preludes (as part of the Nine Little Preludes, BWV 924\u2013932), BWV 939\u2013942 for the P 804 Fascicle 53 preludes (as part of the Five Little Preludes, BWV 939\u2013942) and BWV 999 in the range of the works for lute (BWV 995\u20131000). Nonetheless, instead of following the collation of the original manuscripts for the keyboard works, he adhered to the 19th-century Twelve Little Preludes collation for both keyboard ranges and kept the \"Trio\" BWV 929 listed as a prelude in his catalogue. The 19th-century compilation set of the Twelve Little Preludes kept its presence as a collection of piano pieces in music printing and performance in the second half of the 20th century,Hans Bischoff (editor).
