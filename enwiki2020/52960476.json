    "text": "Maurizio de Giovanni (born March 31, 1958 in Napoli) is an Italian author of mystery novels. Marizio de Giovanni == Biography == Maurizio de Giovanni was born in Naples in 1958; he has spent the majority of his life living and working there. In 2005 he decided to join a Porsche Italia competition reserved for giallo novelists, and that's where he came up with the character of Commissario Ricciardi, main protagonist of his first short story, \u201cI vivi e I morti\u201d. This was the start of his career as a writer. Subsequently, \u201cI Vivi e i morti\u201d served as an inspiration for \u201cLe lacrime del pagliaccio\u201d (later re- published as \u201cI will have vengeance - The winter of commissario Ricciardi\u201d), edited by Graus Editore. With the publishing of this very novel, the chronicles of Commissario Ricciardi had officially begun. In 2007 Fandango published \u201cI will have vengeance - The winter of commissario Ricciardi\u201d, his first work inspired to the 4 seasons of the year. Following this, in 2008,\u201dBlood curse - The springtime of commissario Ricciardi\u201d was released. In 2009 it was time for \u201cEveryone in their place - The summer of commissario Ricciardi\u201d and finally, in 2010, \u201cThe day of the dead - The autumn of commissario Ricciardi\u201d made his appearance in the bookstores. He started to gain a wider audience and made a name for himself because of this series. In 2011 he had his first book published by Einaudi, \u201cBy my hand - A commissario Ricciardi mystery\u201d. In 2012 he went down the path of the noir genre and he managed to come up with a book titled \u201cThe Crocodile\u201d, that marked the first appearance on the scenes of the new main character of his novels, Ispettore Lojacono. In the same year, together with Einaudi, he published the pocket version of the seasons\u2019 novels and the brand new \u201cViper - A commissario Ricciardi mystery\u201d. In 2013 he's back on the scenes with \u201cThe Bastards of Pizzofalcone\u201d, inspired by the 87th Precinct series from Ed McBain. This marked his transition from the noir genre to the police procedural. Shortly after he wrote \u201cDarkness for the Bastards of Pizzofalcone\u201d. These novels will be transformed into a TV show. In the same month when he completed \u201cDarkness\u201d, his short story \u201cUn giorno di Settembre a Natale\u201d, contained in the anthology \u201cRegalo di Natale\u201d, was published by the editor Sellerio. 2014 was a very prolific year for Maurizio. Not only 15 of his best noir stories were released in the anthology called \u201cMani insanguinate\u201d, he also had two new novels published, \u201cBottom of your heart\u201d (by Einaudi) and \u201cGelo per i bastardi di Pizzofalcone\u201d. In 2015 \u201cGlass souls\u201d,the 8th installment in the Ricciardi's series, was released. In the same year, he appeared at an event at the Italian Cultural Institute in Edinburgh, in conversation with academic Raffaella Ocone discussing the success of the detective story. In 2016 he had both \u201cSerenata senza nome. Notturno per il commissario Ricciardi. and \u201cPane per i Bastardi di Pizzofalcone\u201d published.
