    "text": "State Farm Stadium, formerly known as University of Phoenix Stadium, is a multi-purpose stadium in the western United States, located in Glendale, Arizona, west of Phoenix. It is the home of the Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL) and the annual Fiesta Bowl. It replaced Tempe's Sun Devil Stadium as the Valley of the Sun's main stadium. The stadium is adjacent to the Gila River Arena, home of the Arizona Coyotes NHL team. The stadium has hosted the Fiesta Bowl, 2007 and 2011 BCS National Championship Games, 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship, Super Bowl XLII in 2008, the Pro Bowl and Super Bowl XLIX in 2015, and will host Super Bowl LVII in 2023. For soccer, it was one of the stadiums for the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup also the first semi-final of the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup and the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario in 2016. For basketball, it hosted the NCAA Final Four in 2017, which is scheduled to return in 2024. The University of Phoenix acquired the naming rights in September 2006, shortly after the stadium had opened under the name Cardinals Stadium and retained the rights until September 2018, when the Cardinals and insurance company State Farm reached an agreement on an 18-year commitment to call it State Farm Stadium. ==Facility information and history== Since moving to Arizona from St. Louis, Missouri in 1988, the Cardinals had played at Sun Devil Stadium on the campus of Arizona State University in Tempe. The Cardinals planned to play there for only a few years, until a new stadium could be built in Phoenix. However, the savings and loan crisis derailed funding for a new stadium during the 1990s. Over time, the Cardinals expressed frustration at being merely tenants in a college football stadium. The lack of having their own stadium denied them additional revenue streams available to other NFL teams. The Cardinals campaigned several times in the years prior to its construction for a new and more modern facility. The ceremonial groundbreaking for the new stadium in 2003 was held on April 12, and after three years of construction, the 63,400-seat venue opened on August 1, 2006. It was designed by Eisenman Architects and HOK Sport (now Populous).Stadium Statistics The stadium is considered an architectural icon for the region and was named by Business Week as one of the ten \u201cmost impressive\u201d sports facilities on the globe due to the combination of its retractable roof (engineering design by Walter P Moore) and roll-in natural grass field, similar to the GelreDome and the Veltins-Arena.World-Class Sports Stadiums: BusinessWeek LED video and ribbon displays from Daktronics in Brookings, South Dakota were installed in 2006 prior to Arizona's first game of the season at the new stadium. The cost of the project was $455 million, which included $395.4 million for the stadium, $41.7 million for site improvements, and $17.8 million for the land. Contributors to the stadium included the Arizona Sports and Tourism Authority ($302.3 million), the Arizona Cardinals ($143.2 million), and the City of Glendale ($9.5 million). The playing field outside and lined for the Arizona Cardinals. The interior of State Farm Stadium with field removed. To protect the stadium's grass playing surface, non-sporting events are always held with the facility in this configuration. The stadium has 88 luxury suites -- called luxury lofts -- with space for 16 future suites as the stadium matures. The surrounding the stadium is called Sportsman's Park. Included within the Park is an landscaped tailgating area called the Great Lawn. The approximate elevation at field level is above sea level. There are no obstructed view seats in the stadium. There are visible areas in the upper deck of the end zone where seats could have been put in but were not due to the giant super columns supporting the roof structure. Cardinals win NFC Championship, January 18, 2009 The stadium seating capacity can be expanded by 8,800 for \"mega-events\" such as college bowls, NFL Super Bowls, the NFC Championship Game, and the Final Four by adding risers and ganged, portable \"X-frame\" folding seats. The endzone area on the side of the facility where the field tray rolls in and out of the facility can be expanded to accommodate the additional seats. The roof is made out of translucent Birdair fabric and opens in 12 minutes. It is the first retractable roof ever built on an incline. ==Events== The roof of State Farm Stadium.
