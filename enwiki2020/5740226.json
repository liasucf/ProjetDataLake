Upon his arrival, he was quickly turned away once they realized he was Black and did not want him on camera. In order to provide for his family he became an insurance agent, barber, and took a sales job at National Clothing Company. One of his most prominent clients at National Clothing Company was Xerox founder, Joseph Wilson. Wilson and Langston became good friends over time and would talk about a number of topics. One topic being, Langston's dream of starting his own radio station. Due to the poor treatment of Black people, race riots, and lack of proper news coverage Langston wanted to create a vehicle to give the unheard a voice. Wilson believed in Langston's dream and promised him a space atop the Xerox tower, the highest building in Rochester, for his antenna once he solidified ownership of the station. Their agreement was written on a napkin. In 1968, Langston went to Washington, D.C. to meet with the FCC to apply for his license to broadcast on the available frequency 103.9 MHz. After six years, WDKX commenced broadcasting at 5:30 a.m. on April 6, 1974. Wilson kept his promise and the WDKX antenna was placed on top of the Xerox Tower where it still stands today. Langston chose the call letters DKX with intention, standing for influential Black community leaders \u2013 Fredrick Douglass, Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X. Andrew A. Langston, received the \"Rochester Radio Broadcaster of the Year\" Award, the National Association of Black Owned Broadcasters \"Pioneer\" Award, and was inducted to the \"New York State Broadcasters Hall of Fame\" inaugural class for his contributions to the broadcasting industry.
