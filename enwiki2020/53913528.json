It is a Category A listed building. ==History== Holy Trinity Church (also known as the Holy Trinity Parish Church or \"town kirk\") is the most historic church in St Andrews.Lamont-Brown St Andrews \u2013 City by The Northern Sea p.171. The church was initially built on land close to the south-east gable of the cathedral, around 1144 by Bishop Robert Kennedy. The church was dedicated in 1234 by Bishop David de Bernham and then moved to a new site on the north side of South Street between 1410\u20131412 by Bishop Wardlaw.Pride Kingdom of Fife pp.124\u2013126. Towards the end of June 1547, this was the location where John Knox first preached in public and to which he returned to give an inflammatory sermon on 4 June 1559 which led to the stripping of both the cathedral and ecclesiastical status.Lamont- Brown St Andrews \u2013 City by The Northern Sea p.173.Lamont-Brown Fife in History and Legend p.81. Much of the architecture feature of the church was lost in the re-building by Robert Balfour between 1798\u20131800.Fife Regional Council Medieval Abbeys and Historic Churches in Fife p.46. The church was later restored to a (more elaborately decorated) approximation of its medieval appearance between 1907\u20131909 by MacGregor Chalmers.Cook Old St Andrews p.14. Only the north-western tower and spire with parts of the arcade arches were retained. ==References== Bibliography * * * * ==External links== * Church website Category:Church of Scotland churches in Scotland Category:St Andrews Category:Category A listed buildings in Fife ",
