The road runs a total distance of , in a roughly east\u2013west direction, and is both urban and rural in character. It begins near Churchtown south of Garstang and just east of Catterall, as a junction on the A6 Preston Lancaster New Road, immediately to the north of Kirkland Bridge. It runs as a winding rural single-lane road south west to St Michael's on Wyre, where it crosses the River Wyre. Becoming Garstang Road, it runs west, bypassing Great Eccleston and Little Eccleston, and sharing with the A585 as Garstang New Road between Larbreck and Little Singleton, about past St Michael's On Wyre. This is a wider, straighter stretch of road. The road splits from the A585 after approximately , at the Five Lane Ends in Little Singleton, and enters the outskirts of Poulton-le-Fylde as Garstang Road East. From here, the road becomes progressively more urban.
