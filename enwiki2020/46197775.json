The gearbox is usually incorporated into the frame near the crank, and it may be used in addition to or instead of derailleur gears or a hub gear. Cited advantages include improved shifting performance, protecting the gearing from damage and exposure to dirt and moisture, as with hub gears, plus locating the additional mass between the two wheels and on the frame where it may be suspended, unlike with hub gears. == History == Patents for built-in systems to change gear ratios appeared as early as 1890. Adler offered a three-speed gearbox bicycle in the 1930s. Several attempts to develop gearbox bicycles during the 2000s for downhill racing, such as the Honda RN-01 G-cross, incorporated complete derailleur gear drive trains in an enclosure. Around the same time Schlumpf Innovations and Hammerschmidt offered cranksets with two different gear ratios and just one chainring. Pinion launched their spur-gear system in the 2010s. == Methods == At least three different gearing techniques have been employed. *Epicyclic gears, as in hub gears. *Spur gears, as in most automobile transmissions. *Derailleur gears, as on many bicycles, but fully enclosed. == See also == *Bicycle drivetrain systems == Gallery == File:Pinion P1.18 interior.jpg|Pinion P1.18 gearbox interior File:Schlumpf Speed Drive bottom bracket.JPG|Schlumpf Speed Drive File:Britannica Bicycle Sunbeam Two-Speed Gear.jpg|Diagram of the Sunbeam two- speed gear for a bicycle (part of the crank) assembly from the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Vol. 3, p. 916 File:L-Variand.png|Image from the Lexikon der gesamten Technik (dictionary of technology) from 1904 by Otto Lueger File:Adler geared bottom bracket 1936.jpg|Adler gearbox with 3 gears from 1936 File:Motaped2.jpg|Mutaped gearbox external view File:Mutaped.jpg|Mutaped gearbox internal view == References == Category:Cycle types Drivetrain drivetrains ",
