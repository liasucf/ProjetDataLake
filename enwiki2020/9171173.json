Although Thailand made peace with the Japanese after being invaded, there was an active underground movement. One prisoner recalls Boonpong was the merchant with the lowest prices and the smallest mark up. However he performed other services risking his life and those of his family. He lent money, provided extra medicines and ran messages. With access to medicines, the death rate of the prisoners was reduced from five a day in May 1943 to one a week by the following November. ==Post-war== After the war, Boonpong was attacked by Thai police in some mistaken retribution. Sir Edward \"Weary\" Dunlop, another hero of the POW camps, ordered a report on 'the condition of Mr. Boonpong, injured Thai civilian, who had done so much for prisoners of war.\u2019 In 1947 he was in financial difficulties and so a POW association on hearing of it organised a collection for him. Shortly thereafter, Boonpong started the Boonpong Bus Company. In 1948 he was awarded the MBE by the British Government.Biography Later an Australian medical scholarship was named in honor of him and Sir Edward Dunlop. The documentary film \u201cThe Quiet Lions\u201d is about both of them. Boonpong also figures prominently in Beyond the Bamboo Screen, a collection of anecdotes by Scottish PoWs. ==In popular culture== Ruangsak \"James\" Loychusak portrayed Boonpong Sirivejjabhandu in Boon Pong a thai television soap opera based on him. Boon Pong was broadcast on Thai PBS from 8 May 2013 to 20 June 2013. ==See also== *Philip Toosey ==References== * BOOKS: Three cheers for the colonel * Sort of a Cricket Person by E. W.
