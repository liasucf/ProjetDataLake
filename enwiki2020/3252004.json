    "text": "The pirates prepare the Black Spot; N. C. Wyeth, 1911 The Black Spot is a literary device invented by Robert Louis Stevenson for his novel Treasure Island (serialized 1881\u201382, published as a book in 1883). In the book, pirates are presented with a \"black spot\" to officially pronounce a verdict of guilt or judgement. It consists of a circular piece of paper or card, with one side blackened while the other side bears a message and placed in the hand of the accused.The fullest description is in chapter 29 of the book where the narrator describes still having Silver's Black Spot in his possession. It was a source of much fear because it meant the pirate was to be deposed as leader, by force if necessary\u2014or else killed outright. In Treasure Island, Billy Bones is much frightened by it but remains determined to outwit his enemies; however, he suffers a stroke caused by the overconsumption of liquor and is killed by the blind beggar (Pew). Billy Bones receives the spot - chapter 3 Later Long John Silver receives the spot, but is calm enough to notice that the paper bearing the spot has been torn out from a Bible, and warns his associates of the bad luck this will bring upon them. Long John Silver receives the spot from Morgan - chapter 29 The words on the back of that black spot were spookily from Revelation, like an allusion to the beast's mark and judgement day i.e. Chapter 29: ==Origins== The origin of Stevenson's Black Spot might be in the historical tradition of Caribbean pirates of showing an Ace of Spades to a person condemned as traitor or informer. The card was putting the person dangerously \"on the spot\", as the ace bears a single pip. ==Appearances in other works== The Black Spot has since been used in other works of popular culture: Listed chronologically: *1930: In the novel Swallows and Amazons the pirate captain called Uncle Jim (James Turner, also known as Captain Flint) receives the Black Spot from Nancy, a member of his crew. *1938: In the film Algiers Regis draws the ace of spades when forced to cut the deck.
