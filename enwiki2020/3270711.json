    "text": "Marcellinus Comes (died c. 534) was a Latin chronicler of the Eastern Roman Empire. An Illyrian by birth, he spent most of his life at the court of Constantinople. His only surviving work, the Chronicle, focuses on the Eastern Roman Empire. ==Chronicle== Only one work of his survives, a chronicle (Annales), which was a continuation of Eusebius's Ecclesiastical History. It covers the period from 379 to 534, although an unknown writer added a continuation down to 566. Although his work is in Latin, it primarily describes the affairs of the Eastern Roman Empire. Some information about Western Europe, drawn from Orosius's Historia adversus paganos and Gennadius' De viris illustribus, is introduced insofar as it relates to Constantinople. The chronicle is filled with details and anecdotes about the city and the court. Marcellinus was Orthodox and has little good to say about heretics in his work. ==References== ==Sources== * ==Literature== *The Chronicle of Marcellinus: a translation and commentary, by Brian Croke (translation/commentary) and Theodor Mommsen (edition).
