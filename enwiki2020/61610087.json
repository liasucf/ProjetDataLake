At Metacritic, the album received an average score of 79, based on 10 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 6.9 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus. Album of the Year assessed the critical consensus as 71 out of 100, based on eight reviews. Danny Wright of NME gave the album a positive review, saying \"he's able to skillfully cherry pick from different genres[, ...] But Post Malone is the post everything star the kids have called for, a musician made for the internet-age; a goofball chameleon instinctively skilled at understanding the ways genres can merge together. These are albums made as playlists that skip seamlessly between styles.\" Reviewing the album for Variety, A. D. Amorosi said the album was a blend of \"country, rock, hip-hop and modern soft soul\" and that Malone gives the album a \"refined trap-pop vibe.\" Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic saying \"More well-executed than his previous releases and undeniably catchy, Hollywood's Bleeding is a huge step forward for the guarded superstar, one that doesn't sacrifice the essential elements that made him such a surprise hitmaker, and pushes him even further into the pop-savvy landscape where he belongs.\" Writing for Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood stated, \"Unlike Stoney and Beerbongs & Bentleys, this album feels composed of discrete stylistic exercises; no longer is he boiling down rap and rock and a little bit of country into a kind of smearable paste.\" Rolling Stones critic Nick Catucci said, \"Post Malone curates as much as he creates, and there's not a misplaced feature among the 10 spread across seven of these tracks.\" Dan Weiss of Consequence of Sound wrote, \"Hollywood's Bleeding is immediately Post Malone's most listenable work and may well be the catchiest album you hear in 2019, and that includes Taylor Swift.\" Daniel Spielberger of HipHopDX said, \"Besides a few questionable features, there's nothing offensive or particularly bad about Hollywood's Bleeding. It's just Malone playing it safe and betting on the likelihood that the streaming algorithms will reward him once again.\" Jason Greene from Pitchfork stated, \"When he's not wasting time trying to glower, he proves himself surprisingly versatile. ... There are a lot of guests on Hollywood's Bleeding, and all of them sound engaged.\" ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |+Year-end lists |- ! scope=\"col\"| Publication ! scope=\"col\"| List ! scope=\"col\"| Rank ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Billboard | 50 Best Albums of 2019 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Complex | Best Albums of 2019 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| NME | The 50 Best Albums of 2019 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Rolling Stone | 50 Best Albums of 2019 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| Uproxx | The Best Albums of 2019 | | |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |+Awards for Hollywood's Bleeding |- ! scope=\"col\"| Year ! scope=\"col\"| Award ! scope=\"col\"| Category ! scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| 2019 | American Music Awards | Favorite Album \u2013 Rap/Hip-Hop | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\"| 2020 | rowspan=\"2\"| Billboard Music Awards | Top Billboard 200 Album | | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Top Rap Album | |- | Juno Awards | International Album of the Year | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |} ==Commercial performance== Hollywood's Bleeding debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with 489,000 album-equivalent units, of which 200,000 were pure album sales, giving Post Malone his second US number-one album.
