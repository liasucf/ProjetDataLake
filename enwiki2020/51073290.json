The tabloid Iltalehti broke the story on Wednesday, July 13, 2016, reporting that at least one woman who worked for Viinanen in Sweden had left her job earlier that year. The paper then attempted to contact the ambassador; he replied that he was on holiday and would not release any comments on the matter. Foreign Minister Timo Soini stated that his ministry was investigating the incident and commented that Wednesday in Pori that he hoped to have the matter resolved by the time he met with the Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstr\u00f6m in about one month from then. On August 26, 2016, Finnish President Sauli Niinist\u00f6 had officially recalled Viinanen to Finland as a result of the scandal over the alleged sexual harassment. == References == Category:People from Imatra Category:Permanent Representatives of Finland to the United Nations Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Ambassadors of Finland to Sweden Category:Finnish officials of the United Nations Category:Chairmen and Presidents of UNICEF ",
