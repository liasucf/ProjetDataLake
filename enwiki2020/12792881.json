The original building was located on a hilltop surrounded by vegetable farms along Choa Chu Kang Road. It was realized through the joint effort of the Muslim community residing in that area and the former Minister of State, Dr Haji Yaacob Mohammad. Originally it was called the Jamek Mosque but subsequently renamed officially as Al-Khair in 1963. In 1995, it was relocated and rebuilt into the majestic building that landmark the entrance to Teck Whye Crescent of today. The new building, completed in 1997, was the first mosque to be built in Phase 3 of the Mosque Building Fund programme and the 17th overall since the programme started in 1975. It is noted for its senior citizens group called Sohibul Khair which organizes activities such as morning exercise and talks on living a healthy old age. In 2017, Masjid Al Khair was renovated, with the addition of a new prayer hall on the third floor. Improvements were made to the roof, electrical system, and the facade.
