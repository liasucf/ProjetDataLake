The telenovela lasted 103 episodes and was distributed internationally by RCTV International. Roxana D\u00edaz and Carlos Montilla starred as the main protagonists with Maricarmen Regueiro, Franklin Virg\u00fcez and Carolina Tejera as antagonists. ==Plot== Gabriel discovers his father has been murdered, and the suspected killer is Monserrat Vallemor\u00edn (alias Moncho), a powerful man in the underworld of organized crime, his family's enemy and the supposed godfather of Avril. Gabriel decides to take revenge for his father Ulises Santuario by focusing on Monserrat's two loves: Marbella, his foster daughter and Avril. Avril is a young medical doctor struggling to find a job, but she refuses Monserrat's help as she suspects his illegal businesses. Monserrat takes an interest in Avril and tries to show her affection in every way possible, arousing the jealousy of Marbella who feels her foster father loves Avril more than her, and she decides to make Avril suffer. Unknown to Marbella, Avril is actually Monserrat's biological daughter from his past relationship with Thania Guzm\u00e1n. Monserrat took Avril as a baby from Thania and gave her to Antonio Zurli, an Italian immigrant who fled the mafia and whom Monserrat helped to change identity and settle in Venezuela where he hired him as his gardener. Moncho hides Avril's true identity to prevent his enemies and his wife's family from harming her. On the other hand, Thania had another child with Moncho but hid the truth from him fearing he'd take her away. She gave the child, Adriana, to another family. Under a false name, Gabriel integrates himself into the lives of Marbella and Avril as he plots his revenge, but he never expected to fall madly in love with Avril. ==Cast== *Roxana D\u00edaz as Avril Zurli Gavazzeni *Carlos Montilla as Gabriel Enrique Santuario Moro *Maricarmen Regueiro as Yerman\u00ed Vallemor\u00edn / Yerman\u00ed Burgos Urquia *Franklin Virg\u00fcez as Montserrat Vallemor\u00edn Mart\u00ednez *Carlos C\u00e1mara Jr. as Antonio Zurli *Carolina Tejera as Marbella Vallemor\u00edn *Carlos M\u00e1rquez as Felipe Vallemor\u00edn *Dalila Colombo as Esmeralda Aquino / Thania Guzm\u00e1n *F\u00e9lix Loreto as Ulises Santuario Cede\u00f1a *Chantal Baudaux as Adriana Libordo *Gabriel Fern\u00e1ndez as Tito Santuario *Manuel Salazar as Domingo Libordo *Francis Rueda as Esther Moro de Santuario *Alberto Rowinski as Erasmo de la Franchesca *Leopoldo Regnault as Dr. Gregorio Alem\u00e1n *Mart\u00edn Lantigua as \u00c1lvaro Burgos Caicedo *Ver\u00f3nica Ort\u00edz as Valentina \u00c1vila *Estefan\u00eda L\u00f3pez as Melani Santuario *Jer\u00f3nimo Gil as H\u00e9ctor Coronel *Reina Hinojosa as Messalina *Ver\u00f3nica Cort\u00e9z as Tarcisia de Zurli *Violeta Alem\u00e1n as Martha Forero *Enrique Izquierdo as Santiago Santuario *Jeanette Flores as Marisol Santana *Samuel Gonz\u00e1lez as Humberto \"Kiko\" Zurli *Marianela Gonz\u00e1lez as Marni Zurli *Sandy Olivares as Omar Santuario'' *Magaly Serrano as Versuka Santuario ==References== ==External links== * Category:2001 telenovelas Category:RCTV telenovelas Category:Venezuelan telenovelas Category:2001 Venezuelan television series debuts Category:2001 Venezuelan television series endings Category:Spanish-language telenovelas Category:Television shows set in Caracas ",
