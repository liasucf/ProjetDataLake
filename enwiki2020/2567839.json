    "text": "Inside I'm Dancing, also released under the title Rory O'Shea Was Here, is an Irish 2004 comedy-drama film directed by Damien O'Donnell and starring James McAvoy, Steven Robertson, Romola Garai, and Brenda Fricker. The film revolves around two disabled young men who pursue physical and emotional independence in direct defiance of \"protective\" institutional living and their society's prevailing standards and attitudes, especially pity. Rory O'Shea is always mean towards Michael and later helps him get out of the nursing home The production was filmed in Dublin and Wicklow and involved production companies Working Title Films and StudioCanal with assistance from the Irish Film Board (Bord Scann\u00e1n na h\u00c9ireann). The two lead actors in this film do not actually have physical disabilities, leading some to criticise it for casting non- disabled actors in to disability roles. This criticism is especially poignant given that the character of Michael is portrayed as having a rather pronounced version of athetoid cerebral palsy when in fact the actor who portrays him is entirely physically able. ==Plot== Michael Connolly is a 24-year-old with cerebral palsy who is a long-term resident of the Carrigmore Residential Home for the Disabled run by the formidable Eileen. His life, mundane and schedule- driven by the institution's authorities, is transformed when the maverick Rory O'Shea, who suffers from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, suddenly moves in. Michael is stunned to discover that fast talking Rory, prone to lewd and/or overt jokes at unpredictable intervals, and who can move only his right hand, can understand his almost unintelligible speech. Rory's dynamic and rebellious nature soon sparks a flame in Michael, introducing him to the wider world outside of Carrigmore. On a day out in Dublin led by Carrigmore collecting for \"the needs of the disabled\", Rory leads Michael astray, sneaking off to a local pub with their donation bucket, charming a group of girls at a corner table at which sits Siobh\u00e1n; later they see Siobh\u00e1n again while traversing a neighbouring nightclub, which they get into only by Michael citing Irish and EU Disability Discrimination Law text to the bouncer. Rory has meanwhile repeatedly failed in his application for the Independent Living Allowance; he is always denied that on the grounds of irresponsibility and poor judgement, but told to reapply in six months. Inspired by his example Michael applies for the allowance himself; with the help of Rory as his interpreter Michael gets the allowance but they struggle to find an apartment that is both wheelchair accessible and affordable. Rory convinces Michael to visit his estranged father who, out of guilt, gives them the money and property they need to set up on their own. They interview for a care-giver with little success, but later they meet Siobh\u00e1n working in a local supermarket, and try to convince her to take on the job. Despite not having any professional experience she reluctantly accepts. Seeing that Michael and Siobh\u00e1n are platonically friendly to each other, Rory becomes jealous \u2013 culminating in a joyride with local kids in a stolen car, crashing it, subsequently getting briefly detained by the police. Siobh\u00e1n invites Rory and Michael along to a costume party; but after Siobh\u00e1n rejects Michaels advances she decides to bring in Peter, a qualified Personal Assistant to replace herself. Michael is distraught over Siobh\u00e1n's departure from their lives, and considering suicide; Rory finds him on the edge of the James Joyce Bridge. Michael jokingly complains the edge is too high for him to throw himself off, and Rory talks him out of it, reminding him he has a future and to enjoy it. Later, Michael finds Rory in his bed struggling to breathe, and calls for an ambulance. His disease having progressed, Rory is given only a few days to live. Michael visits Siobh\u00e1n and with her help goes to the review board on behalf of Rory to argue his case, another chance having come up after six months. The board initially refuse, restating the same arguments, however Michael responds that \"the right must exist independently of its exercising\" and as a gesture the board approve Rory's independent living allowance in principle \u2013 but before they can get to the hospital to tell Rory the news, he has already died. Michael and Siobhan attend Rory's funeral. Michael hears in his mind Rory's words \"Well, then, are we going out?\" and after saying goodbye to Siobhan, Michael heads out on his own. ==Cast== * James McAvoy as Rory Gerard O'Shea, a rebellious young man with Duchenne muscular dystrophy * Steven Robertson as Michael Connolly, a 24-year-old long-term resident with cerebral palsy * Romola Garai as Siobh\u00e1n, a young woman they employ as a caregiver * Brenda Fricker as Eileen, a domineering care worker at Michael's care home * Gerard McSorley as Fergus Connolly, Michael's father who abandoned him at birth * Tom Hickey as Con O'Shea, Rory's father * Alan King as Tommy * Ruth McCabe as Annie * Anna Healy as Alice * Deirdre O'Kane (cameo) as a caregiver applicant == Production == Writer Christian O'Reilly came up with the story after working with Martin Naughton, and Dermot Walsh, on a campaign for the Centre for Independent Living in Dublin. ==Music== The film features Johnny Cash's cover version of \"Hurt\".

The site's general consensus is that \"The dramatic aspects of Rory O'Shea Was Here veer into mawkish, formulaic sentiment, which undercuts the characters' individuality.\" Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score gives the film 59% based on 23 reviews. Neil Smith, reviewing for the BBC, gave the film 4/5 stars but felt casting non-disabled actors undermined the film. Members of the worldwide disability rights and inclusion communities have mixed opinions on the film. It is not always cited, for example, as a top pick in film festival events led by and for disabled people. These critics sometimes imply that the film does not quite go far enough in lampooning and dismantling pity/heroism attitudes, and that some sectors of the film (mostly in relation to camera angles and music) actually play into those attitudes, possibly without realising it. Similarly to other critics, critics with disabilities also point out that there was no readily apparent reason to exclude actors with disabilities from consideration from the two lead roles. Neither of the two lead actors is actually physically disabled, when in fact at a minimum, it would have been a relatively easy exercise for the filmmakers to have at least located one young, skilled actor with actual cerebral palsy to play the role of Michael. ==References== ==External links== * official site, archived copy from 2006 provided by the Internet Archive * * Category:2004 films Category:2004 comedy-drama films Category:Irish films Category:Irish comedy-drama films Category:British films Category:British comedy-drama films Category:French films Category:French comedy-drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films about people with cerebral palsy Category:Films set in Dublin (city) Category:Films shot in Ireland Category:Irish independent films Category:StudioCanal films Category:Working Title Films films Category:British independent films Category:French independent films Category:Films directed by Damien O'Donnell Category:Films scored by David Julyan Category:Films with screenplays by Jeffrey Caine Category:2004 independent films ",
