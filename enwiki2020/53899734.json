    "text": "The 2017\u201318 Top 14 competition is the 119th French domestic rugby union club competition operated by the Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR). Two new teams from the 2016\u201317 Pro D2 season were promoted to Top 14 (Oyonnax and Agen) in place of the two relegated teams, Grenoble and Bayonne. It marks the second time in a row that both promoted teams had returned on their first opportunity after relegation (Oyonnax and Agen were both relegated during the 2015\u201316 Top 14 season). ==Teams== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"65%\" |- !width=\"18%\"|Club!!width=\"22%\"|City (department)!!width=\"21%\"|Stadium!!width=\"12%\"|Capacity |- | Agen | Agen (Lot- et-Garonne) | Stade Armandie | 14,000 |- | Bordeaux B\u00e8gles | Bordeaux (Gironde) | Stade Chaban-Delmas Matmut Atlantique | 34,694 42,115 |- | Brive | Brive-la-Gaillarde (Corr\u00e8ze) | Stade Am\u00e9d\u00e9e-Domenech | 13,979 |- | Castres | Castres (Tarn) | Stade Pierre-Fabre | 12,500 |- | Clermont | Clermont-Ferrand (Puy-de-D\u00f4me) | Parc des Sports Marcel Michelin | 19,022 |- | La Rochelle | La Rochelle (Charente-Maritime) | Stade Marcel- Deflandre | 16,000 |- | Lyon | Lyon (M\u00e9tropole de Lyon) | Matmut Stadium de Gerland | 25,000 |- | Montpellier | Montpellier (H\u00e9rault) | Altrad Stadium | 15,697 |- | Oyonnax | Oyonnax (Ain) | Stade Charles-Mathon | 11,400 |- | Pau | Pau (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques) | Stade du Hameau | 18,324 |- | Racing 92 | Nanterre (Hauts-de-Seine) | Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir U Arena | 14,000 30,681 |- | Stade Fran\u00e7ais | Paris, 16th arrondissement | Stade Jean-Bouin | 20,000 |- | Toulon | Toulon (Var) | Stade Mayol | 18,200 |- | Toulouse | Toulouse (Haute-Garonne) | Stade Ernest-Wallon | 19,500 |} ==Number of teams by regions== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !

This consists of three rounds: the teams finishing third to sixth in the table play quarter-finals (hosted by the third and fourth placed teams). The winners then face the top two teams in the semi-finals, with the winners meeting in the final at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis. The LNR uses a slightly different bonus points system from that used in most other rugby competitions. It trialled a new system in 2007\u201308 explicitly designed to prevent a losing team from earning more than one bonus point in a match, a system that also made it impossible for either team to earn a bonus point in a drawn match. LNR chose to continue with this system for subsequent seasons. France's bonus point system operates as follows: * 4 points for a win. * 2 points for a draw. * 1 bonus point for winning while scoring at least 3 more tries than the opponent. This replaces the standard bonus point for scoring 4 tries regardless of the match result. * 1 bonus point for losing by 5 points (or fewer). The margin had been 7 points until being changed prior to the 2014\u201315 season. ==Table== ==Relegation== Starting from the 2017\u201318 season forward, only the 14th placed team will be automatically relegated to Pro D2. The 13th placed team will face the runner-up of the Pro D2 play-off, with the winner of that play-off taking up the final place in Top 14 for the following season. ==Fixtures & Results== ===Round 1=== \\---- ===Round 2=== \\---- ===Round 3=== \\---- ===Round 4=== \\---- ===Round 5=== \\---- ===Round 6=== \\---- ===Round 7=== \\---- ===Round 8=== \\---- ===Round 9=== \\---- ===Round 10=== \\---- ===Round 11=== \\---- ===Round 12=== \\---- ===Round 13=== \\---- ===Round 14=== \\---- ===Round 15=== \\---- ===Round 16=== \\---- ===Round 17=== \\---- ===Round 18=== \\---- ===Round 19=== \\---- ===Round 20=== \\---- ===Round 21=== \\---- ===Round 22=== \\---- ===Round 23=== \\---- ===Round 24=== \\---- ===Round 25=== \\---- ===Round 26=== ==Relegation playoff== The team finishing in 13th place faces the runner-up of the Pro D2, with the winner of this match playing in Top 14 in 2018\u201319 and the loser in Pro D2. ==Playoffs== ===Semi-final Qualifiers=== * Under LNR rules, when a playoff game ends level after extra time, the first tiebreaker is tries scored.
