    "text": "John Robert Howe (7 October 1915 \u2013 5 April 1987) was a professional footballer who gained three caps for England in the late 1940s. ==Playing career== Jack Howe was one of the best two footed full-backs in Britain. Standing six foot tall, Howe could kick a ball equally hard and accurately with either foot. Signed by George Jobey from the North East, Howe made his debut as Derby were finishing eight points behind champions Sunderland and was a regular until the war when he joined the Cameron Highlanders and guested for Hearts, Falkirk, Aberdeen, and St Mirren. He played for the Scottish League against the British Army and, after service in India, he was demobbed in time to earn an FA Cup winner's medal playing centre-half in the semi-final replay and left back at Wembley. Howe never shirked a tackle, was totally dominant and took over the captaincy when Raich Carter went to Hull in 1948. When Howe received the first of his three England caps, in a memorable 4\u20130 victory over Italy in Turin, it was considered long overdue. Howe, among Derby's greatest defenders, was one of the first professional sportsmen to wear contact lenses. He was over 40 before he ended his career with Kings Lynn. ==Family== His grandson, Steve Fletcher also played professionally and is the record appearance holder with AFC Bournemouth. ==References== Category:1915 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Hartlepool Category:Footballers from County Durham Category:English footballers Category:England international footballers Category:English Football League players Category:Association football defenders Category:Hartlepool United F.C. players Category:Derby County F.C. players Category:Huddersfield Town A.F.C. players Category:King's Lynn F.C. managers Category:English football managers ",
