The wine produced here was classified as one of eighteen Cinqui\u00e8mes Crus (Fifth Growths) in the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855.Karen MacNeil, The Wine Bible Workman Publishing 2001 p. 885 The name of the estate comes from its geographical location on the Cos hill and the name of Fran\u00e7ois Labory, who was the first owner until 1845. Mr. d'Estournel then acquired it before selling it again to an English banker, Charles Martyns in 1852. The property was finally taken over by George Weber in the 1930s, who bequeathed it to his daughter and son-in-law, Fran\u00e7ois Audoy in 1959. In 1971, the couple acquired the neighbouring estate, Ch\u00e2teau Andron Blanquet. Their sons worked with them on the two estates for a few years and then the elder Bernard took over the running of the properties. Bernard is a strong, practical manager with a quiet reassuring manner. He has always lived in Saint-Est\u00e8phe and is perfectly emblematic of his estate, his wines and the appellation that he has presided over since 2000. ==Wines== Cos Labory wines are fruit-forward wines that are meant to be consumed fairly young for a classified Bordeaux wine.Hugh Johnson and Jancis Robinson The World Atlas of Wine p. 88 Mitchell Beazley Publishing 2005 == References == Category:Bordeaux wine producers ",
