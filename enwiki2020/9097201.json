Jo\u00e3o do Estoril, Cascais. He studied history and philosophy and graduated in 1956 from the University of Lisbon with a thesis entitled A Sociedade em Portugal nos S\u00e9culos XII a XIV (Portuguese Society from 12th to 14th Centuries). After training in the University of W\u00fcrzburg, in Germany, he would start teaching the following year at the University of Lisbon and received his doctorate in 1960. His PhD dissertation was entitled Hansa e Portugal na Idade M\u00e9dia (Hanseatic League and Portugal in the Middle Ages). In 1962, his participation in student strikes against the right-wing regime of Oliveira Salazar resulted in his dismissal from the university as a scholar. He left for the United States where he taught history at a number of universities (Auburn, Florida, Columbia, Minnesota and Chicago) between 1965 and 1970. Oliveira Marques returned to Portugal in 1970, but only resumed teaching at Portuguese universities in 1974, the year in which the Carnation Revolution ended almost five decades of the Estado Novo regime. From October 1974 to April 1976, he was director of the National Library of Lisbon. In 1998, he was granted the Grand Cross of the Order of Liberty, a state accolade which distinguishes figures who have made a contribution to the values of civilization. ==Work== Considered one of Portugal's greatest experts on Portuguese Medieval history, he wrote more than 60 books and numerous articles. One of his most famous works, A History of Portugal, is translated into several languages. Some of his works include: * A Sociedade em Portugal nos S\u00e9culos XII a XIV * Hansa e Portugal na Idade M\u00e9dia * Introdu\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 Hist\u00f3ria da Agricultura em Portugal * A Sociedade Medieval Portuguesa: aspectos da vida quotidiana * Guia do Estudante de Hist\u00f3ria Medieval Portuguesa * Hist\u00f3ria de Portugal (A History of Portugal, has been translated to English, French, Japanese, Polish and Spanish.) * Nova Hist\u00f3ria de Portugal (coordinator, with Joel Serr\u00e3o) * Nova Hist\u00f3ria da Expans\u00e3o Portuguesa (coordinator, with Joel Serr\u00e3o) * Hist\u00f3ria dos Portugueses no Extremo Oriente (coordinator) * Hist\u00f3ria da Ma\u00e7onaria em Portugal ==References== *Joao Pedro Ferro, ed., A.
