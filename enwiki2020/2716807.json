She holds the post of Scotland Editor, having joined the BBC in Spring 2014 for the run-up to the Scottish Independence Referendum on 18 September 2014. She also presents the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. Smith has covered stories ranging from the United States presidential elections and the Madrid train bombings (for which Channel 4 News won an International Emmy in 2004), to the resignation of Iain Duncan Smith and an exclusive interview with Saddam Hussein's defence lawyer. ==Early life== Smith was born in Edinburgh in 1968, where she attended Boroughmuir High School. She then graduated from the University of Glasgow in 1989 with a Master of Arts. ==Career== Smith began her journalistic career as a graduate trainee with BBC Scotland. She spent a year living and working in Belfast for BBC Northern Ireland, during which time she was held at gunpoint by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) in its West Belfast headquarters. In 1991, Smith moved to London as an assistant producer with BBC Youth Programmes, working on Rough Guide, Rapido and Reportage. Two years later she moved to news and current affairs, first as assistant producer with the Public Eye and Here & Now programmes. She then worked as a producer for the BBC on programmes as diverse as Newsnight, Public Eye and Rough Guides. On 5 News she was a reporter for two years. Smith was then the first newsreader on More4 News on Channel 4's digital television sister channel More4. She was Channel 4 Newss Washington correspondent before moving to the post of Business correspondent in the summer of 2011. Smith presented BBC Two's Scottish current affairs programme, Scotland 2014, alongside sports presenter Jonathan Sutherland. The programme first aired on 27 May 2014. She was appointed the BBC's first Scotland Editor in November 2015, to cover Scottish news for a UK audience. In August 2017, it was announced that Smith was to succeed Andrew Neil as the presenter of the Sunday Politics programme on BBC One from mid-September that year. In May 2020, Smith apologized to Nicola Sturgeon for saying that the Scottish First Minister had \"enjoyed\" the opportunity to make her own different lockdown rules during the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Family== She is the eldest daughter of the former leader of the Labour Party John Smith, and of Elizabeth Smith, Baroness Smith of Gilmorehill. She has two younger sisters: Jane and Catherine Smith. The John Smith Memorial Trust, on whose Advisory Council she sits, lists her as The Hon. Sarah Smith; her mother's status as a Baroness allows her the right to use \"the Honourable\" before her forename. Smith married Simon Conway, an author, former British Army officer and co- chair of the Cluster Munition Coalition, on the island of Iona, where her father is buried, on 22 September 2007. The service was led by Rev. Douglas Alexander, father of former Scottish Labour Party leader Wendy Alexander. In 2014, she returned to live in Edinburgh. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of Glasgow Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:ITN newsreaders and journalists Category:Scottish journalists Category:BBC newsreaders and journalists Category:Channel 4 presenters Category:People from Edinburgh Category:Daughters of barons ",
