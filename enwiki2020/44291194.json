Computer Service Directorate badge ==History== Memorial to the Communications Corps's fallen in Yehud with Bible verse Ezra 3:13 The Haganah Communications Service was established in 1937 and in the same year the first Morse Code radio operators\u2019 course was held. At that time in the British Mandate, they operated 12 underground broadcasting stations. In 1938 they brought 150 carrier pigeons to the country. In 1939 the first broadcast station run by the Etzel, also known as the Irgun, was activated. The first communications officer course was held in 1947, and in the time of the Jerusalem blockade, radio communication equipment was installed on Palmach armored vehicles that went up to the city. After the establishment of the State of Israel and the IDF, the Communications Corps was established on October 14, 1948. With the establishment of the Computer Service Directorate in 2003, the C4I Corps became one of its subordinate units, but in 2005 as part of comprehensive organizational changes in the Ground Forces Command, the C4I Corps together with the Ordnance Corps, Logistics Corps, and Adjutant Corps became subordinate elements of that headquarters. In 2007 it was decided to return the C4I Corps to the Computer Service Directorate and over the course of the year 2008 the decision was implemented. ==Commanders== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Name!!Tenure!!Notes |- |Ya'akov Yanai |November 1945 \u2013 November 1949 | |- |Yitzhak Almog |November 1949 \u2013 August 1954 | |- |Ariel Amiad |August 1954 \u2013 September 1957 | |- |Yishayahu Lavi |September 1957 \u2013 June 1962 |Corps name changed to Communications and Electronics Corps |- |Zalman Shalev |June 1962 \u2013 August 1966 | |- |Moshe Gidron |August 1966 \u2013 August 1972 |First commander with the rank of brigadier general |- |Shlomo Inbar |August 1972 \u2013 October 1975 | |- |Yisrael Zamir |October 1975 \u2013 August 1979 | |- |Zvi Amid |August 1979 \u2013 September 1982 | |- |Moti Dagan |September 1982 \u2013 September 1986 | |- |Benny Meidan |September 1986 \u2013 May 1990 | |- |Shlomo Waks |May 1990 \u2013 September 1993 | |- |Avihu Distelman |September 1993 \u2013 September 1996 | |- |Herzl Hallali |September 1996 \u2013 July 1999 | |- |Moshe Markovitz |July 1999 \u2013 August 2002 | |- |Arnon Zuaretz |August 2002 \u2013 September 2005 |Name changed to C4I Corps |- |Shmulik Keinan |September 2005 \u2013 September 2008 | |- |Nahum Baslo |September 2008 \u2013 September 2011 | |- |Eyal Zelinger |September 2011 \u2013 July 2015 | |- |Netanel (Nati) Cohen |July 2015 - May 2018 | |- |Yariv Nir |May 2018 - current | |} ==References== ==External links== * IDF C4I Corps Official Website Category:Corps of Israel ",
