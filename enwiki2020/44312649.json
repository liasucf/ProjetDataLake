    "text": "alt=Narcissus cultivars have a wide range of colours, sizes and proportions of corona to perianth The List of Narcissus horticultural divisions is a classification of the cultivated varieties of the genus Narcissus (), which are predominantly spring perennial plants in the family Amaryllidaceae. Most species and cultivars are known by the common name daffodil, while a few are called jonquils. The list of Narcissus horticultural divisions provided by the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) is the standard method used to classify and describe cultivated varieties (cultivars) of Narcissus. It is widely used since the RHS is the international authority for the registration of such cultivars. For horticultural purposes, all Narcissus cultivars are split into 13 divisions, as described by Kington (1998), for the RHS, based partly upon flower form (shape and length of corona \u2013 the \"trumpet\" or \"cup\"), particularly the ratio of corona to length of perianth segments (tepals or \"petals\"), the number of flowers per stem, flowering period and partly upon the genetic background. Division 11 (Split-corona) with its two subdivisions was the most recent group to be described (1969). Division 13, which includes all the wild rather than cultivated daffodils, is the exception to this scheme. This classification is a useful tool for planning planting. Most commercially available narcissi come from Divisions 1 (Trumpet), 2 (Large- cupped) and 8 (Tazetta). Growers register new daffodil cultivars by name and colour with the RHS, whose International Daffodil Register is regularly updated with supplements available online and is searchable. The most recent supplement (2014) is the sixth; the fifth was published in 2012. More than 27,000 names were registered as of 2008, and the number has continued to grow. However, because of synonymy, the actual number is probably closer to 18,000; only about 500 are in commercial production (470 in 2009\u20132010). Registered daffodils are given a division number and colour code such as 5W-W ('Thalia'). In horticultural usage it is not uncommon to also find another unofficial division of 'Miniatures', which, although drawn from the other 13 divisions, have their miniature size in common. These are sometimes referred to by nurseries as 'Division 14'. Over 140 narcissus cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. == Colour code == alt=Geranium Narcissus is coded as 8WO because it is classified in Division 8, has a W for White perianth and an O for Orange corona Daffodils may be self-coloured\u2014i.e., both perianth and corona identical in colour and shade\u2014or the colours between the perianth and corona may differ widely. Some perianths and some coronas may also contain more than one colour or shade. Prevalent colours are all shades and tones of yellow, white, orange, pink, red and green. Pinks vary from apricot to rose in shades from pale to deep, and some more recent cultivars have hints of lavender or lilac. Reds vary from orange-red to salmon red to near scarlet. Pink, red, orange and green tones are mainly confined to the corona. However, breeders are currently working against the genus' natural pigmentation and genetic barriers to create cultivars in which pink, rose, red, orange and green tones suffuse or \"bleed\" from the more highly coloured coronas onto the perianth segments of white or yellow. There is an increasing number of commercially available varieties which display this enhanced colouration. The colour classification lists the perianth colour and then the corona colour. In the case of multiple colours, the perianth colours are assigned from the outer edge of the perianth segments inward to their juncture with the base of the corona, while the corona colours are assigned from the base of the corona outward to the rim. Thus, 'Accent', a Large Cup (Division 2) Daffodil possessing a white perianth and a pink corona, is officially classified as 2W-P, 'Geranium', Tazetta (Division 8) with a white perianth and orange corona is 8W-O and 'Actaea', Poeticus (Division 9), with white corona and multicoloured corona is 9W-GYR. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center; width:400px; margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\" |+RHS colour classification ! scope=\"col\" |Code!! scope=\"col\" |Colour |- | W | White or Whitish |- |G | Green |- |Y | Yellow |- |P | Pink |- |O | Orange |- |R | Red |} == Definitions of divisions == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ RHS horticultural divisions of daffodils ! !scope=\"col\" |Number|| !scope=\"col\" |Name||style= !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Definition||!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Cultivar Example Code Year Year of registration or first flowering |- ||1|||Trumpet Daffodil cultivars|||Solitary flower with corona as long as, or longer than the tepals||120px 'Little Gem' 1Y\u2013Y 1959 |- ||2|| align=\"left\"| Large-cupped Daffodil cultivars|||Solitary flower with corona more than one-third, but less than equal to the length of the tepals||120px 'Fortune' 2Y\u2013O 1923 |- ||3|| align=\"left\"|Small-cupped Daffodil cultivars|||Solitary flower with corona not more than one-third the length of the tepals||120px 'Barrett Browning' 3WWY\u2013O 1945 |- ||4|||Double Daffodil cultivars|||One or more flowers with doubling of the corona or tepals or both||120px 'Butter and Eggs' 4Y\u2013O 1777 |- ||5|||Triandrus Daffodil cultivars|||Two or more flowers with characteristics of N. triandrus, flowers pendent and tepals reflexed||120px 'Thalia' 5W\u2013W 1916 |- ||6||align=\"left\"|Cyclamineus Daffodil cultivars|||Solitary flower with characteristics of N. cyclamineus, flowers acutely angled to stem, very short pedicel, tepals reflexed||120px 'February Gold' 6Y\u2013Y 1923 |- |\"|7|| align=\"left\"|Jonquilla and Apodanthus Daffodil cultivars|||One to five, but rarely up to eight flowers with characteristics of sections Jonquilla or Apodanthi, flowers acutely angled to stem, corona cup or funnel shaped or flared, and usually wider than long, tepals spreading or reflexed, usually fragrant||120px 'Stratosphere' 7Y\u2013O 1968 |- ||8|||Tazetta Daffodil cultivars|||Three to twenty flowers, with characteristics of section Tazetta, flowers with tepals spreading, usually fragrant, stem stout||120px 'Scilly Valentine' 8Y\u2013O 2000 |- ||9|||Poeticus Daffodil cultivars|||Usually solitary flower, with characteristics of N. poeticus, flowers with corona very short to disc shaped, usually green and or yellow centre and red rim (sometimes a single colour), tepals white, usually fragrant||120px 'Actaea' 9W\u2013YYR 1927 |- ||10|| align=\"left\"|Bulbocodium Daffodil cultivars|||Usually solitary flower, with characteristics of section Bulbocodium, flowers with tepals insignificant relative to corona, anthers dorsiflexed, filament and style usually curved||120px 'Golden Bells' 10Y\u2013Y 1984 |- |rowspan=3 |11|| align=\"left\"|Split-corona Daffodil cultivars||Corona split, usually for more than half its length |- ||(a) Collar Daffodils|||Corona two whorls of three, opposite tepals||120px 'Mondragon' 11aY\u2013O 1973 |- |\"|(b) Papillon Daffodils|||Corona usually single whorl of six, alternate to tepals|| |[Jodi] 'Jodi' 11bW\u2013P/W 2002 |- ||12|||Other Daffodil cultivars|||Cultivars not fitting any of the above definitions||120px 'T\u00eate-\u00e0-T\u00eate' 12Y\u2013Y 1949 |- ||13|| align=\"left\"|Daffodils distinguished solely by botanical name|||Wild (species) daffodils and hybrids without cultivar names||120px Narcissus \u00d7 medioluteus 1768 |} == See also == * List of Narcissus species * List of Award of Garden Merit narcissus == Notes == == References == == Bibliography == * * * Category:Narcissus (plant) ",
