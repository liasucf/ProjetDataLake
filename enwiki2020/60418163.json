The season began on 27 July 2019 and was scheduled to end on 18 April 2020. Cove Rangers were the reigning champions, but could not defend their title after being promoted to Scottish League Two. On 13 March 2020, the league was indefinitely suspended due to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus outbreak and later curtailed. On 21 March, Brora Rangers were awarded the title following a vote of the league's member clubs. League positions were confirmed in August 2020 based on points per game in the curtailed season. ==Teams== The following teams changed division after the 2018\u201319 season. ===From Highland League=== Promoted to League Two *Cove Rangers Following Cove's promotion, the league decided in May 2019 to play the 2019\u201320 season with 17 teams, rather than invite a new member to replace Cove. ===Stadia and locations=== All grounds are equipped with floodlights as required by league regulations. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Team !Location !Stadium !data-sort- type=\"number\" |Capacity !data-sort-type=\"number\" |Seats |- |Brora Rangers |Brora |Dudgeon Park |align=right|4,000 |align=right|200 |- |Buckie Thistle |Buckie |Victoria Park |align=right|5,000 |align=right|400 |- |Clachnacuddin |Inverness |Grant Street Park |align=right|2,074 |align=right|154 |- |Deveronvale |Banff |Princess Royal Park |align=right|2,600 |align=right|360 |- |Formartine United |Pitmedden |North Lodge Park |align=right|2,500 |align=right|300 |- |Forres Mechanics |Forres |Mosset Park |align=right|2,700 |align=right|502 |- |Fort William |Fort William |Claggan Park |align=right|4,000 |align=right|400 |- |Fraserburgh |Fraserburgh |Bellslea Park |align=right|3,000 |align=right|480 |- |Huntly |Huntly |Christie Park |align=right|2,200 |align=right|270 |- |Inverurie Loco Works |Inverurie |Harlaw Park |align=right|2,500 |align=right|250 |- |Keith |Keith |Kynoch Park |align=right|4,000 |align=right|370 |- |Lossiemouth |Lossiemouth |Grant Park |align=right|2,050 |align=right|250 |- |Nairn County |Nairn |Station Park |align=right|2,250 |align=right|250 |- |Rothes |Rothes |Mackessack Park |align=right|2,700 |align=right|184 |- |Strathspey Thistle |Grantown-on-Spey |Seafield Park |align=right|1,600 |align=right|150 |- |Turriff United |Turriff |The Haughs |align=right|2,135 |align=right|135 |- |Wick Academy |Wick |Harmsworth Park |align=right|2,412 |align=right|102 |} ==League table== ==Results== ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:Highland Football League seasons 5 Scottish Scotland ",
