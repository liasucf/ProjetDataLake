    "text": "Later print of Jacques de Via Jacques de Via (died 13 June 1317) was a French cardinal in the Roman Catholic Church. His brother Arnaud was also a cardinal. ==Life== Born in Cahors, he became chantry canon of Fr\u00e9jus, archdeacon of Mede and prebendary canon of Mende. In 1313 he was elected bishop of Avignon, succeeding his mother's brother Jacques Du\u00e8ze, the future Pope John XXII, who made him a cardinal in the consistory of 17 December 1316. He died in June 1317 during the trial of Hugues G\u00e9raud, bishop of Cahors for attempting to murder pope John XXII by witchcraft. G\u00e9raud was thus also accused of initially testing his witchcraft on Jacques de Via and his murder was added to the charge sheet. G\u00e9raud was found guilty, stripped of his bishopric and burned at the stake. ==References== category:1317 deaths category:French cardinals category:14th-century cardinals category:Bishops of Avignon category:Cardinal- nephews ",
