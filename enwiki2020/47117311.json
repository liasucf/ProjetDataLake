Liberal senator Eric Abetz accused the union of \"seizing on a slip up\" as a distraction from issues within the union itself, adding \"That which Mr Hadgkiss is alleged to have done pales into absolute insignificance, it is literally in the parable, they are pointing out a little speck in Mr Hadgkiss's eye\".
