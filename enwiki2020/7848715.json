    "text": "\"Gelem, Gelem\" is a song composed by \u017darko Jovanovi\u0107, often used as the anthem of the Romani people. The title has been adapted in many countries by local Roma to match their native orthography and spoken dialect of the Romani language. Some of the song's many titles include * \"Gyelem, Gyelem\" (Hungarian orthography) * \"Jelem, Jelem\" * \"Dzelem, Dzelem\" * \"D\u017eelem, D\u017eelem\" (alternative Croatian and Latin Serbian and Bosnian orthography) * \"\u0110elem, \u0110elem\" (Croatian and Latin Serbian and Bosnian orthography) * \"Djelem, Djelem\" (German and French orthography) * \"\u0402\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043c, \u0402\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043c\" (Cyrillic Serbian and Bosnian orthography) * \"\u0403\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043c, \u0403\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043c\" (Macedonian orthography) * \"\u040f\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043c, \u040f\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043c\" (alternative Cyrillic Serbian and Bosnian orthography) * \"\u0414\u0436\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043c, \u0434\u0436\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043c\" (Russian, Ukrainian and Bulgarian orthography) * \"Opr\u00e9 Roma\" * \"Romale Shavale\" In an interview with reporter Mike Kalezi\u0107, Jovanovi\u0107 himself titled the song \"Opre Roma\". After experiencing firsthand the incarceration of Roma during the Porajmos (the Romani Holocaust of World War II), Jovanovi\u0107 later composed the lyrics of \"Gelem, Gelem\" and set them to a traditional melody in 1949. The song was first adopted by delegates of the first World Romani Congress held in 1971. ==Lyrics== Original Gelem, gelem, lungone dromensa Maladilem bakhtale Romensa A Romale, katar tumen aven, E tsarensa bakhtale dromensa?

Translation I went, I went on long roads I met happy Roma O Roma, where do you come from, With tents happy on the road? O Roma, O Romani youths! I once had a great family, The Black LegionNazi genocide of Roma and Sinti people murdered them Come with me, Roma from all the world For the Roma, roads have opened Now is the time, rise up Roma now, We will rise high if we act O Roma, O Romani youths! Open, God, White doors So I can see where are my people. Come back to tour the roads And walk with happy Roma O Roma, O Romani youths! Up, Romani people! Now is the time Come with me, Roma from all the world Dark face and dark eyes, I want them like dark grapes O Roma, O Romani youths! == Alternate lyrics == There are many versions of \"Gelem, Gelem\", notably those translated by Ronald Lee.
