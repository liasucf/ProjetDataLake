The band has performed in 30 countries, including Mexico, France, Estonia, China, Portugal, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Poland, Germany, The Netherlands, Austria, Finland, Belgium, Norway, India, the United States, the UK, Italy, Denmark, Iran and Japan. == History == Alexey Belkin, Alexey Skosyrev, Dmitriy Shikhardin, and Peter Sergeev worked together as buskers on the streets of St. Petersburg for about 3 years. The positive feedback from the listeners inspired them to officially form a band in 2003. Of the initial members, only Dmitriy had formal musical education; the rest were self-taught. Initially the band was called Reelroad\u044a and they played The Pogues-styled Celtic punk, but later changed their name to Otava Yo and turned to Russian traditional music. In 2005 they released their first studio album \u201cPod Aptekoj\u201d, named after their favourite street performance spot by a homeopathic pharmacy on Nevsky Prospect. Four years later, in 2009, Otava Yo released their second studio album \"Zhyli-byli\", continuing into a musical direction they called \"Russian beat\". The next Otava Yo's album \u201cRozhdestvo\u201d of traditional Christmas songs released in 2011, marked a deviation from their characteristic musical direction, that they ultimately returned to on their 2013 album \"Chto za pesni\". The band's breakthrough came with the video for the song \u201cSumetckaya\u201d, featuring Russian fist fighters. In 2015 \u201cSumetckaya\u201d reached the No. 1 position on World Music Network\u2019s February Video Chart and had been viewed for more than 36 million times on YouTube, a number that reached 14 million in 2018, setting the record as the most watched music video by a Russian folk band. In october 2018 Otava Yo released their album \"Lyubish li ty?\" had entered the mixing and mastering stage. On September 30, 2018 the band released a video for the song \"Kak na gorke, na gore\" (Once Upon a Time on a High Hill) filmed at the Podporozhsky District in June from the upcoming album. == Members == Current Members * Alexey Belkin \u2013 vocals, bagpipes, gusli, zhaleika * Alexey Skosyrev \u2013 vocals, acoustic guitar * Dmitriy Shikhardin \u2013 vocals, fiddle * Yulia Usova \u2013 vocals, violin (2011\u2013present) * Lina Kolesnik \u2013 vocals, violin (2019\u20132020; substituting for Yulia Usova on maternity leave) * Petr Sergeev \u2013 bass drum, darabouka * Vasiliy Telegin \u2013 bass guitar (ca. 2019\u2013present) * Denis Nikiforov \u2013 drums (ca. 2019\u2013present) Past Members * Svetlana Kondesyuk - bagpipe, flute (2003-2009) * Natalya Vysokikh \u2013 violin (2003\u20132010) * Timur Sigidin \u2013 bass guitar (2009\u2013ca. 2019) ==Discography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Title !Translation in English !Album details |- |\u041f\u043e\u0434 \u0430\u043f\u0442\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0439 (Pod aptekoj) |By the Pharmacy | *Released: 2006 *Label: None *Format: CD |- |\u0416\u0438\u043b\u0438-\u0431\u044b\u043b\u0438 (Zhyli-byli) |Once Upon a Time | *Released: 2009 *Label: None *Format: CD |- |\u0420\u043e\u0436\u0434\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e (Rozhdestvo) |Christmas | *Released: 2011 *Label: None *Format: CD |- |\u0427\u0442\u043e \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438 (Chto za pesni) |What Songs | *Released: 2013 *Label: None *Format: CD |- |\u041b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438 2006\u20142015 (Luchshie pesni 2006\u20142015) |Best Songs 2006\u20132015 | *Released: 2015 *Label: None *Format: CD/DVD |- |\u0414\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0447\u043a\u043e \u0432\u0435\u0441\u0451\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0442\u044c!
