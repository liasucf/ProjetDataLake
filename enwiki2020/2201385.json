    "text": "Acapulco H.E.A.T. was a 1993 syndicated television series. It followed the adventures of the Hemisphere Emergency Action Team (H.E.A.T.), a group of top- secret agents based in Puerto Vallarta, Acapulco in Mexico, recruited by \"C-5\", a secret, inter-governmental coalition to fight terrorism and other international crimes. To keep a low profile, the team posed as models and photographers representing a beach-fashion business. The show returned for a second season (production started in 1996) with a new and smaller cast; it aired in Europe in 1997, and in the USA during 1998\u201399. ==Synopsis== Led by Ashley Hunter-Coddington (Catherine Oxenberg), a former MI6 operative, and Mike Savage (Brendan Kelly), a former CIA agent, the H.E.A.T. members fight international terrorism and other crimes. They receive their assignments from \"Mr. Smith\" (John Vernon), the mysterious head of C-5, a secret governmental organization linked to the United Nations. The team operates from both Puerto Vallarta, Mexico and internationally under the 'cover' of a beach fashion enterprise.Brooks, Tim & Marsh, Earle (2007). The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946\u2013Present (9th ed.). New York: Ballantine Books. . The team's members are: Catherine \"Cat\" Avery Pascal (Alison Armitage), a former cat-burglar who had to choose between life imprisonment and working in H.E.A.T. for a year in order to have a \"clean-slate\"; Tommy Chase (Michael Worth), a martial arts expert with a deep understanding of human psychology; Brett Richardson (Spencer Rochfort), a former Navy SEAL with a vast knowledge of explosives; Krissie Valentine (Holly Floria), a computer genius who can do anything with computers, no matter the situation and, who eventually becomes romantically involved with teammate, Marcos Chavez (Randy Vasquez), a member of Mexico's Los Federales, and whose local contacts in their base-of-operations prove very helpful; Arthur Small (Graham Heywood), owner of Acapulco H.E.A.T. Beach Fashion who manages both the team's logistics and its members' false identities in the \"Beach Fashion Enterprise\" and, Claudio Divanti (Fabio), owner of the hotel where the team is headquartered. Catherine (\"Cat\") Avery Pascal and Tommy Chase are the only original characters to return in Season Two. The Season Two storyline explained the time gap (about 3 years) between seasons by stating that the (Season One) H.E.A.T. team had disbanded a few years after the events of Season One. In the interim, \"Cat\" became a beach-fashion photographer, and Tommy became a \"lone wolf\". The two were recruited by ex-spy Nicole Bernard (Lydie Denier) and her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, Joanna Barnes (Christa Sauls) a computer expert. They continued fighting international crime backed by private investors; their \"cover\": owners of a beach-fashion boutique (\"Acapulco HEAT Beach Fashion\").Terrace, Vincent (2009).
