He played college basketball for Cleveland State and Michigan State, and became a reliable three-point shooter. He plays both guard positions. == High school career == Forbes averaged 13.6 points as a junior, helping Sexton to a 26\u20132 record and a state championship. He scored 29 points in the 2011 Class B semifinals against Detroit Country Day. Forbes averaged 19.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists as a senior at Sexton.

He connected on 60 three-pointers as a senior and scored 19 points in the 2012 Class B title game against Stevensville Lakeshore, adding seven assists, following a 19-point effort in the semifinals against Detroit Country Day. He was named a Lansing State Journal Dream Team member and was a Class B All-State selection for the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News. He was not heavily recruited and did not receive any of the major attention that Denzel Valentine and Anthony Clemmons received. ESPN listed him as Cleveland State's third best recruit in the 2012 recruiting class. Forbes received a two-star recruiting grade from ESPN and listed him as 85 overall (out of a scale or 0-100). He was the ranked the 92nd best shooting guard in the nation, the 77th best player in the Midwest Region, and the 11th best player in the state of Michigan. He signed with Cleveland State, his only major offer, on August 4, 2011. == College career == === Freshman year (2012\u201313) === Forbes played his freshman year at Cleveland State. He appeared in 32 games, starting 18, averaging 12.7 points, 3.5 rebounds and 1.2 assists in 28.3 minutes. Forbes led the team in scoring among players who played in more than six games. He ranked 11th in Horizon League in scoring and eighth in three-pointers per game (2.0) and in conference games, ranked seventh in scoring (14.9 ppg) and second in free-throw percentage (.908). Forbes scored in double figures in 24 contests, including four games of more than 20 points. His season-high of 24 points came against both Valparaiso (2/9), connecting on 8-of-10 shots, including 4-of-4 from three-point range, and Milwaukee (2/17), making 9-of-12 shots, including 4-of-7 from behind the arc. His other high scoring games came against Loyola with 22 points (1/23) and 21 against Detroit (1/12), adding a season-high eight rebounds against the Titans and matching the CSU single-game record with five three-pointers. Forbes collected eight rebounds at UIC (2/2) and dished out a season-high five assists against Notre Dame (Ohio) (12/19). His successful freshman year was rewarded with 2012\u201313 Horizon League Newcomer of the Year, Horizon League All-Newcomer Team, CollegeInsider.com Mid-Major Freshman All-America Team, and a two-time Horizon League Newcomer of the Week (Dec 3 and Jan. 14). === Sophomore year (2013\u201314) === Forbes looked to improve going into his sophomore year. Still at Cleveland State, he started all 32 games in which he played, averaging 15.6 points, 3.1 rebounds and 1.7 assists in 34.4 minutes. His 15.6 points per game average led Cleveland State and ranked sixth in the Horizon League while he ranked second in the league in three-point field goals made (2.5 pg), trailing only Oakland's Travis Bader, the NCAA's all-time leading three-point shooter. Forbes led the team to a 21-12 record and 12-4 in the Horizon League. His efficiency improved heavily as he ranked fourth in the Horizon League in three-point field-goal percentage (.424), fifth in free-throw percentage (.826) and fourth in minutes played (34.4 mpg). Forbes broke records when he established a Cleveland State single-season school record with 81 made three- pointers, making at least one three-pointer in every contest. Scoring came easy as he scored in double-figures in 26 of 32 games, including 10 contests with 20 points or more. He went perfect on his first 28 free throws of the season before missing. Season highs for scoring against both Notre Dame (Ohio) with 27 points (12/18), matching the CSU single-game mark with five made three-pointers, and Detroit (1/31), adding a season-high seven rebounds against the Titans. Forbes proved his ability to play on the big stage when he tallied 22 points and five rebounds at the University of Kentucky (11/25), making 11-of-11 attempts from the foul line. He earned second-team NABC All- District 12 and second-Team All-Horizon League honors. === Junior year (2014\u201315) === Going into his junior year, Forbes decided to transfer. He wanted to come to Michigan State in part to be closer to home to take care of his young son and be near a family member with a medical issue. Forbes was granted a waiver to play for the Spartans in the 2014\u201315 season. NCAA rules typically require transfer players to sit out one year, but the NCAA waivers are granted for athletes who transfer because of family hardship. Forbes still had two seasons of eligibility remaining at Michigan State. Forbes looked to make an immediate impact due to the massive turnover from the previous season. Michigan State lost guards, Keith Appling, Gary Harris, and Russell Byrd. Three post players who displayed shooting ability also left, Adreian Payne, Kenny Kaminski, and Alex Guana. Forbes appeared in 39 games, starting 24, averaging 8.5 points, 1.4 rebounds and 1.0 assists in 26.2 minutes per game. Forbes' sharp shooting continued as he ranked fourth in the Big Ten in three- point field-goal percentage overall (.427), eighth in Big Ten games (.405), and 12th in the Big Ten in three-point field goals made overall (1.8). He scored in double figures in 14 games, including a season-high 21 points at Wisconsin (3/1) and led MSU in scoring in three games against Eastern Michigan (12/17; 14 points), Rutgers (1/29; 18 points) and Wisconsin (3/1; 21 points). Forbes made two or more three-pointers in 19 games, including five games with four or more three-pointers, highlighted by a perfect 5-of-5 effort from behind the arc at Wisconsin (3/1). Forbes shot a perfect 7-of-7 from the field, including 4-of-4 from three-point range en route to 18 points at Notre Dame (12/3). He ranked fourth on the team with 23 steals, highlighted by three steals at Nebraska (1/24). He shot .808 (42-52) from the foul line, ranking second on the team and shot .450 (9-20) from three-point range during MSU's NCAA Tournament run to the Final Four. He scored 14 points in two NCAA Tournament games against Georgia (3/20) in the second round and Louisville (3/29) in the Elite Eight and scored the first five points of overtime in MSU's Elite Eight overtime victory, knocking down a three-pointer on the first possession of the extra stanza. His career-best of four assists against Arkansas-Pine Bluff came on December 6. === Senior year (2015\u201316) === Forbes' senior year was one of much improvement. He became one of the country's top three-point shooters, making close to 50%. He was the recipient of many awards and records during his senior year at Michigan State. On March 2, 2016, Forbes hit a team and Big Ten Conference record 11 three-point field goals, while leading Michigan State to a 97-66 win over Rutgers. Forbes, along with Denzel Valentine, was selected to the NCAA College Basketball Three-Point Contest following his senior year.
