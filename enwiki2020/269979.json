    "text": "Roberto Cofres\u00ed y Ram\u00edrez de Arellano (June 17, 1791 \u2013 March 29, 1825), better known as El Pirata Cofres\u00ed, was a pirate from Puerto Rico. He was born into a noble family, but the political and economic difficulties faced by the island as a colony of the Spanish Empire during the Latin American wars of independence meant that his household was poor. Cofres\u00ed worked at sea from an early age which familiarized him with the region's geography, but it provided only a modest salary, and he eventually decided to abandon the sailor's life and became a pirate. He had previous links to land-based criminal activities, but the reason for Cofres\u00ed's change of vocation is unknown; historians speculate that he may have worked as a privateer aboard El Scipi\u00f3n, a ship owned by one of his cousins. At the height of his career, Cofres\u00ed evaded capture by vessels from Spain, Gran Colombia, the United Kingdom, Denmark, France, and the United States. He commanded several small-draft vessels, the best known a fast six-gun sloop named Anne, and he had a preference for speed and maneuverability over firepower. He manned them with small, rotating crews which most contemporaneous documents numbered at 10 to 20. He preferred to outrun his pursuers, but his flotilla engaged the West Indies Squadron twice, attacking the schooners USS Grampus and USS Beagle. Most crew members were recruited locally, although men occasionally joined them from the other Antilles, Central America, and Europe. He never confessed to murder, but he reportedly boasted about his crimes, and 300 to 400 people died as a result of his pillaging, mostly foreigners. Cofres\u00ed proved too much for local authorities, who accepted international help to capture the pirate; Spain created an alliance with the West Indies Squadron and the Danish government of Saint Thomas. On March 5, 1825, the alliance set a trap which forced Anne into a naval battle. After 45 minutes, Cofres\u00ed abandoned his ship and escaped overland; he was recognized by a resident who ambushed and injured him. Cofres\u00ed was captured and imprisoned, making a last unsuccessful attempt to escape by trying to bribe an official with part of a hidden stash. The pirates were sent to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where a brief military tribunal found them guilty and sentenced them to death. On March 29, 1825, Cofres\u00ed and most of his crew were executed by firing squad. He inspired stories and myths after his death, most emphasizing a Robin Hood-like \"steal from the rich, give to the poor\" philosophy which became associated with him. This portrayal has grown into legend, commonly accepted as fact in Puerto Rico and throughout the West Indies. Some of these claim that Cofres\u00ed became part of the Puerto Rican independence movement and other secessionist initiatives, including Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar's campaign against Spain. Historical and mythical accounts of his life have inspired songs, poems, plays, books, and films. In Puerto Rico, caves, beaches, and other alleged hideouts or locations of buried treasure have been named after Cofres\u00ed, and a resort town is named for him near Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic. ==Early years== ===Lineage=== The Kupferschein family's coat of arms (1549). In 1945, historian Enrique Ram\u00edrez Brau speculated that Cofres\u00ed may have had Jewish ancestry. A theory, held by David Cuesta and historian Ursula Acosta (a member of the Puerto Rican Genealogy Society), held that the name Kupferstein (\"copper stone\") may have been chosen by his family when the 18th-century European Jewish population adopted surnames. The theory was later discarded when their research uncovered a complete family tree prepared by Cofres\u00ed's cousin, Luigi de Jenner, indicating that their name was spelled Kupferschein (not Kupferstein). Originally from Prague, Cofres\u00ed paternal patriarch Cristoforo Kupferschein received a recognition and coat of arms from Ferdinand I of Austria in December 1549 and eventually moved to Trieste. His last name was probably adapted from the town of Kufstein. After its arrival, the family became one of Trieste's early settlers. Cristoforo's son Felice was recognized as a noble in 1620, becoming Edler von Kupferschein. The family gained prestige and became one of the city's wealthiest, with the next generation receiving the best possible education and marrying into other influential families. Cofres\u00ed's grandfather, Giovanni Giuseppe Stanislao de Kupferschein, held several offices in the police, military and municipal administration. According to Acosta, Cofres\u00ed's father Francesco Giuseppe Fortunato von Kupferschein received a lateinschule education and left at age 19 for Frankfurt (probably in search of a university or legal practice). In Frankfurt he mingled with influential figures such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, returning to Trieste two years later. As a cosmopolitan, mercantile city Trieste was a probable hub of illicit trade, and Francesco was forced to leave after he killed Josephus Steffani on July 31, 1778. Although Steffani's death is commonly attributed to a duel, given their acquaintanceship (both worked at a criminal court) it may have been related to illegal activity. Francesco's name and those of four sailors soon became linked to the murder. Convicted in absentia, the fugitive remained in touch with his family. Francesco went to Barcelona, reportedly learning Spanish there. By 1784 he had settled in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, a harbor town recently separated from the municipality of San Germ\u00e1n and made the seat of an eponymous municipality, where he was accepted by the local aristocracy with the Spanish honorific Don (\"of noble origin\"). Francesco's name was Hispanicized to Francisco Jos\u00e9 Cofres\u00ed (his third given name was not), which was easier for his neighbors to pronounce. Since he was linked to illegal commerce in his homeland, he probably relocated to Cabo Rojo for strategic reasons; its harbor was far from San Juan, the capital. Francisco soon met Mar\u00eda Germana Ram\u00edrez de Arellano y Segarra, and they married. His wife was born to Clemente Ram\u00edrez de Arellano y del Toro y Qui\u00f1ones Rivera, a noble and first cousin of town founder Nicol\u00e1s Ram\u00edrez de Arellano y Mart\u00ednez de Matos. Her paternal family, descended from the Jimena royal dynasty of the Kingdom of Navarre and the first royal house of the Kingdom of Arag\u00f3n (said house was established by a Jimena prince), owned a significant amount of land in Cabo Rojo. After their marriage the couple settled in El Tujao (or El Tujado), near the coast. Francisco's father Giovanni died in 1789, and a petition pardoning him for Steffani's murder a decade before was granted two years later (enabling him to return to Trieste). However, no evidence exists that Francisco ever returned to the city. ===Penniless nobleman and marauder=== The Latin American wars of independence had repercussions in Puerto Rico; due to widespread privateering and other naval warfare, maritime commerce suffered heavily. Cabo Rojo was among the municipalities affected most, with its ports at a virtual standstill. African slaves took to the sea in an attempt at freedom; merchants were assessed higher taxes and harassed by foreigners. Under these conditions, Cofres\u00ed was born to Francisco and Mar\u00eda Germana. The youngest of four children, he had one sister (Juana) and two brothers (Juan Francisco and Juan Ignacio). Cofres\u00ed was baptized into the Catholic Church by Jos\u00e9 de Roxas, the first priest in Cabo Rojo, when he was fifteen days old. Mar\u00eda died when Cofres\u00ed was four years old, and an aunt assumed his upbringing. Francisco then began a relationship with Mar\u00eda Sanabria, the mother of his last child Juli\u00e1n. A don by birth, Cofres\u00ed's education was above average; since there is no evidence of a school in Cabo Rojo at that time, Francisco may have educated his children or hired a tutor. The Cofres\u00eds, raised in a multicultural environment, probably knew Dutch and Italian. In November 1814 Francisco died, leaving a modest estate; Roberto was probably homeless, with no income. On January 14, 1815, three months after his father's death, Cofres\u00ed married Juana Creitoff in San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel parish, Cabo Rojo. Contemporary documents are unclear about her birthplace; although it is also listed as Cura\u00e7ao, she was probably born in Cabo Rojo to Dutch parents. After their marriage, the couple moved to a residence bought for 50 pesos by Creitoff's father, Geraldo. Months later Cofres\u00ed's father in-law lost his humble home in a fire, plunging the family into debt. Three years after his marriage Cofres\u00ed owned no property and lived with his mother-in-law, Anna Cordelia. He established ties with residents of San Germ\u00e1n, including his brothers-in-law: the wealthy merchant Don Jacobo Ufret and Don Manuel Ufret. The couple struggled to begin a family of their own, conceiving two sons (Juan and Francisco Mat\u00edas) who died soon after birth. Although he belonged to a prestigious family, Cofres\u00ed was not wealthy. In 1818 he paid 17 maraved\u00eds in taxes, spending most of his time at sea and earning a low wage. According to historian Walter Cardona Bonet, Cofres\u00ed probably worked in a number of fishing corrals in Boquer\u00f3n Bay. The corrals belonged to the aristocrat Crist\u00f3bal Pab\u00f3n D\u00e1vila, a friend of municipal port captain Jos\u00e9 Mendoza. This connection is believed to have later protected Cofres\u00ed, since Mendoza was godfather to several of his brother Juan Francisco's children. The following year he first appeared on a government registry as a sailor, and there is no evidence linking him to any other jobs in Cabo Rojo. Although Cofres\u00ed's brothers were maritime merchants and sailed a boat, Avispa, he probably worked as an able fisherman. On December 28, 1819 Cofres\u00ed was registered on Ramona, ferrying goods between the southern municipalities. In addition, her frequent voyages to the Mona Passage and Cofres\u00ed's recognition by local residents indicate that he occasionally accompanied Avispa That year, Cofres\u00ed and Juana lived in Barrio del Pueblo and paid higher taxes than the previous year: five reales. Political changes in Spain affected Puerto Rico's stability during the first two decades of the 19th century. Europeans and refugees from the American colonies began arriving after the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815, changing the archipelago's economic and political environments. With strategic acquisitions, the new arrivals triggered a rise in prices. Food distribution was inefficient, particularly in non-agricultural areas. Unmotivated and desperate, the local population drifted toward crime and dissipation. By 1816, governor Salvador Mel\u00e9ndez Bruna shifted responsibility for law enforcement from the Captaincy General of Puerto Rico to the mayors. Driven by hunger and poverty, highway robbers continued to roam southern and central Puerto Rico. In 1817 wealthy San Germ\u00e1n residents requested help with the criminals, who were invading houses and shops. The following year, Mel\u00e9ndez established a high-security prison at El Arsenal in San Juan. During the next few years, the governor transferred repeat offenders to San Juan. Cabo Rojo, with its high crime rate, also dealt with civil strife, inefficient law enforcement and corrupt officials. While he was still a don, Cofres\u00ed led a criminal gang in San Germ\u00e1n which stole cattle, food and crops. He was linked to an organization operating near the Hormigueros barrio since at least 1818 and to another nobleman, Juan Geraldo Bey. Among Cofres\u00ed's associates were Juan de los Reyes, Jos\u00e9 Cartagena and Francisco Ramos, and the criminals continued to thrive in 1820. The situation worsened with the arrival of unauthorized street vendors from nearby municipalities, who were soon robbed. A series of storms and droughts drove residents away from Cabo Rojo, worsening the already-poor economy; authorities retrained the unemployed and underemployed as night watchmen. The regional harvest was destroyed by a September 28, 1820 hurricane, triggering the region's largest crime wave to date. Newly appointed Puerto Rican governor Gonzalo Ar\u00f3stegui Herrera immediately ordered Lieutenant Antonio Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez to round up as many criminals as possible. On November 22, 1820, a group of fifteen men from Cabo Rojo participated in the highway robbery of Francisco de Rivera, Nicol\u00e1s Vald\u00e9s and Francisco Lamboy on the outskirts of Yauco. Cofres\u00ed is believed to have been involved in this incident because of its timing and the criminals' link to an area headed by his friend, Crist\u00f3bal Pab\u00f3n D\u00e1vila. The incident sparked an uproar in towns throughout the region, and convinced the governor that the authorities were conspiring with the criminals. Among measures taken by Ar\u00f3stegui were a mayoral election in Cabo Rojo (Juan Evangelista Ram\u00edrez de Arellano, one of Cofres\u00ed's relatives, was elected) and an investigation of the former mayor. The incoming mayor was ordered to control crime in the region, an unrealistic demand with the resources at his disposal. Bernardo Pab\u00f3n Davila, a friend of Cofres\u00ed and relative of Crist\u00f3bal, was assigned to prosecute the Yauco incident. Bernardo reportedly protected the accused and argued against pursuing the case, saying that according to \"private confidences\" they were fleeing to the United States. Other initiatives to capture highway robbers in Cabo Rojo were more successful, resulting in over a dozen arrests; among them was the nobleman Bey, who was charged with murder. Known as \"El Holand\u00e9s\", Bey testified that Cofres\u00ed led a criminal gang. Cofres\u00ed's primary collaborators were the Ram\u00edrez de Arellano family, who prevented his capture as Cabo Rojo's founding family with high positions in politics and law enforcement. The central government issued wanted posters for Cofres\u00ed, and in July 1821 he and the rest of his gang were captured; Bey escaped, becoming a fugitive. Cofres\u00ed and his men were tried in San Germ\u00e1n's courthouse, where their connection to several crimes was proven. On August 17, 1821 (while Cofres\u00ed was in prison) Juana gave birth to their only daughter, Bernardina. Due to his noble status, Cofres\u00ed probably received a pass for the birth and took the opportunity to escape; in alternative theories, he broke out or was released on parole. While Cofres\u00ed was a fugitive, Bernardo Pab\u00f3n Davila was Bernardina's godfather and Fel\u00edcita Asencio her godmother. On December 4, 1821, a wanted poster was circulated by San Germ\u00e1n mayor Pascacio Cardona. There is little documentation of Cofres\u00ed's whereabouts in 1822. Historians have suggested that he exploited his upper- class connections to remain concealed; the Ram\u00edrez de Arellano family held most regional public offices, and their influence extended beyond the region. Other wealthy families, including the Beys, had similarly protected their relatives and Cofres\u00ed may have hidden in plain sight due to the inertia of Cabo Rojo authorities. When he became a wanted man, he moved Juana and Anna to her brothers' houses and would visit in secret; Juana also visited him at his headquarters in the rural ward of Pedernales in Cabo Rojo. It is unknown how far Cofres\u00ed traveled during this time, but he had associates on the east coast and may have taken advantage of eastern migration from Cabo Rojo. Although he may have been captured and imprisoned in San Juan, he does not appear in contemporary records. However, Cofres\u00ed's associates Juan \"El Indio\" de los Reyes, Francisco Ramos and Jos\u00e9 \"Pepe\" Cartagena were released only months before his recorded reappearance. ==\"Last of the West India pirates\"== ===Establishing a reputation=== By 1823 Cofres\u00ed was probably on the crew of the corsair barquentine El Scipi\u00f3n, captained by Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Torres and managed by his cousin (the first mayor of Mayag\u00fcez, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ram\u00edrez de Arellano). Historians agree, since several of his friends and family members benefited from the sale of stolen goods. Cofres\u00ed may have joined to evade the authorities, honing skills he would use later in life. El Scipi\u00f3n employed questionable tactics later associated with the pirate, such as flying the flag of Gran Colombia so other ships would lower their guard (as she did in capturing the British frigate Aurora and the American brigantine Otter). The capture of Otter led to a court order requiring restitution, affecting the crew. At this time, Cofres\u00ed turned to piracy. Although the reasons behind his decision are unclear, several theories have been proposed by researchers. In Or\u00edgenes portorrique\u00f1os Ram\u00edrez Brau speculates that Cofres\u00ed's time aboard El Scipi\u00f3n, or seeing a family member become a privateer, may have influenced his decision to become a pirate after the crew's pay was threatened by the lawsuit. According to Acosta, a lack of work for privateers ultimately pushed Cofres\u00ed into piracy. The timing of this decision was crucial in establishing him as the dominant Caribbean pirate of the era. Cofres\u00ed began his new career in early 1823, filling a role vacant in the Spanish Main since the death of Jean Lafitte, and was the last major target of West Indies anti-piracy operations. While piracy was heavily monitored and most pirates were rarely successful, Cofres\u00ed was confirmed to have plundered at least eight vessels and has been credited with over 70 captures. Unlike his predecessors, Cofres\u00ed is not known to have imposed a pirate code on his crew; his leadership was enhanced by an audacious personality, a trait acknowledged even by his pursuers. According to 19th-century reports he had a rule of engagement that when a vessel was captured, only those willing to join his crew were permitted to live. Cofres\u00ed's influence extended to a large number of civil informants and associates, forming a network which took 14 years after his death to fully dismantle. The earliest document linked to Cofres\u00ed's modus operandi is a letter dated July 5, 1823, from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico which was published in the St. Thomas Gazette. The letter reported that a brigantine, loaded with coffee and West Indian indigo from La Guaira, was boarded by pirates on June 12. The hijackers ordered the ship brought to Isla de Mona (incorrectly anglicized as \"Monkey Island\"), a small island in the eponymous passage between Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, where its captain and crew were ordered to unload the cargo. After this was done, the pirates reportedly killed the sailors and sank the brigantine. Both of Cofres\u00ed's brothers were soon involved in his operation, helping him move plunder and deal with captured ships. Juan Francisco was able to gather information about maritime traffic in his work at the port, presumably forwarding it to his brother. The pirates communicated with their cohorts through coastal signs, and their associates on land warned them of danger; the system was probably used to identify loaded vessels as well. According to Puerto Rican historian Aurelio Ti\u00f3, Cofres\u00ed shared his loot with the needy (especially family members and close friends) and was considered the Puerto Rican equivalent of Robin Hood.Puerto Rican Folkloric Dance, Retrieved April 2, 2008 Acosta disagrees, saying that any acts of generosity were probably opportunistic. Cardona Bonet's research suggests that Cofres\u00ed organized improvised markets in Cabo Rojo, where plunder would be informally sold; according to this theory, merchant families would buy goods for resale to the public. The process was facilitated by local collaborators, such as French smuggler Juan Bautista Buy\u00e9. On October 28, 1823, months after the El Scipi\u00f3n case was settled, Cofres\u00ed attacked a ship registered to the harbor of Patillas and robbed the small fishing boat of 800 pesos in cash. Cofres\u00ed attacked with other members of his gang and that of another pirate, Manuel Lamparo, who was connected to British pirate Samuel McMorren (also known as Juan Bron). That week he also led the capture of John, an American schooner. Out of Newburyport and captained by Daniel Knight, on its way to Mayag\u00fcez the ship was intercepted by a ten-ton schooner armed with a swivel gun near Desecheo Island. Cofres\u00ed's group, consisting of seven pirates armed with sabers and muskets, stole $1,000 in cash, tobacco, tar and other provisions and the vessel's square rig and mainsail. Cofres\u00ed ordered the crew to head for Santo Domingo, threatening to kill everyone aboard if they were seen at any Puerto Rican port. Despite the threat, Knight went to Mayag\u00fcez and reported the incident. Map of the area where Cofres\u00ed and his men usually operated: Puerto Rico, Mona, Vieques (Crab Island), Culebra, Saona, Hispaniola and Saint Thomas It was soon established that some of the pirates were from Cabo Rojo, since they disembarked there. Undercover agents were sent to the town to track them, and new mayor Juan Font y Soler requested resources to deal with a larger group which was out of control. Links between the pirates and local sympathizers made arresting them difficult. The central government, frustrated with Cabo Rojo's inefficiency, demanded the pirates' capture and western Puerto Rico military commander Jos\u00e9 Rivas was ordered to exert pressure on local authorities. Although Cofres\u00ed was tracked to the beach in Pe\u00f1ones, near his brothers' homes in Guaniquilla, the operation only recovered the Johns sails, meat, flour, cheese, lard, butter and candles; the pirates escaped aboard a schooner. A detachment caught Juan Jos\u00e9 Mateu and charged him with conspiracy; his confession linked Cofres\u00ed to the two hijackings. Cofres\u00ed's sudden success was an oddity, nearly a century after the end of the Golden Age of Piracy. By this time, joint governmental efforts had eradicated rampant buccaneering by Anglo-French seamen (primarily based on Jamaica and Tortuga), which had turned the Caribbean into a haven for pirates attacking shipments from the region's Spanish colonies; this made his capture a priority. By late 1823, the pursuit on land probably forced Cofres\u00ed to move his main base of operations to Mona; the following year, he was often there. This base, initially a temporary haven with Barrio Pedernales his stable outpost, became more heavily used. Easily accessible from Cabo Rojo, Mona had been associated with pirates for more than a century; it was visited by William Kidd, who landed in 1699 after fleeing with a load of gold, silver and iron. A second pirate base was found at Saona, an island south of Hispaniola. In November a number of sailors aboard El Scipi\u00f3n took advantage of her officers' shore leave and mutinied, seizing control of the ship. The vessel, repurposed as a pirate ship, began operating in the Mona Passage and was later seen at Mayag\u00fcez before disappearing from the record. Cofres\u00ed was linked to El Scipi\u00f3n by pirate Jaime M\u00e1rquez, who admitted under police questioning on Saint Thomas that boatswain Manuel Reyes Paz was a Cofres\u00ed associate. The confession hints that the ship was captured by Hispaniola authorities. Cofres\u00ed is recorded in eastern Hispaniola (then part of the unified Republic of Haiti, modern-day Dominican Republic), where his crew reportedly rested off Puerto Plata province. On one excursion, the pirates were intercepted by Spanish patrol boats off the coast of Saman\u00e1 Province. With no apparent escape route, Cofres\u00ed is said to have ordered the vessel's sinking and it sailed into Bah\u00eda de Saman\u00e1 before coming to rest near the town of Punta Gorda. This created a diversion, allowing him and his crew to escape in skiffs they rowed to shore and adjacent wetlands (where the larger Spanish ships could not follow). The remains of the ship, reportedly full of plunder, have not been found. In an article in the May 9, 1936 issue of Puerto Rico Ilustrado, Eugenio Astol described an 1823 incident between Cofres\u00ed and Puerto Rican physician and politician Pedro Ger\u00f3nimo Goyco. The 15-year-old Goyco traveled alone on a schooner to a Santo Domingo school for his secondary education. In mid-voyage, Cofres\u00ed intercepted the ship and the pirates boarded it. Cofres\u00ed assembled the passengers, asking their names and those of their parents. When he learned that Goyco was among them, the pirate ordered a change of course; they landed on a beach near Mayag\u00fcez, where Goyco was freed. Cofres\u00ed explained that he knew Goyco's father, an immigrant from Herceg Novi named Ger\u00f3nimo Goicovich who had settled in Mayag\u00fcez. Goyco returned home safely, later attempting the voyage again. The elder Goicovich had favored members of Cofres\u00ed's family, despite their association with a pirate. Goyco grew up to become a militant abolitionist, similar to Ram\u00f3n Emeterio Betances and Segundo Ruiz Belvis. Cofres\u00ed's actions quickly gained the attention of the Anglo-American nations, who called him \"Cofrecinas\" (a mistranslated, onomatopoeic variant of his last name). Commercial agent and ambassador to the United States Judah Lord wrote to John Quincy Adams (then United States Secretary of State) describing the El Scipi\u00f3n situation and the capture of John. Adams relayed the information to Commodore David Porter, leader of the anti-piracy West Indies Squadron, who sent several ships to Puerto Rico. On November 27 Cofres\u00ed sailed from his base on Mona with two sloops (armed with pivot gun cannons) and assaulted another American ship, the brigantine William Henry. The Salem Gazette reported that the following month a schooner sailed from Santo Domingo to Saona, capturing 18 pirates (including Manuel Reyes Paz) and a \"considerable quantity\" of leather, coffee, indigo and cash. ===International manhunt=== Cofres\u00ed's victims were locals and foreigners, and the region was economically destabilized. When he boarded Spanish vessels he usually targeted immigrants brought by the royal decree of 1815, ignoring his fellow criollos. The situation was complicated by several factors, most of them geopolitical. The Spanish Empire had lost most of its possessions in the New World, and her last two territories (Puerto Rico and Cuba) faced economic problems and political unrest. To undermine the commerce of former colonies, Spain stopped issuing letters of marque; this left sailors unemployed, and they gravitated towards Cofres\u00ed and piracy. On the diplomatic front, the pirates assaulted foreign ships while flying the Flag of Spain (angering nations who had reached an agreement about the return of ships captured by corsairs and compensation for losses). Aware that the problem had developed international overtones, Spanish-appointed governor of Puerto Rico Lt. Gen. Miguel Luciano de la Torre y Pando (1822\u20131837) made Cofres\u00ed's capture a priority. By December 1823 other nations joined the effort to combat Cofres\u00ed, sending warships to the Mona Passage. Gran Colombia sent two corvettes, Bocay\u00e1 and Bol\u00edvar, under the command of former privateer and Jean Lafitte associate Renato Beluche. The British assigned the brig-sloop to the region after the William Henry incident. On January 23, 1824, de la Torre implemented anti-piracy measures in response to Spanish losses and political pressure from the United States, ordering that pirates be tried in a military tribunal with the defendants considered enemy combatants. De la Torre ordered the pursuit of pirates, bandits, and those aiding them, issuing medals, certificates and bounties in gold and silver as rewards. Manuel Lamparo was captured on Puerto Rico's east coast, and some of his crew joined Cofres\u00ed and other fugitives. United States Secretary of the Navy Samuel L. Southard ordered David Porter to assign ships to the Mona Passage, and the commodore sent the schooner and the brigantine . The ships were to investigate the zone, gathering information at Saint Barth\u00e9lemy and St. Thomas with the goal of destroying the base at Mona. Although Porter warned that the pirates were reportedly well-armed and -supplied, he said the crews would probably not find plunder at the base because of the proximity of eastern Puerto Rican ports. On February 8, 1824, the Spark arrived at Mona, conducted reconnaissance and landed. A suspicious schooner was seen, but captain John T. Newton decided not to chase her. The crew found a small settlement with an empty hut and other buildings, a chest of medicine, sails, books, an anchor and documents from William Henry. Newton ordered the base and a large canoe found in the vicinity destroyed, and reported his findings to the Secretary of the Navy. According to another report, the ship sent was the USS Beagle; in this account, several pirates eluded the Beagles crew. Undeterred, Cofres\u00ed quickly resettled on Mona. Attacks on two brigantines were reported by Renato Beluche on February 12, 1824, and published in El Colombiano several days later. The first was Boniton, captained by Alexander Murdock, which sailed with a load of cocoa from Trinidad and was intercepted en route to Gibraltar. The second, Bonne Sophie, sailed from Havre de Grace under the command of a man named Chevanche with dry goods bound for Martinique. In both cases, the sailors were beaten and imprisoned and the ships plundered. The ships were part of a convoy escorted by the Bol\u00edvar off Puerto Real, Cabo Rojo, and Cofres\u00ed captained a ship identified by Beluche as a pailebot (a small schooner). Although Bol\u00edvar could not capture her, her crew described the vessel as painted black, armed with a rotating cannon and having a crew of twenty unidentified Puerto Rican men. Cofres\u00ed was presumably leading the vessels to dock at Pedernales, where Mendoza and his brother could facilitate the distribution of loot with the aid of official inertia. From there, other associates usually used Boquer\u00f3n Bay for transportation and ensured that the loot reached stores in Cabo Rojo and nearby towns. In this region Cofres\u00ed's influence extended to government and the military, with the Ram\u00edrez de Arellano family involved in the smuggling and sale of his loot. On land the loot, hidden in sacks and barrels, was brought to Mayag\u00fcez, Hormigueros or San Germ\u00e1n for distribution. When Beluche returned to Colombia, he published an article critical of the situation in the press. La Gaceta de Puerto Rico countered, accusing him of stealing Bonne Sophie and connecting him to the pirates. On February 16, 1824, de la Torre mandated a more-aggressive pursuit and prosecution of pirates. In March the governor ordered a search for the schooner Caballo Blanco, reportedly used in the boarding of Boniton and Bonne Sophie and similar attacks. In private communication with Mayag\u00fcez military commander Jos\u00e9 Rivas, he asked Rivas to find someone trustworthy who could launch a mission to capture \"the so-called Cofresin\" and to notify him personally of the pirate's arrest. Authorizing the use of force, the governor described Cofres\u00ed as \"one of the evil ones that I am pursuing\" and acknowledged that the pirate was protected by Cabo Rojo authorities. The mayor was unable (or unwilling) to cooperate, despite orders from de la Torre. Rivas tracked Cofres\u00ed to his house twice, but found it empty. When the captain lost contact with the pirate and his wife, he was also unable to communicate with the mayor. A similar search was undertaken in San Germ\u00e1n, whose mayor reported to de la Torre on March 12, 1824. Martinique governor Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Donzelot wrote to de la Torre on March 22, concerned about the capture of Bonne Sophie and the impact of piracy on maritime commerce. This brought France into the search for Cofres\u00ed; on March 23 de la Torre authorized France to patrol the Puerto Rican coast and commissioned a frigate, Flora. The mission was led by a military commander named Mallet, who was ordered to the west coast and pursue the pirates \"until he [was] able to trap and destroy them\". Although Flora arrived three days after the operation's approval, the attempt was unsuccessful. Rivas then assigned Joaqu\u00edn Arroyo, a retired Pedernales militiaman, to monitor activity near Cofres\u00ed's house. 1824 wanted poster, offering a bounty in gold and silver for Cofres\u00ed's capture In April 1824, Rinc\u00f3n mayor Pedro Garc\u00eda authorized the sale of a vessel owned by Juan Bautista de Salas to Pedro Ram\u00edrez. Ram\u00edrez, who may have been a member of the Ram\u00edrez de Arellano family, lived in Pedernales and was a neighbor of Cofres\u00ed's brothers and Cristobal Pab\u00f3n Davila. On April 30, shortly after acquiring the ship, Ram\u00edrez sold it to Cofres\u00ed (who used it as a pirate flagship). The irregularity of the transactions was quickly noticed, prompting an investigation of Garc\u00eda. The scandal weakened his already-frail authority, and Mat\u00edas Conchuela intervened as the governor's representative. De la Torre asked the mayor of A\u00f1asco, Thom\u00e1s de la Concha, to retrieve the records and verify their accuracy. The investigation, led by public prosecutor Jos\u00e9 Madrazo of the Regimiento de Granada's Military Anti-Piracy Commission, concluded with Bautista's imprisonment and sanctions for Garc\u00eda. Several members of the Ram\u00edrez de Arellano family were prosecuted, including the former mayors of A\u00f1asco and Mayag\u00fcez (Manuel and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda), T\u00f3mas and Antonio. Others with the same last name but unclear parentage, such as Juan Lorenzo Ramirez, were also linked to Cofres\u00ed. A number of unsuccessful searches were carried out in Cabo Rojo by an urban militia led by Captain Carlos de Espada, and additional searches were made in San Germ\u00e1n. On May 23, 1824, the Mayag\u00fcez military commander prepared two vessels and sent them to Pedernales in response to reported sightings of Cofres\u00ed. Rivas and the military captain of Mayag\u00fcez, Cayetano Castillo y Picado, boarded a ship commanded by Sergeant Sebasti\u00e1n Baus\u00e1. Sailor Pedro Alac\u00e1n, best known as the grandfather of Ram\u00f3n Emeterio Betances and a neighbor of Cofres\u00ed, was captain of the second schooner. The expedition failed, only finding a military deserter named Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdova. Also known as Manuel Navarro, Fern\u00e1ndez was connected to Cofres\u00ed through Lucas Branstan (a merchant from Trieste who was involved in Bonne Sophie incident). In the meantime, the pirates fled toward southern Puerto Rico. Poorly supplied after his hasty retreat, Cofres\u00ed docked at Jobos Bay on June 2, 1824; about a dozen pirates invaded the hacienda of Francisco Antonio Ortiz, stealing his cattle. The group then broke into a second estate, owned by Jacinto Texidor, stole plantains and resupplied their ship. It is now believed that Juan Jos\u00e9 Mateu gave the pirates refuge in one of his haciendas, near Jobos Bay. The next day the news reached Guayama mayor Francisco Brenes, who quickly contacted the military and requested operations by land and sea. He was told that there were not enough weapons in the municipality for a mission of that scale. Brenes then requested supplies from Patillas, which rushed him twenty guns. However, the pirates fled the municipality and traveled west. On June 9, 1824, Cofres\u00ed led an assault on the schooner San Jos\u00e9 y Las Animas off the coast of Tallaboa in Pe\u00f1uelas. The ship was en route between Saint Thomas and Guayanilla with over 6,000 pesos' worth of dry goods for F\u00e9lix and Miguel Mattei, who were aboard. The Mattei brothers are now thought to have been anti-establishment smugglers related to Henri La Fayette Villaume Ducoudray Holstein and the Ducoudray Holstein Expedition. The schooner, owned by Santos Lucca, sailed with captain Francisco Ocasio and a crew of four. Frequently used to transport cargo throughout the southern region and Saint Thomas, she made several trips to Cabo Rojo. When Cofres\u00ed began the chase, Ocasio headed landward; the brothers abandoned ship and swam ashore, from where they watched the ship's plundering. Portugu\u00e9s was second-in-command during the boarding of San Jos\u00e9 y las Animas, and Joaqu\u00edn \"El Campechano\" Hern\u00e1ndez was a crew member. The pirates took most of the merchandise, leaving goods valued at 418 pesos, three reales and 26 maravedi. Governor Miguel de la Torre was visiting nearby municipalities at the time, which occupied the authorities. Cargo from San Jos\u00e9 y Las Animas (clothing belonging to the brothers and a painting) was later found at Cabo Rojo. Days later, a sloop and a small boat commanded by Luis S\u00e1nchez and Francisco Guilfuchi left Guayama in search of Cofres\u00ed. Unable to find him, they returned on June 19, 1824. Patillas and Guayama enacted measures, monitored by the governor, which were intended to prevent further visits. De la Torre continued his tour of the municipalities, ordering Rivas to focus on the Cabo Rojo area when he reached Mayag\u00fcez. The task was given to Lieutenant Antonio Madrona, leader of the Mayag\u00fcez garrison. Madrona assembled troops and left for Cabo Rojo, launching an operation on June 17 which ended with the arrest of pirate Eustaquio Ventura de Luciano at the home of Juan Francisco. The troops came close to capturing a second associate, Joaqu\u00edn \"El Maracaybero\" G\u00f3mez. Madrona then began a surprise attack at Pedernales, finding Cofres\u00ed and several associates (including Juan Bey, his brother Ignacio and his brother-in-law Juan Francisco Creitoff). The pirates' only option was to flee on foot. The Cofres\u00ed brothers escaped, but Creitoff and Bey were captured and tried in San Germ\u00e1n. Troops later visited Creitoff's house, where they found Cofres\u00ed's wife and mother-in-law. Under questioning, the women confirmed the brothers' identities. The authorities continued searching the homes of those involved and those of their families, where they found quantities of plunder hidden and prepared for sale. Madrona also found burned loot on a nearby hill. Juan Francisco Cofres\u00ed, Ventura de Luciano and Creitoff were sent to San Juan with other suspected associates. Of this group the pirate's brother, Luis de R\u00edo and Juan Bautista Buy\u00e9 were prosecuted as accomplices instead of pirates. Ignacio was later arrested and also charged as an accomplice. The Mattei brothers filed a claim against shopkeeper Francisco Betances that some of his merchandise was cargo from San Jos\u00e9 y Las Animas. In response to a tip, Jos\u00e9 Mendoza and Rivas organized an expedition to Mona. On June 22, 1824, Pedro Alac\u00e1n assembled a party of eight volunteers (among them Joaqu\u00edn Arroyo, possibly Mendoza's source). He loaned a small sailboat he co- owned (Avispa, once used by Cofres\u00ed's brothers) to Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Mendoza and Antonio Gueyh. There were eight volunteers, The locally coordinated operation intended to ambush and apprehend Cofres\u00ed in his hideout. The expedition left the coast of Cabo Rojo with Action Stations in place. Despite unfavorable sea conditions, the party arrived at their destination. However, as soon as they disembarked Avispa was lost. Although most of the pirates were captured without incident, Cofres\u00ed's second in-command Juan Portugu\u00e9s was shot to death in the back and dismembered by crewmember Lorenzo Camareno. Among the captives was a man identified as Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, but Cofres\u00ed was not with his crew. Five days later, they returned to Cabo Rojo on a ship confiscated from the pirates with weapons, three prisoners and Portugu\u00e9s' head and right hand (probably for identification when claiming the bounty). Rivas contacted de la Torre, informing him of further measures to track the pirates. The governor publicized the expedition, writing an account which was published in the government newspaper La Gaceta del Gobierno de Puerto Rico on July 9, 1824. Alac\u00e1n was honored by the Spanish government, receiving the ship recovered from the pirates as compensation for the loss of the Avispa. Mendoza and the crew were also honored. Cofres\u00ed reportedly escaped in one of his ships with \"Campechano\" Hern\u00e1ndez, resuming his attacks soon after the ambush. Shortly after the Mona expedition, Ponce mayor Jos\u00e9 Ort\u00edz de la Renta began his own search for Cofres\u00ed. On June 30, 1824, the schooner Uni\u00f3n left with 42 sailors commanded by captain Francisco Francheschi. After three days, the search was abandoned and the ship returned to Ponce. The governor enacted more measures to capture the pirates, including the commission of gunboats. De la Torre ordered the destruction of any hut or abandoned ship which might aid Cofres\u00ed in his escape attempts, an initiative carried out on the coasts of several municipalities. Again acting on the basis of information obtained by interrogation, the authorities tracked the pirates during the first week of July. Although Jos\u00e9 \"Pepe\" Cartagena (a local mulatto) and Juan Geraldo Bey were found in Cabo Rojo and San Germ\u00e1n respectively, Cofres\u00ed avoided the troops. On July 6, 1824, Cartagena resisted arrest and was killed in a shootout, with the developments again featured in La Gaceta del Gobierno de Puerto Rico. During the next few weeks, a joint initiative by Rivas and the west coast mayors led to the arrest of Cofres\u00ed associates Gregorio del Rosario, Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez, Felipe Carnero, Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez, G\u00f3mez, Roberto Francisco Reifles, Sebasti\u00e1n Gallardo, Francisco Ramos, Jos\u00e9 Vicente and a slave of Juan Nicol\u00e1s Bey (Juan Geraldo's father) known as Pablo. However, the pirate again evaded the net. In his confession, Pablo testified that Juan Geraldo Bey was an accomplice of Cofres\u00ed. Sebasti\u00e1n Gallardo was captured on July 13, 1824, and tried as a collaborator. The defendants were transported to San Juan, where they were prosecuted by Madrazo in a military tribunal overseen by the governor. The trial was plagued by irregularities, including G\u00f3mez' allegation that the public attorney had accepted a bribe of 300 pesos from Juan Francisco. During the searches, the pirates stole a \"sturdy, copper- plated boat\" from Cabo Rojo and escaped. The ship was originally stolen in San Juan by Gregorio Pereza and Francisco P\u00e9rez (both arrested during the search for Caballo Blanco) and given to Cofres\u00ed. When the news became public, mayor Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Hurtado asked local residents for help. On August 5, 1824, Antonio de Irizarry found the boat at Punta Arenas, a cape in the Joyuda barrio. The mayor quickly organized his troops, reaching the location on horseback. Aboard the ship they found three rifles, three guns, a carbine, a cannon, ammunition and supplies. After an unsuccessful search of nearby woods, the mayor sailed the craft to Pedernales and turned it over to Mendoza. A group left behind continued the search, but did not find anyone. Assuming that the pirates had fled inland, Hurtado alerted his colleagues in the region about the find. The mayor resumed the search, but abandoned it due to a rainstorm and poor directions. Peraza, P\u00e9rez, Jos\u00e9 Rivas del Mar, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Correa and Jos\u00e9 Antonio Martinez were later arrested, but Cofres\u00ed remained free. On August 5, 1824, the pirate and a skeleton crew captured the sloop Mar\u00eda off the coast of Guayama as she completed a run between Guayanilla and Ponce under the command of Juan Camino. After boarding the ship they decided not to plunder her, since a larger craft was sailing towards them. The pirates fled west, intercepting a second sloop (La Voladora) off Morillos. Cofres\u00ed did not plunder her either, instead requesting information from captain Rafael Mola. That month a ship commanded by the pirates stalked the port of Fajardo, taking advantage of the lack of gunboats capable of pursuing their shallow-draft vessels. Shortly afterwards, the United States ordered captain Charles Boarman of the USS Weasel to monitor the western waters of Puerto Rico as part of an international force. The schooner located a sloop commanded by the pirates off Culebra, but it fled to Vieques and ran inland into dense vegetation; Boarman could only recover the ship. The Danish sloop Jordenxiold was intercepted off Isla Palominos on September 3, 1824, as she completed a voyage from Saint Thomas to Fajardo; the pirates stole goods and cash from the passengers. The incident attracted the attention of the Danish government, which commissioned the Santa Cruz (a 16-gun brigantine commanded by Michael Klariman) to monitor the areas off Vieques and Culebra. On September 8\u20139 a hurricane, Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Monserrate, struck southern Puerto Rico and passed directly over the Mona Passage. Cofres\u00ed and his crew were caught in the storm, which drove their ship towards Hispaniola. According to historian Enrique Ram\u00edrez Brau, an expedition weeks later by Fajardo commander Ram\u00f3n Aboy to search Vieques, Culebra and the Windward Islands for pirates was actually after Cofres\u00ed. The operation used the schooner Aurora (owned by Nicol\u00e1s M\u00e1rquez) and Flor de Mayo, owned by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Marujo. After weeks of searching, the team failed to locate anything of interest. Continuing to drift, Cofres\u00ed and his crew were captured after his ship reached Santo Domingo. Sentenced to six years in prison, they were sent to a keep named Torre del Homenaje. Cofres\u00ed and his men escaped, were recaptured and again imprisoned. The group escaped again, breaking the locks on their cell doors and climbing down the prison walls on a stormy night on a rope made from their clothing. With Cofres\u00ed were two other inmates: a man known as Portalat\u00edn and Manuel Reyes Paz, former boatswain of El Scipi\u00f3n. After reaching the province of San Pedro de Macor\u00eds, the pirates bought a ship. They sailed from Hispaniola in late September to Naguabo, where Portalat\u00edn disembarked. From there they went to the island of Vieques, where they set up another hideout and regrouped. ===Challenge to the West Indies Squadron=== By October 1824 piracy in the region was dramatically reduced, with Cofres\u00ed the remaining target of concern. However, that month Peraza, P\u00e9rez, Hern\u00e1dez, Gallardo, Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez and Ramos escaped from jail. Three former members of Lamparo's crew\u2014a man of African descent named Bibi\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez Morales, Antonio del Castillo and Juan Manuel de Fuentes Rodr\u00edguez\u2014also broke out. They were joined by Juan Manuel \"Venado\" de Fuentes Rodr\u00edguez, Ignacio Cabrera, Miguel de la Cruz, Damasio Arroyo, Miguel \"El Rasgado\" de la Rosa and Juan Reyes. Those traveling east met with Cofres\u00ed, who welcomed them on his crew; the pirate was in Naguabo looking for recruits after his return from Hispaniola. Hern\u00e1ndez Morales, an experienced knife fighter, was second-in-command of the new crew. At the height of their success, they had a flotilla of three sloops and a schooner. The group avoided capture by hiding in Ceiba, Fajardo, Naguabo, Jobos Bay and Vieques, and when Cofres\u00ed sailed the east coast he reportedly flew the flag of Gran Colombia. On October 24, Hern\u00e1ndez Morales led a group of six pirates in the robbery of Cabot, Bailey & Company in Saint Thomas, making off with US$5,000. On October 26 the USS Beagle, commanded by Charles T. Platt, navigated by John Low and carrying shopkeeper George Bedford (with a list of plundered goods, which were reportedly near Naguabo) left Saint Thomas. Platt sailed to Vieques, following a tip about a pirate sloop. Beagle opened fire, interrupting the capture of a sloop from Saint Croix, but the pirates docked at Punta Arenas in Vieques and fled inland; one, identified as Juan Felis, was captured after a shootout. When Platt disembarked in Fajardo to contact Juan Campos, a local associate of Bedford, the authorities accused him of piracy and detained him. The officer was later freed, but the pirates escaped. Commodore Porter's reaction to what was later known as the Fajardo Affair led to a diplomatic crisis which threatened war between Spain and the United States; Campos was later found to be involved in the distribution of loot. With more ships, Cofres\u00ed's activity near Culebra and Vieques peaked by November 1824. The international force reacted by sending more warships to patrol the zone; France provided the Gazelle, a brigantine, and the frigate Constancia. After the Fajardo incident the United States increased its flotilla in the region, with the USS Beagle joined by the schooners and in addition to the previously-commissioned Santa Cruz and Scout. Despite unprecedented monitoring, Cofres\u00ed grew bolder. John D. Sloat, captain of Grampus, received intelligence placing the pirates in a schooner out of Cabo Rojo. On the evening of January 25, 1825 Cofres\u00ed sailed a sloop towards Grampus, which was patrolling the west coast. In position, the pirate commanded his crew (armed with sabers and muskets) to open fire and ordered the schooner to stop. When Sloat gave the order to counterattack, Cofres\u00ed sailed into the night. Although a skiff and cutters from Grampus were sent after the pirates, they failed to find them after a two-hour search. The pirates sailed east and docked at Quebrada de las Palmas, a river in Naguabo. From there, Cofres\u00ed, Hern\u00e1ndez Morales, Juan Francisco \"Ceniza\" Pizarro and De los Reyes crossed the mangroves and vegetation to the Quebrada barrio in Fajardo. Joined by a fugitive, Juan Pedro Espinoza, the group robbed the house of Juan Becerril and hid in a house in the nearby R\u00edo Abajo barrio. Two days later Cofres\u00ed again led his flotilla out to sea and targeted San Vicente, a Spanish sloop making its way back from Saint Thomas. Cofres\u00ed attacked with two sloops, ordering his crew to fire muskets and blunderbusses. Sustaining heavy damage, San Vicente finally escaped because she was near port. On February 10, 1825, Cofres\u00ed plundered the sloop Neptune. The merchant ship, with a cargo of fabric and provisions, was attacked while its dry goods were unloaded at dockside in Jobos Bay. Neptune was owned by Salvador Pastorisa, who was supervising the unloading. Cofres\u00ed began the charge in a sloop, opening musket fire on the crew, and Pastoriza fled in a rowboat. Despite a bullet wound, Pastoriza identified four of the eight to ten pirates (including Cofres\u00ed). An Italian living in Puerto Rico, Pedro Salovi, was reportedly second-in-command during the attack. The pirates pursued and shot those who fled. Cofres\u00ed sailed Neptune out of Jobos Port, a harbor in Jobos Bay (near Fajardo), and adopted the sloop as a pirate ship. Guayama mayor Francisco Brenes doubled his patrol. Salovi was soon arrested, and informed on his shipmates. Hern\u00e1ndez Morales led another sloop, intercepting Beagle off Vieques. After a battle, the pirate sloop was captured and Hern\u00e1ndez Morales was transported to St. Thomas for trial. After being sentenced to death, he escaped from prison and disappeared for years. According to a St. Thomas resident, on February 12, 1825 the pirates retaliated by setting fire to a town on the island. That week, Neptune captured a Danish schooner belonging to W. Furniss (a company based in Saint Thomas) off the Ponce coast with a load of imported merchandise. After the assault, Cofres\u00ed and his crew abandoned the ship at sea. Later seen floating with broken masts, it was presumed lost. Some time later Cofres\u00ed and his crew boarded another ship owned by the company near Guayama, again plundering and abandoning her. Like its predecessor, it was seen near Caja de Muertos (Dead Man's Chest) before disappearing. Evading Beagle, Cofres\u00ed returned to Jobos Bay; on February 15, 1825, the pirates arrived in Fajardo. Three days later John Low picked up a six-gun sloop, Anne (commonly known by her Spanish name Ana or La Ana), which he had ordered from boat-builder Toribio Centeno and registered in St. Thomas. Centeno sailed the sloop to Fajardo, where he received permission to dock at Quebrada de Palmas in Naguabo. As its new owner Low accompanied him, remaining aboard while cargo was loaded. That night Cofres\u00ed led a group of eight pirates, stealthily boarded the ship and forced the crew to jump overboard; during the capture, Cofres\u00ed reportedly picked $20 from Low's pocket. Despite having to \"walk the plank\", Low's crew survived and reported the assault to the governor of Saint Thomas. Low probably attracted the pirates' attention by docking near one of their hideouts; his work on the Beagle rankled, and they were hungry for revenge after the capture of Hern\u00e1ndez Morales. Low met Centeno at his hacienda, where he told the Spaniard about the incident and later filed a formal complaint in Fajardo. Afterwards, he and his crew sailed to Saint Thomas. Although another account suggests that Cofres\u00ed bought Anne from Centeno for twice Low's price, legal documents verify that the builder was paid by Low. Days later, Cofres\u00ed led his pirates to the Humacao shipyard and they stole a cannon from a gunboat (ordered by Miguel de la Torre to pursue the pirates) which was under construction. The crew armed themselves with weapons found on the ships they boarded. After the hijacking, Cofres\u00ed adopted Anne as his flagship. Although she is popularly believed to have been renamed El Mosquito, all official documents use her formal name. Anne was quickly used to intercept a merchant off the coast of Vieques who was completing a voyage from Saint Croix to Puerto Rico. Like others before it, the fate of the captured ship and its crew is unknown. The Spanish countered with an expedition from the port of Patillas. Captain Sebasti\u00e1n Quevedo commanded a small boat, Esperanza, to find the pirates but was unsuccessful after several days at sea. At the same time, de la Torre pressured the regional military commanders to take action against the pirates and undercover agents monitored maritime traffic in most coastal towns. The pirates docked Anne in Jobos Bay before sunset, a pattern reported by the local militia to southern region commander Tom\u00e1s de Renovales. At this time the pirates sailed Anne towards Pe\u00f1uelas, where the ship was recognized. Cofres\u00ed's last capture was on March 5, 1825, when he commanded the hijacking of a boat owned by Vicente Antoneti in Salinas. ==Capture and trial== Early 20th-century illustration of the capture of Cofres\u00ed's flagship, the sloop Anne (right) By the spring of 1825, the flotilla led by Anne was the last substantial pirate threat in the Caribbean. The incursion which finally ended Cofres\u00ed's operation began serendipitously. When Low arrived at his home base in Saint Thomas with news of Annes hijacking, a Puerto Rican ship reported a recent sighting. Sloat requested three international sloops (with Spanish and Danish papers) from the Danish governor, collaborating with Pastoriza and Pierety. All four of Cofres\u00ed's victims left port shortly after the authorization on March 4; the task force was made up of Grampus, San Jos\u00e9 y Las Animas, an unidentified vessel belonging to Pierety and a third sloop staffed by volunteers from a Colombian frigate. After sighting Anne while they negotiated the involvement of the Spanish government in Puerto Rico, the task force decided to split up. San Jos\u00e9 y Las Animas found Cofres\u00ed the next day, and mounted a surprise attack. The sailors aboard hid while Cofres\u00ed, recognizing the ship as a local merchant vessel, gave the order to attack it. When Anne was within range, the crew of San Jos\u00e9 y las Animas opened fire. Startled, the pirates countered with cannon and musket fire while attempting to outrun the sloop. Unable to shake off San Jos\u00e9 y las Animas and having lost two members of his crew, Cofres\u00ed grounded Anne and fled inland. Although a third pirate fell during the landing, most scattered throughout rural Guayama and adjacent areas. Cofres\u00ed, injured, was accompanied by two crew members. Half his crew was captured shortly afterwards, but the captain remained at large until the following day. At midnight a local trooper, Juan C\u00e1ndido Garay, and two other members of the Puerto Rican militia spotted Cofres\u00ed. The trio ambushed the pirate, who was hit by blunderbuss fire while he was fleeing. Despite his injury, Cofres\u00ed fought back with a knife until he was subdued by militia machetes. After their capture, the pirates were held at a prison in Guayama before their transfer to San Juan. Cofres\u00ed met with mayor Francisco Brenes, offering him 4,000 pieces of eight (which he claimed to possess) in exchange for his freedom. Although a key component of modern myth, this is the only historical reference to Cofres\u00ed's hiding any treasure. Brenes declined the bribe. Cofres\u00ed and his crew remained in Castillo San Felipe del Morro in San Juan for the rest of their lives. On March 21, 1825, the pirate's reputed servant (known only as Carlos) was arrested in Guayama. ===Military prosecution=== Cofres\u00ed received a council of war trial, with no possibility of a civil trial. The only right granted the pirates was to choose their lawyers; the arguments the attorneys could make were limited, and their role was a formality. Jos\u00e9 Madrazo was again the prosecutor. The case was hurried\u2014an oddity, since other cases as serious (or more so) sometimes took months or years. Cofres\u00ed was reportedly tried as an insurgent corsair (and listed as such in a subsequent explanatory action in Spain), in accordance with measures enacted by governor Miguel de la Torre the year before. It is thought that the reason for the irregularities was that the Spanish government was under international scrutiny, with several neutral countries filing complaints about pirate and privateer attacks in Puerto Rican waters; there was additional pressure due to the start of David Porter's court-martial in the United States for invading the municipality of Fajardo. The ministry rushed the Cofres\u00ed trial, denying him and his crew defense witnesses or testimony (required by trial protocol). The trial was based on the pirates' confessions, with their legitimacy or circumstances not established. Fort San Felipe del Morro The other pirates on trial were Manuel Aponte Monteverde of A\u00f1asco; Vicente del Valle Carbajal of Punta Espada (or Santo Domingo, depending on the report); Vicente Xim\u00e9nes of Cuman\u00e1; Antonio Delgado of Humacao; Victoriano Salda\u00f1a of Juncos; Agust\u00edn de Soto of San Germ\u00e1n; Carlos D\u00edaz of Trinidad de Barlovento; Carlos Torres of Fajardo; Juan Manuel Fuentes of Havana, and Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez of Cura\u00e7ao. Torres stood out as an African and Cofres\u00ed's slave. Among the few sentenced for piracy who were not executed, his sentence was to be sold at public auction with his price earmarked for trial costs. Cofres\u00ed confessed to capturing a French sloop in Vieques; a Danish schooner; a sailing ship from St. Thomas; a brigatine and a schooner from eastern Hispaniola; a sloop with a load of cattle in Boca del Infierno; a ship from which he stole 800 pieces of eight in Patillas, and an American schooner with a cargo worth 8,000 pieces of eight (abandoned and burned in Punta de Pe\u00f1ones). Under pressure, he was adamant that he was unaware of the current whereabouts of the vessels or their crews and that he had never killed anyone; his testimony was corroborated by the other pirates. However, according to a letter sent to Hezekiah Niles' Weekly Register Cofres\u00ed admitted off the record that he had killed nearly 400 people (but no Puerto Ricans). The pirate also confessed that he burned the cargo of an American vessel to throw off the authorities. The defendants' social status and association with criminal (or outlaw) elements dictated the course of events. Captain Jos\u00e9 Madrazo served as judge and prosecutor of the one-day trial. Governor Miguel de la Torre may have influenced the process, negotiating with Madrazo beforehand. On July 14, 1825, U.S. Congressman Samuel Smith accused Secretary of State Henry Clay of pressuring the Spanish governor to execute the pirates. ==Death and legacy== On the morning of March 29, 1825, a firing squad was assembled to carry out the sentence handed down to the pirates. The public execution, which had a large number of spectators, was supervised by the Regimiento de Infanter\u00eda de Granada between eight and nine a.m. Catholic priests were present to hear confessions and offer comfort. As the pirates prayed, they were shot before the silent crowd. Although San Felipe del Morro is the accepted execution site, Alejandro Tapia y Rivera (whose father was a member of the Regimiento de Granada) places their execution near Convento Dominico in the Baluarte de Santo Domingo (part of present-day Old San Juan). According to historian Enrique Ram\u00edrez Brau, in a final act of defiance Cofres\u00ed refused to have his eyes covered after he was tied to a chair and he was blindfolded by soldiers. Richard Wheeler said that the pirate said that after killing three or four hundred people, it would be strange if he was not accustomed to death. Cofres\u00ed supposedly said he had \"killed four hundred persons with his own hands but never to his knowledge had he killed a native of Puerto Rico.\" Cofres\u00ed's last words were reportedly, \"I have killed hundreds with my own hands, and I know how to die. Fire!\" These earrings, worn by Cofres\u00ed, are on display at the National Museum of American History. According to several of the pirates' death certificates, they were buried on the shore next to the Santa Mar\u00eda Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery. Hern\u00e1ndez Morales and several of his associates received the same treatment. Cofres\u00ed and his men were buried behind the cemetery, on what is now a lush green hill overlooking the cemetery wall. Contrary to local lore, they were not buried in Old San Juan Cemetery (Cementerio Antiguo de San Juan); their execution as criminals made them ineligible for burial in the Catholic cemetery. A letter from Sloat to United States Secretary of the Navy Samuel L. Southard implied that at least some of the pirates were intended to be \"beheaded and quartered, and their parts sent to all the small ports around the island to be exhibited\". Spanish authorities continued to arrest Cofres\u00ed associates until 1839. At this time defendants were required to pay trial expenses, and Cofres\u00ed's family was charged 643 pieces of eight, two reales and 12 maraved\u00ed. Contemporary documents suggest that Juana Creitoff, with little or no support from Cofres\u00ed's brothers and sisters, was left with the debt. His brothers distanced themselves from the trial and their brother's legacy, and Juan Francisco left Cabo Rojo for Humacao. Juan Ignacio also evidently disassociated himself from Creitoff and her daughter, and one of Juan Ignacio's granddaughters ignored Bernardina and her descendants. Due to Cofres\u00ed's squandering of his treasure, his only asset the Spanish government could seize was Carlos. Appraised at 200 pesos, he was sold to Juan Saint Just for 133 pesos. After the auction costs were paid, only 108 pesos and 2 reales were left; the remainder was paid by F\u00e9lix and Miguel Mattei after they made a deal with the authorities giving them the cargo of the San Jos\u00e9 y las Animas in return for future accountability. Juana Creitoff died a year later. Bernardina later married a Venezuelan immigrant, Estanislao Asencio Vel\u00e1zquez, continuing Cofres\u00ed's blood lineage in Cabo Rojo to this day. She had seven children: Jos\u00e9 Lucas, Mar\u00eda Esterlina, Antonio Salvador, Antonio Luciano, Pablo, Mar\u00eda Encarnaci\u00f3n and Juan Bernardino. One of Cofres\u00ed's most notable descendants was Ana Gonz\u00e1lez, better known by her married name Ana G. M\u00e9ndez. Cofres\u00ed's great-granddaughter, M\u00e9ndez was directly descended from the Cabo Rojo bloodline through her mother Ana Gonz\u00e1lez Cofres\u00ed. Known for her interest in education, she was the first member of her branch of the Cofres\u00ed family to earn a high-school diploma and university degree. A teacher, M\u00e9ndez founded the Puerto Rico High School of Commerce during the 1940s (when most women did not complete their education). By the turn of the 21st century her initiative had evolved into the Ana G. M\u00e9ndez University System, the largest group of private universities in Puerto Rico. Other branches of the Cofres\u00ed family include Juan Francisco's descendants in Ponce, and Juan Ignacio's lineage persists in the western region. Internationally, the Kupferschein family remains in Trieste. Another family member was Severo Colberg Ram\u00edrez, speaker of the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico during the 1980s. Colberg made efforts to popularize Cofres\u00ed, particularly the heroic legends which followed his death. He was related to the pirate through his sister Juana, who married Germ\u00e1n Colberg. After Cofres\u00ed's death, items associated with him have been preserved or placed on display. His birth certificate is at San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel Church with those of other notable figures, including Ram\u00f3n Emeterio Betances and Salvador Brau. Earrings said to have been worn by Cofres\u00ed were owned by Ynocencia Ram\u00edrez de Arellano, a maternal cousin. Her great-great-grandson, collector Teodoro Vidal Santoni, gave them to the National Museum of American History in 1997 and the institution displayed them in a section devoted to Spanish colonial history. Locally, documents are preserved in the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture's General Archive of Puerto Rico, the Ateneo Puertorrique\u00f1o, the University of Puerto Rico's General Library and Historic Investigation Department and the Catholic Church's Parochial Archives. Outside Puerto Rico, records can be found at the National Archives Building and the General Archive of the Indies. However, official documents relating to Cofres\u00ed's trial and execution have been lost. ==Modern view== Modern portrayal of Cofres\u00ed, standing on the deck of a ship and preparing for battle Few aspects of Cofres\u00ed's life and relationships have avoided the romanticism surrounding pirates in popular culture. During his life, attempts by Spanish authorities to portray him as a menacing figure by emphasizing his role as \"pirate lord\" and nicknaming him the \"terror of the seas\" planted him in the collective consciousness. This, combined with his boldness, transformed Cofres\u00ed into a swashbuckler differing from late-19th-century fictional accounts of pirates. The legends are inconsistent in their depiction of historical facts, often contradicting each other. Cofres\u00ed's race, economic background, personality and loyalties are among variable aspects of these stories. However, the widespread use of these myths in the media has resulted in their general acceptance as fact. The myths and legends surrounding Cofres\u00ed fall into two categories: those portraying him as a generous thief or anti- hero and those describing him as overwhelmingly evil. A subcategory represents him as an adventurer, world traveler or womanizer. Reports by historians such as Ti\u00f3 of the pirate sharing his loot with the needy have evolved into a detailed mythology. These apologetics attempt to justify his piracy, blaming it on poverty, revenge or a desire to restore his family's honor, and portray Cofres\u00ed as a class hero defying official inequality and corruption. He is said to have been a protector and benefactor of children, women and the elderly, with some accounts describing him as a rebel hero and supporter of independence from imperial power. Legends describing Cofres\u00ed as malevolent generally link him to supernatural elements acquired through witchcraft, mysticism or a deal with the Devil. This horror fiction emphasizes his ruthlessness while alive or his unwillingness to remain dead. Cofres\u00ed's ghost has a fiery aura or extraordinary powers of manifestation, defending the locations of his hidden treasure or roaming aimlessly. Cofres\u00ed has been vilified by merchants. Legends portraying him as benign figure are more prevalent near Cabo Rojo; in other areas of Puerto Rico, they focus on his treasure and depict him as a cutthroat. Most of the hidden-treasure stories have a moral counseling against greed; those trying to find the plunder are killed, dragged to Davy Jones' Locker or attacked by the ghost of Cofres\u00ed or a member of his crew. Rumors about the locations of hidden treasure flourish, with dozens of coves, beaches and buildings linked to pirates in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. The 20th century revived interest in Cofres\u00ed's piracy as a tourist attraction, with municipalities in Puerto Rico highlighting their historical connection to the pirates. By the second half of the century, beaches and sports teams (especially in his native Cabo Rojo, which features a monument in his honor) were named for him; in the Dominican Republic, a resort town was named after the pirate. Cofres\u00ed's name has been commercialized, with a number of products and businesses adopting it and its associated legends. Puerto Rico's first flag carrier seaplane was named for him. Several attempts have been made to portray Cofres\u00ed's life on film, based on legend. Coplas, songs and plays have been adapted from the oral tradition, and formal studies of the historical Cofres\u00ed and the legends surrounding him have appeared in book form. Historians Cardona Bonet, Acosta, Salvador Brau, Ram\u00f3n Ibern Fleytas, Antonio S. Pedreira, Bienvenido Camacho, Isabel Cuch\u00ed Coll, Fernando G\u00e9igel Sabat, Ram\u00edrez Brau and Cayetano Coll y Toste have published the results of their research. Others inspired by the pirate include poets Ces\u00e1reo Rosa Nieves and the brothers Luis and Gustavo Pal\u00e9s Matos. Educators Juan Bernardo Huyke and Robert Fern\u00e1ndez Valledor have also published on Cofres\u00ed. In mainstream media Cofres\u00ed has recently been discussed in the newspapers El Mundo, El Imparcial, El Nuevo D\u00eda, Primera Hora, El Peri\u00f3dico de Catalunya, Die Tageszeitung, Tribuna do Norte and The New York Times, and the magazines Puerto Rico Ilustrado, Fiat Lux and Proceedings have published articles on the pirate. ==See also== *List of Puerto Ricans *List of pirates *Miguel Enr\u00edquez (privateer) *Folk hero ==References== ===Notes=== ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * * * * * * * * * ===Further reading=== * ==External links== * Roberto Cofres\u00ed: El pirata caborroje\u00f1o * Puerto Rico's History: 1800\u20131849 Category:1791 births Category:1825 deaths Category:18th-century Puerto Rican people Category:19th-century Puerto Rican people Category:18th- century Roman Catholics Category:19th-century Roman Catholics Category:19th- century pirates Category:People from Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico Category:Puerto Rican people of European descent Category:Puerto Rican pirates Category:Puerto Rican folklore Category:People executed by Spain by firing squad Category:Executed Puerto Rican people Category:People executed for piracy Category:19th-century executions by Spain Category:Deaths by firearm in Puerto Rico Category:Spanish untitled nobility Category:Homeless people Category:Fishers Category:Highwaymen Category:Puerto Rican escapees Category:Escapees from Spanish detention Category:Fugitives wanted by Spain Category:Prisoners and detainees of Haiti Category:Maritime folklore ",
