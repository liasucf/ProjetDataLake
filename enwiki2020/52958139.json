    "text": "Panyit from the kindred Hah\u00f3t (; died after 1272) was a Hungarian robber baron, who became infamous for his violent actions and plunderings against neighboring estates in the 1250s and 60s. ==Family background== Panyit was born into the gens Hah\u00f3t as one of the three sons of Arnold I, who founded a monastery in Hah\u00f3t, Zala County, dedicated to Saint Margaret. Panyit had two brothers, Arnold II, who served as Palatine of Hungary for a short time in 1242, and Keled I, the ancestor of the Hah\u00f3ti noble family.Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus Hah\u00f3t 1.) Panyit had two children from his unidentified wife, including James, who held the dignity of Master of the stewards for Queen Dowager Elizabeth the Cuman in 1280. According to a royal charter from 1259, a talented soldier and aspiring courtly knight, Reynold B\u00e1szt\u00e9ly intended to marry Panyit's unidentified daughter, however the wealthy lord refused to consent, referring to that the young noble did not have enough possessions to repay the dowry later. Historian Attila Zsoldos also argued Panyit considered the marriage proposal as morganatic, as Reynold came from a kindred which belonged to the lower nobility in Esztergom County. However Duke Stephen, to benefit his loyal soldier, donated lands to Reynold to neutralize Panyit's argument, who also received the estates of S\u00f6jt\u00f6r and Csesztve in Zala County, which then was attached to the Duchy of Styria, as part of Stephen's realm. ==Crimes and offenses== Panyit became infamous for his violent actions and plunderings against neighboring estates in the 1250s and 60s, taking advantage of the emerging tensions between King B\u00e9la IV of Hungary and his son, Duke Stephen. In order to acquire his land, Panyit captured and imprisoned one of his neighbors, Gregory, son of Iharos in 1254. In the next year, B\u00e9la IV fined Panyit thirty denari for this violent act and forgery of document issued by Judge royal Henry K\u0151szegi, who sentenced in favour of Gregory during a lawsuit. In the same time, Panyit suppressed an uprising in his estate of Nick, sparked by cruel treatment and harassment of local castle folks by Panyit, who ignored their privileges. After 1260, he was embroiled in conflict with sons of the late Ebed J\u00e1k, also ancestors of the prestigious Niczky (Nicki) noble family. He also harassed the lands of other local nobles, including Gregory Andi and Izs\u00e9p Sukor\u00f3di. As a result, B\u00e9la IV sentenced confiscation of his lands (including Nick). In response, Panyit left B\u00e9la's realm and took an oath of allegiance to Duke Stephen. Although a joint court of B\u00e9la and Stephen also ruled against Panyit, the noble presented himself as victim of a political persecution, and procured a document from Duke Stephen in early October 1264, which set down the duke's promise that he will invalidate the judgment and return the confiscated lands to Panyit after the accession to the Hungarian throne. Following a brief civil war, B\u00e9la was forced to accept the authority of Stephen at the eastern part of the realm. On 23 March 1266, father and son confirmed the peace in the Convent of the Blessed Virgin on the 'Rabbits' Island. In accordance with the peace treaty, Panyit, as Duke Stephen's \"supporter\", also received amnesty from B\u00e9la in exchange for a promise to abandon the trespass against local landowners. However Panyit did not fulfill the promise and ousted the J\u00e1k brothers from their land both in 1266 and 1267, also preventing the on-site inspection of the royal judges. On 15 September 1267, six appointed noble judges at the royal court, including his own cousin, the influential Cs\u00e1k Hah\u00f3t ordered the enforcement and implementation of the previous sentence, declaring Panyit as \"disruptive and common bandit\". As a result, in the next few days, B\u00e9la ordered the confiscation of lands Nick and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 (in Sopron County) from Panyit, in addition to his apprehension. To avoid imprisonment, Panyit appeared in court before Judge royal Ernye \u00c1kos on 14 March 1268, and ceded Nick and some other lands in Somogy County to the J\u00e1k brothers. Recognizing the gesture, B\u00e9la IV returned other estates from Somogy County to Panyit in September 1268. However Panyit only wanted to gain time with this act. In June 1269, his soldiers pestered and invaded the adjacent lands, and brutally massacred the local serf families. Gregory Andi and his son, in addition to a relative of Kem\u00e9ny J\u00e1k were also ruthlessly murdered having after their tongues cut out. The elderly B\u00e9la could no longer deal with the case. His son, Stephen V ascended the throne in May 1270. Despite his promise from 1264, the new monarch launched an investigation, and after having given the truth of the accusations, he ordered a trial by combat to 6 October 1270. However Panyit once again came to an agreement with his enemies and paid 170 denari compensation for the three counts of murder, damages and destructions. In 1272, he also handed over the lands Sukor\u00f3 and Asziv\u00e1gy as compensation. This is the last information about him. ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * Category:13th-century Hungarian people Panyit Category:Hungarian criminals ",
