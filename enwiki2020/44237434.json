The film was released in December 1958, by United Artists. ==Plot== Sugar plantation owner Don Luis Montoya gets married in New York and brings his bride Jean back to Puerto Rico, unaware that she wed him only for his money. Friends at their San Juan honeymoon hotel recognize her as a notorious party girl, so Jean urges her husband to take her home right away, before the marriage has even been consummated. At the plantation, Jean's arrival is met with mistrust by Luis' longtime protege, Carlos, and by his cousin, Miguel, who help run the business. A drunken Miguel insults her and is slapped by Carlos. In vengeance, he attacks Carlos later with a machete. Luis orders him to leave, but Miguel sabotages the cane-cutting machinery and is asked back by Luis to repair it. Jean, meantime, has fallen in love with Carlos, which results in Miguel planting seeds of suspicion with Luis against them. Catching the two in a compromising position, Luis chastises Carlos and later takes his new wife forcibly. Miguel sets fire to the sugar field. Luis, believing that Jean is running off with Carlos, comes after them with his machete and is about to die in the blaze when Carlos comes to rescue him. Miguel is killed with the machete, and Jean dies during the ordeal as well. == Cast == *Mari Blanchard as Jean Montoya *Ruth Cains as Rita *Albert Dekker as Don Luis Montoya *Juano Hernandez as Bernardo *Carlos Rivas as Carlos *Lee Van Cleef as Miguel == References == == External links == * Category:1958 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:United Artists films Category:American drama films Category:Films shot in Puerto Rico Category:1958 drama films Category:Films directed by Kurt Neumann Category:Films scored by Paul Sawtell ",
