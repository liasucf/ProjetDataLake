Each Year UNODC selects themes for International Drug Day and launches campaigns to raise public appreciation regarding the global drug issue and its effects on complete humanity. Past Observance themes for last 5 years were: * 2015: \"Lets Develop \u2014 Our Lives \u2014 Our Communities \u2014 Our Identities \u2014 Without Drugs\" * 2014: \"A message of hope: Drug use disorders are preventable and treatable\" * 2013: \"Make health your 'new high' in life, not drugs\" * 2012: \"Global Action for Healthy Communities without Drugs\" * 2011: \"Say No!\" * 2010 : \"Think health \u2013 not drugs\" World Anti-Narcotics Day in Pakistan The magnitude of drug menace not only undermines global public health, socio-economic synopsis and international stability, it has also become an issue of National Security for Pakistan. Pakistan itself is a poppy free country, but its population became a victim of regional opiate production. We are facing the brunt of trafficking of opiates and cannabis from the West, precursors from the East and Amphetamine Type Stimulants from elsewhere. Each year International Drug Day is celebrated by Anti Narcotics Force. ANF celebrate Drug Day in a wholesome manner so as to generate a strong message for the international community and domestic masses for general awareness and society's participation by introducing a variety of drug demand awareness activities in addition to drug burning ceremonies. == Model Addiction and Treatment Centres == ANF is also playing a lead role in mass awareness and community participation programs to educate the people against drug abuse as Drug Demand Reduction has always been an important segment of our Strategy. ANF besides many awareness ventures runs 5 Model Addiction and Treatment Centres (MATRCs) at Rawalpindi, Peshawar, Quetta, Sukkur and Karachi and since their raising over twelve thousand patients have been treated. Under the policy guidelines provided by NCD and with the co-operation of our allied countries, civil society and the media, ANF is doing the best it can and has had significant successes in all three regimes of operation i.e. Drug Supply Reduction, Drug Demand Reduction and International Cooperation. Men and women of ANF are fully committed to protecting our compatriots from the peril at cost of risk to their own lives. ==References== == External links == * * United Nation's Convention on Psychotropic Substances, 1971 Category:Drug policy organizations Category:Federal law enforcement agencies of Pakistan Category:Drug policy of Pakistan ",
