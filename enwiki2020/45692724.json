    "text": "A Mayo-Smith pyramid is a triangle divided into a sequence of isosceles trapezoids configured such that the outer perimeter maintains the shape of a triangle with each additional element. A Mayo-Smith pyramid is used to describe system development methodologies adapted for scenarios characterized by schedule and resource uncertainty. \"Two Ways to Build a Pyramid\" was published in 2001. In this, the Mayo-Smith pyramid sequence (see Figure B) is used to illustrate a specific case study, and contrasted with a less favorable sequence (see Figure A). While Mayo-Smith's pyramid is typically depicted as a two dimensional sequence, it may also be depicted in three dimensions. ==References== Category:Polygons Category:Software development philosophies ",
