It is the second installment of a trilogy of films based on the manga Karate Baka Ichidai (literal title: \"A Karate-Crazy Life\") by Ikki Kajiwara, Jiro Tsunoda and J\u014dya Kagemaru. Sonny Chiba reprises his role from Champion of Death as Masutatsu Oyama, the historical founder of Kyokushin karate in Japan (Oyama makes a cameo appearance in the film as well). Chiba had studied martial arts under the real-life Oyama for several years. True to the film's title, at one point in the course of the narrative he battles a \"bear\", actually a human actor in a bear costume. ==Plot== ==Cast== *Sonny Chiba as Mas Oyama *Eiji G\u00f4 *Yutaka Nakajima ==External links== *Japanese Movie Database * * Category:1975 films Category:1975 action films Category:1975 martial arts films Category:Japanese action films Category:Films directed by Kazuhiko Yamaguchi Category:Japanese films Category:Karate films Category:Japanese-language films Category:Toei Company films Category:Films scored by Shunsuke Kikuchi ",
