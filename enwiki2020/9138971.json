    "text": "Bello (c. 755 \u2013 810) was Count of Carcassonne from 790 until his death. He was the founder of the Bellonid Dynasty of Carcassonne and Raz\u00e8s which reached its apex in Wilfred the Hairy, progenitor of the House of Barcelona. It is not known who Bello married, but several children have been suggested for him: * Guisclafred, his successor in Carcassonne * Oliba I, Count of Carcassonne and Raz\u00e8s * Sunyer I, Count of Emp\u00faries * Sunifred I, Count of Barcelona - may have been his son or possibly son-in-law. He is mentioned to be the brother of Sunyer I; might have been his brother-in-law. * Argila of Raz\u00e8s, Count of Carcassonne and Raz\u00e8s * Bera of Barcelona, Count of Carcassonne and Raz\u00e8s, Count of Barcelona, Girona, Ausona, Emp\u00faries Argila and Bera are less likely to have been sons of Bello. Bera is also noted to be the son of William of Gellone, but that is also unlikely based on references detailing William's inheritance.
