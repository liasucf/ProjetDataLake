The homes facing, split among \u2116s 1\u201345 have statutory protection and recognition in the initial, mainstream category (they are listed Grade II for their architectural/historic merit). ==History== In 1685, Thomas Young, a woodcarver, acquired land in Kensington which he sought to develop, and as he later described it in 1701, \"did sett out and appoint a considerable part thereof to be built into a large Square of large and substantial Houses fit for ye Habitacion of persons of good Worth and Quality, with Courts and Yards before and Gardens lying backwards\". In London, St. James's Square, Soho Square and Golden Square are a few years older, but in contrast with these Kensington Square still retains its residential character. ==Garden== The communal gardens were laid out in 1698 and are in size. The garden is private and not open to the public, though it has taken part in the annual Open Garden Squares Weekend. ==Heythrop College== \u2116 23 was Heythrop College, University of London until 2018, \"the Specialist Philosophy and Theology College of the University of London,\" which included a library originally established in 1614 in Louvain (Leuven) by the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) for those studies.Heythrop College: About us Heythrop College: How to find us ==Former residents== ;Blue plaque holders The square includes the former homes of: *composer Hubert Parry at \u2116 17 *liberal philosopher John Stuart Mill at \u2116 18 *sanitary reformer and pathologist John Simon at \u2116 40; *Pre-Raphaelite artist Edward Burne-Jones at \u2116 41 -- Other homes belonged to, or were rented as their family home by: *Lawyer and positivist Vernon Lushington at \u2116 36. He introduced one of the foremost Pre-Raphaelites to another: E. Burne Jones (Burne-Jones) to Dante Gabriel Rossetti, at the Working Men's College.

First published by Faber & Faber, 1952 Between 1831 and 1896 (the) Kensington School occupied two sites: \u2116 31, then \u2116s 25\u201329. It is notable as one of the founders of the Football Association in 1863. The school built classrooms and fives courts in the gardens of the houses; all that remains is \u2116 27a, the cottage or small house behind \u2116 28. ==In popular culture== In the 2016 film The Exception, protagonist Mieke de Jong coyly inscribes a copy of landmark philosophical work Beyond Good and Evil with: ==See also== * Squares in London * List of city squares ==References== ==External links== *Kensington Square at OGSW Category:1698 establishments in England Category:Garden squares in London Category:Grade II listed houses in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Category:Kensington Category:Squares in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Category:Communal gardens ",
