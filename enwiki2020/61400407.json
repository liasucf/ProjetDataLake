Aman is a Nawab, who is cursed by the Dark shadow of Jinn, while Roshni is a Tawaif with the heart of an angel. Parveen's life falls in danger due to the Jinn's magic and can be protected only if Aman marries an Ayaana; a woman with the heart of an angel. Salma pretends to be sick, forcing Roshni to marry Aman for money. Aman misunderstands Roshni to be a gold digger. He starts detesting her and gives her a cheque in exchange of marrying him. Aman and Roshni get married. Roshni feels a connection with Aman but is hurt by his rude behaviour. Aman's brother, Kabir Junaid Khan makes his entry. He tries to kill Aman, but Roshni dies while saving Aman. Aman realises his feelings for Roshni and is left heartbroken. Kabir brings Roshni back to life but keeps her under his control, aiming to separate her from Aman. Kabir's hold on Roshni gets destroyed when Aman stabs her with a magical dagger. Parveen is revealed to be evil who wants to use her sons to become the queen of jinns. Parveen kills Kabir but fails in killing Aman. Aliya, Aman's former girlfriend, returns with a baby and tries to separate Aman and Roshni. The baby is revealed to be Kabir's and Aliya is revealed to be a Haiwana. Parveen tries to sacrifice the baby to regain her lost powers, but Aman saves the child. Roshni tries to expose her, but fails. Aliya attacks Parveen resulting in Parveen going in a coma. Aman, believing it's Roshni's fault, asks her to leave the house. ===One year later=== Roshni decides to open a bakery by taking a loan. Aman is worried about Parveen's decreasing health conditions. Roshni and Aman meet. Aman receives news about Parveen's kidney failure. He destroys Roshni's bakery believing her to be the reason of Parveen's condition. Roshni is devastated. Aman offers her a job for her to repay the loan. Due to Salma's worsening health, Roshni accepts the job and works as his secretary. As the two come closer again, an intoxicated Aman reveals to Roshni that he tried to hate her but couldn't. They consummate their relationship, and Roshni becomes pregnant. In order to save Parveen, Roshni secretly donates her kidney. Kabir returns with deadlier powers. He joins hands with Laila, the red moon princess who tries to harm Roshni and Aman's twins. Laila curses Roshni that she will die before the next full moon. Aman succeeds in saving Roshni but dies instead. Jinn asks Roshni's first born child in order to save Aman. Roshni agrees and the Jinn brings Aman back to life. ==Cast== ===Main=== * Vikram Singh Chauhan as Aman Junaid Khan: Parveen and Junaid's son; Kabir, Sara and Saima's brother; Farah's half-brother; Roshni's husband (2019\u2013present) *Aditi Sharma as Roshni Ahmed: Salma's adoptive daughter; Aman's wife (2019\u2013present) ===Recurring=== * Smita Bansal as Parveen Khan: Nasreen's sister; Junaid's wife; Kabir, Aman, Sara and Saima's mother (2019\u20132020) * Sushant Singh as Junaid Khan: Anjum's son; Baby's brother; Parveen and Rubina's husband; Kabir, Aman, Sara, Saima and Farah's father (2019\u20132020) * Garima Vikrant Singh as Salma Janesaar: A Tawaif; Roshni's adoptive mother (2019\u2013present) * Jaswinder Gardner as Rubina \"Tabeezi\" Khan: Junaid's wife; Farah's mother, Aman, Sara and Saima's stepmother; Khan family's helper (2019\u2013present) * Arhaan Behll as Kabir Junaid Khan: Sifriti Jinn; Parveen and Junaid's son; Aman, Sara and Saima's brother; Farah's half-brother; Aliya's husband (2019\u20132020) * Vaibhavi Kapoor as Sara Khan: Parveen and Junaid's daughter; Kabir, Aman and Saima's sister; Farah's half-sister (2019\u2013present) * Gouri Agarwal as Saima Khan: Parveen and Junaid's daughter; Kabir, Aman, Sara's sister; Farah's half-sister (2019\u2013present) * Saloni Daini as Farah Khan: Rubina and Junaid's daughter; Kabir, Aman, Sara and Saima's half-sister (2019\u2013present) * Richa Bhattacharya as Anjum Khan: Baby and Junaid's mother; Kabir, Aman, Sara, Saima and Farah's grandmother (2019\u2013present) * Seema Azmi as Baby Khan: Anjum's daughter; Junaid's sister; Farah, Kabir, Aman, Sara and Saima's aunt (2019\u2013present) * Ayansh Mishra as Mr. Chotu: Soha's son (2019\u2013present) * Shehzada as Rehaan Khan: Nasreen's son; Farhan and Mahira's brother; Aman's cousin (2020-present) * Shruti Sharma as Shayari: Roshni's cousin, Rehan's secretary (2020-present) * Ashita Dhawan as Nasreen Khan: Rehan, Farhan and Mahira's mother; Parveen\u2019s sister (2020) * Prabhat Choudhary as Farhan Khan: Nasreen's son, Farah and Rehan's brother (2020\u2013present) * Solanki Sharma as Mahira Khan: Nasreen's daughter; Rehan and Farhan's sister (2020\u2013present) * Himani Sahani as Natasha: A Jinn shikari; Rehan's friend (2020\u2013present) * Sanjana Singh as Adaa Rizvi: Aman's former fiance (2019) * Aashish Kaul as Mr. Rizvi: Adaa's father (2019) * Anushka Singh as Mrs. Rizvi: Adaa's mother (2019) * Rupesh Kataria as Sameer: Roshni's former fiance (2019) * Rajshri Rani as Huma: Sameer's wife (2019) * Sreejita De as Aliya:Haiwana; Aman's former girlfriend; Kabir's wife; Aamir's mother (2020) * Krishvi Bhanushali as Aamir Khan: Aliya and Kabir's son (2020) * Aamir Salim Khan as Imran Khan: Aman's cousin; Roshni's friend (2020) * Saloni Chauhan as Raakh Jinn: Kabir's helper (2019) * Surbhi Jyoti as Laila: Red Moon Princess (2020) ==Production== ===Release=== The first promo of the series was released on 23 September 2019 where Vikram Singh Chauhan and Aditi Sharma were introduced as Aman Junaid Khan and Roshni Ahmad. ===Development=== The show was launched at Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor's Pataudi Palace, becoming the first television show to be launched at the Pataudi Palace.
