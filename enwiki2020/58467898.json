    "text": "Vanadium(III) acetylacetonate is the coordination compound with the formula V(C5H7O2)3, sometimes designated as V(acac)3. It is an orange-brown solid that is soluble in organic solvents. ==Structure and synthesis== The complex has idealized D3 symmetry. Like other V(III) compounds, it has a triplet ground state. The compound is prepared by reduction of ammonium vanadate in the presence of acetylacetone. ==Applications and research== V(acac)3 is a common precatalyst for the production of EPDM polymers. It has also been shown to be a precursor to vanadium pentoxide nanostructures. ==References== Category:Acetylacetonate complexes Category:Vanadium compounds ",
