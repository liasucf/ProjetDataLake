The municipality included the northern part of the island of And\u00f8ya as well as many small surrounding islets and skerries in what is now And\u00f8y Municipality. The administrative centre was the village of Andenes where the Andenes Church is located. ==History== The municipality of Andenes was established on 1 January 1924 when Dverberg Municipality was divided into three: Andenes (population: 2,213) in the north, Bj\u00f8rnskinn (population: 1,410) in the south, and Dverberg (population: 1,477) in the central part of the old municipality. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of Andenes (population: 3,812) was merged (back) with the municipalities of Dverberg (population: 1,719) and Bj\u00f8rnskinn (population: 1,835) to create the new And\u00f8y Municipality. ==Name== The Old Norse form of the name was Andarnes (from originally Amdarnes). The first element is the genitive case of \u00d6md (the old name of the island And\u00f8ya) and the last element is nes which means \"headland\". ==Government== All municipalities in Norway, including Andenes, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor. ===Municipal council=== The municipal council of Andenes was made up of representatives that were elected to four year terms. The party breakdown of the final municipal council was as follows: ==See also== *List of former municipalities of Norway ==References== Category:And\u00f8y Category:Former municipalities of Norway Category:1924 establishments in Norway Category:1964 disestablishments in Norway ",
