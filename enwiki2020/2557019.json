    "text": "NGC 4725 is an intermediate barred spiral galaxy with a prominent ring structure, located in the northern constellation of Coma Berenices near the north galactic pole. It was discovered by German-born astronomer William Herschel on April 6, 1785. The galaxy lies at a distance of approximately from the Milky Way. NGC 4725 is the brightest member of the Coma I Group of the Coma-Sculptor Cloud, although it is relatively isolated from the other members of this group. This galaxy is strongly disturbed and is interacting with neighboring spiral galaxy NGC 4747, with its spiral arms showing indications of warping. The pair have an angular separation of , which corresponds to a projected linear separation of . A tidal plume extends from NGC 4747 toward NGC 4725. This is a suspected type 2 Seyfert galaxy with a supermassive black hole at the core. The morphological classification of this galaxy is SAB(r)ab pec, indicating a peculiar, weakly-barred spiral galaxy (SAB) with a complete ring surrounding the bar (r) and somewhat tightly-wound spiral arms (ab). It is actually double-barred, a feature found among about a third of all barred spirals. The galactic plane is inclined by approximately 46\u00b0 to the line of sight from the Earth. The ring structure of the galaxy is a region of star formation. It is offset from the galactic center and displays non-circular motion. There is a compact radio source positioned approximately from the nucleus of NGC 4725. Since there is no optical counterpart at that position, this may be a star forming region that is heavily obscured by dust. Multiple supernova candidate events have been detected in this galaxy: * SN 1940B was detected on a photograph taken May 5, 1940, about northeast of the galactic core. The light curve indicates this was a type II supernova. * Candidate SN 1987E was detected April 24, 1987 with a magnitude of 15.65. A follow-up study failed to detect this event, so it may have been the result of gravitational lensing. * SN 1999gs was detected on December 28, 1999 with a magnitude of 19.3. It was positioned west and south of the nucleus of NGC 4725. * On automated images taken July 5, 2016, a magnitude 17.0 transient source was discovered at an angular separation of from the galactic nucleus. Designated ASASSN-16gu (AT 2016cyu), this was most likely a supernova event. It had an estimated absolute visual magnitude of \u201313.6. ==Gallery== File:N4725s.jpg|NGC 4725 taken with a 24-inch telescope ==References== ==External links== * NOAO: NGC 4725 * NGC 4725 * * NGC 4725 in Coma-Berenices Category:Barred spiral galaxies Category:Peculiar galaxies Category:Seyfert galaxies Category:Interacting galaxies Category:Coma I Group Category:Coma Berenices (constellation) 4725 07989 43451 ",
