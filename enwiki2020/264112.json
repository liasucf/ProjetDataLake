    "text": "Patrick Sarsfield Donegan (29 October 1923 \u2013 26 November 2000) was an Irish Fine Gael politician and three-time cabinet minister. He was educated at a Christian Brothers School in Drogheda, County Louth and at the Vincentian Castleknock College, County Dublin. Donegan was first elected as a Fine Gael Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for the Louth constituency at the 1954 general election. He lost his seat at the 1957 general election but was elected to Seanad \u00c9ireann by the Agricultural Panel. He regained his D\u00e1il seat at the 1961 general election. In the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition government which took power after the 1973 general election Donegan was appointed as Minister for Defence. In October 1976 Donegan made a controversial speech on an official visit to the opening of new kitchen facilities in an army barracks at Mullingar, County Westmeath. He described as a \"thundering disgrace\" (in some accounts what he said was 'thundering boll*x and a f**king disgrace') President Cearbhall \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh's refusal to sign the Emergency Powers Act, 1976, instead using his powers under Article 26 of the Constitution to refer it to the Supreme Court. The Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, refused Donegan's resignation, and instead \u00d3 D\u00e1laigh resigned as President of Ireland. The whole episode badly damaged the government's reputation. In 1976 Donegan became Minister for Lands, and in 1977 he served briefly as Minister for Fisheries. Donegan retired from politics at the 1981 general election, and died in 2000. He was buried in his home town of Monasterboice, County Louth. ==References== Category:1923 births Category:2000 deaths Category:Fine Gael TDs Category:Members of the 15th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 9th Seanad Category:Members of the 17th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 18th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 19th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 20th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 21st D\u00e1il Category:People educated at Castleknock College Category:Irish farmers Category:Ministers for Defence (Ireland) Category:Fine Gael senators ",
