Founded in 1898 to serve the growing area it is the fifth oldest Anglican parish in central Ottawa after St. Alban's, St. Bartholomew's, Trinity, and Ascension. It is a registered charity # 108084658RR0078 providing spiritual worship, spiritual guidance, pastoral care, and community outreach.MATTHEW'S PARISH ==History== ===Establishment=== For most of the 19th Century, the diocesan organization for Anglican churches in and around Ottawa was remote. Authority in the Church of England was administered first from Halifax, Nova Scotia then from Kingston, Ontario. In 1896 the northern and eastern parts of the Diocese of Ontario (Kingston) became the separate diocese of Ottawa and had its own bishop. The new diocese covered an area of almost 18,000 square miles, including eight counties and most of the district of Nipissing reaching west into Algonquin Park. It started with 51 parishes serving 30,000 people. St. Matthew's Anglican parish was established after the creation of the Diocese of Ottawa. The late Archbishop Hamilton was the first bishop of the new diocese, of which he was a native having been born in Hawkesbury. Because of his many years in Quebec City, Archbishop Hamilton chose St. Matthew's for the name of this parish. After his consecration he quickly noted the growth of Ottawa southwards, and acted immediately to fill the needs of church people living north of Trinity and west of Ascension. He also laid the cornerstone on July 6, 1898. Bishop Hamilton appointed Rev. J. A. Tancock as rector in February 1888 and the first service in the newly formed parish was held in July 1888 in the newly dedicated church. The service was held in what was known as Moorland's Hall on the south east corner of Bank Street and Fourth Avenue on January 13, 1888 and attended by 15 persons: Mrs. Clara M. Clarke & Miss E.L. Hammon, Mrs. J. P. Enston, Mrs. C. X. Bowse, Miss Emma Coyles, Master George Coyles and Mrs. H. X. Marshall and Mrs. Joseph Roy. The first hymn sung was \"The Church's One Foundation\". Miss E.L. Hammon was on the organ and the singing was by Mrs. Clara M. Clarke.St. Matthew's Church (Anglican), fonds When collection, time came there were no plates, so Mr. Moreland went down to the store and brought two plates up which were used.[ https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/50040532/ St Matthew's in the Glebe January 22, 1977 Ottawa Journal (Ottawa, Ontario) Page 36] The congregation decided to go ahead with the erection of a church and four lots were purchased on First Avenue, immediately west of Bank Street. In 1904, the church bought a large house on 223 First Ave., which served as a rectory. The rectory was repaired by 1941. The rectory was subdivided from the lot in 2005. From 1910 to 1945, St Matthew's was the largest parish in the diocese.L'histoire de la paroisse anglicane St. Matthew ===First Avenue Church=== St Matthew's Anglican church on the Glebe was erected by July 1, 1898. Rev. Mr. Tancock, the rector and the churchwardens accepted the plans of Architect J. W. H. Watts April 14, 1898. The contract for building the building was awarded to Mr. J. H. Copping, at a cost of $2,500.The Ottawa Journal (Ottawa, Ontario) April 14, 1898 Page 3 The following resolution also was passed: \"That the vestry of St. Matthew's parish in the City of Ottawa being now duly constituted under Canon of the diocese of Ottawa, desire, as their first act to put on record their hearty and grateful appreciation of the generous aid extended to them by their brother churchmen in Ottawa towards the purchase of a suitable site and the erection of a building for Divine service to be used as a parish room and Sunday school where a church hall have been erected to the future. That the list of subscribers be entered on the minutes, and that a copy of the Ottawa paper which may publish this resolution be sent to each subscriber.\" The church had about 100 members.

The first building on First Avenue, immediately west of Bank Street, which was of frame construction, was opened on July 17, 1888. There was an Apse Sanctuary; hammer beam trusses supported the roof and there was a cross on the roof at the chancel end. It was almost the only building between Bank Street and Bronson.St Matthew's in the Glebe January 22, 1977 Ottawa Journal (Ottawa, Ontario) Page 36 The boundaries of the new church were, roughly, the cross tracks on the north, and canal on the east and south. Bronson Street West and Preston Street on the East Ottawa did not then form part of the parish. The original building on First Avenue at Bank Street was a wooden structure designed in 1898 by noted architect John William Hurrell Watts. Two new transepts were added by Watts in 1903.C.R., ix, 20 April 1898, 3; Evening Journal [Ottawa], 22 Jan. 1903, 3, descrip.; 14 July 1903, 9, descrip.; Saint Matthews Parish Golden Anniversary 1898-1948, 6-7, illus.Watts, John William Hurrell in the Biographical Dictionary of Architects in Canada.

Loucks\", curate St Christ Church, Cathedral, was appointed third rector from October 1, 1902 until December, 1913, when he resigned to become rector of All Saints Church, Winnipeg. With a parish of 3000, people felt it was time to plan for a new and larger church extended northward \"almost doubling the sittings.\" For some time the need of more room had been felt by the congregation, which under Rev. Mr. Loucks, grew rapidly. The architectural plans by John William Hurrell Watts called for a transept which would provide extra sitting. With the transept added the church was cruciform in shape. The Ottawa Journal (Ottawa, Ontario) January 22, 1903, Page 3. The church was enlarged and dedicated on July 17, 1903 by the erection of a transepts five years after the first services were held. It was reopened on September 22, 1903. This enlargement was not sufficient to cope with the ever-growing congregation, which by 1908 numbered 1984. Steps were taken to more than double the size of the church. The building was enlarged by a second transept opened on September 22, 1908, with a seating capacity of 700. The electropneumatic Casavant Fr\u00e8res Opus 376 organ was dedicated on November 11, 1908. In 1931, Casavant Fr\u00e8res enlarged and moved it into the new church and enlarged.

Plant, who had been a member of the church since his boyhood, offered to give $133,000 towards the building of a new church provided the congregation contributed a similar sum within a year.

Our attendance at the services during the past year has been good but there is much room for improvement. There is a danger in a well organized parish to imagine that our religious duties end with whatever work we do in this or that organization. This is a fatal mistake.
