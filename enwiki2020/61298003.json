He completed his doctorate at Yale University in 1956. His dissertation, Invariant Wedderburn Factors, was supervised by Nathan Jacobson. After working as Ritt Instructor of mathematics at Columbia University from 1956 to 1959, he moved to Rutgers University, where he remained for many years. He was also a regular visitor to the Institute for Advanced Study. ==Personal life== Taft's wife, Hessy Levinsons Taft, had been publicized as \"the most beautiful Aryan baby\" in Nazi propaganda despite being Jewish. Her family escaped Nazi Germany for France, Cuba, and later the US, and she met Taft as a graduate student in chemistry at Columbia University, while he was an instructor there. After Taft retired from Rutgers, he and his wife moved to New York City. ==References== Category:1931 births Category:Living people Category:American mathematicians Category:Amherst College alumni Category:Yale University alumni Category:Columbia University faculty Category:Rutgers University faculty Category:Academic journal editors ",
