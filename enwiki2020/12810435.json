The club is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union and is a feeder club for the Llanelli Scarlets. ==Club history== Formed in the mining village of Tumble in 1897 Tumble RFC were one of the most successful rugby teams in the old West Wales Rugby Union, and are still highly regarded for all that they achieved. The club's peak in terms of success came during the 1980s when under coaches Clive and Allan John they managed the feat of winning the President Cup five times, the Challenge Cup four times and the West Wales Championship three times. The club first won the Challenge Cup in 1933, and retained ownership of the trophy for a further two seasons. In season 1937/38 the club was crowned West Wales Champions for the first time. In season 1945/46 the club won its first post war trophy when it picked up the Challenge Cup for the fourth time. Tumble successfully defended the trophy the following season. The club won the Challenge Cup in 1946/47 and the Championship again in season 1949/50. During the next three decades the club's success waned a little. Tumble only won the Challenge Cup twice, in seasons 1962/63 and 1971/72. Then came the Eighties \u2013 what can be seen as the club's Golden Era. In 1983/84 Tumble were crowned West Wales Champions for the first time in 34 years, a title they reclaimed the following year, along with the Challenge Cup. They held onto the cup for a further four years and in 1987/88 they won the West Wales Championship for the last time. In 1990 Tumble gained Heineken National League status. In 1991/92 the club won the Heineken League Division 4 Championship. In 1995/96 the club reclaimed the Challenge Cup for the twelfth time. The club celebrated its centenary in season 1996/97. In 2006/07 the club won the WRU Division 3 West Championship and the Brains SA Bowl. The club suffered successive relegations in seasons 2007/08 and 2008/09 and found themselves in Division 4 West at the beginning of season 2009/10. The return of brothers Arwel and Gareth Davies was the catalyst for a revival of fortunes. The 1st XV won both the 2009/10 Division 4 West title and the WWRU Brains SA Plate. League restructuring and the retirement of a number of senior players saw the club go through another period of restructuring playing in the newly created Division 3 West B. After a season of consolidation the Magpies clinched the Division 3 West B championship in 2015/16 and play 2016/17 in Division 2 West. The club has a fine history of producing players that have gone on to make a name for themselves at a higher level. One of Tumble's most notable players, was Welsh international Archie Skym. Although Skym had already moved to Llanelli RFC at the time he was first capped, he came to the attention of larger clubs when representing Tumble. He joined the team from a local side at Drefach, and in December 1926 left Tumble for the Scarlets.A Century of Welsh Rugby Players 1880-1980, Wayne Thomas; Ansell (1979) pg. 72 British Lion Gareth Davies is a native of the village and played for Tumble before making a name for himself in the 1970s and 80s with Cardiff RFC and Wales. In more recent times fellow Lion Dwayne Peel started his career with the club and played through the junior system before representing Llanelli Scarlets, Sale Sharks, Bristol, Wales and the Lions. Other notable former players from recent years are Richard Rees the Neath, Newport, Swansea, Scarlets and Wales wing, Darren Allinson the London Irish scrum half, Hugh Gustafson the Ospreys hooker, Nicholas Cudd the Newport Gwent Dragons flanker and Daniel Evans the Ospreys and Wales full back.
