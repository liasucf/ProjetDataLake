It was also the twelfth season for the current incarnations of the Premier, North and South Divisions, the last to have two regional divisions, and the first as the Bostik League following a sponsorship deal with Bostik. In May 2017, the FA chose the Southern League to create one additional division at Step 3 and the Isthmian League to create one at Step 4 as part of the next change to the structure, and in March 2018, the Northern Premier League voted to reorganise its Step 4 divisions into an east- west alignment, with all Step 3 divisions contracting to 22 clubs and those at Step 4 to 20, taking effect in the 2018\u201319 season. ==Premier Division== The Premier Division consisted of 24 clubs: 19 clubs from the previous season, and five new clubs: *Brightlingsea Regent, promoted as champions of Division One North *Dorking Wanderers, promoted as play-off winners in Division One South *Margate, relegated from the National League South *Thurrock, promoted as play-off winners in Division One North *Tooting & Mitcham United, promoted as champions of Division One South Billericay Town won the division and returned to National League South after five seasons in the Isthmian League. Dulwich Hamlet, who competed in the Isthmian League since its establishment in 1907, won the play-offs and followed them. Only one club were to relegate from the Premier Division, Tooting & Mitcham finished bottom of the table and returned straight back to the step 4. At the end of the season a new step 3 division was created under the Southern Football League, seven Premier Division clubs were transferred to the Southern League Premier divisions. Number of clubs in the Premier Division were reduced to 22 for the next season. ===League table=== ==== Top scorers ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Player !Club !Goals |- |Elliott Buchanan |Staines Town |39 |- |Jake Robinson |Billericay Town |34 |- |Niko Muir |Hendon |32 |- |Jordan Chiedozie |Margate |29 |- |Mohamed Bettamer |Staines Town |27 |- |Adeoye Yusuff |Folkestone Invicta |27 |- |William Hunt |Brightlingsea Regent |24 |- |Nyren Clunis |Dulwich Hamlet |19 |- |Jake Reed |Leiston |19 |- |Adam Cunnington |Billericay Town |18 |- |James McShane |Dorking Wanderers |16 |- |Alexander Akrofi |Tonbridge Angels |16 |} ====Play- offs==== ===Results table=== ===Stadia and locations=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
