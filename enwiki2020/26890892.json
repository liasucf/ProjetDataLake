It was worn against Fremantle at their home Indigenous round match on 1 June 2014. Stewart was one of the 18 players recognised. At the conclusion of the 1961 Grand Final, the players from opposing sides swapped jumpers. Stewart traded jumpers with his opposing wingman, Hawthorn's John Fisher. In 2012, Stewart was cleaning out his house and found Fisher's old jumper in a box. He donated the guernsey to the Hawthorn Football Club museum who said it was a \"wonderful gesture\" and described the jumper as being \"in mint condition\". ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1939 births Category:Western Bulldogs players Category:Indigenous Australian players of Australian rules football Category:Australian rules football coaches Category:Kyabram Football Club players Category:Shepparton Swans Football Club players Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Living people ",
