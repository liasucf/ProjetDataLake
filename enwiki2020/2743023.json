After originally being awarded as WCNE but changing calls to WZUM before being licensed in 1964, the station signed on as an R&B; and top 40 station, partly owned by popular Pittsburgh polka bandleader James Psihoulis \"Jimmy Pol\". During the 1970s, WZUM was a freeform AOR outlet from 10:00 am until sunset, (broadcasting polkas in the morning from sunrise). \"Powerful\" Paul Perry, son of Pittsburgh TV personality Nick Perry, was one of the freeform disc jockeys; along with Kit Baron, \"Laid Back\" Larry Allen and Mark Wallace. WZUM switched to religious programming under the WPLW callsign in 1975 after its purchase by Robert Hickling. In 1998, following Hickling's death, it was sold to Pittsburgh-area broadcaster Mike Horvath and returned to WZUM, changing to smooth jazz, but went dark after just one year with the format. The station later returned after a major transmitter and studio overhaul with time-brokered programming, then oldies, with Catholic programming added in 2002. Upon purchase of the station, Starboard converted it to 100% Catholic programming under the Relevant Radio branding. In recent years, WZUM applied for an upgrade to its signal, which would have given the station minimal night power.
