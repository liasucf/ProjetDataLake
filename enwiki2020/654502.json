    "text": "Yauco () is a city (ciudad) and municipality in southwestern Puerto Rico, centered on the city of the same name. Although the city is inland, the municipality stretches to a southern coast facing the Caribbean Sea. Yauco is located south of Maricao, Lares and Adjuntas; east of Sabana Grande and Gu\u00e1nica; and west of Guayanilla. The municipality consists of 20 barrios and Yauco barrio-pueblo. It is both a principal city of the Yauco Metropolitan Statistical Area and the Ponce-Yauco-Coamo Combined Statistical Area. It was founded by Fernando Pacheco on February 29, 1756, and developed for commodity crops of tobacco, sugar cane, and coffee. Yauco became a center for Corsican immigration to Puerto Rico in the 19th century due to its geographical similarity to their homeland. Corsicans have contributed to many areas of life in Yauco, particularly to its coffee industry. This has played a role in the city's nicknames of El Pueblo del Caf\u00e9 (City of Coffee), and Los Corsos (The Corsicans). It is also known as La Capital Ta\u00edna (the Ta\u00edno capital) after the native peoples of Puerto Rico. ==History== Yucca The city of Yauco was named after the river Yauco, which the indigenous Ta\u00edno called coayuco, meaning \"yucca plantation\".Yauco, Puerto Rico . Welcome.topuertorico.org. The Taino natives considered the area of Yauco the capital of Boriken (Ta\u00edno name for what is today called \"Puerto Rico\") and was governed by Ag\u00fceybana, the most powerful Ta\u00edno \"cacique\" (chief) in the island. All the other caciques were subject to and had to obey Ag\u00fceyban\u00e1, although they governed their own tribes. Upon Ag\u00fceyban\u00e1's death in 1510, his nephew, G\u00fceyban\u00e1 (also known as Ag\u00fceyban\u00e1 II), became the most powerful cacique in the island. Ag\u00fceyban\u00e1 II doubted the \"godly\" status the Spaniards were rumored to have. He came up with a plan to test these doubts: he and Urayo\u00e1n (cacique of A\u00f1asco) sent some of their tribe members to lure a Spaniard named Diego Salcedo into a river and drown him. They watched over Salcedo's body to ensure that he did not revive. Salcedo's death convinced Ag\u00fceyban\u00e1 II and the rest of the Ta\u00edno that the Spaniards were not gods. They rebelled against the Spanish in 1511 but were defeated. In 1755, the Spanish settlers of the region built a small chapel and named it Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Sant\u00edsimo Rosario (Our Lady of the Holy Rosary). The settlers sent Fernando Pacheco as their representative to the Spanish Government, to request the establishment of a municipality, since they had satisfied one of the requirements for the establishment of a municipality, namely, to establish a place of worship. On February 29, 1756, the King of Spain granted the settlers their request and the town of Yauco was founded. Fernando Pacheco was named First Lieutenant of War of the new town. From the mid-19th to the early 20th century, hundreds of Corsican, Italian, French, Portuguese, Irish, Scots, and German immigrants arrived in Puerto Rico, attracted by the Spanish Crown's offer of free land. They settled mostly in the south central region. ===19th century Corsican immigration=== Early Yauco coffee plantation (Pre-1920) The island of Puerto Rico is very similar in geography to the island of Corsica and appealed to the many Corsican immigrants. Corsica was part of the Republic of Genoa for centuries until 1768. Corsicans descend from a combination of ancient Corsi people from northeastern Sardinia and people who came over later from northern and central Italy (including Tuscans, Etruscans, Ligurians, and Romans) along with, to a lesser extent, Greeks and Carthaginians. It's been part of France since 1768, but retains a distinct Italian culture. Hundreds of Corsicans and their families immigrated to Puerto Rico from as early as 1830, and their numbers peaked in the 1850s, after European unrest following the Revolutions of 1848, and environmental problems of lengthy drought. The Corsicans tended to settle in the mountainous southwestern region of the island, and Yauco attracted the majority of them. As noted, the three main crops were coffee, sugar cane and tobacco. The new settlers first worked on the farms, and some saved money in order to own and operate their own grocery stores. They began to specialize in cultivation of coffee as a commodity crop. Coffee was first cultivated in the Rancheras and Diego Hern\u00e1ndez sectors; it was expanded to the Aguas Blancas, Frailes and Rubias sectors. The Mariani family adapted a cotton gin in the 1860s to use in mechanical dehusking of coffee. This improved the appearance of Puerto Rico's coffee beans and helped it stand out in the international coffee market. By the 1860s the Corsican settlers were the leaders of the coffee industry in Puerto Rico, and seven out of ten coffee plantations were owned by Corsicans. ===Intentona de Yauco=== Flag flown by Fidel V\u00e9lez and his men during the \"Intentona de Yauco\" revolt The pro-independence movement raised the second and last major revolt here against Spanish colonial rule in Puerto Rico, known as the Intentona de Yauco, a.k.a. the \"Attempted Coup of Yauco.\" The revolt, which occurred on March 26, 1897, was organized by Antonio Mattei Lluberas, Mateo Mercado and Fidel V\u00e9lez. They were supported by leaders of \"El Grito de Lares\", the first major independence attempt, who were in exile in New York City as members of the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee. During this uprising, V\u00e9lez raised for the first time what became the current flag of Puerto Rico on local soil. Local Spanish authorities had heard rumors of the revolt and acted swiftly to suppress it.\"Historia militar de Puerto Rico\"; by H\u00e9ctor Andr\u00e9s Negroni (Author); Publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario (1992); Language: Spanish; ; ===Spanish\u2013American War=== Part of the Hacienda Desideria, owned by Antonio Mariani, where the Battle of Yauco took place in 1898 In 1898, upon the outbreak of the Spanish\u2013American War, Gu\u00e1nica was a small barrio within the town of Yauco. It had 60 houses in all and was defended only by eleven members of the 4th Volante de Yauco, a Puerto Rican militia unit, under the command of Lieutenant Enrique M\u00e9ndez L\u00f3pez. When the convoy with General Nelson A. Miles, approached the barrio, Gu\u00e1nica lighthouse keeper Robustiano Rivera immediately alerted its residents. Nearly all the residents abandoned their homes and joined Rivera to go to Yauco, where he broke the news of the invading forces to the city's mayor. Only Agust\u00edn Barrenechea, Vicente Ferrer, Juan Mar\u00eda Morciglio, Sim\u00f3n Mejil, Salvador Mu\u00f1oz, Cornelio Serrano and Pascual Elena stayed to welcome the invaders. The first skirmish between Spanish/Puerto Rican and American armed forces was fought in that barrio between the Puerto Rican militia and twenty- eight sailors and Marines, under the command of Lieutenants H. P. Huse and Wood. They had come from the on rafts and landed on the beach, where Lt. M\u00e9ndez L\u00f3pez and his men opened fire on the Americans. During the small battle which followed, the Americans returned fire with a machine gun and the Gloucester began to bombard the Spanish position. Lt. M\u00e9ndez L\u00f3pez and three of his men were wounded, and the militia unit retreated to the town of Yauco. This was also the site of the first major land battle in Puerto Rico during the war between Spanish/Puerto Rican and American armed forces. On July 26, 1898, Spanish forces and Puerto Rican volunteers, led by Captain Salvador Meca and Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Puig, fought against American forces led by Brigadier General George A. Garretson. The Spanish forces engaged the 6th Massachusetts in a firefight at the Hacienda Desideria, owned by Antonio Mariani, in what became known as the Battle of Yauco of the Puerto Rico Campaign. The casualties of Puig's forces were two officers and three soldiers wounded and two soldiers dead. The Spanish forces were ordered to retreat. ===Earthquake in 2020=== Multiple residences and structures in Yauco were damaged in a series of earthquakes with increasing magnitude that started on December 27, 2019 and culminating with a 6.4-magnitude earthquake that struck the island in the morning hours of January 7, 2020.

A center for emergency operations was set up in the municipality's auditorium parking area, with air-conditioned tarps and tents for evacuated hospital patients and with food being cooked by World Central Kitchen. ===Hurricane Maria=== Significant rainfall from Hurricane Maria, on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Yauco, leaving entire communities cut-off.
