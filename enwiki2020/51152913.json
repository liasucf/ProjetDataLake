Intelligence suggested that many of the rockets were being launched from coastal areas. Senior Maglan officers planned a clandestine operation behind Hezbollah lines to destroy rocket launchers in the western sector of South Lebanon along the coast, and the mission was cleared for action after personal approval from Brigadier- General Gal Hirsch. ==The operation== Dozens of Maglan soldiers were airlifted into South Lebanon by helicopter. After hiding from a passing Hezbollah squad, the soldiers began calling in airstrikes against Hezbollah rocket launchers, as well as headquarters, trucks, ammunition dumps, and other military infrastructure. A total of 150 Hezbollah targets, including 40 rocket launchers, were destroyed. The operation lasted 11 days before the soldiers were withdrawn, as a ceasefire came into effect.Gal Perl Finkel, Don\u2019t throw out the baby with the bath water, The Jerusalem Post, August 09, 2018. ==Aftermath== The operation was widely considered a success, and was estimated to have reduced Hezbollah rocket fire by 40%. ==References== Category:2006 Lebanon War Category:Battles involving Israel Category:Battles of the 2006 Lebanon War Category:August 2006 events in Asia Category: Clandestine operations ",
