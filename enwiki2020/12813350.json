    "text": "Tobacco Road is a 1941 film directed by John Ford and starring Charley Grapewin, Marjorie Rambeau, Gene Tierney, William Tracy, Dana Andrews and Ward Bond. It was based on the 1932 novel of the same name by Erskine Caldwell and the 1933 Broadway play that Jack Kirkland adapted from the novel.https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-show/tobacco-road-8766 The plot was rewritten for the film by Nunnally Johnson, however.Crowther, Bosley.\"Tobacco Road (1941)\",New York Times, February 21, 1941 ==Cast== *Charley Grapewin as Jeeter Lester *Marjorie Rambeau as Sister Bessie Rice *Gene Tierney as Ellie May Lester *William Tracy as Dude Lester *Elizabeth Patterson as Ada Lester *Dana Andrews as Capt. Tim Harmon *Ward Bond as Lov Bensey *Slim Summerville as Henry Peabody *Grant Mitchell as George Payne *Zeffie Tilbury as Grandma Lester ==Production== Studios attempted to acquire the screen rights to the novel from 1933. RKO Pictures and Warner Bros. considered buying the rights, the first intending to assign Charles Laughton in the lead role, but were discouraged from doing so. In March 1940, Columbia Pictures showed interest, but was informed that Tobacco Road was on the list of banned titles. Eventually, 20th Century Fox gained the rights in August 1940, with RKO as its main competitor. It was believed that Fox won due to the success of The Grapes of Wrath (1940). They were the main preference of the copyright holders Erskine Caldwell and Jack Kirkland, who were reluctant to sell the rights unless the film \"would be picturized honestly and fearlessly.\"\"Sensational Screen Play Comes Thurs. To Fox California\", San Jose Evening News, March 12, 1941, p. 13 Initially, Henry Hull was sought from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to reprise the main role previously portrayed on Broadway. However, in October 1940 he was revealed to be only in consideration, along with Walter Brennan and Henry Fonda. Much to the \"immense satisfaction of the studio\", John Ford was signed on as the director as early as March 1940.\"Hollywood Now Only Talks In Millions\" by Sheilah Graham, The Miami News, March 31, 1940, p. 2 On production, he commented in a December 1940 interview: \"We have no dirt in the picture. We've eliminated the horrible details and what we've got left is a nice dramatic story. It's a tear-jerker, with some comedy relief. What we're aiming at is to have the customers sympathize with our people and not feel disgusted.\"\"'Tobacco Road' Cleaned Up For Production as Movie\" by Frederick C. Othman, St. Petersburg Times, December 15, 1940 The decision was most likely a result of a November 1940 warning that \"many religious folk throughout the nation may be offended by the religious aspects.\" Casting was a huge problem, and it was reported that producer Darryl F. Zanuck and director Ford deliberated for weeks.\"'Tobacco Road' To Be Here Soon\", Spartanburg Herald- Journal, March 30, 1941, p. 8 Marjorie Rambeau and Gene Tierney were cast in November 1940.\"Gene Tierney Wins Big Role in 'Tobacco Road'\", Los Angeles Times, November 13, 1940 Most other cast members were signed on in the same month. Ford personally insisted that Charley Grapewin was cast as Jeeter, because of their previous collaboration on The Grapes of Wrath.\"Director Ford Operates Own 'Stock' Group\" by Robbin Coons, Toledo Blade, January 15, 1941 To portray Dude, William Tracy had to diet and lose teeth. On his role, Tracy commented in a December 1940 interview: \"It's a swell part. It's one you can sink your teeth in, if you have your teeth.\" While in production, Tobacco Road was thought to be received as even greater than The Grapes of Wrath. Filming was initially set on location in Georgia, but to avoid any controversy, the studio decided in November 1940 that the film would be shot in the studio on closed sets.\"'Tobacco Road' Will Be Filmed On Closed Sets\" by Cameron Shipp, Spartanburg Herald-Journal, November 25, 1940, p. 5 To further prevent the film from being banned before its release, there was no publicity. ==Reception== Many critics compared the film of Tobacco Road to the stage version, which was still running on Broadway at the time of the film's release. Variety wrote, \"The slightest attempt to clean up Jeeter and his brood dooms the effort to failure... He's better entertainment--and box office --with rough edges.\" Despite the studio's concerns over the censorship, the film was only banned in Australia for unknown reasons. Although the film received mixed reviews, it became a success at the box office, and it had grossed up to $1.9 million by 1973. ==See also== * List of American films of 1941 * Southern Gothic ==References== ==External links== * * *New Georgia Encyclopedia article on Tobacco Road *TCM synopsis Category:1941 films Category:1941 comedy films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American comedy films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by John Ford Category:Films produced by Darryl F.
