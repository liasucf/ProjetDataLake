One review states that the manga is good due to the amount of action, especially with the use of movie-style camera angles in showing off some of the gunfights in Rose Hip Zero. Anime News Network's review of Rose Hip Zero have positive as well, stating that the manga was well done for using the \"buddy cop\"-style of relationship, similar to the Lethal Weapon series done in the 1990s, though Anime News Network critiques it for having Kasumi use non-lethal bullets in her weapons, which has \"no place in a gritty police drama.\" Teenreads.com has even said that Rose Hip Zero is a fine read especially to those who prefer \"shoot-'em-up action movies, police dramas, or even the flying-fists of Jackie Chan.\" ==See also== * Rose Hip Rose ==References== ==External links== * Category:2005 manga Category:Sh\u014dnen manga Category:Rose Hip series Category:Terrorism in fiction Category:Tokyopop titles ",
