Psychoanalysis in Britain, 1893\u20131913: Histories and Historiography. Lexington Books. pp. 73-74. The aim of the journal was to promote the \"fruitarian system of living, and to teach its advantages.\" The journal promoted vegetarianism from a Christian perspective. Beard believed that a vegetarian diet should be pursued as a moral duty.Stark, James F. (2018). Replace them by Salads and Vegetables: Dietary Innovation, Youthfulness, and Authority, 1900\u20131939.

The Cambridge Independent Press (November 27, 1908). p. 3 Similar to Oldfield, Beard's type of fruitarianism was not strict and included dairy and eggs. Beard defined fruitarianism as \"systematic living upon the various fruits of the earth, instead of upon the products of the shambles.\" He stated that fruits of the earth included all kinds of cereals, seeds and every variety of nuts, all fruits and every kind of vegetable and this could be supplemented by dairy and egg products. Beard argued that fruitarianism helped one to live a humane and hygienic life with freedom from the butchery of animal flesh. ==Selected publications== *A Simple Guide to a Natural and Humane Diet (1898) *Is Flesh-Eating Morally Defensible?
