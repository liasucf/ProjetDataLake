    "text": "Oblique Apollo 17 image, facing east Izsak is a small lunar impact crater that is located on the Moon's far side, hidden from view from the Earth. It lies about half-way between the walled plains Fermi to the northeast and Milne to the southwest. Due south of Izsak is the larger crater Schaeberle. Izsak is a circular, nearly symmetric crater formation with a sharp-edged rim that has received little erosion. At the midpoint of the interior floor is a small central peak. == Satellite craters == By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Izsak. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !
