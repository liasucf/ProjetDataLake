    "text": "The Woodlawn Commercial Historic District, in Birmingham, Alabama, was listed on the National Register of Historic Districts in 1991. It is a district which included 12 contributing buildings and four non-contributing buildings in an area around the junction of 1st Avenue North and 55th Place in Birmingham, at the center of the community of Woodlawn, Alabama, which for a time was a separate city before being absorbed into Birmingham. A much larger portion of the community, including all of this Commercial historic district and residential areas as well, was later listed on the National Register as Woodlawn Historic District. The Woodlawn Commercial Historic District is roughly L-shaped along 1st Avenue North, running northeast to southwest, and along perpendicular 55th Place. All buildings were constructed between 1908 and 1935. It was noted that the district contains \"a wide range of building types associated with a small, early twentieth-century suburban community; such as a church and church-related school (inventory #2, 1), a city hall (inventory #12), a fraternal lodge (inventory #3), and a variety of small commercial and professional buildings (inv. #9-11,13-18). Most all of the buildings located within the district are constructed in brick. One building has been covered in smooth stucco (inventory #11). Stone and terra cotta is used throughout the district as decorative elements (inventory #2, 3, 9, 10, 12, 13, 18). Many of the buildings are highlighted by decorative brick corbelled cornices (inventory #3, 9, 14, 15, 16, 17). The buildings within the district range in height from one, two, and three stories. All of the commercial buildings have flat or parapet roofs. Because of the urban location of the district, all of the buildings are situated close to the street and are either attached to one another or are separated only by an alley.\" It includes Beaux Arts, Gothic Revival, and Commercial Style architecture. Selected buildings in the district are: *the Woodlawn City Hall (1908), which was already separately listed on the National Register. The city hall functioned as such for only a few years before the city was absorbed into Birmingham. *Woodlawn Methodist Episcopal Church (1909-12), Victorian Gothic Revival, the only stone building in the district, wigh a three-story square tower. *Church school of the Woodlawn M.E.
