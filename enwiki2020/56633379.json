From 1977 to 1979 the State of Israel permitted approximately 360 Vietnamese boat people fleeing the 1975 Communist takeover of Vietnam to enter the country. The most well-known rescue operation took place on June 10, 1977 in which an Israeli freighter ship called the Yuvali, en route to Taiwan, sighted the passengers. Prime Minister Menachem Begin was quoted as having compared them to Holocaust refugees: > \"We never have forgotten the boat with 900 Jews, the St. Louis, having left > Germany in the last weeks before the Second World War\u2026 traveling from harbor > to harbor, from country to country, crying out for refuge. They were > refused\u2026 Therefore it was natural\u2026 to give those people a haven in the Land > of Israel.\" An Associated Press broadcast from October 26, 1979 covered one of the arrival flights in which a refugee stated he would like to thank the government of Israel and Prime Minister Menachem Begin \"to give us a homeland while the other countries were still reluctant to take us when we left our country to flee from the barbaric regime of communism.\" Vietnamese refugees happily waving to the welcoming crowd at Ben Gurion Airport, June 26, 1977.
