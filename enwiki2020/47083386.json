She attended the University of California at Los Angeles and then went to work at Fox as a script reader before moving up the ranks to be a script clerk. Eventually she began writing her own screenplays for Fox, working on two popular franchises, Charlie Chan and the Jones Family. Later she worked on wartime musical films. She wrote many of her scripts in collaboration with writer-director-actor Robert Ellis, who she began working with around 1934 and married at some point after 1940. In fact, in 1938, Ellis was sued by actress Vera Reynolds for $150,000; Reynolds alleged that Ellis had promised to marry her but instead took a trip to Mexico with Logan. Ellis and Logan had separate contracts but made the same salary. ==Selected filmography== * Charlie Chan in Egypt (1935) * Ladies Love Danger (1935) * Back to Nature (1936) * Red Lights Ahead (1936) * Footlights and Shadows (1936) * Charlie Chan's Secret (1936) * Charlie Chan at the Circus (1936) * Charlie Chan at the Race Track (1936) * Charlie Chan at the Olympics (1937) * The Jones Family in Big Business (1937) * A Trip to Paris (1938) * Charlie Chan in City in Darkness (1939) * The Man Who Wouldn't Talk (1940) * Iceland (1942) * Hello, Frisco, Hello (1943) * Pin Up Girl (1944) * Something for the Boys (1944) * Four Jills in a Jeep (1944) ==References== ==Bibliography== * Solomon, Aubrey.
