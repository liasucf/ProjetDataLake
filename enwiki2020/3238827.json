Rovo defines their music as \"man- drive trance,\" and many of their compositions have a repetitive minimalism, blended with progressive rock and psychedelic music, related to the style of bands such as Gong, Neu!, and Simple Minds (circa 1981). They collaborated with Gong guitarist (and former Simple Minds producer) Steve Hillage's group System 7 on the 2013 album \"Phoenix Rising\". ==Discography== *Pico!
