    "text": "Torah Jane Bright (born 27 December 1986) is an Australian professional snowboarder. She is Australia's most successful Winter Olympian, former Olympic gold and silver medalist, two time X Games gold medalist, three time US Open winner, two time Global Open Champion, three time World Superpipe Champion, former TTR World Champion and recipient of the Best Female Action Sports Athlete at the ESPY awards. In 2014 Bright became the first Olympic athlete (male or female) to qualify for all three snowboarding disciplines; halfpipe, slopestyle and boarder-cross. ==Early life== Bright was born in Cooma, New South Wales on 27 December 1986, to parents Peter and Marion Bright; she is the fourth of five siblings. Her parents named her \"Torah\" after her sister Rowena learned from her Jewish piano teacher that the name referred to the Jewish name for the first five books of the Tanakh and meant \"bearer of a great spiritual message\" and suggested the name for her new sister. Bright grew up in Cooma, New South Wales and attended Cooma North Public School at the base of the Snowy Mountains. She started out as a downhill ski racer. Bright's brother, Ben, is also a professional snowboarder and remains her coach. Her older sister, Rowena, competed in the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics in alpine skiing. ==Career== Bright uses a goofy stance. Bright finished 30th overall at the 2005 World Championships in Whistler, Canada and was runner-up for the World Cup title during the 2003\u201304 season. Bright entered only three World Cup events during the 2004\u201305 season, both in February at the 2006 Winter Olympic venue of Bardonecchia. She placed third in both events, qualifying for the Australian Olympic team. In 2006, Bright earned a silver medal at the Winter X Games in Aspen, Colorado. She returned the following year, winning the gold medal in the women's superpipe event. She is the first Australian snowboarder to ever win gold at the Winter X Games (11), beating Winter Olympic medalists Gretchen Bleiler and Hannah Teter. In 2007, Bright took first at the Nissan X-Trail Nippon Open in the women's halfpipe, giving her back-to-back wins in two consecutive competitions. At the 2007 World Super Pipe Championships in Park City, Utah, Bright won first place, beating 2002 Olympic gold medalist Kelly Clark. In late 2007, she made the podium for both events in the Roxy Chicken Jam, the final event in the TTR (Ticket to Ride) Snowboard Tour, where she became the 2007 TTR world champion.Torah Bright Discusses 2009 Roxy Snow Line Bright during the 2010 Winter Olympics In 2010, at the Winter Olympics at Vancouver, Bright was chosen to carry the flag for Australia at the opening ceremonies, and qualified for the no. 1 spot for the final of the women's halfpipe, despite suffering two concussions beforehand in training. Crashing out in her first run in the final, Bright was the first competitor to make a second run. With a successful second run, she posted a score of 45.0, which remained the highest score through the field's second run. Bright became the fourth Australian to win a Winter Olympics gold medal. In 2013 at the Winter X Games XVII in Aspen, Colorado, Bright came in fourth in the superpipe behind medalists Kelly Clark, Elena Hight, and Arielle Gold. In 2014 at the Winter Olympics at Sochi, having entered an unprecedented triple of slopestyle, halfpipe, and boarder-cross, Bright finished 7th in the inaugural women's slopestyle final and went on to win silver with a score of 91.50 in the women's halfpipe. This was Australia's first medal at the 2014 Winter Olympics. The medal also saw Bright surpass Alisa Camplin to become Australia's most successful Winter Olympics athlete. Bright was a participant in the fourteenth season of Dancing with the Stars. ==Endorsements== Bright has a lifelong sponsorship with Rhythm Snowsports, located in her home town Cooma. She also has a head-to-toe sponsorship with Roxy, the female-specific brand of action-sports company Quiksilver. For the 2008\u201309 season, she worked to expand her career into design, working on a new addition to the Roxy's women's line, dubbed the \"Bright Series,\" which includes her snowboard, the Roxy Eminence. Her other sponsors include Subway and Boost Mobile. ==Competition results== 2014 * 2nd \u2013 Half-pipe \u2013 Winter Olympics (2014 Winter Olympics) * 7th \u2013 Slope-style \u2013 Winter Olympics (2014 Winter Olympics) 2013 * 1st \u2013 Super-pipe \u2013 iON Mountain Championships (Winter Dew Tour) 2010 * 1st \u2013 Half-pipe \u2013 Winter Olympics (2010 Winter Olympics) 2009 * 1st \u2013 Super-pipe \u2013 Toyota Championship (Winter Dew Tour) * 1st \u2013 Super-pipe \u2013 EXPN Winter X games 13 (Aspen, Colorado) 2008 * 2nd \u2013 TTR World Snowboard Tour 07/08 * 1st \u2013 Super-pipe \u2013 World Superpipe Championships \u2013 Park City, UT. * 2nd \u2013 Super-pipe \u2013 EXPN Winter X Games 12 (Aspen) * 1st \u2013 Super-pipe \u2013 Nippon Open Japan * 1st \u2013 Super-pipe \u2013 Burton US Open, Vermont * Burton Global Open Champion 2007 * Burton Global Open Champion * TTR World Snowboard Tour Champion 06/07 * 1st \u2013 Half-pipe \u2013 Burton New Zealand Open * 4th \u2013 Slope-style \u2013 Burton New Zealand Open * 2nd \u2013 Half-pipe \u2013 Roxy Chicken Jam (USA) * 3rd \u2013 Slope-style \u2013 Roxy Chicken Jam (USA) * 2nd \u2013 Slope-style \u2013 Burton US Open * 3rd \u2013 Half-pipe \u2013 Burton US Open * 1st \u2013 Super-pipe \u2013 World Super-pipe Championships * 1st \u2013 Half-pipe \u2013 X-Trail Nippon Open * 1st \u2013 Half-pipe \u2013 EXPN Winter X Games 11 2006 * 1st \u2013 Half-pipe \u2013 US Open * 1st \u2013 Super-pipe \u2013 World Super-pipe Championships Park City, Utah. * 1st \u2013 Vans Cup 2005 * 1st \u2013 Arctic Challenge, Troms\u00f8, Norway * 2nd \u2013 US Open * 1st \u2013 Nippon Open * 3rd \u2013 FIS World Cup * 3rd \u2013 Slope-style \u2013 Roxy Chicken Jam (USA) * 30th \u2013 2005 World Championships in Whistler, Canada 2004 * 1st \u2013 Half-Pipe \u2013 FIS World Cup, Turin * 2nd \u2013 World Cup, Whistler, British Columbia * 2nd \u2013 FIS World Cup, Juetsu, Japan * 3rd \u2013 FIS World Cup, Sapporo, Japan * 2nd \u2013 Roxy pro, Les Arc, France 2003 * Runner Up for the World Cup Title \u2013 2003\u201304 season ==Personal life== Bright is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
