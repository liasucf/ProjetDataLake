The magazine was a small, independent, monthly magazine, which had an online and print version. It was created as a fortnightly tabloid publication before it evolved into a monthly magazine format. The magazine was disestablished in October 2011. The magazine was representative of alternative-commercial media with independent ownership combined with a political and religious mission. It provided a mix of lifestyle and information featuring cultural, political, religious stories focusing on their relevance to Muslims around the world. It provided independent analysis, critique, and review of current affairs, politics, culture, ideas and spirituality. It engaged in a political struggle for civil liberties, rights, political participation, and inclusion of Muslims in British society. It focused on issues and themes of common concern to Muslims. The magazine was politically independent as it is not financed by any one particular country or regime. It received financial support primarily from advertising and subscriptions; its advertising revenue came mostly from private Islamic companies and charity organisations. Each issue had between 50 and 78 pages and a print run of 20,000. Q-News had staff of 60 unpaid people, 30 of whom were journalists, 27 were freelancers, and three were writers. ==See also== *Islam in the United Kingdom ==References== ==External links== * Category:1992 establishments in England Category:2011 disestablishments in England Category:Biweekly magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Monthly magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Online magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Religious magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:English-language magazines Category:Defunct magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Islam in the United Kingdom Category:Islamic magazines Category:Magazines published in London Category:Magazines established in 1992 Category:Magazines disestablished in 2011 ",
