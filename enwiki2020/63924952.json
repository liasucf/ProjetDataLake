    "text": "A Regional Garden Show (Landesgartenschau) is an exhibition on horticulture taking place in several German and Austrian states. In Germany, a state horticultural show at the state level is the smaller counterpart to the Bundesgartenschau and the International Horticultural Show, in Austria there is no counterpart so far. == Germany == === History === right In the federal states of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Bavaria state garden shows have been held since 1980. In North Rhine-Westphalia there was already a first state garden show in 1970, other German states adopted the model later. In the Austrian federal states Upper Austria and Lower Austria, too, state garden shows have been taking place for several years in alternating two-year cycles. In 1980, the first cross-border national horticultural show in Germany took place in Ulm/Neu-Ulm (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg/Bavaria). === Objectives and financing === The garden shows are intended to improve the quality of life and the ecological climate in the cities. Often the garden shows also serve urban or regional political development objectives. For this reason, garden shows are usually not placed in particularly beautiful landscapes, but rather in areas which are particularly disadvantaged (e.g. due to mining damage), where the garden shows are aimed at supporting structure and help to promote urban planning. The investments which are made within the framework of the regional garden shows help the respective district to become more attractive and usually also to remain attractive. In addition national horticultural shows are today also measures of city marketing, since they can increase as a large meeting lasting half a year also the awareness level of a city. The municipalities, which often realize a garden show with the help of state funds, take a calculated financial risk. While some state garden shows closed with a \"black 0\" or even with slight profits, others exceeded their budget and had to be subsidised retrospectively. Particularly in municipalities with a strained budget situation, state garden shows are therefore sometimes controversial despite their long-term advantages, in some cases there have already been citizens' petitions or citizens' decisions. === Garden shows in the individual federal states === ==== Baden-W\u00fcerttemberg ==== Baden-Baden 1981 Kehl and Strasbourg 2004 (\"Garden Show of the Two Banks\"): Mimram Bridge Ladenburg 2005 Horb am Neckar 2011 Swabian Gm\u00fcnd 2014: Skystormers From 1980 to 2000, the \"large horticultural shows\" were held annually in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Since 2001, they have been held annually, alternating with the \"small state garden shows\", the so-called green projects.Martin Baur: Wie eine Schneek\u00f6nigin. In: S\u00fcdkurier. 23. Juni 2010. For green projects, the state provides a subsidy of a maximum of two million euros for green projects and a maximum of five million euros for state horticultural shows, whereby the municipalities also have to make corresponding contributions of their own.Martin Baur: Ausgew\u00e4hlte Kommunen. In: S\u00fcdkurier. 23. Juni 2010. By 2010, the state has granted almost 80 million euros in state subsidies. This has resulted in at least three times and in some cases even seven times the amount of investment on the part of the municipalities; they invested around 153 million euros: In the process, around 625 hectares of green spaces were created, redesigned and permanently secured. The State Horticultural Shows and green projects provide the impetus for comprehensive structural developments that create a spirit of optimism in the municipalities and strengthen their economic development. An expert commission will evaluate the applications and assess the submitted concepts on site. The Council of Ministers then awards the state garden shows and green projects in a cabinet meeting. The last strongly visited State Garden Show in Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg before the introduction of the \"Green Projects\" in 2001 was the 1992 State Garden Show in the \"Gold City\" of Pforzheim with a peak number of visitors of 1.6 million. Thereafter, the number of visitors at state level also fell well below one million in each case. For this reason, the state government decided as early as 1996 to carry out the smaller \"green projects\" in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg every two years from 2001 onwards. In 2014 Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd set a new record with around 2 million visitors. # 1980: Ulm/Neu-Ulm # 1981: Baden-Baden # 1982: Schw\u00e4bisch Hall # 1983: L\u00f6rrach \u2013 Landschaftspark Gr\u00fctt # 1984: Reutlingen # 1985: Heilbronn # 1986: Freiburg im Breisgau # 1988: Ettlingen # 1989: Bietigheim-Bissingen # 1990: Sindelfingen # 1991: Hockenheim # 1992: Pforzheim # 1993: IGA Stuttgart # 1994: Bad D\u00fcrrheim # 1996: B\u00f6blingen # 1997: Mosbach # 1998: Plochingen # 1999: Weil am Rhein # 2000: Singen (Hohentwiel) # 2001: Green Project Pfullendorf # 2002: Ostfildern # 2003: Green Project Nordheim (W\u00fcrttemberg) # 2003: Green Project Tuttlingen # 2004: Kehl und Stra\u00dfburg \u2013 Garten der zwei Ufer # 2005: Green Project Ladenburg # 2006: Heidenheim an der Brenz # 2007: Green Project Rheinfelden (Baden) # 2008: Bad Rappenau # 2009: Green Project Rechberghausen # 2010: Villingen-Schwenningen # 2011: Green Project Horb am Neckar Deck chair with advertisement for the State Garden Show 2020 in \u00dcberlingen # 2012: Nagold: Gr\u00fcne Urbanit\u00e4t # 2013: Green Project Sigmaringen # 2014: Schw\u00e4bisch Gm\u00fcnd, Record number of visitors with approx. 2 million # 2015: Green Project M\u00fchlacker # 2016: \u00d6hringen # 2017: Green Project Bad Herrenalb # 2018: Lahr # 2019: Green Project Remstal # 2020: \u00dcberlingen # 2021: Green Project Eppingen # 2022: Neuenburg am Rhein # 2023: Green Project Balingen # 2024: Wangen im Allg\u00e4u # 2025: Green Project Freudenstadt/Baiersbronn # 2026: Ellwangen # 2027: Green Project Bad Urach # 2028: Rottweil # 2029: Green Project Vaihingen/Enz # 2030: Ulm ==== Bavaria ==== After North Rhine-Westphalia, Bavaria, together with Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, was the first federal state to hold state garden shows. The Free State initially started in an irregular rhythm with four State Horticultural Shows in Neu-Ulm, Augsburg, Dinkelsb\u00fchl and Straubing. Since 1990 the State Garden Shows have been held in Bavaria every two years, at even-numbered years, in addition to the Federal Garden Shows, which take place at odd-numbered years. In the uneven years in between there has been a small horticultural show in Bavaria since 1995 called Nature in the City, in which, similar to the State Horticultural Shows, but on a smaller scale, improvements in green and recreational structures form the framework for the horticultural show. Up to and including 2015, the Free State and the EU have provided 83 million euros in funding for Bavarian garden shows, almost 23 million visitors have been recorded and around 460 hectares of public green spaces have been created over these years.http://www.stmuv.bayern.de/themen/naturschutz/unterwegs/gartenschauen/index.htm Cities and municipalities can apply to the Society for the Promotion of the Bavarian State Horticultural Shows (F\u00d6G) to organise a garden show. The awarding procedure and also the type and implementation of the state funding has been criticised on numerous occasions. Unter anderem hielt der Bayerische Oberste Rechnungshof die Vergabe der Gartenschauen in Bayern f\u00fcr intransparent und empfahl, sie auf eine neue Grundlage zu stellen, was auch geschah.

A show was to take place in the landscape park Brodaer H\u00f6he of Neubrandenburg, but it did not go beyond the design phase.Landesgartenschau Neubrandenburg: Ideen- und Realisierungswettbewerb, Wettbewerbe Aktuell 2003, Originally, a further State Garden Show was scheduled for 2014/2015. This was initially suspended because the applicants G\u00fcstrow and Putbus were unable to present a financially sustainable concept. In the year 2003 an International Horticultural Exhibition was held in Rostock. In Schwerin a successful National Garden Show followed in 2009. For 2025 Schwerin was awarded the contract by the BUGA Society for a further Federal Horticultural Show, which is to further develop the 2009 concept and make the southern shore of Lake Schwerin more accessible to residents and visitors. A referendum was to decide on the organisation of the show on the election date of the Bundestag elections 2017 in September. After the state government failed to provide the financial means, the BUGA 2025 was returned to the German National Garden Show Society mbH (DBG) 2017. On July 26, 2018, Rostock launched a BUGA application and was officially awarded the contract to host the National Garden Show 2025 on September 10, 2018. ==== Lower Saxony ==== # 2002: Bad Zwischenahn, \u201ePark of gardens\u201c # 2004: Wolfsburg # 2006: Winsen (Luhe) # 2010: Bad Essen # 2014: Papenburg # 2018: Bad Iburg # 2022: Bad Gandersheim Rostrup Laga 02.jpg|Bad Zwischenahn (2002) Schlosspark Wolfsburg -
