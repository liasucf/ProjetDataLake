    "text": "Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo is the fourth studio album released by American punk rock band MxPx in 1998. The album title was taken from a letter that a fan had written to the band, complaining that the band was changing and was \"slowly going the way of the buffalo\". ==Background== Due to the success of MxPx's \"Chick Magnet\", from their previous album, Life in General, the band signed a multi-album contract with A&M.;Reece 1998, p. 18 A&M; had previously signed a deal with Tooth & Nail to co-market Life in General. This market deal was \"cobbled together in order to sign the band\", according to A&M; chairman Al Cafaro. ==Composition and recording== Moving away from the sound of Life in General, the band \"dirtied things up a little\", according to vocalist and bassist Mike Herrera, for Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo. The band refrained from making the album \"sound like it was produced in a lab.\" Greg Hetson of Bad Religion has guest vocals on \"The Downfall of Western Civilization\". ==Release== To generate hype, A&M; picked 1,000 of the band's fans and, from April to June 1998, sent them a CD of songs from the album. Despite the band's sizable fan base, the label was not approaching the album with high expectations. The vice president of A&M; estimated the album would easily achieve 100,000 in sales. On May 6, \"I'm OK, You're OK\" was sent to modern rock radio stations. The band supported Bad Religion on their tour of Europe in May. Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo was released on June 16 through A&M.; From June 30, for five weeks, the band played on the 1998 edition of Warped Tour. In August, the band supported Blink-182. ==Reception== The album charted at number 99 on the Billboard 200 and at number 2 on the Top Contemporary Christian chart. It certified gold in January 2000 by the Recording Industry Association of America. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== MxPx *Mike Herrera \u2014 bass, vocals *Tom Wisniewski \u2014 guitar, backing vocals *Yuri Ruley \u2014 drums Additional musicians *Ronnie King \u2014 keyboard *Greg Hetson \u2014 lead guitar on \"The Downfall of the Western Civilization\" *Dale Yob \u2014 vocals on \"I'm Ok, You're OK\" *Jeff Bettger \u2014 screams on \"Fist vs. Tact\" and \"The Theme Fiasco\" Production *Steve Kravac \u2014 producer, mixing *Aaron Warner \u2014 production assistant *Al Lay \u2014 mixing assistant *Brian \"Big Bass\" Gardner \u2014 mastering Artwork *Marina Chavez \u2014 photography *Mitch Tobias \u2014 photography *John Nissen \u2014 illustrations *Luke W.
