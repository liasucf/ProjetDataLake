His research centers on diagnostic studies of the atmosphere. Madden is a fellow of the American Meteorological Society (AMS)https://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/about-ams/ams-organization-and- administration/list-of-fellows/ accessed 5 October 2019 and a recipient of the 2002 Jule G. Charney Award of the AMS. == Biography == Madden was born on May 8, 1938 in Chicago, Illinois Ancestry.com. U.S. Public Records Index, 1950\u20131993, Volume 1 [database on-line].

He grew up in Edison Park in northwest Chicago and attended St. Juliana\u2019s Grammar School and Fenwick High School\"See \"Madden, Roland Aloysius\", p. 43, Fenwick High School Yearbook, Senior Class of 1956.

That same year, he joined the United States Air Force where he served for four years as Duty Forecaster at Patrick Air Force Base and Assistant Staff Meteorologist at Cape Canaveral. He received his master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in meteorology from the University of Chicago in 1967 and Colorado State University in 1978 respectivelyhttps://www.atmos.colostate.edu/people/alumni/ accessed 5 October 2019. In 1967, he was appointed staff scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder Colorado where he worked for 35 years, most recently as a member of the Climate Analysis Section in the Climate and Global Dynamics Division. Madden spent periods of time as an invited scientist at a variety of institutions, including the Scripps Institute of Oceanography, Free University of Berlin, Naval Postgraduate School, University of Stockholm, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology, the New Zealand National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, and Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. Madden retired from NCAR in 2002 . He was married to Mary Agnes (n\u00e9e Ruh) Madden (1939\u20132019) for fifty-seven years, and the couple has four children.https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/dailycamera/obituary.aspx?n=mary- agnes-madden&pid;=193277409&fhid;=6726 accessed 5 October 2019 == Career Highlights == Over the course of his career, Madden authored over 100 research publications, technical reports, and proceedingshttp://imsc.pacificclimate.org/awards_madden.shtml accessed 5 October 2019. He is perhaps best known for his discovery in 1971 with Paul JulianMadden, R. A., and P. R. Julian, 1971: Detection of a 40\u201350 day oscillation in the zonal wind in the tropical Pacific. J. Atmos. Sci., 28, 702\u2013708. of the Madden\u2013Julian oscillation (MJO) and the comprehensive description of the phenomenon in 1972.Madden, R. A., and P. R. Julian, 1972: Description of global-scale circulation cells in the tropics with a 40\u201350 day period. J. Atmos. Sci., 29, 1109\u20131123. The MJO is an eastward moving atmospheric disturbance that traverses the planet in the tropics with a period of 30-60 days, on average. The MJO is the main intra-seasonal fluctuation explaining weather in the tropics, and it continues to be studied broadlyJohn E. Oliver, 2005, The Encyclopedia of World Climatology (Encyclopedia of Earth Sciences Series), Berlin:Springer, p. 476, .Chidong Zhang, 2005, \"Madden- Julian Oscillation\", Rev. Geophysics, 43:RG2003, 1-36.. Selected areas of important contributions (and related publications) in addition to the MJO include: * The first estimates of the composition of cloud clusters in the Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE) area;Madden, R. A., L. Sapp, and E. Zipser, 1974: Clouds over the tropical Atlantic during July and August 1970. Bull. Amer. Meteor.

Kidson, 1999: The potential for long-range predictability of precipitation over New Zealand, Int. J.
