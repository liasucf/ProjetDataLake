Porter for the tilted layers of rock strata. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1924 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. ==Geology== Like other mountains in Banff Park, Tilted Mountain is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Tilted Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below \u221220 \u00b0C with wind chill factors below \u221230 \u00b0C. ==References== ==See also== *Geography of Alberta *Geology of Alberta ==External links== * Weather forecast: Tilted Mountain * Parks Canada web site: Banff National Park Category:Mountains of Alberta Category:Mountains of Banff National Park Category:Alberta's Rockies Category:Canadian Rockies ",
