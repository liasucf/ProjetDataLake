    "text": "Austad Church () is a parish church in Bygland municipality in Agder county, Norway. It is located in the village of Tveit on the south shore of the river Otra, just off the Norwegian National Road 9. The church is part of the Bygland parish in the Otredal deanery in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark. The white, wooden church was built in a rectangular style in 1880 by the architect Oskar Fabricius from Oslo. The church seats about 250 people. It was consecrated on 7 July 1880 by the Bishop J\u00f8rgen Moe. This church was built to replace a much older Austad Church that was located in Austad, about to the southeast, on the other side of the river. The old church was torn down around the same time as the present church was built. == See also == * List of churches in Aust-Agder == References == Category:Bygland Category:Churches in Agder Category:Wooden churches in Norway Category:19th-century Church of Norway church buildings ",
