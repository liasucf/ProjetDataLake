Until 1939, it was garrisoned in Krakow, and its traditions dated back to 1784, when a cavalry regiment of Prince Jozef Poniatowski was formed in Lwow. The Prince Poniatowski Regiment was part of the Imperial Austrian Army, and in the early 20th century was called 1st Regiment of Austrian Uhlans. Nevertheless, it was made of ethnic Poles, with Polish officers and Polish traditions. In late 1918 it was renamed into 1st Land of Krakow Uhlan Regiment, and after a few years it was renamed again, into 8th Uhlan Regiment of Prince Jozef Poniatowski. Krakowska BK w 1938 The regiment was involved in heavy fighting during the Polish-Soviet War. It took part in the Kiev Offensive (1920), and then fought against 1st Cavalry Army (Soviet Union), commanded by Semyon Budyonny. It participated in the Battle of Komarow, one of the most important battles of the Polish-Bolshevik War. After the war the regiment was garrisoned in the village of Rakow, located in the suburbs of Krakow. During the 1923 Krakow riot, its soldiers under Rotmistrz Lucjan Bochenek charged on the crowd of protesting workers. The charge was a complete failure, as horses slipped on wet pavement. Altogether, 14 uhlans of the regiment were killed in the riots. During the Invasion of Poland, the regiment was part of Krakow Cavalry Brigade (General Zygmunt Piasecki), Krakow Army. Commanded by Colonel Wlodzimierz Dunin-Zuchowski, it was on September 3, 1939, sent to the area of Szczekociny, where it was mauled by the armoured Wehrmacht divisions. By September 6, it had crossed the Vistula, to join the newly created Lublin Army. Most of the regiment was destroyed during the campaign, only some of its elements managed to cross the Hungarian border in the second half of September 1939. In 1940, the regiment was recreated in France, as 1st Prince Jozef Poniatowski Reece Company. Also, its traditions were kept by the Home Army of Krakow district. == Commandants == * Colonel Roman Kawecki (XI 1918 \u2013 14 I 1919), * Colonel Adam Kicinski (14 I 1919 \u2013 1920) * Major Henryk Brzezowski (II \u2013 VIII 1920) * Major Karol Rommel (1920) * Rotmistrz Kornel Krzeczunowicz (1920-1921) * Major Stanislaw Riess de Riesenhorst (1921) * Colonel Adam Rozwadowski (1921) * Colonel Stanislaw Riess de Riesenhorst (1921-1922) * Colonel Wladyslaw Bzowski (1922-1923) * Colonel Stanislaw Riess de Riesenhorst (1923) * Colonel Aleksander Zelio (1923) * Colonel Wladyslaw Bzowski (1923-1928) * Colonel Stefan Dembinski (1928-1930) * Colonel Kazimierz Mastalerz (1930-1939) * Colonel Wlodzimierz Dunin-Zuchowski (1939) * Major Wlodzimierz Kasperski (1940) * Major Wladyslaw Pininski (1942-1944) == Symbols == The regimental flag was funded by wives, mothers and sisters of the officers of the unit.
