Known as the \u201cDevilcats\u201d, it served as a training squadron during the war, and was deactivated in early 1946. ==History== ===World War II=== VMF-911 was formed on June 25, 1944, at Marine Corps Auxiliary Airfield Kinston, North Carolina, under Major James B. Moore. Initial training was on the F4U Corsair but 911 transitioned to the F7F Tigercat in February 1945, the second Marine Corps squadron to receive the twin-engine Grumman (after VMFN-531; see Location and Allowance of US Naval Aircraft, 13 February 1945). In mid-August 1945, led by Major Robert T. Kingsbury, 911 was sent to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California from which it was to deploy to Okinawa, Japan to support Operation Downfall the planned invasion of Japan.Reed Lost Black Sheep, p.84-85. Following Japan's surrender, VMF-911 aviators, aircraft, and a small number of ground personnel deployed from Miramar to Okinawa. Upon arrival, the squadron\u2019s assets and personnel were absorbed by VMF-312 and remained so until their return to the United States in February 1946. During its time overseas, VMF-312 adopted the Devilcat insignia and nickname. The squadron was disestablished on March 15, 1946. ==See also== * United States Marine Corps Aviation * List of active United States Marine Corps aircraft squadrons * List of inactive United States Marine Corps aircraft squadrons ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * * * ;Web Fighting911 Category:Inactive units of the United States Marine Corps ",
