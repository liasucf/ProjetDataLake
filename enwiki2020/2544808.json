    "text": "Vitr\u00e9, France A crocket (or croquet) is a hook-shaped decorative element common in Gothic architecture. The name derives from the diminutive of the French croc, meaning \"hook\", due to the resemblance of crockets to a bishop's crosier. ==Description== A crocket is in the form of a stylized carving of curled leaves, buds or flowers which are used at regular intervals to decorate the sloping edges of spires, finials, pinnacles, and wimpergs. ==As ornaments== When used to decorate the capital of columns, these are called crocket capitals. This element is also used as an ornament on furniture and metalwork in the Gothic style. ==Examples== * All Souls College \u2013 Oxford * Canterbury Cathedral * Notre Dame Cathedral \u2013 Paris * Le\u00f3n Cathedral \u2013 Spain * Duke Chapel ==References== ==External links== * Category:Church architecture Category:Ornaments (architecture) ",
