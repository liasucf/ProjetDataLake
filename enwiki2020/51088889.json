It was a passenger and cargo airline that operated from 1991 until 1997. ==Accidents== On September 10, 1992 a Fokker F27 (reg. OB-1443) operated by Expreso A\u00e9reo was landing in the Amazon jungle town of Bellavista (in the district of the same name) after a flight from Tarapoto. The tire of the Fokker's front landing gear burst on contact with the ground, causing the plane to spin out of control and veer off the runway, breaking in three parts and killing the pilot. The six remaining crew and the 36 passengers survived.https://www.baaa-acro.com/crash/crash- fokker-f27-bellavista-1-killedhttp://www.planecrashinfo.com/1992/1992-57.htm On February 25, 1994, an Expreso A\u00e9reo Yakovlev Yak-40 (just recently delivered to the airline) struck Mount Carpish six minutes after leaving Tingo Mar\u00eda for Lima, killing all 26 passengers and five crew members.
