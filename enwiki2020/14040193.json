A bill for legalisation was signed by Queen Elizabeth II on 14 December 2011 and registered in the royal court on 6 January 2012. The law took effect on 2 April 2012. ==Civil partnerships== In August 2009, it was announced by the Chief Minister that a bill to allow civil partnerships (; J\u00e8rriais: ) would be drafted and be due for introduction to the Assembly of the States of Jersey in October 2009.\"Jersey States to propose Civil Partnerships\", International Finance Centre, 2 September 2009\"Legal rights for same sex couples\", BBC News, 3 September 2009 On 20 October 2009, the Assembly voted in favour of civil partnerships \"in principle\".

On 14 December 2011, the bill received royal assent and was registered in the royal court on 6 January 2012. In March 2012, the Government of Jersey issued orders implementing the law, which took effect on 2 April 2012. ==Same-sex marriage== On 28 May 2014, Deputy Sam M\u00e9zec of the Reform Jersey party submitted a proposition asking the Assembly of the States of Jersey to support, in principle, the legalisation of same-sex marriage, and to request the Chief Minister to prepare the necessary draft legislation to give effect to the proposal. On 8 July 2014, the Assembly voted for an amendment to the proposal, introduced by Senator Ian Le Marquand, to request the Chief Minister to present a detailed study into the effects of allowing same-sex marriage by 31 December 2014. The amendment was passed by 24 votes to 18 and the amended proposition by 39 to 1. On 26 November 2014, Chief Minister Ian Gorst submitted a report, which included a commitment to introduce legislation allowing same-sex couples to get married in civil and religious ceremonies by the end of 2017, and to create safeguards for religious organisations and officials who do not wish to conduct same-sex marriages, among others.EQUAL MARRIAGE AND PARTNERSHIP: OPTIONS PAPER REPORT \u2013 NOVEMBER 2014 On 14 July 2015, the Chief Minister submitted a proposition to ask the States to decide whether they agree, in principle, that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry and to request that the draft legislation necessary to implement it be introduced for approval by the States, no later than January 2017. It was approved by the Assembly on 22 September 2015, 37 to 4. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+22 September 2015 vote in the States of Jersey |- ! Political affiliation !! style=\"width:20%;\"| Voted for !!

However, on 8 September 2017, the Chief Minister stated that the bill would be delayed and that it would not be in force until at least spring 2018. A draft same-sex marriage bill was eventually introduced into the States of Jersey on 3 October 2017. The States debated the bill on 16 November 2017 and agreed to its principles but sent it for further review to the Corporate Services Scrutiny Panel. The panel's report was presented to the States on 29 January 2018. Controversially, the report included a recommendation asking the States to approve a \"tolerance clause\" in the bill, which would have allowed traders to refuse to serve same-sex couples goods and services in accordance with their religious beliefs. The \"tolerance clause\" was strenuously opposed by equality and diversity campaigners in Jersey. The equality charity Liberate organised an online petition that received over 5,000 signatures opposing the inclusion of the clause. The charity gathered key support from members of church groups and wedding suppliers opposing the clause. A final vote on the bill by the States occurred on 1 February 2018, where it passed 42\u20131. The tolerance clause amendment was rejected by a vote of 40\u20135. The bill was granted royal assent in the Privy Council on 23 May 2018 and registered in the royal court on 1 June. On 26 June, the States approved a proposition to commence the law on 1 July 2018. The first same-sex marriage was performed on 9 July 2018. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+1 February 2018 vote in the States of Jersey |- ! Political affiliation !! style=\"width:20%;\"| Voted for !!
