    "text": "La Romana () is a village of some 2,500 people, located in the foothills of the Serra del Reclot a few kilometres from Algue\u00f1a and several kilometres from Hond\u00f3n de las Nieves and Novelda, in the autonomous community of Valencia, southern Spain. The village is surrounded by countryside where vineyards and almond orchards are grown. The area is also noted for the number of quarries producing marble and limestone. There are a number of cave dwellings around La Romana which are still in use, many having been converted into modern homes. The main village is set out on a grid pattern of mostly one-way streets, with very few buildings higher than one storey, with clean, tree lined streets. The town's popular fiesta is held in the third week of August each year, with a humorous parade held on the Thursday and Moors and Christians parades on the Friday and Saturday. In the autumn a gastronomica is held in the park. There is a small weekly street market on Saturdays, around where the covered daily market is. == Notable people == * \u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda Cant\u00f3, footballer ==References== Category:Municipalities in the Province of Alicante Category:Vinalop\u00f3 Mitj\u00e0 Category:Cave dwellings ",
