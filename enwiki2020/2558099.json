    "text": "The GE C39-8 is a 6-axle road switcher diesel-electric locomotive model built by GE Transportation Systems between 1984 and 1987. It is part of the GE Dash 8 Series of freight locomotives. A total of 161 examples of this locomotive were built for two North American railroads: Conrail and Norfolk Southern Railway. The C39-8 was a fairly unpopular locomotive with crews, cited factors such as a rough ride, tendency to overheat, frequent turbocharger issues, issues with the fuel injection system, and various other reliability issues. == Technical == The C39-8 is powered by a V16 7FDL-16 diesel engine driving a GE GMC187A2 main alternator. The power generated by the main alternator drove 6 GE 752AG traction motors, each with a gear ratio of 83:20 and connected to wheels which allowed the C39-8 a maximum speed of . Depending on customer options, the C39-8 carried between of diesel fuel, of lubricating oil, and of coolant. Like most North American diesel locomotives, the C39-8 uses normal water for cooling. The C39-8 has a maximum tractive effort of at . == Original owners == {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=4 | GE C39-8 owners |- ! Railroad ! Quantity ! Road numbers !
