Armed with five triple gun turrets (three forward, two aft), they mounted more main battery guns than any other standard U.S. cruisers. The Brooklyns were all commissioned between 1937 and 1939, in the time between the start of the war in Asia and before the outbreak of war in Europe. They served extensively in both the Pacific and Atlantic theaters during World War II. Though some were heavily damaged, all but survived the war. All that did were decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, and five were transferred to South American navies in 1951, where they served for many more years. One of these, , formerly , was sunk during the Falklands War in 1982.Ewing p. 76 The Brooklyn-class ships had a strong influence on US cruiser design. Nearly all subsequent US cruisers, heavy and light, were directly or indirectly based on them. Notable among these are the and of World War II. == Design == The Brooklyn-class design was a further refinement of the heavy cruiser that preceded it.Friedman, Norman. US Cruisers: An illustrated design history, pp. 155\u2013156 The desire for the Brooklyns arose from the London Naval Treaty of 1930, which limited the construction of heavy cruisers, i.e., ships carrying guns with calibers between . Great Britain needed trade control cruisers and hoped that the treaty would limit nations to smaller cruisers with a range that she could afford. Agreement to the London Treaty and the proceeding with the American light cruiser design can be focused to Admiral William V. Pratt, who overrode the vehement objections of the General Board.Friedman, Norman. US Cruisers: An illustrated design history, pp. 164\u2013165 Under the treaty the US was allowed for 18 heavy cruisers and , with no limit on the number of ships, for light cruisers.Friedman, Norman. US Cruisers: An illustrated design history, p. 187 The United States needed large cruisers to deal with the extreme ranges that operations in the Pacific Ocean required. Cruisers with guns and were therefore desired.US Navy Light Cruisers location 77 The US Navy's experience with the was not all that could be hoped for. The light hull design caused a stressed hull and was very overweight. Design started in 1930, with the first four of the class ordered in 1933, and an additional three ships in 1934. Basic criteria had been that speed and range should match heavy cruisers, and when the Japanese carrying fifteen 6-inch main guns appeared, the new US ships would match their weaponry. Various combinations of armor and power plants were tried in the efforts to stay below the Treaty 10,000 ton limit.Whitley pp. 248\u2013249 Aviation facilities were moved to the stern of the ship from the amidships position of the New Orleans-class cruisers.Friedman, Norman. US Cruisers: An illustrated design history, p. 183Whitley p. 248 The last two ships of the class, and , were slightly modified versions of the design with new higher pressure boilers and a unit system of machinery that alternated boiler and engine rooms to prevent a ship from being immobilized by a single unlucky hit. Additionally, AA armament was improved. They were the first US cruisers to be armed with twin five-inch (127 mm) 38-caliber guns. They could be distinguished visually from the other Brooklyns by the placement of the after deckhouse, immediately abaft the second funnel, and by the twin 5-inch mounts. From 1942, the bridge structure was lowered and radar was fitted. === Armament === The Brooklyn class was equipped with 15 6-in/47 caliber Mark 16 naval guns, developed from the 6-in/53 caliber Mark 8 used on the Omaha-class cruiser. The decision was reached as the gun could achieve up to ten rounds per minute rate of fire. This gave the class the ability to send up to 150 rounds a minute at its intended target. This allowed the cruiser to smother an enemy ship with fire. The turret arrangement was five turrets, each mounting three guns on a single sleeve, which did not allow the guns in a turret to move independently. The 6-inch guns were of a new design, the Mark 16, which could fire a armor-piercing shell (AP) up to with twice the penetrative power of the old gun. The ammunition was of the semi-fixed type. The impact of the shell changed the General Board's view on the usefulness of light cruisers in service.Friedman, Norman. US Cruisers: An illustrated design history, p. 194 As designed, the anti-aircraft weaponry specified eight /25 caliber guns and eight caliber M2 Browning machine guns. The intention to mount /75 caliber anti-aircraft guns were frustrated and the requirement was not fully met until 1943. The weapon as deployed was less than satisfactory with frequent jamming and weight being serious issues.Schreier, Konrad F. (1994). \"The Chicago Piano\". Naval History. United States Naval Institute. 8 (4): 44\u201346. Some of the class had 5-in/38 caliber guns installed versus the 5-in/25 guns.US Navy Light Cruisers 1941\u201345 location 100 There were varied mixes of Oerlikon cannons and Bofors gun mountings actually installed during World War II, 28 40 mm (4 \u00d7 4, 6 \u00d7 2) and twenty 20 mm (10 \u00d7 2) being the most common. === Fire control === The Brooklyn class was deployed with the Mark 34 director and later the Mark 3 radar. This would be upgraded to the Mark 8 and again to the Mark 13 radar. The secondary battery was controlled by the Mark 28 and upgraded to the Mark 33 fire control systems. The associated radars were the Mark 4 fire control radar and upgraded again to the Mark 12. Two anti-aircraft fire directors were fitted to each ship. A late World War II refit saw the Mk 51 director installed for the Bofors guns. Night engagements were improved when in 1945, the Mark 57 and 63 directors in installed.US Navy Light Cruisers 1941\u201345 location 130 == Successors == The vast majority of cruisers built by the United States during World War II derive from the Brooklyn design. Modifications of Brooklyn-class hull were the predecessors to the two main lines of wartime cruisers, respectively the light cruiser armed with 6-inch guns and heavy cruiser armed with 8-inch guns.Friedman, Norman. US Cruisers: An illustrated design history, p. 183 This class would lead onto the Cleveland-class light cruiser (less a fifth triple 6-inch turret), of which two were upgraded as the . The other predecessor was , built on a modified Brooklyn-class hull, with a heavy cruiser armament featuring three rather than five triple turrets, but each turret containing larger 8-inch guns, and increased armor. Wichita was succeeded by the Baltimore class, including the subclass, and the upgraded . As the Baltimore class began building about a year after the Cleveland class, later developments and improvements were transferred to the Baltimore-class hull. Finally, both Cleveland and Baltimore hulls were converted to light aircraft carriers. The of light aircraft carriers, were converted from Cleveland-class cruisers,Silverstone p. 48 and the light carriers used the basic form of the Baltimore-class cruiser design.Fahey p. 9 == Brooklyn-class ships == {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !Ship name !Hull No. !Builder !Laid down !Launched !Commissioned !Decommissioned !Fate !Reference |- | |CL-40 |Brooklyn Navy Yard, New York City |12 March 1935 |30 November 1936 |30 September 1937 |3 January 1947 |Transferred to Chilean Navy as O'Higgins, 9 January 1951 | |- | |CL-41 |Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, Philadelphia |28 May 1935 |17 November 1936 |23 September 1937 |3 February 1947 |Transferred to Brazilian Navy as Barroso, 9 January 1951 | |- | |CL-42 |rowspan=3|New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden |31 May 1934 |8 May 1937 |10 March 1938 |3 February 1947 |Sold for scrap, 25 January 1966 | |- | |CL-43 |24 January 1935 |2 October 1937 |6 June 1938 |24 June 1946 |Transferred to Chilean Navy as Capit\u00e1n Prat, 9 January 1951 | |- | |CL-46 |25 April 1935 |19 March 1938 |3 October 1938 |3 July 1946 |Transferred to Argentine Navy as Diecisiete de Octubre, 9 April 1951, renamed 1956 Sunk, 2 May 1982, Falklands War | |- | |CL-47 |Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Newport News |1 April 1935 |3 December 1936 |12 August 1938 |1 July 1946 |Transferred to Argentine Navy as Nueve de Julio, 11 January 1951 | |- | |CL-48 |Brooklyn Navy Yard, New York City |9 December 1935 |26 August 1937 |15 June 1938 |3 February 1947 |Sold for scrap, 17 November 1959 | |- | |CL-49 |Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company |10 December 1936 |15 April 1938 |19 May 1939 |20 June 1946 |Transferred to Brazilian Navy as Tamandare, 29 January 1951 | |- | |CL-50 |Brooklyn Navy Yard |9 December 1936 |27 August 1938 |18 September 1939 | |Torpedoed and sunk, 6 July 1943 | |} == Service history == === War service === Several Brooklyns were seriously damaged during World War II, all but one of the cruisers survived. was severely damaged by a shell that hit her in the forward turret magazine during the Battle of Cape Esperance on 11 October 1942, suffering many casualties but the magazine (being partially flooded as a result of shell hits in her hull) did not explode. was hit by a kamikaze attack on 13 December 1944, off Mindoro, which killed or wounded 310 crewmen. was torpedoed at the Battle of Kolombangara on 12\u201313 July 1943, as was her near-sister St. Louis. After being repaired in the United States, Honolulu returned to service only to be torpedoed by a Japanese aircraft on 20 October 1944, during the invasion of Leyte.Ewing pp. 81\u201388 On 11 September 1943, was hit by a German Fritz X radio guided bomb which penetrated her #3 turret and blew out the bottom of the ship. Skillful damage control by her crew saved her from sinking. While under repair in the United States, Savannah and Honolulu were rebuilt with a bulged hull that increased their beam by nearly and their 5-inch guns were reinstalled as four twins, though the repairs to Honolulu were completed too late for her to see action again.Whitley p. 249 Helena was sunk in 1943 during the Battle of Kula Gulf. The remains of the ship were discovered below the surface of New Georgia Sound by Paul Allen's research ship in April 2018. St. Louis was seriously damaged twice, but survived the war. === Post-war === All ships of the class were deactivated by early 1947, except for Honolulu and Savannah, which had been modernized with bulges, 5-in/38 secondaries, and Mk 37 directors and were retained for potential reactivation until sold for scrap in 1959 and 1966, respectively. The rest were sold to South American countries in the early 1950s, and served for many more years: Brooklyn and Nashville to Chile, St. Louis and Philadelphia to Brazil, and Boise and Phoenix to Argentina. (ex-Phoenix) was torpedoed and sunk by during the Falklands War,Ewing pp. 77\u201388 while (ex-Brooklyn) remained in service with the Chilean Navy until 1992. She sank under tow, on her way to the scrappers, in the mid- Pacific in 1994. == See also == * List of ships of the Second World War * List of ship classes of the Second World War ==Citations== == Sources == * * * * * Category:Cruiser classes ",
