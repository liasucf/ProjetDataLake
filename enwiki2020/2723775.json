A sweeper who could play in midfield, Vasovi\u0107 was renowned for his defensive positioning, never-say-die attitude and tactical awareness. ==Early life== Born in Po\u017earevac on the eve of World War II to parents hailing from Montenegro \u2014 tax office clerk \u017divojin Vasovi\u0107 and homemaker Jelka Lau\u0161evi\u0107 \u2014 young Velibor was the couple's ninth child.Velibor Vasovi\u0107 - Kako je milicija pendre\u010dila Milaneze!;Duga, 1986 He had four older brothers and three older sisters while another one of his sisters died before he was born. With the Nazi German invasion and subsequent dismemberment of the Yugoslav kingdom in April 1941, Vasovi\u0107's father got taken prisoner by the Germans, spending four years in captivity, while his oldest siblings joined the Partisan resistance movement. The youngster completed primary education in his hometown before moving to capital Belgrade along with his entire family courtesy of his maternal uncle David Lau\u0161evi\u0107 who in the meantime rose to high post with the State Security Administration (UDBA). Vasovi\u0107 began his secondary studies by enrolling at the First Belgrade Gymnasium. ==Club career== Simultaneous with starting gymnasium studies, Vasovi\u0107 got introduced to the game of football at FK Novi Beograd, a small local lower-league outfit. ===Partizan=== In 1955, youngster's footballing talents got spotted by FK Partizan youth coach Florijan Matekalo, initiating fifteen-year-old Vasovi\u0107's transfer across town to the big club's youth system where he came in alongside additional talented teenagers such as right back Fahrudin Jusufi and central midfielder Vladica Kova\u010devi\u0107, brought in from Prilep and Ivanjica, respectively. Others already on the youth team were twin brothers Sr\u0111an and Zvezdan \u010cebinac as well as Branko Pejovi\u0107. The entire talented generation soon came to be known as \"Matekalo's Babies\". In June 1958, eighteen-year-old Vasovi\u0107 got moved up to the full squad. He spent five seasons at FK Partizan in this stint (June 1958 \u2013 June 1963) before controversially transferring to archrivals Red Star Belgrade during summer 1963. ===Six months at Red Star Belgrade=== In the summer of 1963, twenty-three-year-old Vasovi\u0107 was coming off another stellar season for Partizan in which he greatly contributed to the crno-beli winning their third consecutive league title. However, his contract with Partizan was set to expire. In a 1986 interview for Duga magazine, Vasovi\u0107 recalled how his transfer to Red Star came about: Vasovi\u0107 reportedly received YUD5 million (enough to buy two Mercedes vehicles at the time) from Red Star.Biography in Serbian;reprezentacija.rs At the start of the new league season, Vasovi\u0107 got a spot in Red Star's central defense alongside Milan \u010cop and Vojkan Meli\u0107. His first competitive match for Red Star on 1 September 1963 was also the grand opening of the club's still not fully finished grandiose new stadium Marakana as crveno-beli came from behind to beat NK Rijeka 2\u20131. The team easily led the league by five points at the winter break while defending league champion Partizan lagged far behind. Over the winter break, another transfer saga involving Vasovi\u0107 ensued as Partizan club president Radakovi\u0107 was successful in persuading the player to come back for even more money than Red Star gave him. Vasovi\u0107 agreed, but he was under contract with Red Star and the club didn't want to sign off on the move despite being offered some money as a transfer fee. Vasovi\u0107 even resorted to unilaterally training with his old club. With the league season restarting following the winter break, Vasovi\u0107 was in legal limbo, out of the Red Star lineup, though still having his salary paid by the club. After several months of sitting out, Vasovi\u0107 got instructed by the Partizan vice-president \u010ceda D\u017eomba to try to get a meeting with the highest political authority in SR Serbia at the time, federal interior secretary Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107, in order to finally resolve the situation. Vasovi\u0107 made the approach through private channels as his friend and teammate Zvezdan \u010cebinac was an old schoolmate of Rankovi\u0107's son so Vasovi\u0107 managed to get a 45-minute meeting with Rankovi\u0107 at the recently built SIV building in New Belgrade where nothing concrete was promised other than Rankovi\u0107 saying he'll look into it. Several months later Red Star's technical director Obradovi\u0107 agreed to let Vasovi\u0107 return to Partizan while in return, as consolation of sorts for Red Star, Partizan's club president Radakovi\u0107 agreed to allow Zvezdan \u010cebinac's transfer to Red Star. ===Return to Partizan=== Vasovi\u0107 thus managed to get both his money and his wishes of return, but many within Partizan did not welcome him back with open arms. Some of the players saw his stunt as blackmail and were further unhappy that the club bent over backwards to accommodate any single player like that. Furthermore, his return took place against the backdrop of internal squabbles within the club's managing board, specifically between president Radakovi\u0107 and general-secretary Mirko Nenezi\u0107 who acted as proxy for his brother, powerful JNA general . The row started over the internal decision to relieve general-secretary Nenezi\u0107 of his duties as a person in charge of finances, a move pushed through by president Radakovi\u0107. As the 1964\u201365 season began under new head coach Aleksandar Atanackovi\u0107, Partizan led the league, but with each coming week the row in the managing board increasingly affected player relations. By December 1964, ahead of the last league fixture before the winter break, two opposing camps clearly emerged within the team \u2014 one group supporting dissenting general-secretary Nenezi\u0107 was led by Jusufi and also included Milan Gali\u0107, Radoslav Be\u010dejac, Joakim Vislavski, and head coach Atanackovi\u0107 while the other group supporting president Radakovi\u0107 was led by Vasovi\u0107 with Vladica Kova\u010devi\u0107, Zoran Miladinovi\u0107, and several youth players. Remaining players Milutin \u0160o\u0161ki\u0107, Ivan \u0106urkovi\u0107, Josip Pirmajer, and Branko Ra\u0161ovi\u0107 stayed neutral. The dissenting group even resorted to initiating a mutiny, refusing to travel to Skopje for the final match of the first half of the season versus FK Vardar. Seeing they were missing half of their team along with head coach Atanackovi\u0107, president Radakovi\u0107 handed the head coaching reins to Mile Kos for one match. In difficult circumstances, Kos managed to put together eleven players and Partizan managed to retain the top league spot as winter break commenced. The very next day after the Skopje debacle, head coach Atanackovi\u0107 was relieved of his duties as the two factions prepared for the final showdown at the club's general assembly scheduled for January 1965 at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Law. The assembly saw the two groups of players make up. Still, the case even got to the highest echelons of power in Yugoslavia as general Ivan Go\u0161njak, reporting directly to marshal Tito, became aware of his fellow JNA generals causing problems within the Partizan management. Once Tito caught whiff of this, he acted swiftly, ordering action against each officer from the club's management board involved in the row by having them reassigned to another location. General Radakovi\u0107 thus got moved to SR Slovenia while general Radojica Nenezi\u0107 got assigned to Skopje. Vladimir Duji\u0107, a civilian, became the new club president.Se\u0107anja: Propu\u0161tena \u0161ansa Partizana;SOS kanal, 4 September 2011 The head coaching duties were handed to Marko Valok. Several months later Partizan played a friendly versus A.C. Milan that went down in infamy for Vasovi\u0107 getting into a vicious fist fight with Milan's Peruvian defender V\u00edctor Ben\u00edtez, all of which prompted a bench-clearing brawl. Though unpleasant, the ugly fracas actually served to further solidify the newly unified team spirit of the recently fractured Partizan squad. ===Ajax=== Vasovi\u0107 transferred to Ajax after he had lost 2\u20131 to Real Madrid with Partizan in the 1966 European Cup Final (scoring the only goal for his team). He did the same (4\u20131 loss to A.C. Milan, scoring from the spot) in the 1969 European Cup Final, before leading Ajax as captain to a 2\u20130 victory over Panathinaikos in the 1971 European Cup Final. He played 5 seasons for the Dutch giants (1966\u20131971) and was the first foreign captain in the club's history. He played 32 games for the Yugoslavia national football team. During his career with Partizan he won 4 Yugoslav Championships (1960\u201361, 1961\u201362, 1962\u201363, 1964\u201365) and leading Partizan as captain to the 1966 European Cup Final. Vasovi\u0107's career was relatively short. He only played 13 professional seasons due to the asthmatic condition he was suffering from. == National team == In the Yugoslavia national team Vasovi\u0107 appeared from 1961 until 1966 in 32 fixtures and scoring 2 goals. {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |+List of international goals scored by Velibor Vasovi\u0107 |- ! scope=\"col\" | No. ! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"date\" | Date ! scope=\"col\" | Venue ! scope=\"col\" | Opponent ! scope=\"col\" | Score ! scope=\"col\" | Result ! scope=\"col\" | Competition |- !scope=\"row\"|1 || 4 November 1962 || Belgrade, Yugoslavia || || 3\u20132 || 3\u20132 || UEFA Euro 1964 qualifying |- !scope=\"row\"|2 || 7 November 1965 || Belgrade, Yugoslavia || || 1\u20131 || 1\u20131 || 1966 FIFA World Cup qualification |} ==Coaching career== After ending his career as a player in 1971, he coached FK Partizan (second part of 1971\u201372 season, full 1972\u201373, and the first part of 1973\u201374), Proleter Zrenjanin, Angers SCO (1975\u20131976), Paris Saint-Germain (first part of 1976\u201377 and the first part of 1978\u201379 seasons). He also managed Egyptian club Zamalek SC (1982\u20131983), Ethnikos Piraeus (1983), Red Star Belgrade (1986\u20131988), and AC Bellinzona (1989) before returning home to Belgrade and working as a lawyer. During his coaching career, he managed to win one Yugoslav Championship, in 1987\u201388 season, with Red Star. ==Honours== ===As a player=== ;Partizan (1958\u20131963, 1964\u20131966) *Yugoslav First League **Winner (4): 1960\u201361, 1961\u201362, 1962\u201363, 1964\u201365 ;Red Star Belgrade (1963\u20131964) *Yugoslav First League **Winner (1): 1963\u201364 ;Ajax (1966\u20131971) *Eredivisie **Winner (3): 1966\u201367, 1967\u201368, 1969\u201370 *KNVB Cup **Winner (3): 1966\u201367, 1969\u201370, 1970\u201371 *European Cup **Winner (1): 1970\u201371 ===As a head coach=== ;Red Star Belgrade (1986\u20131988) *Yugoslav First League **Winner (1): 1987\u201388 ==Other endeavours== Vasovi\u0107 was one of the strongest and most persistent critics of the Yugoslav FA (FSJ) leadership, especially its longtime president Miljan Miljani\u0107. His criticism particularly intensified after the breakup of SFR Yugoslavia. In 1997 Vasovi\u0107 founded an organization called Udru\u017eenje za razvoj i prosperitet jugoslovenskog fudbala (Organization for the Development and Prosperity of Yugoslav Football) through which he channeled his criticism of the FSJ. Throughout the summer of 2000 he spoke at various town hall meetings throughout Serbia organized by the Yugoslav Left (JUL), a political party headed by the Yugoslav president Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107's wife Mira Markovi\u0107. On October 10, 2000, five days after the overthrow of Milo\u0161evi\u0107's regime in Serbia, Vasovi\u0107 and about a dozen bodyguards broke into the FSJ offices at Terazije square in downtown Belgrade.VELIBOR VASOVIC UPAO U FSJ;B92, 10 October 2000 They attempted to use the post-overthrow chaos and confusion in order to gain the upper hand in the expected FA leadership change, however they were unsuccessful.;Nezavisna svetlost, 15 October 2000 He graduated from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law. ==Personal== Velibor Vasovi\u0107 was married twice, first with Mirjana Vasovi\u0107, and then to Branka Zori\u0107.
