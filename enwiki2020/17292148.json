    "text": "o-Anisidine (2-anisidine) is an organic compound with the formula CH3OC6H4NH2. A colorless liquid, commercial samples can appear yellow owing to air oxidation. It is one of three isomers of the methoxy-containing aniline derivative. ==Production and use== It is prepared via methanolysis of 2-chloronitrobenzene: :NaOCH3 \\+ ClC6H4NO2 \u2192 CH3OC6H4NO2 \\+ NaCl The resulting o-nitroanisole is reduced to o-anisidine. o-Anisidine is used in the manufacture of dyes. It is nitrated to give 4-nitroanisidine. It is also a precursor to o-dianisidine. One special use is as a heartwood indicator. An acid solution of o-anisidine is diazotized by adding a sodium nitrite solution. This mixture is applied to the wood and by reaction with polyphenols in the heartwood a reddish brown azo dye is formed. :Direct Blue 15 is an azo dye produced from o-anisidine ==Safety and environmental aspects== o-Anisidine is a dangerous pollutant from the production of dyes. It is listed as RCRA hazardous waste, with the code K181. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified o-anisidine as a Group 2B, possible human carcinogen. ==References== ==External links == * * Category:Anilines Category:Hazardous air pollutants Category:IARC Group 2B carcinogens ",
