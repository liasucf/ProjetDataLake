The bay is immediately north of Tuna Bay which is accessed by the same road. ==Attractions== Penzance's beach is of gravel, which is unusual for this area of the Marlborough Sounds. This gives the beach a good reputation for safe and pleasant swimming. The bay contains a boat ramp, a large wharf, and a swimming island. These facilities coupled with ease of access gives the bay a great reputation for boating activities and fishing. There are walking tracks which link many of the adjacent bays together, such as Duncan Bay and Elaine Bay. Penzance is surrounded with native forest, much of it is untouched. The native forest contains large southern beech trees, Nothofagus species; along with conifers, as well as perching plants and epiphytes. In early summer, large numbers of the New Zealand ground orchid Pterostylis banksii are present along the walking tracks. The Maori name for the orchard is tutukiwi, or beak of a kiwi.

Penzance is located about 1 hour and 15 minutes away from Nelson. ==Settlement== The Penzance settlement is small with very few permanent residents. The settlement is mostly composed of baches or New Zealand holiday homes. ==References== == External links == * Tennyson Inlet map Category:Landforms of the Marlborough Region Category:Bays of New Zealand Category:Marlborough Sounds ",
