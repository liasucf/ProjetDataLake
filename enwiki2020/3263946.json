    "text": "Porphyrio is the swamphen or swamp hen bird genus in the rail family. It includes some smaller species which are usually called \"purple gallinules\", and which are sometimes separated as genus Porphyrula or united with the gallinules proper (or \"moorhens\") in Gallinula. The Porphyrio gallinules are distributed in the warmer regions of the world. The group probably originated in Africa in the Middle Miocene, before spreading across the world in waves from the Late Miocene to Pleistocene. The genus Porphyrio was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the western swamphen (Porphyrio porphyrio) as the type species. The genus name Porphyrio is the Latin name for \"swamphen\", meaning \"purple\". == Species == The genus contains ten extant species and two that have become extinct in historical times: === Extant species === * Purple swamphen complex ** Western swamphen, Porphyrio porphyrio ** African swamphen, Porphyrio madagascariensis ** Grey- headed swamphen, Porphyrio poliocephalus ** Black-backed swamphen, Porphyrio indicus ** Philippine swamphen, Porphyrio pulverulentus ** Australasian swamphen, Porphyrio melanotus * South Island takah\u0113, Porphyrio hochstetteri * Allen's gallinule, also known as lesser gallinule, Porphyrio alleni (formerly Porphyrula alleni) * American purple gallinule, Porphyrio martinicus (formerly Porphyrula martinica) * Azure gallinule, Porphyrio flavirostris === Extinct species === * Lord Howe swamphen, Porphyrio albus (early 19th century) * R\u00e9union swamphen, or ', Porphyrio coerulescens (18th century, hypothetical species) * Marquesas swamphen, Porphyrio paepae (prehistoric or ) * North Island takah\u0113, or ', Porphyrio mantelli (prehistoric or 1890s) * New Caledonian swamphen, Porphyrio kukwiedei (prehistoric or more recent) * Huahine swamphen, Porphyrio mcnabi (prehistoric) * Buka swamphen, Porphyrio sp.

(prehistoric) * Mangaia swamphen/woodhen, ?Porphyrio sp. (prehistoric) - would belong into Porphyrula, Gallinula or Pareudiastes ==References== *Taylor, P.
