It was constructed as three separate buildings adjacent to each other with sky walks connecting the upper floors. The center, owned by Kamehameha Schools at the time, completed a $100 million renovation in 2007 to include more retailers and restaurants. The center was sold to RHC Property Holding LLC in 2013. == References == Category:Shopping malls in Hawaii Category:Waikiki ",
