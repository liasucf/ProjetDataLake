The group was formerly known as Gelatin and changed their name in 2005. They are known for creating sensational art events in the tradition of Relational Aesthetics, often with a lively sense of humor. Among their projects are a gigantic plush toy: a 55 meter tall pink rabbit on Colletto Fava (near Genoa, Italy), intended to remain there until 2025. In November 2005, the group had a show at Leo Koenig, Inc. in New York, a project called Tantamounter 24/7. The project was a \"gigantic, complex and very clever machine\", according to the artists, which functioned as a kind of art-Xerox. The group erected a barrier blocking off one half of the space, locking themselves inside for one week, then asking visitors to insert items that they wanted copied into an opening in the barrier, which copies were then returned through another opening. ==Works== ===The B-Thing=== One of Gelitin's best known art projects began in March 2000, when the group allegedly removed one of the windows on the 91st floor of the former World Trade Center complex and temporarily installed a narrow balcony, while a helicopter flew around the scene, taking photographs to be later documented in their book The B-Thing. The book was published in 2001 and had even by that time taken on an air of urban legend, with new copies selling for $500 on Amazon.com as of 2016.Amazon listing for The B-Thing Other works include: * vorm - fellows - attitude, 2018, at the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam, The Netherlands: giant sculptures of feces, with visitors encouraged to put on costumes representing nude men and women * La Louvre, Paris, 2008, at ARC, Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris * Tantamounter 24/7, 2005, a \"gigantic, complex and very clever machine\" created at Leo Koenig, New York * Hase (Rabbit / Coniglio), 2005, a 55-meter knitted pink rabbit on Colletto FavaPictures , gelitin.net. * Zapf de Pipi, 2005, a sculpture of frozen urine as contributed by the visitors at the Moscow Biennale of Contemporary Art * Otto Volante, 2004, a roller coaster inside a gallery in Milan, Italy * Arc de Triomphe, 2003, a 7-meter tall fountain picturing a urinating figure made of 2000 kg of Plasticine in Salzburg, Austria * Armpit, 2002, a human elevator of Body Builders for the Liverpool Biennial * Schlund, 2001, a human scaffolding of fat people at the Bavarian Theatre, Munich, Germany * Die totale Osmose, 2001, a swamp surrounding the Austrian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale * The B-Thing, 2000, a small temporary balcony on the 91st floor of the World Trade Center * Weltwunder, 2000, a hidden underwater cave, only accessible by diving through a pipe 5 meters deep, as part of the Expo 2000 in Hannover, Germany ==References== ==External links== * Category:Austrian artist groups and collectives Category:Austrian contemporary artists ",
