Following a disturbance that destroys some of the populations, the first lineages to move into the disturbed area are able to establish and multiply to monopolize space. Later-arriving lineages can be 'blocked' by the newly established populations. The founder takes all (FTA) hypothesis refers to the evolutionary advantages conferred to first-arriving lineages in an ecosystem. The FTA model is underpinned by demographic and ecological phenomena and processes such as the Allee effect, \u2018gene surfing\u2019, \u2018high- density blocking\u2019 and \u2018priority effects\u2019 \u2014whereby early-colonising lineages can reach high densities and thus hinder the success of late-arriving colonisers\u2014which have been suggested to strongly influence spatial biodiversity patterns. Scientific evidence for FTA processes has emerged from a variety of evolutionary, biogeographic and ecological research areas, with examples including the sectoring patterns sometimes evident in microbial colonies; phylogeographic sectoring of lineages inferred to have rapidly expanded into new terrain following deglaciation; the island \u2018progression rule\u2019; and sudden biological replacement (lineage turnover) following extirpation. One possible scientific consequence of FTA dynamics is that measures of gene flow based on genetics of contemporary high-density populations may underestimate actual rates of dispersal and invasion potential. == See also == * Allee effect * Founder effect * Peripatric speciation == References == Category:Evolutionary ecology ",
