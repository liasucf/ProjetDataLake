    "text": "Scott Stewart (born 29 April 1996) is a Scottish footballer who plays for Arbroath as a full-back or midfielder. He began his career at Airdrieonians. ==Career== ===Airdrieonians=== Stewart was born in Edinburgh but raised in Rutherglen, South Lanarkshire where he attended Stonelaw High School. His father Sandy was a footballer who spent the majority of his career with the original Airdrieonians club and also served as player and manager at its successor Airdrie United, where Scott began his career in the youth setup. At the age of 17, Stewart received his first call-up to the senior squad at the club (now re-named Airdrieonians) in August 2013, making his senior debut two months later in a 2\u20130 home defeat to Forfar Athletic in Scottish League One, with his first start in the competition against Stranraer in March 2014. He initially began his career as a midfielder but retrained as a full-back, which he stated drew more scrutiny on his performances from his father, who had played the same position.
