A 2017 report on corruption in Uganda's mining sector in Uganda by Global Witness cited Elizabeth Karungi as a beneficiary of a licence that enabled her to mine and explore for minerals in Bwindi Forest even though it was a gazetted area with endangered species. The report recommended an investigation into her by the Inspector General of Government, Uganda. In October 2018, it was reported that Members of the 10th Parliament of Uganda had almost failed to debate on the motion for adoption of the report of the Public Service and Local Government Committee on the petition on pending eviction of traders, lock-up owners, special hire operators and taxi owners from Mukono Taxi Park. This was because she as well as her committee chairperson were not in the House to present their report. In November 2018, it was still reported that court had summoned Elizabeth Karungi on allegations that she had attempted to poison a parliamentary staffer. In turn she sued the staffer and a local paper, accusing the paper of giving the staffer \"a platform to publish false and malicious story about her and her family.\" == Membership and committees == * Member \u2013 Committee on Government Assurances * Member \u2013 Uganda Women Parliamentary Association (UWOPA) * Vice Chairperson \u2013 Public Service Committee * Vice Chairperson \u2013 Uganda Parliamentary Forum for children (UPFC) == References == Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Parliament of Uganda Category:Women members of the Parliament of Uganda ",
