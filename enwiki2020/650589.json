Semacodes are primarily aimed at being used with cellular phones which have built-in cameras, to quickly capture a Web site address for use in the phone's web browser. Semacodes are in fact DataMatrix encoded URLs. The Semacode website states that Semacode tags are an \"open system\" and that tag creation is \"completely unrestricted,\" with the SDK software tools being free of charge for non-commercial use.Semacode Potential uses for Semacode tags are still being explored, and will complement development of the concept of using mobile phones as devices for information gathering and exchange. Suggestions from the Semacode.org websitesemacode.org/apps/potential/ included: * placing Semacode tags on posters, such as those for concerts and public performances. Those interested could use their mobile phone to take a photo of the tag, which could link them directly to the web page where they could order tickets. * using Semacode tags and mobile phones to enable multilingual museum exhibits - a tag photographed at the exhibition entrance could set a language cookie in the phone's web browser, and subsequent Semacode tags displayed at each exhibit could then link the phone's browser directly to a web page about the item, displayed in the user's language of choice. * placing Semacode tags on name tags given to conference attendees. These tags could provide the corporate web address of each attendee's company, or their biography and contact details. ==See also== * QR Code an implementation of a similar concept invented in Japan. * PDF417 * Object hyperlinking * High Capacity Color Barcode * SPARQCode * Cauzin Softstrip an historical implementation of a similar concept introduced in the 1980s ==References== ==External links== * Semacode.com * Online Semacode/DataMatrix decoder Category:Barcodes Category:Companies based in Waterloo, Ontario ",
