When he is put in prison, Seru begins working as a prostitute to earn money for the gangster's parole. During her yakuza lover's incarceration, Seru gains a new, young boyfriend. The yakuza discovers the new boyfriend after he is released from prison. Realizing that she will have a better life with her new boyfriend who is not associated with the yakuza, he sacrifices his love for Seru and gives her up. ==Cast== * Cecile G\u014dda (\u8c6a\u7530\u8def\u4e16\u7559) as Seru * Satoshi Miyata (\u5bae\u7530\u8aed) as Seru's younger boyfriend * Shir\u014d Shimomoto (\u4e0b\u5143\u53f2\u90ce) as yakuza in love with Seru * Naomi Oka (\u4e18\u306a\u304a\u307f) * Maria Satsuki (\u4e94\u6708\u30de\u30ea\u30a2) * Ren \u014csugi (\u5927\u6749\u6f23) ==Background and critical appraisal== Along with Mamoru Watanabe and Genji Nakamura, Banmei Takahashi was known as one of the \"Three Pillars of Pink\" before he made Girl Mistress. He was known for his stylistically unique approach to the genre which brought college students back to pink film theaters at this time, when Nikkatsu's Roman Porno series was beginning to lose its popularity among this audience. In their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films, Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser give Girl Mistress three-and-a-half out of four stars. Without stating what award the film won, they note that it is an \"award- winning motion picture\". Director Takahashi had already made a name for himself in the pink film through his films at K\u014dji Wakamatsu's production company, such as Raping the Sisters (1977) and Japanese Inquisition (1978), and films made at his own company, such as Attacking Girls and Scandal: Pleasure Trap (both 1979). However, according to the Weissers, Girl Mistress is the film which cemented his name in the history of pink cinema. ==Availability== Banmei Takahashi filmed Girl Mistress for his own Takahashi Productions and Kokuei and it was released theatrically in Japan by Shint\u014dh\u014d Eiga in October 1980. Uplink released it on DVD as part of their Nippon Erotics series on June 28, 2002. ==Bibliography== ===English=== * * * ===Japanese=== * * * ==Notes== Category:1980 films Category:Films directed by Banmei Takahashi Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese-language films Category:Pink films Category:Shint\u014dh\u014d Eiga films ",
