    "text": "The Uneventful Vacation is the second and final album released by American emo band Commander Venus in 1997. The album was recorded during the summer of the band's junior year in high school. Despite the album being rushed into recording over summer vacation, and the band experiencing tension between themselves and their producer, the album was considered a mild success, and gained popularity over college airplay. Fans of the album claimed that Commander Venus could be \"the next big thing\" out of Omaha. The Uneventful Vacation continues to gain popularity even today as fans of Bright Eyes discover Conor Oberst's older material. The original pressing of the album on vinyl included a bonus 13th song titled \"Congratulations!\" ==Track listing== # \"Jean's TV\" - 2:18 # \"Refused By Light\" - 3:42 # \"We'll Always Have Paris\" - 4:44 # \"The Uneventful Vacation (Part 1)\" - 2:26 # \"Lock 'n' Chase\" - 2:53 # \"Life As Expected\" - 5:45 # \"The Way Things Had to Be\" - 3:57 # \"Dress to Please\" - 1:49 # \"The Walk-Around Problem\" - 3:53 # \"My Collapsing Frame\" - 3:32 # \"The Raining Holiday (Part 2)\" - 2:55 # \"The Role of the Hero in Antiquity\" - 2:45 # \"Congratulations!\" (12\" vinyl bonus track) Category:1997 albums ",
