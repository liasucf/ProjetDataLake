He made his pro debut on 16 May 2010 against Estudiantes, with the forward netting the club's only goal in a 1\u20134 defeat. Curuchet went on to make eighty-four appearances for the club across six seasons, five of which were in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n; taking his goal tally to nine in the process, including six in the 2012\u201313 season. During 2012\u201313, he also scored on his Copa Sudamericana bow versus Racing Club in August 2012. January 2015 saw Curuchet join Defensa y Justicia on loan. Two appearances came before he returned midway through the year. Curuchet spent the rest of 2015 with Santamarina in Primera B Nacional. After one goal and twenty-one matches for Santamarina, Curuchet subsequently departed Col\u00f3n permanently after agreeing a move to Juventud Unida in February 2016. A further move in the second tier with Independiente Rivadavia arrived six months later. Ahead of the 2017\u201318 campaign, Curuchet signed for Primera B Metropolitana's Platense. He scored nine goals against nine opponents in his first season, helping Platense win the title to gain promotion to Primera B Nacional. ==Personal life== Curuchet's brother, Cristian, also played football professionally. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"8\"|Col\u00f3n |2009\u201310 |rowspan=\"5\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |1||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||1 |- |2010\u201311 |9||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||9||0 |- |2011\u201312 |6||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||8||0 |- |2012\u201313 |31||6||0||0||4Appearance(s) in the Copa Sudamericana||1||0||0||35||7 |- |2013\u201314 |30||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1Appearance(s) in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n play-offs||0||31||1 |- |2014 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera B Nacional |6||1||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||8||1 |- |2015 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !83!!9!!4!!0!!4!!1!!1!!0!!92!!10 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Defensa y Justicia (loan) |2015 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |2||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||2||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Santamarina (loan) |2015 |rowspan=\"3\"|Primera B Nacional |17||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||4Appearance(s) in the Primera B Nacional play- offs||0||21||1 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Juventud Unida |2016 |13||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||13||1 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Independiente Rivadavia |2016\u201317 |29||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||29||1 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Platense |2017\u201318 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera B Metropolitana |34||9||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1Appearance(s) in the Primera B Metropolitana play-offs||0||36||9 |- |2018\u201319 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera B Nacional |4||2||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||6||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !38!!11!!3!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!1!!0!!42!!11 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !182!!23!!7!!0!!4!!1!!6!!0!!199!!24 |} ==Honours== ;Platense *Primera B Metropolitana: 2017\u201318 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:People from Entre R\u00edos Province Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Primera B Nacional players Category:Primera B Metropolitana players Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Col\u00f3n footballers Category:Defensa y Justicia footballers Category:Club y Biblioteca Ram\u00f3n Santamarina footballers Category:Juventud Unida de Gualeguaych\u00fa players Category:Independiente Rivadavia footballers Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Platense footballers ",
