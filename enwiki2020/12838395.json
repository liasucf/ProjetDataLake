    "text": "Mevl\u00fct Erdin\u00e7 (surname spelt Erding in France; born 25 February 1987) is a Turkish professional footballer who plays as a forward for Fatih Karag\u00fcmr\u00fck.https://twitter.com/karagumruk_sk/status/1301552408338862081 Born in France to Turkish parents, he spent most of his career in his country of birth, recording 295 games and 92 goals in Ligue 1. He won the Coupe de France in 2007 and 2010, with Sochaux and Paris Saint-Germain respectively, and also represented Rennes, Saint-\u00c9tienne, Guingamp and Metz in France's highest division. Erdin\u00e7 played for France at under-17 level before switching to Turkey from under-19 onwards. He made his senior debut for the latter in March 2008 and represented them at UEFA Euro 2008, in which they were semi- finalists. ==Club career== ===Sochaux=== Born in Saint-Claude, Jura, Erdin\u00e7 began his development at his hometown club and Jura Sud Foot before joining the ranks of Sochaux in 2000. Erdin\u00e7 was promoted to the first-team squad in the 2005\u201306 Ligue 1 season, scoring a last-minute goal on his debut to gift his side a 1\u20130 victory away at Ajaccio. Despite early promise, it was not until the 2007\u201308 season that he was able to hold down a first-team place, becoming the club's top-scorer with 11 goals in 28 appearances in the process. Notably, he scored in the 1\u20130 win against Grenoble on the final day of the 2008\u201309 season; Sochaux needed at least a point in order to confirm their top flight status in Ligue 1 for the next season, thus securing their survival. He was their leading goal scorer for the 2008\u201309 season with 12 goals. ===Paris Saint-Germain=== Mevl\u00fct signed for Paris Saint-Germain on 28 June 2009 on a four-year contract, for a reported \u20ac9 million transfer fee. Having previously scored 11 goals in the league for the past two seasons for relegation- threatened Sochaux, there was heavy speculation regarding his future prior to the move to PSG. Aston Villa, Fulham, Newcastle United and Wigan Athletic all reportedly showed interest in the player throughout May 2009, as well as French sides Bordeaux and Lyon. He scored his first goal for PSG in a pre- season friendly match away to Fiorentina in Italy on 29 July 2009, a game in which PSG won 3\u20130. He also played against Rangers in the Emirates Cup on 1 August 2009, but failed to get on the score sheet. He scored his first Ligue 1 goal for PSG in the second week of the 2009\u201310 season in PSG's 3\u20131 win at home to Le Mans. In his first month playing for the Paris club, he was selected as Ligue 1 Player of the Month in August by 31 percent of fans who voted on the official website. In late October 2009, a foot injury saw him ruled out of action for approximately four weeks, but nonetheless had still managed to score six league goals in 11 games by December. In March 2010, Erdin\u00e7 scored his first hat-trick for PSG in a 4\u20131 home win against his former club, Sochaux. He finished as PSG's top scorer in the 2009\u201310 Ligue and third-placed in the overall league scoring charts, having scored 15 goals in the league and 19 in all games. He was also voted Paris Saint-Germain's Player of the Year for the 2009\u201310 season. Various injuries in the 2010\u201311 season meant that Erdin\u00e7 could not capture his form from the previous year, and scored just nine goals, eight in Ligue 1. After the takeover of PSG in 2011 by the Qatar Investment Group and a number of high-profile arrivals, such as club-record signing of Javier Pastore for \u20ac42 million, Erdin\u00e7's place in the first-team looked in danger. Despite much interest from Newcastle United, Rennes and Galatasaray, it was confirmed that he would stay in Paris after an impressive start to the 2011\u201312 season.http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/950798/psg-opt-to-keep- mevlut-erdinc-despite-interest?cc=5739 In his second game of the season, after coming on as a substitute, he scored in the 90th minute in a game against Toulouse to make it 2\u20131 and three minutes later, made an assist for J\u00e9r\u00e9my M\u00e9nez to score, ending the game 3\u20131.http://www.goal.com/en/match/60727/toulouse-fc-vs-paris-saint- germain/lineup-stats On 23 September, after a series of successful performances, Erdin\u00e7 was offered a one-year contract extension through to the end of the 2013\u201314 season.http://www.ntvspor.net/haber/dunyadan- futbol/48906/mevlut-erdinc-1-yil-daha-psgde ===Rennes=== On 25 January 2012, receiving limited playing time under manager Carlo Ancelotti, Erdin\u00e7 was transferred to Rennes for a \u20ac7.5 million transfer fee, signing a three-and-a- half-year contract.http://www.goal.com/en/news/11/transfer- zone/2012/01/24/2864348/rennes-reach-agreement-with-paris-saint-germain-over- mevlut ===Saint-\u00c9tienne=== On 1 September 2013, transfer deadline day, Erdin\u00e7 joined Saint-\u00c9tienne in a reported \u20ac4 million deal. He made his debut for Les Verts on 14 September, playing 81 minutes in the 3\u20131 win over Valenciennes. It took Erdin\u00e7 until 24 November 2013 to score his first goal for Saint-\u00c9tienne, scoring the only goal in their away victory over Nice when he stole the ball from goalkeeper Lucas Veronese and tapped it into an empty net. He followed this up with four goals in his next five matches for the club, the final goal of a 4\u20130 victory over Stade Reims on 30 November, a consolation goal in a 3\u20131 defeat to former club Rennes, the equalizer in an eventual 2\u20131 Coupe de la Ligue defeat to former club PSG, and a penalty in Saint-\u00c9tienne's 2\u20130 defeat of Nantes on 21 December. In the penultimate league match of the 2013\u201314 Ligue 1 season, Erdin\u00e7 scored a first-half brace as Saint-\u00c9tienne defeated Nantes 3\u20131 at the Stade de la Beaujoire on 10 May 2014. He then scored Saint- \u00c9tienne's second goal, in between strikes from Lo\u00efc Perrin, in a 3\u20131 over Ajaccio on 17 May, securing a 20th league win of the season, fourth place in the league table and a spot in the 2014\u201315 UEFA Europa League. He finished his first season with Saint-\u00c9tienne as the club's top-scorer, netting 11 Ligue 1 goals and 12 in all competitions. In Saint-\u00c9tienne's opening match of the 2014\u201315 Ligue 1 season, Erdin\u00e7 scored both goals as the side completed a 2\u20130 win over Guingamp on 9 August 2014. In their next league fixture, he slotted a home a Romain Hamouma cross to secure a 3\u20131 come from behind victory over Reims, continuing the club's undefeated start to the season. ===Hannover 96=== On 17 July 2015, Erdin\u00e7 signed a three-year contract with Bundesliga side Hannover 96 for a reported fee of \u20ac3.5 million.http://www.footmercato.net/breves/officiel-erding-quitte-l-asse_157968 ====Guingamp (Loan)==== On 7 January 2016, Erdin\u00e7 was loaned to Guingamp for the remainder of the 2015\u201316 season. He went on to score 4 goals in 15 league appearances. ====Metz (Loan)==== On 10 June 2016, it was announced that Erdin\u00e7 would spend the 2016\u201317 season on loan with newly promoted Ligue 1 side Metz. ===\u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir=== On 13 July 2017, Erdin\u00e7 moved to Turkey for the first time in his career, joining \u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir. He was one of several internationals signed by the club that summer, among the others were Ga\u00ebl Clichy, Eljero Elia, G\u00f6khan Inler and Manuel da Costa. At the end of his first season in his ancestral company, he told French regional newspaper Le Progr\u00e8s that he wished to finish his career at the club. ====Antalyaspor (Loan)==== On 31 August 2018, Erdin\u00e7 was loaned to Antalyaspor for 2018\u201319 season. On 31 May 2019, his loan agreement has finalized and Erdin\u00e7 returned Ba\u015fak\u015fehir. ===Fenerbah\u00e7e=== On 30 August 2019, Erdin\u00e7 joined Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K. on a 2-season-long-contract. ===Fatih Karag\u00fcmr\u00fck=== On 3 September 2020, Erdin\u00e7 signed with the newly promoted S\u00fcper Lig side Fatih Karag\u00fcmr\u00fck. ==International career== Erdin\u00e7 has dual nationality and was thus eligible to represent both Turkish and French internationally. He ultimately earned his first senior international cap, however, for Turkey on 26 March 2008 in a 2\u20132 draw with Belarus. On 10 May 2008, Fatih Terim announced Erdin\u00e7's inclusion in Turkey's 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2008. He started in the first XI against Turkey's first opponent Portugal, though he was substituted after the first half in an eventual 2\u20130 defeat. Additionally, he came on as a second-half substitute in the semi-final against Germany, a 3\u20132 loss that eliminated Turkey. On 11 October 2008, Erdin\u00e7 scored his first international goal, the winner in a 2\u20131 home victory against Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification. He added two away goals in qualification for the 2014 edition, opening a 3\u20131 loss to Hungary and concluding a 2\u20130 win over Romania, as Turkey again failed to reach the final tournament. Terim named Erdin\u00e7 in Turkey's preliminary 27-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016 in France, though he was one of four cut before the final deadline. ==Personal life== Erdin\u00e7 is the youngest of eight children born to parents who emigrated from Yozgat, Turkey, to France in 1973.Mevlut Erdinc at Turk Medya Yozgat In January 2010, he received a medal of honour from his town of birth, Saint- Claude.http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/spor/futbol/13369423.asp?gid=229 ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !colspan=\"3\"|Club performance !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Club !Division !Season !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- !colspan=\"3\"|France !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- |rowspan=\"5\" valign=center|Sochaux |rowspan=\"16\"|Ligue 1 |2005\u201306 |10||2||3||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||13||2 |- |2006\u201307 |4||0||0||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||5||0 |- |2007\u201308 |29||11||2||0||1||0||1||0||33||11 |- |2008\u201309 |36||11||1||0||1||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||38||12 |- !Total !79!!24!!6!!0!!3!!1!!1!!0!!89!!25 |- |rowspan=\"4\" valign=center|Paris Saint- Germain |2009\u201310 |31||15||6||4||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||37||19 |- |2010\u201311 |34||8||6||0||3||0||10||1||53||9 |- |2011\u201312 |11||1||1||0||1||1||6||0||19||2 |- !align=\"left\"|Total !76!!24!!13!!4!!4!!1!!16!!1!!109!!30 |- |rowspan=\"4\" valign=center|Rennes |2011\u201312 |12||4||2||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||14||4 |- |2012\u201313 |32||10||1||0||4||3||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||37||13 |- |2013\u201314 |4||1||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||4||1 |- !align=\"left\"|Total !48!!15!!3!!0!!4!!3!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!55!!18 |- |rowspan=\"3\" valign=center|Saint-\u00c9tienne |2013\u201314 |27||11||1||0||1||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||29||12 |- |2014\u201315 |26||8||5||1||1||0||4||0||36||9 |- !align=\"left\"|Total !53!!19!!6!!1!!2!!1!!4!!0!!65!!21 |- |valign=center|Hannover 96 |Bundesliga |2015\u201316 |11||0||2||0||colspan=\"4\"|\u2014||13||0 |- |valign=center|Guingamp (loan) |rowspan=\"2\"|Ligue 1 |2015\u201316 |15||4||0||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||16||4 |- |valign=center|Metz (loan) |2016\u201317 |24||6||1||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||27||6 |- |valign=center|\u0130stanbul Ba\u015fak\u015fehir |rowspan=\"3\"|S\u00fcper Lig |2017\u201318 |16||4||4||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||6||0||26||6 |- |valign=center|Antalyaspor (loan) |2018\u201319 |24||12||3||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||27||14 |- |valign=center|Fenerbah\u00e7e |2019\u201320 |10||0||6||4||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||16||4 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !356!!108!!44!!13!!16!!6!!27!!1!!443!!128 |- |colspan=\"13\" align=\"left\"| |} ===International goals=== :Source: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
