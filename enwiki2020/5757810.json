His mother was Easvari pillai. Kuzhikkottu Paduvilakathu Kochu Narayana Pillai was his Guru in warfare. He became a minister under the King Unni Kerala Varma of Venad. During his time, Madurai Thirumala Naickar attacked Venad. Pillai was asked to lead the Venad army and the attack which was spearheaded by Velayyan was repulsed. As a reward, Iravikkutti Pillai was appointed the Chief Minister and the Commander-in-Chief of Venad. But Thirumala Naickar sent another army under the leadership of Ramappayyan to attack Venad. The battle at Kaniyamkulam near Nagercoil was decisive. Some army commanders betrayed the Venad army out of jealousy towards Pillai and the Madurai army defeated the Venad army. Iravikkutti Pillai was killed in the battle. This incident became the theme for the folk song for the Villadichan Paattu \u2018Kaniyakulathu Poru\u2019 in the local Malayalam dialect. This song describes the life history of Iravikkutti Pillai and his trusted disciple Thengapattanath Kunjirakottu Kaali Nair. His cemetery was near Keralapuram Siva temple close to his ancestral house. There is also have Bhadra kali temple which is called as Padathalavan Bhadrakali Temple. His reputed horse was also cremated near his cemetery opposite the temple. ==References== * \"Mahacharitha Samgraham\" by Pallippattu Kunjukrishnan.
