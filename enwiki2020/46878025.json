    "text": "Lucas Peressini (born March 9, 1995) is a Canadian ice hockey goaltender. He is currently playing with the Western Mustangs of the OUA. ==Kingston Frontenacs (2012-2016)== Originally a tenth-round draft pick of the Saginaw Spirit in 2011, Peressini was traded to Kingston the following year. Peressini made his Ontario Hockey League debut with the Kingston Frontenacs during the 2012-13 season, appearing in only one game, in which he allowed six goals on 38 shots in a 6-1 loss to the Oshawa Generals. He spent the majority of the 2011-12 season, however, in the OJHL with the Newmarket Hurricanes. Peressini became the Frontenacs back up goaltender in 2013-14. He recorded his first career OHL victory on September 27, 2013, making 27 saves in a 5-1 victory over the Niagara IceDogs. In 25 games with the club, Peressini had a record of 11-4-4 with a 3.43 GAA and a .902 save percentage. In the post-season, Peressini went 0-1 with a 3.77 GAA and a .919 save percentage as the Frontenacs lost to the Peterborough Petes in the first round. In 2014-15, Peressini was named the Frontenacs starting goaltender. On October 12, 2014, he made 31 saves in a 1-0 win to earn his first career OHL shutout. Peressini finished the regular season winning his last seven decisions, helping the Frontenacs into the post-season. Overall, Peressini had a 30-20-6 record with a 2.32 GAA and a .922 save percentage, and had five shutouts, to win the OHL Goaltender of the Year award, and was named to the OHL First All-Star Team. In the post-season, he struggled in four games, going 0-4 with a 3.96 GAA and a .884 save percentage, as the Frontenacs were swept by the North Bay Battalion. Peressini returned to the Frontenacs for his overage season in 2015-16, as he put up a record of 27-14-4 with a 2.85 GAA and a .906 save percentage. On February 15, Peressini made 50 saves against the Barrie Colts, as Kingston won the game by a 6-4 score. Due to the emergence of backup goaltender Jeremy Helvig, Peressini began the post-season as the Frontenacs backup goaltender, however, he would regain his starters job midway in the second round. On March 29, Peressini earned his first career playoff victory, coming in relief for Helvig in the third period, and made 14 saves on 15 shots, as the Frontenacs defeated the Oshawa Generals 5-4. Overall in the playoffs, Peressini had a 1-4 record with a 3.09 GAA and a .902 save percentage. ==University of Western Ontario (2016-pres)== Peressini joined the Western Mustangs of the OUA for the 2016-17 season.
