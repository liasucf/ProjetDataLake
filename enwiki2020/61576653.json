He named it after his wife, Merced Garcia. Merced Theater offered live theatre from January 30, 1871 to 1876, then moved to minstrel and burlesque shows. When the Wood's Opera House opened nearby in 1876, and there was an outbreak of smallpox, the Merced ceased being the city's leading theatre. The Merced closed in 1877; it was used for informal entertainment events. Eventually, it gained an \"unenviable reputation\" because of \"the disreputable dances staged there, and was finally closed by the authorities.\"Cal Parks, Site 171 In the 1960s and in the 1980s, the theatre had renovations inside and out side. From 1985 to 2014, the theatre remained vacant. Current renovations are working on use for broadcast TV studio use. ==Founder== William Abbot (1830-26 July 1879) and his parents came from Switzerland.
