    "text": "The Fever Nurses Association was established in London in 1908. The governing body had 39 members: 20 doctors and 19 matrons and assistant matrons, mostly from fever hospitals and some from the hospitals run by the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Nurse Susan Villiers was a member. It was associated with the campaign for nurse registration led by Ethel Bedford-Fenwick, and was represented on the Central Committee for the State Registration of Nurses which was established in 1908. A scheme for training fever nurses was established after it was set up. ==References== Category:Nursing organisations in the United Kingdom ",
