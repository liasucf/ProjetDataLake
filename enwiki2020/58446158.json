    "text": "The Intel Extreme Masters Season XIII \u2013 Katowice Major 2019, also known as IEM Katowice Major 2019 or Katowice 2019, was the fourteenth Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Major Championship and the world championship for the thirteenth season of the Intel Extreme Masters. It was held in Katowice, Silesian Voivodeship, Poland from February 13 \u2013 March 3, 2019. Fourteen teams would qualify for the IEM Katowice Major 2019 based on their top fourteen placements from the last Major, the FACEIT Major: London 2018, while another ten teams would qualify from their respective regional qualifiers. The top eight teams from the London Major (Legends) received a bye to the second phase of the group stage while the other sixteen teams (Challengers) had to go through the first and second group stages in order to reach the playoffs. It featured a $1,000,000 USD prize pool and twenty-four professional teams from around the world as within previous Majors. It was also notably being held by ESL, whose last Major was in 2016. The IEM Katowice Major 2019 was the seventh consecutive major with a prize pool of $1,000,000 since Valve announced the prize pool increase from $250,000 at MLG Columbus 2016. This event was the start of the second season of the Intel Grand Slam. Astralis, Team Liquid, MIBR, Natus Vincere, and FaZe Clan were returning Legends. BIG, HellRaisers, and compLexity Gaming were knocked out in the New Legends stage, thus losing their Legends status. Renegades, Ninjas in Pyjamas, and ENCE were new Legends. The grand finals pitted the world's number one Astralis, which defeated Ninjas in Pyjamas and MIBR, and the underdog ENCE, which defeated the world's number two in Team Liquid and the world's number three in Natus Vincere. Astralis swept ENCE in two maps to take its third Major title to tie Fnatic for most Majors titles. In addition, it became just the third team after Fnatic and the current roster of MIBR to win consecutive Majors. This major is also notable in that this was one of the first tournaments in which the usage of the AUG surpassed the usage of the M4, which had been the main rifle used by the CTs in all previous tournaments dating back to Counter-Strike 1.6. According to some analysts and players, this switch increased the ability to play on the CT-side, in turn reducing the efficiency to play in the T-side. Most notably this affected the maps already favoured for the CT-side defences, such as Train, which was played three times in the final stage of the tournament. ==Background== Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a multiplayer first-person shooter video game developed by Hidden Path Entertainment and Valve. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. In competitive play, the game pits two teams against each other: the Terrorists and the Counter-Terrorists. Both sides are tasked with eliminating the other while also completing separate objectives. The Terrorists must either plant a bomb or kill the entire Counter-Terrorist team, while the Counter-Terrorists must either prevent the bomb from being planted by killing the entire Terrorist team or defusing the bomb. Once the bomb is planted, counter-terrorists have forty seconds to defuse the bomb; under normal circumstances, it takes ten seconds to defuse the bomb, but purchasing a defuse kit reduces the defuse time to five seconds. At the end of each round, players are rewarded based on their individual performance with in-game currency to spend on more powerful weapons in subsequent rounds. Winning rounds results in more money than losing, and completing objectives such as killing enemy players gives cash bonuses. However, the more consecutive rounds a team loses, the more money the losing team earns, with the loss bonus capping after five rounds; once that team wins a round, the loss round bonus resets to the minimum amount each player could earn after a round. The current defending champions are Astralis, after winning their second championship at the FACEIT Major: London 2018. At the time, Fnatic had the most Major titles with 3. ==Format== There are four regional qualifiers \u2013 Americas, Asia, CIS, and Europe. Two teams from each qualifier move on to the New Challengers stage. Each Minor will feature eight teams. In addition, the teams that placed third in their respective Minors will have another shot at the Major as since Valve reduced the number of direct invites from sixteen to fourteen, the last two spots will be decided through a third place qualifier, in which the teams that placed third at each Minor will play until two teams remain. The Major will feature twenty-four teams. The top eight teams from the FACEIT Major: London 2018 are known as Legends. The remaining sixteen teams are known as Challengers. The Major is split up into three stages. The first stage is the New Challengers stage, which features all the Challengers, which includes the teams that placed ninth through fourteenth at the FACEIT Major and the ten teams that came through the Minors system.; the top eight teams advance to the next stage and the bottom eight teams are sent home. The second stage is the New Legends stage. This stage features the eight Legends from the London Major and the eight teams from the New Challengers stage. Like the New Challengers stage, the New Legends stage will also have the top eight teams move on to the next stage and the bottom eight teams eliminated. However, the top six teams from the bottom eight teams are automatically invited to the next Major. The final stage is the New Champions stage. This stage features an eight team, best of three, single elimination bracket. Teams play until a winner is decided. Changes were announced for this Major format for the New Challengers and the New Legends stage. Rather than only featuring best of threes in the fifth round for the group stages, ESL announced that any progression or elimination matches would feature a best of three series. Therefore, the high and low matches of round three and all the matches for rounds four and five will be a best of three. Due to time constraints, some matches will be played at the same time when, in the past, every match would be shown on the main stream. Seeding will also be different. Rather than having a determined seeding by placement from the last Major and the Minors, teams will take time to rank the teams they will be playing; the scores will be combined and create the final seeding for the first round. ESL moved away from FACEIT's Buchholz system and instead will use an Elo rating system. Teams will be assigned Elo ratings that match their seeding and the Elo will change after every win or loss, as the winner will take some of the loser's points. Each team's Elo will determine its next matchup rather than having a random draw, as it was done in the past. ===Map Pool=== The map pool will be kept the same as the previous major. {| cellspacing=\"10\" |- |valign=\"top\" width=\"450px\"| ;Maps * Cache * Dust II * Mirage * Inferno * Nuke * Train * Overpass |- |} ==Minors== Each regional qualifier, called \"Minors\", featured eight teams. Each Minor also had a 50,000 prize pool, with first place receiving 30,000, second place taking in 15,000, and third place raking in the last 5,000. Unlike past Minors, no teams was directly invited to the Minors. All Minors take place in Katowice to avoid visa issues, just like the FACEIT Major approach. Each Minor's format was similar to past Minors, but with a couple small changes. The group stages would be a GSL, double elimination format with each group featuring four teams. The opening matches would be a best of one. A new change came along with the winner's set being a best of three instead of the usual best of one. The loser's and decider's matches would also be best of three sets. The top two teams in each group would move on to a four team, best of three, double elimination bracket. The top two teams would move on to the Major. In addition, the Minor finals that used to determine seeding would be eliminated; instead, the winner of the winner's match would be the first seed going into the New Challengers stage and the winner of the loser's match would be the second seed. ===CIS Minor=== The CIS Minor qualifier featured sixteen teams. Winstrike Team was automatically invited based on its top sixteen placement at the FACEIT Major and another seven teams were invited. Eight more teams qualified through four online qualifiers. The qualifier will have a sixteen team, double elimination bracket and teams will play until eight teams qualified CIS Minor. The CIS Minor took place from January 16 to 20, 2019. {| cellspacing=\"30\" |- | ; Teams * AVANGAR * Nemiga Gaming * Team Spirit * Winstrike Team * Gambit Esports * pro100 * Syman Gaming * Runtime.gg |- |} {| border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style=\"font-size: 90%;

Even after Gambit's shakeups after releasing two of its star players, it was still a stunning upset that Syman was able to knock down Gambit in the opening match. Team Spirit had a 12\u20135 lead against Nemiga Gaming, but the team from Belarus was able to take it to overtime; however, Spirit able to deny the comeback victory by sweeping the overtime, thanks to Vadim \"DavCost\" Vasilyev's dominant 35 kills. AVANGAR easily took care of pro100 16-5 as the Kazakh team looked to go back to a Major after over a year. Winstrike Team also looked to head back to the Major after being Legends for one tournament before bombing out at the London Major as the Russian team easily took down a Runtime that was a mix of former top professional players and unproven talent. In the first best of three, Syman and Spirit had a tough battle, but Spirit managed to pull away as Pavel \"COLDYY1\" Veklenko in the two-game sweep, one of which went to double overtime, to secure a spot in the CIS Minor playoffs. Winstrike also secured a spot after taking two of three over AVANGAR. In the first elimination series, Gambit easily took down Nemiga. In group B, pro100 was able to eliminate Runtime after losing the first map to stay alive. Syman looked to upset Gambit once again and it looked possible after taking the first match. However, Gambit adjusted and cruised to victory in the next to maps to secure a top four spot. In a much closer series, AVANGAR swept pro100 and eliminated the Ukrainian team. What was supposed to be a fairly even matchup turned into a dominating performance by AVANGAR, winning by at least ten rounds in the 2\u20130 sweep over Team Spirit. In the second set, Winstrike and Gambit split two maps, both of which were close. On the third map on Dust II, Winstrike looked to take the game after being up 15\u201312. However, Gambit came back to tie the game and go into overtime. However, Winstrike quickly responded by taking the overtime and guaranteed at least a third place. AVANGAR easily skipped past Winstrike in the first map, but a big comeback win in the second map by Winstrike gave the Russian team a lot of momentum. However, AVANGAR was able to turn things around and put up a similar scoreline as the first map to claim its spot at the Major. In the loser's side, Mikhail \"Dosia\" Stolyarov and Rustem \"mou\" Telepov were Major champions just over a year and a half ago, but not they could not get out of the CIS Minor as Spirit put Gambit away for good. Spirit finally qualified for a Major after years of falling short while Winstrike had one more chance to qualify. ===Europe Minor=== The Europe Minor qualifier featured sixteen teams. mousesports were automatically invited based on their top sixteen placement at the FACEIT Major and another seven teams were invited. Eight more teams qualified through four online qualifiers. The qualifier had a sixteen team, double elimination bracket and teams played until eight teams qualified for the Europe Minor. The Europe Minor took place from January 16 to 20, 2019. ENCE eSports and Team Vitality qualified for the main qualifier. {| cellspacing=\"30\" |- | ; Teams * mousesports * North * OpTic Gaming * Windigo Gaming * ENCE * ex-Space Soldiers * Team Vitality * Valiance |- |} {| border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style=\"font-size: 90%;

After a close first half, Vitality pulled away to take the opening match. In a huge upset in the next match, Valiance took down mousesports on mousesports's signature map of Mirage. Despite Chris \"\" de Jong's 32 kills, Valiance's team effort pulled ahead to take down the favorite to win the Minor. Yaman \"yam\" Ergenekon made his debut with the former roster of Space Soldiers by top fragging for his team. However, the team itself needed to fix a lot of issues as it was dominated by ENCE. The last initial match was Windigo easily taking down North. A close first half was made possible by Nicklas \"gade\" Gade, but Windigo's defense seemed impenetrable as North won zero rounds on its terrorist side. On the winner's side, ENCE was able to move past Windigo with relative ease as Aleksi \"allu\" Jalli was one step closer to heading back to a Major with his young team. On the other side of the winner's matches, Valiance had a 15\u201313 lead late into the first map, but Vitality took over the game and pulled off a win in overtime. Valiance responded with a win on Inferno, but Vitality demolished Valiance in the decider to book a playoff spot for the Minor. The first match of the second day took mousesports squeezing past OpTic as the Danes were eliminated in a competitive Minor. North was able to take down the struggling ex-Space Soldiers and the Turks were eliminated. Valiance proved that its upset win over mousesports was no fluke as the majority- Serbian team took down the international squad again and eliminated mousesports. The rising Windigo was able to take the first map and North took the second map in the final group stage series. In the decider game, Valdemar \"valde\" Bj\u00f8rn Vangs\u00e5 carried his team to victory and North avoided another disappointment. Vitality looked to continue to put on a good performance lead by their promising young star Mathieu \"ZywOo\" Herbaut while North only looked to head back to the Major and regain a Legends spot. In a close best of three, North swept Vitality as North needed to make two big comebacks. Valiance looked to continue its strong momentum and Valiance proved it was prepared after taking the first map and it looked like Valiance's plan of countering the enemies' strategies was working. However, ENCE came back, lead by Jere \"sergej\" Salo and Jani \"Aerial\" Jussila, to take the series and move on. A fan favorite, but underdog, of the community, ENCE finally booked a ticket to the Major as the team defeated North. The first map required a small, but tense comeback, as ENCE was down 14\u201311, but was able to take the game in double overtime. The loser's semifinals was the closest series of any of the Minors at this point. On the first map, Valiance had a 14\u20135 lead, but eight unanswered rounds from Vitality suddenly made it 14\u201313. Fortunately for Valiance, it was able to scrape together two more rounds to give the team the map advantage. However, it looked like that Vitality was able to make some adjustments as it took an early 9\u20132 lead. Despite this, Valiance mad it 11-9 and then 15\u201313, but the French made it out alive and took the last round to tie up the series. The third map was close all around. Vitality had a 9\u20136 lead before Valiance swung the score to its favor at 13\u201311. However, four rounds in a row gave Vitality the lead before Valiance took one more at 15\u201314. In the thirtieth round, Vitality found an open B bombsite and planted the bomb. While Valiance was able to sweep up the five members of Vitality, the European team went in with the bomb timer ticking down and Vitality won the series with under two seconds to go on the defuse. The decider series had a similar feel to the CIS decider, as North took the first map in a close game, but Vitality bounced back to trample North and qualified for the Major. ===Asia Minor=== The Asia Minor featured two teams from Oceania, two teams from China, two teams from East Asia, one team from Southeast Asia, and one team from the Middle East.

The other Australian team, Grayhound Gaming, faced off against the dark horse team in CyberZen. After Grayhound took a comfortable lead, CyberZen started to mount a comeback; however, some mistakes by CyberZen in round 26 against a Grayhound team that barely bought into the round lead the Chinese team to stumble and Grayhound secured the win. In group B, GOSU surprisingly took a huge lead against ViCi Gaming 12\u20133. ViCi finally started to get into a rhythm, but it was too late as GOSU was able to pull off the upset win. In the last opening match, Beyond Esports looked to also pull off an upset over MVP PK, but MVP PK pulled ahead in the second half to easily take the victory. In group A's winner's match, Renegades barely took the win over its compatriots in Grayhound, as both games were decided by two rounds. On the other side, MVP PK took down its own compatriots in GOSU after a very close first game; in the second game, however, MVP easily won to move on to the top four. Aquees looked to surprise the scene after taking a massive lead over CyberZen, but the Chinese team turned on the jets and brought the game all the way back; despite this, Aquees closed out the game. However, CyberZen took the momentum from the almost- comeback and took the next two games with relative ease. Beyond could not get anything going with its redesigned lineup as ViCi easily moved on to the decider's series. Grayhound and CyberZen split the first two maps, both close games. The third map was also close, but after CyberZen tied the game up at 11, Grayhound pulled away, winning the next five of six to face off against MVP PK in the bracket. GOSU looked to upset ViCi again, and the Korean team almost did it again, but ViCi winning a series of unanswered rounds hurt GOSU, including being up 14\u20135 on the second map at one point, and ViCi would close out the series just barely. ViCi started the playoffs with a win over the Renegades lead by Zhihong \"aumaN\" Liu. However, Renegades did not have any problem in the following two maps as the Renegades guaranteed a top three spot in this Minor. What was supposed to be an evenly matched set did not turn out as expected. MVP PK comfortably took the first map, but Grayhound did the same in the next two maps, as neither team struggled too much in its victory. In the loss, only Keun-chul \"solo\" Kang had a positive kill-death differential. The battle for top three ended in the loser's semifinals. ViCi took an early lead, but MVP PK was able to bring the score back by the end of the first half. ViCi then took match point with a comfortable lead, but MVP PK started to mount a comeback; however, that comeback fell just short and ViCi took the first map. The next map would go in favor of ViCi strongly and the MVP organization's frustrations continued as it ended in another fourth-place finish. Grayhound easily took the first map off of Renegades, but Renegades took the second map as Grayhound looked for the upset. Renegades took a massive 12-3 and then 15\u20136 lead, but a sudden surge from Grayhound got the team within two rounds. Nevertheless, Renegades managed to find a round to take the top seed at the Minor. ViCi easily took the first map against Grayhound, but the Australians returned the favor with a win of their own. The third map would end up being a close one based on the score, but a dominant win based on the performance. ViCi took a 9\u20136 lead and then a 12\u20136 lead. However, Grayhound would then win the next ten of eleven rounds, shutting down ViCi's terrorist side to join Renegades at the Major. With Renegades and Grayhound qualifying, this would mean that Sean \"Gratisfaction\"' Kaiwai was the first New Zealander and Erdenetsogt \"erkaSt\" Gantulga was the first Mongolian to play at a Major. Euan \"sterling\" Moore also joined Gratisfaction as a New Zealander to play at a Major. ===Americas Minor=== The Americas Minor featured two qualifiers, one from North America and one from South America. The North America qualifier featured sixteen teams. Eight teams were invited and another eight teams qualified through four online qualifiers. The qualifier would have a sixteen team, double elimination bracket and teams would play until six teams qualified for the Americas Minor. The South America qualifier featured eight teams. Four teams were invited and another four teams qualified through two online qualifiers. This qualifier have an eight team, double elimination, best of three bracket. Teams would play until two teams qualified for the Minor. The Americas Minor took place from January 22 to 26, 2019, the same dates as the Asia Minor. {| cellspacing=\"30\" |- | ; Teams * * FURIA Esports * NRG Esports * Team Envy * Bravado Gaming * Team One * INTZ eSports * Imperial e-Sports |- |} {| border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style=\"font-size: 90%;

Bravado Gaming was able to upset INTZ eSports after a fairly close game as the South African team looked to head back to a Major. Team Envy won its first Major-related game after its new branding as the Americans completely shut down Brazil's Team One. FURIA Esports was able to upset the favorite to win the group as FURIA looked to join MIBR at the Major to represent Brazil. In the first winner's match, NRG easily took down Bravado to head to the top four as NRG looked to make its first Major despite being a top American team for a while. In group B's winner's match, FURIA took down Envy after some close games to make it to the playoff stage. After dominating the Minor qualifier, 's run to the Major ended in a letdown as Team One was able to come back from a nine-round deficit in the first map and then used that drive to easily take the second map as were sent home. Meanwhile, INTZ was able to take down Imperial, but the victory came at more of a struggle than anticipated as Imperial was able to take a map. In group A's decider, INTZ had a fairly easy time taking down Bravado as the South African dream came to an end amidst Bravado's financial troubles of keeping the team in the United States. The last Katowice Minor group stage set was an extremely close one. The first map went in favor of Team One cleanly. In the second map on Dust II, Envy's new in-game leader Finn \"karrigan\" Andersen was about to lead Envy to evening the series, but a small and sudden surge from Team One sent the game to overtime. After the game was tied at 17, Envy was able to clutch it out to send it to a third map. At first, Team One's 13\u20139 lead seemed to be sufficient, but Envy was able to bring it back to tie the game at 14. After some very close rounds, Envy's persistence beat out that of Team One and Envy moved on. The favorites to win the Minor, NRG Esports, took one step closer to the Major after defeating Team Envy after Cvetelin \"CeRq\" Dimitrov went big for his team. In the Brazilian battle, FURIA joined NRG after defeating INTZ in three maps. Kaike \"kscerato\" Cerato, after being rumored of being transferred to MIBR, had 14 more kills than the next closest player's kill count. After struggling for much of ESL Pro League Season 8, Team Envy looked like it found its groove as it demolished INTZ 16\u20132 on the first map, but in the second map, after a 11\u20134 lead, INTZ scored 12 unanswered rounds to take the second map. The third map featured a close first half, but Tayler \"Drone\" Johnson's 25 kills helped Envy send INTZ back home. NRG finally secured a Major spot after many unsuccessful attempts after taking down FURIA in two maps as it was led by Ethan \"nahtE\" Arnold. FURIA easily took down Envy in the decider set with the score of 16\u20132. The second map proved to be a lot closer, but Rinaldo \"AbleJ\" Moda Junior's 24 kills lead FURIA to close out the map with ten rounds in a row to become just the third South American team to play at a Major. With NRG Esports qualifying, this meant Cvetelin \"CeRq\" Dimitrov was the first Bulgarian to play at a Major. ===Minor play-in=== This qualifier featured the teams that placed third in their respective Minors. This phase was a four team, best of three, double elimination bracket.

Winstrike demolished Team Envy 16-4 as the veteran Jan \"wayLander\" Rahkonen had 29 kills to lead the Russian team. The winner's match was a very close one as both teams knew one more win would send them to the top twenty-four at the Major. In the back and forth affair, Winstrike came out on top 16-14 Kirill \"Boombl4\" Mikhailov and his team were able to outlast the impact Zhihong \"aumaN\" Liu had for ViCi and Winstrike headed to its third consecutive Major. North was able to take a 13\u20132 lead against Envy in the first best of three in the elimination match and was able to close out the map despite a small comeback attempt from the American side. The second map was fairly close, but Envy could not get its foot completely off the ground as North looked to seek revenge against ViCi. The first map was a close one. After falling behind 9-6 after the first half, North was able to take a 12\u201310 lead. However, ViCi's star Wing Hei \"Freeman\" Cheung was able to lead his team to take the final six rounds and the Chinese team looked to join TyLoo as Asia's representatives. North got off to a very good start in the first half of the second map, ending the score with 11\u20134, including taking 11 of the last 12 rounds. That lead turned into 12\u20136, but ViCi were suddenly able to tie it up at 12 and then the game went to overtime at 15-15. More back and forth ensued until the game reached double overtime. Lead by Freeman and Andrew \"kaze\" Khong, ViCi were able to barely pull out the victory and send North home. Valdemar \"valde\" Bj\u00f8rn Vangs\u00e5 and Markus \"Kjaerbye\" Kj\u00e6rbye tried to carry North to a win, but the rest of their team fell behind. With ViCi Gaming qualifying, this meant Wing Hei \"Freeman\" Cheung was the first player from Hong Kong to play at a Major. ==Broadcast talent== Desk hosts * Alex \"Machine\" Richardson * Tres \"stunna\" Saranthus Stage host * OJ Borg Reporter * Frankie Ward Commentators * Henry \"HenryG\" Greer * Vince Hill * Jason \"moses\" O'Toole * Matthew \"Sadokist\" Trivett * Analysts and desk hosts also filled in as commentators Analysts * Chad \"SPUNJ\" Burchill * Sean \"seang@res\" Gares * Jacob \"Pimp\" Winneche Observers * Connor \"Sliggy\" Blomfield * Heather \"sapphiRe\" Garozzo * David \"Prius\" Kuntz * Alex \"Rushly\" Rush ===Broadcasts=== The major is streamed in various languages across Twitch.

The rankings shown below reflect the February 11, 2019 rankings. The HLTV.org World Ranking ranks the best teams in the competitive field of the game. The world ranking is based on teams' achievements over the past year (with severe decay in points throughout each month), recent form over the last 2 months, and performance at the last 10 LAN events. All of that is predicated around a 3-man core each team is required to have in order to retain their past points. Points cap at 1000 points. The rankings started with the last season's Katowice World Championship, in which Fnatic defeated FaZe Clan and concluded with Astralis defeating Team Liquid at ESL Pro League Season 8.

ViCi got off to hot 8\u20131 start before Fnatic recovered by the end and trailed only 6\u20139. Starting in the second half, it looked like Fnatic was looking to take it after taking the first two gun rounds. However, ViCi changed up some strategies and then ran over the top seeded Swedes and an upset happened in the very first match of the Major. Although Freddy \"KRIMZ\" Johansson had a massive game for Fnatic with 24 kills, the rest of his team fell behind, including Ludvig \"Brollan\" Brolin with just 16 kills and 20 deaths. Weijie \"zhokiNg\" Zhong had 26 kills and Zhuo \"advent\" Liang had 25 to lead ViCi while not needing Andrew \"kaze\" Khong to go on a superstar performance as he normally does. What was supposed to be a tightly contested map turned to a fairly convincing win. Renegades took a 9\u20136 lead at the end of the first half over AVANGAR. The teams switched sides and Renegades overran AVANGAR on its terrorist side; the turning point was arguably when Ali \"Jame\" Djami unscoped his AWP when Sean \"Gratisfaction\"' Kaiwai peeked around a corner with just twelve seconds left with the bomb. Aaron \"AZR\" Ward lead the server with 24 kills. Alexey \"qikert\" Golubev and Jame lead the way with 17 kills for AVANGAR, but Timur \"buster\" Tulepov, after an impressive Boston Major, struggled with just six kills. Cloud9 got off to a hot start against Grayhound Gaming with a 6\u20130 lead, which included two 1 vs 3 clutches by the newcomer Jordan \"Zellsis\" Montemurro and the veteran Fabien \"kioShiMa\" Fiey Grayhound did keep it close, including winning five unanswered in the second half to keep it within one, but Cloud9 took the match to progress to the 1-0 phase. kioShiMa lead all players with 27 kills while three players on Grayhound had 19 kills, with Chris \"dexter\" Nong being the highest rated player on the team. Nobody knew how TyLoo would do at the Major since the team played at zero tournaments since December, but, lead by YuLun \"Summer\" Cai, the newly formed TyLoo lineup had zero trouble once it got to its counter- terrorist side. Nathan \"NBK-\" Schmitt had 22 kills to lead Team Vitality, but its star player Mathieu \"ZywOo\" Herbaut struggled with just 15 kills as the Chinese team took the win. ENCE eSports and Team Spirit was next. While initially close, ENCE was able to pull away at the end of the map with Jere \"sergej\" Salo and Jani \"Aerial\" Jussila leading with 21 kills. Dmitry \"S0tF1k\" Forostyanko and Vadim \"DavCost\" Vasilyev also had 21 kills for Spirit, but the Russian team could not go toe-to-toe with the Finns. Vega tried to surprise the world again with an upset over G2 and it started well with a 9\u20136 lead at the half. However, G2 had an even better terrorist side in the second half as Kenny \"kennyS\" Schrublooked like he had returned to his old self with 29 kills and Alexandre \"bodyy\" Pianaro, who had faced criticism for underperforming, had 26. Igor \"crush\" Shevchenko had 25 for Vega, but the team fell just short. FURIA Esports came in as a dark horse, especially with Kaike \"KSCERATO\" Cerato on the team, but the team struggled against the veterans in Ninjas in Pyjamas (NiP) as Fredrik \"REZ\" Sterner and Jonas \"Lekr0\" Olofsson lead all players in kills. KSCERATO played well, but the rest of his team struggled. NRG Esports' debut on the Major was a good one as Ethan \"Ethan\" Arnold went huge with 24 kills and Cvetelin \"CeRq\" Dimitrov followed up with 21. Kirill \"Boombl4\" Mikhailov and Georgi \"WorldEdit\" Yaskin had 17 kills each, but Winstrike Team's second half was flat. Vega took an early lead over its Russian compatriots, but Spirit took the next eight of ten rounds before Vega made it close again at the half. However, Spirit pulled away again and took a 14\u201311 lead. Vega then turned on the jets and suddenly took the next five rounds to close out the messy game. Pavel \"COLDYY1\" Veklenko and Victor \"somedieyoung\" Orudzhev had a huge game for Spirit, but the combination of Dmitriy \"jR\" Chervak, Pavel \"hutji\" Lashkov, and Leonid \"chopper\" Vishnyakov allowed Vega to squeeze past. On the B stream, Grayhound bounced back from a close loss against Cloud9 and took a 13\u20132 lead over Vitality. However, Vitality won a few rounds in a row and then took advantage of Grayhound's inexperience. Grayhound eventually got to match point late into the game, but Vitality tied the game right up to send the game to overtime. Grayhound got a round on the seemingly- elusive terrorist side to possibly to it in an advantage, but Vitality adjusted its strategies and took two terrorist rounds to complete the comeback. Dan \"apEX\" Madesclaire had the best performance out of anyone with 36 kills and ZywOo bounced back with 33. Oliver \"DickStacy\" Tierney also broke the 30 barrier and Chris \"dexter\"' Nong and Euan \"sterling\" Moore had 23 kills each, but the Australian team could not hold on in the end. Fnatic was upset once again as the Swedes could not get anything going against Winstrike as they fell 2\u201313 at the first half. Fnatic nearly came back, but a 1 vs. 3 clutch by Boombl4 spurred Winstrike to finish the game in a win. Although Richard \"Xizt\" Landstr\u00f6m was the highest rated player for Fnatic, the rest of Fnatic was shut down. Jan \"wayLander\" Rahkonen had 23 kills in the win. Another comeback took place on the other side as AVANGAR came back from a 8\u20131 deficit and read FURIA's terrorist strategies well towards the end as the last few rounds were shut down. Jame and Bektiyar \"fitch\" Bahytov were able to make the comeback possible with 27 and 21 kills, respectively. Andrei \"arT\" Piovezan had 23 kills and KSCERATO had 20, but Yuri \"yuurih\" Santos only had 13 kills to the loss. TyLoo continued it surprise run by defeating Cloud9 in dominating fashion. The two Indonesians showed up as Kevin \"xccurate\" Susanto had 20 kills and Hansel \"BnTeT\" Ferdinand had 19, with Haowen \"somebody\" Xu also at 19. Will \"RUSH\" Wierzba had 13 kills, but Cloud9 struggled, including the top 20 player Timothy \"\" Ta with just 6 kills. G2 looked to go up to two wins and it won the second round with a weak buy and went up 2\u20131. However, ENCE won twelve unanswered and closed the half with a 13\u20132 lead. G2 performed better on its counter-terrorist side, but the lead was too much and ENCE easily took the map. The veteran Aleksi \"allu\" Jalli and the two young players sergej and Aleksi \"Aleksib\" Virolainen had 20 kills each in the win. Audric \"JaCkz\" Jug and Lucas \"Lucky\" Chastang had 13 kills each in their second ever Major game, but the Finns dominated in the end. NRG came out swinging against ViCi and took an easy win over the Chinese as ViCi could not take down another top seed. Ethan and Jacob \"FugLy\" Medina in the dominating win. Zhuo \"advent\" Liang only had one kill for the majority of the map and ViCi's start player Wing Hei \"Freeman\" Cheung also struggled with just 8 while zhokiNg did well with 14. Renegades's three weeks of bootcamp paid off as the Australians went up 2\u20130 against NiP. Although NiP mounted a comeback when Renegades reached map point, a hit on the A bombsite completely ran over NiP's defense and Renegades took the win. The three veterans in NiP \u2013 Patrik \"f0rest\" Lindberg, Christopher \"GeT_RiGhT\" Alesund, and Dennis \"dennis\" Edman \u2013 all had good games, but REZ and Lekr0 struggled after a good first game. AZR and Jay \"Liazz\" Tregillgas had crucial kills for Renegades in the win to conclude day 1. Vitality started day 2 with a romp over Vega 16\u20131, as the French took twelve unanswered to close out the game. All of Vega performed poorly, including Anton \"tonyblack\" Kolesnikov, who was the best performing player for Vega, as nobody broke double digits for the team. G2 could not replicate the performance of its French compatriots as they team fell to AVANGAR. While Richard \"shox\" Papillon did well, the rest of G2 struggled and buster for AVANGAR had a big game with 27 kills. Winstrike took advantage of NiP banning to one of its strongest maps as, aside from f0rest, the Swedes could not get much done. Aurimas \"Kvik\" Kvaksis had 29 kills for Winstrike and only David \"n0rb3r7\" Danielyan underperformed in the game. The pick that many chose to go 0-3 moved on to the high ground of round 4 ViCi dominated Cloud9 on Inferno. Although legendary player Robin \"flusha\" R\u00f6nnquist kept pace with ViCi with 21 kills, everyone one else on Cloud9 stumbled. ViCi's two star players came alive and Zhihong \"aumaN\" Liu contributed with 20 kills. Renegades finally made it to the top 16 after years of turmoil and the Australians took down fan favorite ENCE as Justin \"jks\" Savage had a massive series with 51 kills across the two maps while Joakim \"jkaem\" Myrbostad's supportive role proved to be vital. Fnatic stayed alive and avoided another upset after taking down Renegades' compatriots Grayhound. While Jesper \"JW\" Wecksell did not have the best series, KRiMZ and Brollan stepped up to counter the likes of dexter and sterling. Erdenetsogt \"erkaSt\" Gantulga and Liam \"malta\" Schembri struggled in the loss and Grayhound was eliminated. FURIA had another massive counter- terrorist side on Mirage, but struggled again on its terrorist side. Spirit started to mount a big comeback, garnering 7 rounds in the second half, but the lead was too much and FURIA closed it out. Spirit took a 12\u20136 lead on the second map and looked to tie up the series, but FURIA won seven unanswered to take the lead. Spirit won two to take back the lead, but FURIA managed to take the series and stay alive. Dmitriy \"Dima\" Bandurka had 40 kills across the two maps for Spirit, but he struggled on the second map in the losing effort. Damian \"daps\" Steele lead NRG to a very close win over TyLoo, as Vincent \"Brehze\" Cayonte had a massive set with 72 kills over two maps. Vitality and ViCi kicked off round four. ViCi was able to take a 10\u20135 lead at the end of the first half and then went up 14-7 and looked to pull off another upset. However, eight unanswered rounds from Vitality suddenly gave the French match point, but ViCi managed to snag the thirtieth round to send the game to overtime. A back and forth affair took the game to triple overtime, where Vitality pulled off the win. kaze had 42 kills, but ZywOo was able to match him with 41, including crucial 1 vs 2 and 1 vs 3 clutches in overtime. On the second map, ViCi started on the much more favored side on Nuke, but the team only managed to get eight rounds. Vitality took advantage of this and after a shaky start to the second half, Vitality moved on to the New Legends stage. While Alex \"ALEX\" McMeekin struggled on Nuke, C\u00e9dric \"RpK\" Guipouy showed signs of his old self and lead the way with 24 kills. AVANGAR wasted no time against TyLoo and quickly went up 8\u20132, but TyLoo was able to fortify its defense and make it a close half at 8\u20137. The Chinese team then went up 11\u20137, but it would not have any more luck as it could not get past the Kazakh defense and took map one. AVANGAR once again took a lead into the middle of the game and took a convincing 15\u20135 lead. However, TyLoo, lead by some strong defense by somebody and YuanZhang \"Attacker\" Sheng allowed TyLoo to mount a huge comeback. In the thirtieth round, Aidyn \"KrizzeN\" Turlybekov, who had been struggling for a good portion of the tournament, stepped up and took down the TyLoo players on the A bombsite and AVANGAR denied the comeback and moved on to the Legends stage. ENCE took a huge 11\u20134 lead to start off the last series of day 3, including winning ten in a row. Winstrike started to bring it back behind WorldEdit and Boombl4, but the lead was too far gone. Winstrike managed to take that momentum from the first map and convert it to the second map with a 13-2 half. ENCE managed to scrappily pick up rounds, but Winstrike closed map two with ease. Map three showcased the dominant counter-terrorist side on Train. ENCE took a massive 14\u20131 lead, including a wild 1 vs 3 sergej clutch. However, Winstrike came all the way back by taking 12 of 13 rounds to make the score 15\u201313. ENCE made some tweaks and squeezed out a winning round to move on. Overall, ENCE players such as Sami \"xseveN\" Laasanen stepped up when necessary throughout the series to secure the win. Day 4 began with a thriller in the rematch of the historic game, when Vega eliminated NiP at the Atlanta Major 2017 in the qualifier, making that Major the first Major NiP did not take part of. Vega showed off its strong counter-terrorist side on Overpass in the first half, but NiP did the same as well in the second half, even when Vega had eight match points, and the game headed to overtime. The overtime was also close, but Vega managed to not give up the massive advantage it had and closed out map one. NiP recovered a map on Train in an easy win, lead by REZ's 25 kills. Mirage was the last map and Vega took a 9\u20136 lead and then the first pistol round. However, NiP's defense held strong, letting Vega only find rounds once in a while, and eliminated the Russian team. Fnatic came out strong with an 11-4 halftime lead over G2. G2 had a strong second half start, but Fnatic would easily take the first map. After a close first half on the second map, but G2 would pull away with an easy win of its own, letting Fnatic only take two rounds as Lucky had a big game. The last map Overpass was historically a good map for both teams. Fnatic took the pistol round, but G2 followed up with nine rounds in a row and the half ended 11\u20134 in the side of the French. Fnatic was able to take the first gun round, but a harsh reset to the economy spelled the end of Fnatic, putting Fnatic's fourteen Major streak of finishing in the top sixteen to an end. Simon \"twist\" Eliasson, who had only nine kills, had struggled for Fnatic throughout the event, and the number one seed fell. FURIA took a massive 8\u20130 lead and then, after Cloud9 took a round, FURIA then won the game 16\u20131. FURIA looked to carry that momentum, but it was Cloud9 who turned things around and won a 16\u20131 game of its own. The final map was much more competitive than the first two, as the half ended in 8\u20137 in favor of FURIA. Cloud9 then took the first six rounds of the second half to take the lead at 13\u20138, but FURIA finally took two rounds. However, Cloud9's strategies countered FURIA's counter-terrorist side and the American organization stayed alive. Vinicius \"VINI\" Figueiredo had a strong performance for FURIA and players such as Rinaldo \"ableJ\" Moda J\u00fanior had important frags, but kioShiMa's 23 and Zellsis's key kills in the second half lead Cloud9 to a win. NiP and ViCi had a very close first half on the first map, with the Swedes leading on 8\u20137. In the second half, despite aumaN leading the server, ViCi could not get a single round in the second half and NiP cruised to a win. The second map started with ViCi taking the first five rounds, then NiP took the next eight before ViCi took the last two of the first round. In the second half, however, NiP only had a brief period of success on its terrorist side and ViCi was able to tie the series in after the close game. After a back and forth start on Mirage, NiP pulled away and took a big 11-4 halftime lead. ViCi was able gather two sets of three rounds, but deficit was too much to come back from and NiP moved on. G2 managed to have a good counter-terrorist side, but TyLoo had an even better one in the second half, as G2 only scrapped up two rounds. Dust II was historically a good G2 map and it showed why as the French had an even better first half than the last with a 13\u20132 lead. G2 then easily finished up the game to force a third map. G2 matched its halftime score from the second map in the third map. TyLoo tried to come back after taking the second half pistol round, but G2's economy rounds somehow managed to overrun TyLoo and G2 moved on. TyLoo started the tournament 2\u20130, but ended in 2-3 as it could not get a best of three win. Cloud9 started on the much more favored side on Nuke and easily took an 11\u20134 lead. Winstrike tried to put on a big performance for its counter-terrorist side in the second half, but Cloud9 denied much success as dominated the map. Cloud9 won the pistol round to carry the momentum, but some crucial mistakes allowed Winstrike to take the next three rounds and then eventually an 8\u20137 lead. Winstrike won the first two rounds, but Cloud9 won seven rounds in a row to go up 14-10 and then 15\u201312. Winstrike then regrouped and then tied the game at 15. In overtime, Winstrike dominated the first round, but Cloud9, lead by RUSH's plays, took the next four to survive and move on. ==New Legends stage== The New Legends stage, formerly known as the Group stage, used the same format as the Challengers stage.

Meanwhile, apEX dropped 30 kills as Vitality put up a strong counter-terrorist side. On the other stream, ENCE eSports took a good lead over Renegades in the New Challengers rematch with a 10-5 half. However, Renegades put up an even better half in the second at 11-3 as the Australians shut down most of what ENCE had to offer. Many looked at what HellRaisers could do after not being active in tournaments for a long time, but Kirill \"ANGE1\" Karasiow's team fell flat. Abay \"HObbit\" Khasenov played well in his HellRaisers Majors debut, but the team's star players Issa \"ISSAA\" Murad and \u00d6zg\u00fcr \"woxic\" Eker did not have the impact the team wanted. Meanwhile, FaZe Clan's Nikola \"NiKo\" Kova\u010d put up big numbers against HellRaisers, with Ladislav \"GuardiaN\" Kov\u00e1cs close behind him. Natus Vincere (Na'Vi) had an unexpected performance from Ioann \"Edward\" Sukhariev with 23 kills and everyone on the team had a good game, limiting the impact kennyS had for G2 Esports. After AVANGAR took the halftime lead, Team Liquid went to work. Despite qikert's 27 kills, the Canadians Russel \"Twistzz\" Van Dulken and Keith \"NAF\" Markovic both performed well to limit the Kazakhs to just four rounds in the second half. Ninjas in Pyjamas took a huge halftime lead on Nuke at 11\u20134, but did start on the much more favored side, giving NRG Esports a chance.

XANTARES did turn things around from his last game as he lead BIG to a 9\u20136 lead. However, shox's crew, lead by kennyS's 25 kills, took control and won 10 rounds in the second half to BIG's 4 and sent the German team to 0\u20132.

In the following round, things looked good for ENCE to make the comeback, but HObbit and ISSAA managed to secure two kills each and HellRaisers staved off the comeback. compLexity tried to surprise the world again and head back to the playoffs and it took an 8\u20137 lead against MIBR. However, MIBR found a strategy to counter compLexity in the second half and easily won it out and avoided the 0\u20132. AVANGAR took a huge lead at 11-4 and then at 12\u20136. NRG decided to take a risk and bought with low money and it paid off and eventually tied the game at 13. However, AVANGAR figured out the defense in the end and upset NRG. Renegades pulled off another upset and went up 9\u20130 in series since the Asia Minor as AZR had another huge game. FaZe's Olof \"olofmeister\" Kajbjer, named the best player in 2015, struggled with just 10 kills. Astralis pulled off the second 16\u20130 in Major history, lead by Emil \"Magisk\" Reif and Nicolai \"dev1ce\" Reedtz, against Cloud9; the Danes had the only other 16\u20130, which was against MIBR in the last Major in the New Legends stage. Vitality and Na'Vi was a thriller that headed to triple overtime. Vitality had chances, but Denis \"electronic\" Sharipov and Oleksandr \"s1mple\" Kostyliev bailed Na'Vi out to barely survive. Team Liquid had a hot start, but NiP settled in and eventually took the lead late into the game.

Vitality, lead by apEX and ZywOo, just barely won out over Cloud9, even though flusha had 27 kills and Zellsis with 24 as the Frenchmen went up 2\u20131. Astralis looked like it put a halt onto Renegades's Cinderella run as the world's number one put up a 12-3 halftime lead and then a 14\u20135 lead. However, Renegades showed that it could compete with the best and put up ten unanswered to suddenly take a 15\u201314 lead before Astralis tied it up and the game headed to overtime. Renegades then continued its streak and then took down the Danish giants in map one. Renegades then took a 9-6 halftime lead on Nuke, a map Astralis had not lost in over a year. However, Astralis's defense combined with some big mistakes from Renegades completely shut down whatever the Oceanic team had to offer and Astralis cruised in the second half. Astralis did not look back in the third map and dominated and the Danes were the first team to the playoffs; in addition, Lukas \"gla1ve\" Rossander's team was the first team to beat Renegades during this Katowice run, as dev1ce and Peter \"dupreeh\" Rothmann were instrumental in the victory. BIG looked to end ENCE's Major hopes as the German team completely ran over the Finns. BIG then took a 14\u201310 lead on Train, but ENCE managed to take six straight to close out the game to edge by BIG 16\u201314. ENCE then took a big 11\u20134 lead.

Despite Liquid limiting s1mple, Egor \"\" Vasilyev stepped up with 26 kills. However, Liquid's teamwork proved to be more effective, with its newest acquisition Jake \"Stewie2K\" Yip leading the way with 21 kills and Jonathan \"EliGE\" Jablonowski followed up also with 21 kills as Liquid barely sneaked by. The second map also featured a close first half, as Liquid only lead 8\u20137. Even though s1mple stepped up compared to the last map, Liquid's terrorist side was too much for Na'Vi to handle as Liquid was the second team to move on. The last series of day two was a thriller between NRG and compLexity. On Nuke, NRG had an 8\u20137 lead while in the terrorist side, meaning its second half would be on the much more favored side. However, despite a good start, NRG could not follow through as stanislaw put up big numbers, ending the game with 45 kills. The game headed to double overtime, where compLexity pulled out the upset. On Cache, NRG once again had an 8\u20137 lead while on the less favored side.

Vitality's terrorist side in the second half then took over and NBK- and his team tied up the series at one. After a close first half, Renegades suddenly took a 14\u20137 lead. Vitality looked like it could make up the deficit with five in a row, but Renegades were able to close out the map. With Renegades moving on, Gratisfaction was the first New Zealander to become a Legend and his four teammates were the first Australians to become Legends. Danylo \"Zeus\" Teslenko lead Na'Vi to another as the CIS team dismantled AVANGAR. Although electronic had a subpar game, and s1mple continued to put up good performances and Na'Vi advanced. MIBR took a 10\u20135 lead on Train, but was on the much more favored side, giving NiP a chance. However, NiP could not get anything going in the second half, which started with a Fernando \"fer\" Alvarenga and Jo\u00e3o \"\" Vasconcellos embracing his new role. MIBR continued with a 6\u20130 lead, but NiP brought it back within three rounds by then end of the half. NiP then took the lead at 11-9 and then 14\u201312.

However, Aleksib's 31 kills were able to help ENCE defeat G2 in the first map. ENCE then jumped to a 12\u20135 lead in the second map. G2 had some momentum starting then, but the Finns were able to win out the map and the series to stay alive in the tournament. compLexity started very strong against FaZe as it took a 11\u20134 lead at the half. FaZe had a good start to the second half, but compLexity's team effort allowed the North American squad to take the first map. On verge of pulling off another upset, compLexity took a 5\u20133 lead, but FaZe pulled it back to win out the half 9\u20136. Although stanislaw and Ricky \"Rickeh\" Mulholland gave FaZe some trouble, the Europeans tied the series up at one. The third map would prove to be a thriller. After compLexity took an 10\u20137 lead, FaZe started to crawl back and take the lead at 13\u201310. Lead by Jordan \"n0thing\" Gilbert's crucial plays, compLexity took back the lead at 14\u201313. NiKo then went on a tear and put FaZe behind his back as he overcame compLexity's defense and FaZe barely survived to the next day. After HellRaisers took an early lead, Cloud9 jumped back into the game and took a 9-6 halftime lead. HellRaisers struggled in the second half as Cloud9 easily took the first map. In the second map, Cloud9 continued to perform and took an 11\u20134 lead. However, seven unanswered from HellRaisers suddenly tied up the game.

ENCE then jumped out to a 15\u20139 lead and close out the map with a brief scare after AVANGAR took three more rounds. Train started out well for AVANGAR, but ENCE's terrorist side, lead by allu, took over the half. AVANGAR's struggled continued as it could not take a single gun round in the second half and ENCE cruised to the playoffs after starting 0\u20132. Vitality and NiP started on Cache, historically a good NiP map, and it showed why as the Swedes took 11 rounds on the less favored side in the first half. Vitality took the first three rounds of the half, but with dennis stepping up for his team, NiP was easily able to take the win. NiP took the pistol and anti-economy rounds in the second map, but Vitality put up 11 rounds of its own, but the French did start on the more favored side, giving NiP a silver lining. However, Vitality quickly reached 15 rounds and then won the game after NiP took four more rounds. NiP rebounded as it took a massive 14\u20131 lead at the half. Vitality made a comeback look possible it took six rounds, but NiP was able to close it out and move on to the playoffs, with dennis leading the way with 23 kills. The first map between FaZe and Cloud9 looked like a blowout, as FaZe took a 12\u20133 lead and then a 15\u20134 lead. However, everyone on Cloud9 started contributing and mounted a massive comeback. In the end, a fake execute by FaZe on the B bombsite when the team was going A opened up an avenue for FaZe and the European squad just barely denied the comeback. FaZe had another strong first half, this time at 11\u20134. However, Cloud9 started to come back and reached nine rounds, which was capped with an 1 vs 4.

NAF then peeked to the catwalk area and flicked onto sergej and then hid inside a smoke grenade. allu desperately pushed into the smoke, but NAF was there to clutch and Liquid had some life. However, ENCE then took a 15\u201311 lead and Liquid took its final timeout. In the 27th round, Liquid executed to the A bombsite with 1:10 on the clock. sergej was patient enough and peeked at the right time to take down NAF, Stewie2K, and ELiGE before being downed by nitr0. nitr0 tried to fall back, but Aerial was already on the flank to catch him. Twistzz was on the other side of the map during all this and found a headshot onto xseveN. Twistzz had to run into the middle area to try to retrieve the bomb that was dropped by nitr0, but allu found the final kill and ENCE took the first map. Stewie2K had 19 kills to lead Liquid, but sergej and xseveN had 22 each to lead ENCE. Liquid took the pistol round, but ENCE proceeded to win five of the next six rounds to take the lead. In the next round, Liquid executed to the B bombsite with just over fifty seconds left in the round, but xseveN took down Stewie2K trying to open up the site. Aleksib tried to follow up, but Twistzz was there to deny it. xseveN traded Twistzz out, but ELiGE traded xseveN and Liquid had the B bombsite as ELiGE planted the bomb. NAF spotted allu, but allu was quicker to the trigger to give ENCE the man advantage. ELiGE took down Aerial and lit up the other to ENCE members before he died. nitr0 the flashed his way in to kill sergej, who was defusing the bomb. allu was able to trade, but he could not defuse the bomb in time and Liquid found a third. This led Liquid to a winning streak and Liquid was up 10\u20135. ENCE took the first three rounds of the second half, but Liquid took five and it looked like a third map between the two teams. In the 24th round, ENCE was down to potentially its last buy. With under thirty seconds left, Stewie2K caught sergej trying to creep in. xseveN took down ELiGE on the other bombsite about ten second later and then followed up onto Twistzz. Aleksib took down Stewie2K on B. NAF was able to trade out Aleksib, but allu took down nitr0, and ENCE was still alive. This led to a surge in the Finns' offense and then suddenly tied the game and it headed to overtime. Liquid found one round in the first half of overtime, but ENCE took two and then one more to get to map and set point at 18\u201316. Liquid was on the terrorist side in the fifth round of overtime and wanted to head to the A bombsite. The team went up the middle area, but allu was there to catch ELiGE. However, allu was only a distraction for sergej and Aerial to pounce from the other side as nitr0 and NAF went down. Stewie2K was able to take down Aerial, but when he needed to make a play, allu made sure he did not, leaving just Twistzz. Twistzz took down sergej, but allu traded right away, and ENCE pulled off a massive upset. allu dominated with 36 kills. Although Twistzz and ELiGE had 30 kills each, but Liquid could not hold it together. Some have referenced this to another Liquid choke, most notably at MLG Major Championship: Columbus, when Liquid had 15-9 and 15-6 leads against Luminosity Gaming (the current roster of MIBR) and the lost both games in overtime. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !colspan=5| Team Liquid vs. ENCE eSports scores |- ! width=\"181px\"| Team ! width=\"20px\"| Score ! width=\"100px\"| Map ! width=\"20px\"| Score ! width=\"181px\"| Team |- | style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\" | Team Liquid | style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\" | 11 | Mirage | style=\"background: #D0F0C0;\" | 16 | style=\"background: #D0F0C0;\" | ENCE eSports |- | style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\" | Team Liquid | style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\" | 16 | Inferno | style=\"background: #D0F0C0;\" | 19 | style=\"background: #D0F0C0;\" | ENCE eSports |- | Team Liquid | | Overpass | | ENCE eSports |} ====MIBR vs. Renegades==== Renegades were the surprise team of the Major, as it took a map off of Astralis and defeated FaZe Clan. Made in Brazil struggled massively its first match, but soon recovered well and won out the rest of the group stage. MIBR also continued its streak as the only team to become Legends since its Major debut. MIBR has an 8\u20132 record against Renegades that stretched back to when the Brazilians were with SK Gaming. On LAN, MIBR is 4\u20130 against Renegades. 60% of Pick'Em predictions had MIBR winning.

MIBR took an early 5\u20131 lead. In the seventh round, Renegades executed to the A bombsite from the catwalk area, which connects the middle are to the A bombsite. Renegades threw in flashbangs, forcing MIBR to back away from the site and try to retake it. Gratisfaction planted the bomb with about 45 seconds left. fer caught AZR, but Liazz and Gratisfaction found two. coldzera took down jks and Gratisfaction killed fer. coldzera tried to fish for more kills, but Liazz was there to deny it. FalleN did take out Gratisfaction, but he was too far away to find kills and defuse the bomb, so he backed off, giving Renegades a second round. Renegades found three more in the half, but MIBR took a sizable 10\u20135 lead at the half. Renegades took the second half pistol with jks's heroics, giving Renegades a chance to close the gap. Rather than saving for the next round to get better guns, MIBR force bought with the weaker sniper rifle and four pistols. As soon as the round started, FalleN tagged jkaem through the middle doors all the way down to 18 health points. TACO and fer pushed to the A bombsite from the catwalk area and they tagged Liazz all the way to one point of health and MIBR planted the bomb as Renegades fell back and let the Brazilians have the site. AZR tried to push in, but fer found an immediate headshot and followed up onto jks. then took out jkaem and FalleN found a headshot onto Liazz. Gratisfaction found , but an immediate trade from fer made the force buy successful. After that steal, MIBR cruised the rest of the way, winning six consecutive rounds to close out the map. fer had 21 kills to lead the way and coldzera had 20. jks had 17 kills, but the rest of Renegades struggled as MIBR was efficient in the win. Map 2 was on Train, a map MIBR was once considered to be the undisputed best team on, as its counter-terrorist sides were able to shut down anything. However, the Oceanic team did not let history or the last map bother it. Renegades took the first three rounds before MIBR took one. In the fifth round, Renegades was on a low buy and relied on Gratisfaction with his saved AWP to carry the round. However, it was not initially needed as jkaem found two headshots with his upgraded pistol in the desert eagle onto coldzera and before being traded by fer. fer tried to push up later on in the round, but Gratisfaction was there to stop him. TACO found one onto AZR, but Liazz caught him out trying to receive the bomb to FalleN. FalleN found Gratisfaction, but he was sandwiched between the last two Renegades players as jks found the kill, resetting MIBR's economy. This led Renegades to go up 10\u20131, as MIBR could not get the signature AWP onto FalleN. MIBR somewhat recovered with four rounds at the end of the half, but Renegades had a seven-round lead as MIBR went to its counter- terrorist side. MIBR took the first two rounds of the second half, but Renegades took the next round. In the 19th round, TACO found a lot of damage with a high explosive grenade, bringing three players' health points down as Renegades was trying to execute to the B bombsite. TACO then took the fight against jkaem, but AZR traded. took out AZR and coldzera, who was hiding on the B site bomb train, caught jks off guard. killed Liazz and then coldzera swung around to take down Grtisfaction, resetting Renegades's economy. Renegades then struggled as MIBR went from being 4-11 down to going up 15\u201312. In the 28th round, Renegades took a timeout to discuss things over. Three Renegades players were in the Ivy area, which is the longer way to get to the A bombsite from the terrorist spawn, but coldzera was hiding nearby. jkaem did not check the position where coldzera was and he was immediately brought down. coldzera kept shooting and was able to take down Liazz. Gratisfaction tried to trade him out, but FalleN's flashbang blinded him, helping coldzera take down a third player. AZR went in to try to do something about the situation, but coldzera also found him. MIBR tried to give coldzera the ace, but jks was able to take him down. TACO brought jks down low and FalleN finished the series and MIBR moved on to another Major top four. Gratisfaction had a huge first half with 18 kills, but had limited impact in the second half with just 5, although did end up at the top of the server with 24 kills. FalleN continued to put up huge performances on Train and he, TACO, and fer had 23 kills each as the Renegades Cinderella came to an end. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !colspan=5| MIBR vs. Renegades scores |- ! width=\"181px\"| Team ! width=\"20px\"| Score ! width=\"100px\"| Map ! width=\"20px\"| Score ! width=\"181px\"| Team |- | style=\"background: #D0F0C0;\"| MIBR | style=\"background: #D0F0C0;\"| 16 | Dust II | style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| 6 | style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| Renegades |- | style=\"background: #D0F0C0;\"| MIBR | style=\"background: #D0F0C0;\"| 16 | Train | style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| 12 | style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| Renegades |- | MIBR | | Mirage | | Renegades |} ====Astralis vs. Ninjas in Pyjamas==== This set featured a historic rivalry between two legendary cores in the core of dev1ce, dupreeh, and Xyp9x against the core of GeT_RiGhT and f0rest. Astralis came in as unequivocally the best team of 2018 and defending Major champions while NiP reached its first Legends status for the first time since MLG Major Championship: Columbus in 2016. Historically, between the two rosters, Astralis leads 14\u20139, but between the two aforementioned cores, the Danes led 54\u201352. 97% of Pick'Em predictions had Astralis winning.

The bomb tried to make its way out of the apartments area, but two quick headshots onto f0rest and Lekr0 by gla1ve denied that. Xyp9x killed GeT_RiGhT and gla1ve took down dennis and Astralis swept away the pistol round. This would set the tone for the rest of the half as Astralis put up a 15-0 scoreline. In the second half pistol, Astralis was the only team to 16-0 any team at a Major, including one against Cloud9 this tournament, and looked to add a third. In the 16th round, Lekr0 took an aggressive position in the apartments area as Astralis was going B and was caught out early, falling to dupreeh. f0rest traded out gla1ve. dev1ce then found two very quick kills onto dennis and GeT_RiGhT, making it look like another 16\u20130. However, during all this, REZ was hiding near the van area, which is next to the apartments area. dupreeh tried to plant the bomb, but REZ sneaked up and killed dupreeh and Xyp9x in succession then won a fight against dev1ce. Magisk was able come from the apartments area and finally take REZ down, but f0rest won the long range fight from catwalk and NiP got its first. The success would be limited, however, as the Swedes only got one more before Astralis got the one round it needed. Magisk led the way with 23 kills in the stomp. Only Lekr0 had at least ten kills on NiP. Fortunes did not look bright for NiP as to fell to an 8\u20131 deficit on Dust II. The team finally picked up two heading into the twelfth round. With under 45 seconds left, Astralis executed to the A bombsite. f0rest was able to take dupreeh from the counter- terrorist spawn, which is essentially right under the A bombsite, before being traded by Xyp9x. Lekr0 found dev1ce and gla1ve found GeT_RiGhT. Lekr0 missed a crucial shot onto Magisk, which allowed Xyp9x to punish. The bomb was planted and then dennis found Magisk. gla1ve peeked out to find dennis, but REZ caught Xyp9x in the long area, which leads from the terrorist spawn to the A bombsite. REZ ran up to the A bombsite, but gla1ve was there to take him down and Astralis took the round. The Danes led 11\u20134 at the half. It looked like a clean sweep, but NiP went on a run, winning seven of the next nine rounds, and only down 13\u201311. In round 25, dennis quickly went up the catwalk area and took down the unwary dev1ce and Xyp9x to singlehandedly take over the A bombsite. gla1ve took down GeT_RiGhT in the long area and Lekr0 was downed by dupreeh. f0rest was able to kill gla1ve after the bomb was planted. Astralis was forced away and NiP had reset Astralis's economy. The Ninjas then went up 14\u201313, but Astralis regained the lead at 15-14 thanks to some clutch plays by Xyp9x. In the 30th round, NiP was on a very low but desperate buy with just pistols and f0rest's saved AWP from the last round. dupreeh went very aggressive in the tunnels area, which leads from the terrorist spawn to the B bombsite, as NiP was prepared to execute to the site, and it paid off as he took down dennis. Xyp9x killed f0rest before REZ killed dupreeh. Magisk was in the corner of the B bombsite and took down Lekr0 before being traded by REZ. GeT_RiGhT planted the bomb, but REZ died to Xyp9x. GeT_RiGhT tried to play some tricks and hid in a smoke, but Xyp9x fished him out and Astralis booked a spot in the semifinals against MIBR. REZ had 21 kills and f0rest had 19 for NiP, but Xypyx's 22 kills led the server as Astralis just about edged out the Swedes. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !colspan=5| Astralis vs. Ninjas in Pyjamas scores |- ! width=\"181px\"| Team ! width=\"20px\"| Score ! width=\"100px\"| Map ! width=\"20px\"| Score ! width=\"181px\"| Team |- | style=\"background: #D0F0C0;\"| Astralis | style=\"background: #D0F0C0;\"| 16 | Mirage | style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| 2 | style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| Ninjas in Pyjamas |- | style=\"background: #D0F0C0;\"| Astralis | style=\"background: #D0F0C0;\"| 16 | Dust II | style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| 14 | style=\"background: #FFCCCC;\"| Ninjas in Pyjamas |- | Astralis | | Overpass | | Ninjas in Pyjamas |} ===Semifinals=== ====Natus Vincere vs. ENCE eSports==== The fan favorite in ENCE took on the CIS giants in Natus Vincere. Na`Vi did not have too much trouble handling FaZe Clan, which included only allowing one round in the second half of the second half. Meanwhile, ENCE pulled off one of the biggest upsets in Major history as the Finns took down Team Liquid in a sweep.

Zeus was able to trade out xseveN from the connector area, which connects the A and B sites. allu desperately tried to plant the bomb with four seconds left, and was able to, but did not have time to adjust to a creeping Zeus, who defused the bomb. The following round, ENCE took a timeout. The Finns burst out of the terrorist connector and took down three Na`Vi players in exchange for one of their own. Zeus and s1mple tried to save their weapons because the team had a low economy, but ENCE was able to steal them away. ENCE recovered to a 7-8 halftime score. Na`Vi would make it 14\u201310 advantage in the second half. About thirty seconds into the round, Aerial took out in the terrorist connector. In the ivy area, which is the longest way to the A bombsite from the terrorist spawn, electronic tried to creep in, but xseveN won the duel. xseveN tried to back out, but Zeus traded. Zeus tried to plant the bomb, but Aerial was close by to deny it with less than twenty seconds in the round. With a significant disadvantage and time running low, Edward and s1mple backed off to save their weapons. This would be a huge turning point as ENCE came back all the way to stun Na`Vi 16\u201314 to take the first map. Although s1mple had 23 kills, sergej led all players with 26. Na`Vi took a 2\u20130 lead and then a 7\u20131 lead on Dust II. ENCE took another round by running out the time. In the tenth round, Na`Vi made a very quick play.

Zeus them followed up onto xseveN despite being on very low health before a high explosive grenade took down the Na`Vi captain.
