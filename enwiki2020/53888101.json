    "text": "Compassion is the second studio album by British electronic music artist Forest Swords, released on 5 May 2017. The album is Forest Swords' second, following 2013's Engravings. The first single from the album, \"The Highest Flood\", was released on 7 March 2017. Compassion was announced on 30 March 2017, and accompanied by another track from the album, \"Arms Out\", featuring a video directed by Sam Wiehl and Forest Swords himself. On 26 April 2017, a third track, \"Panic\", was released, again with a video directed by the artist. A further single featuring two tracks from the Compassion album recording sessions - \"Congregate\" and \"Free\" - was released on 28 September, with all proceeds going to relief work in Mexico and Puerto Rico. http://www.factmag.com/2017/09/28/forest-swords-single-raise-money-relief- mexico-puerto-rico-congregate-free/ In an interview with Fact, Barnes talked about the hybrid of digital and analog sounds used to create the record, noting that computer-generated instruments and digital processing on recordings blur the lines between \"real and fake\" on the record, drawing parallels between his music making techniques and the current affairs trend of 'fake news' in the media. Barnes cited \"communication\" as a central theme of the record, claiming \"It's what I like exploring musically as well, sometimes you can say quite a lot with an instrumental part that you maybe can't say with language or lyrics that are prescriptive.\" ==Artwork and design== Barnes has a background in graphic design, and designed all the artwork for the album himself. In an interview with The Vinyl Factory, he said he chose the album\u2019s cover photograph because \u2018It just seemed to sum up what I try and make with the music: something that\u2019s timeless\u2026 and something that veers between different emotions\u2019, describing it as a \u2018visual metaphor\u2019 for the \u2018feel and themes of the record\u2019. Barnes describes a book on Francis Bacon\u2019s paintings and \u2019the photos they found on his studio floor by John Deakin\u2019 as a \u2018singular\u2026 style reference for the artwork\u2019 on Compassion. The art booklet that accompanies the deluxe edition of the album includes a variety of found images sourced from \u2018old books and magazines\u2019. Many of the images are \u2018portraits of people who\u2019d emigrated\u2019 through Barnes\u2019 \u2018home port\u2019 of Liverpool in the early 1900s. == Critical reception == At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, Compassion received an average score of 82, based on 15 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Q magazine gave the album a score of 4 out of 5 and said it \"unfolds like a journey through a bustling soundscape of found sounds, instrumental loops and post-dubstep production\".
