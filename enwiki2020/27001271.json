It has developed the airport named as Kazi Nazrul Islam International Airport.

The airport city is constructed around an old airfield RAF Station Andal and used by the RAF in Andal, and also by the USAAF during World War II. On 7 September 2007, the Union Civil Aviation Ministry and the West Bengal government announced plans to set up a new airport \u2013 along with a township, IT and logistics hub \u2013 at Durgapur subdivision. Marking the start of the Aerotropolis Project in Andal, the Andal Aerotropolis Project is spread over approximately in the Asansol Durgapur Planning Area (ADPA) of Burdwan District in West Bengal. Bestowed with premium facilities and unparalleled opportunities in the fields of power-intensive industries, mining, iron and steel, metalwork, engineering, petrochemicals, Information Technology (IT) and telecommunications, ADPA has proved to be an ideal destination for investors.
