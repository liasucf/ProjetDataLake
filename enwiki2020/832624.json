He helped rebuild the power of the empire by rooting out corruption and reorganizing the Ottoman army. As he introduced these changes, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc also expanded the borders of the empire, defeating the Cossacks, the Hungarians, and most impressively, the Venetians. K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc's effectiveness was matched by his reputation. He founded the city of K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc (now Veles, North Macedonia) in Rumelia, where his eldest son, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed, was born.Rahmi Tekin, Osmanli Atlasi, Istanbul 2003 ==Biography== ===Early life=== He was born in the village of Rudnik in the Sanjak of Berat, Albania to Albanian parents. He entered the sultan's service as a dev\u015firme youth and was trained in the palace school. K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc began as a kitchen boy in the imperial kitchen before transferring to the imperial treasury and then the offices of the palace chamberlain. Other officials reportedly found it difficult to work with K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc, and he was transferred to the sipahi (cavalry) corps in the provinces. ===Rise through the imperial service=== He was first stationed in the town of K\u00f6pr\u00fc in northern Turkey, which was later named Vezirk\u00f6pr\u00fc in his honour. He quickly rose in rank, keeping the name K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc, meaning from K\u00f6pr\u00fc. K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc's former mentor, H\u00fcsrev Pasha, rose in the imperial service and promoted K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc to increasingly important offices. When H\u00fcsrev was assassinated, however, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc built up his own following. He eventually held important offices as head of the market police in Constantinople, supervisor of the Imperial Arsenal, chief of the Sipahi corps, and head of the corps armorers. K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc managed to attach himself to powerful men and somehow survived their falls without being destroyed himself. K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc continued to hold important offices. He eventually rose to the rank of pasha and was appointed the beylerbey (provincial governor) of the Trebizond Eyalet in 1644. Later he was to rule the provinces of E\u011fri in 1647, of Karaman in 1648, and of Anatolia in 1650. He served as vizier of the divan for one week in 1652 before being dismissed due to the constant power struggle within the palace. Over the years, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc had cultivated many friendships at the sultan's court, especially with the Queen Mother Turhan Hatice Sultan , mother of the minor sultan Mehmed IV. In 1656, the political situation in Ottoman Empire was critical. The war in Crete against the Venetians was still continuing. The Ottoman Navy under Kapudan Pasha (grand admiral) Kenan Pasha, in May 1656, was defeated by the Venetian and Maltese navy at the Battle of Dardanelles (1656) and the Venetian navy continued the blockade of the \u00c7anakkale Straits cutting the Ottoman army in Crete from Constantinople, the state capital. There was a political plot to unseat the reigning Sultan Mehmed IV led by important viziers including the Grand Mufti (\u015eeyh\u00fclislam) Hocazade Mesut Efendi. This plot was discovered, and the plotters were executed or exiled. The Mother Sultana Turhan Hatice conducted consultations and the most favored candidate for the post of Grand Vizier came out as the old and retired but experienced K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha. Mehmed Efendi, the chief of scribes, and the chief architect convinced the sultan that only K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha could avert disaster. ===Grand Vizier=== The Ottoman Empire reached the peak of its expansion during the administration of the K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc household. K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc was called to Istanbul, where he accepted the position of Grand Vizier on 14 September 1656. As a condition of his acceptance, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc demanded that the sultan decree only what K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc approved, allow him to make all the appointments and dismissals, and refuse to hear or accept any malicious stories that might be spread about him. He was given extraordinary powers and political rule without interference, even from the highest authority of the Sultan. K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc had acquired the reputation of being an honest and able administrator, but he was 80 years old when he assumed office. As the Grand Vizier, his first task was to advise Sultan Mehmed IV to conduct a life of hunts and traveling around the Balkans and to reside in the old capital of Edirne, thus stopping his direct political involvement in the management of the state. On 4 January 1657, the household cavalry Sipahi troops in Constantinople started a rebellion and this was cruelly suppressed by K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha with the help of Janissary troops. The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople was proven to be in treasonous contacts with the enemies of Ottoman state and K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha approved of his execution. Rivals and unfriendly religious leaders were banished or executed. The support of the Janissaries was obtained once he was secure in his office. K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc centralized power in the empire, reviving traditional Ottoman methods of governing. He ordered those who were suspected of abusing their positions or who proved to be corrupt to be removed or executed. Those who failed at their tasks were punished severely, and unsuccessful military commanders often paid the supreme price. When Grand Admiral Topal Mehmed Pasha failed to break the Venetian blockade of the Dardanelles on 17 July 1657, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc executed him and his principal officers on the spot. When rivals complained to Mehmed IV about the Grand Vizier's methods, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc resigned, complaining that the Sultan had violated their agreement. Mehmed immediately asked K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc to return as Grand Vizier, because his methods showed such success at restoring Ottoman power. ===War with Venice=== Battle of the Dardanelles on 19 July 1657. Since the resurgence of the Republic of Venice was the immediate crisis that had prompted K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc's appointment as grand vizier, it was important that he demonstrate his effectiveness as a leader against the Venetians. He started on a military expeditions against the Venetian blockade of Dardanelles Straits. The Ottoman navy had a victory against Venice in the Battle of the Dardanelles on 19 July 1657. This allowed Ottomans to regain some of the Aegean islands, including Bozcaada and Limni (15 November) and to open the sea-supply routes to the Ottoman Army still conducting the sieges of Crete. ===War with Transylvania and the Habsburgs=== In 1658 he conducted a successful campaign in Transylvania. In Transylvania, Prince George II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi renounced his erstwhile allegiance to the sultan. He attempted to make his state into a major power, allying himself with other Protestant princes in an attempt to conquer Hungary and Poland. While R\u00e1k\u00f3czi invaded Poland in 1657, however, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc sent the Crimean Tatars to attack Transylvania. They forced R\u00e1k\u00f3czi to retreat from Poland, but he refused to resume his obedience to the sultan. In response, in 1658, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc himself led a large Ottoman army into Transylvania. This force defeated R\u00e1k\u00f3czi and forced him to flee to Habsburg lands. War with Habsburgs continued, but Ottoman control over Transylvania was confirmed in a temporary peace. He also annexed Yanova (Jen\u00f6) on 1 August 1660 and V\u00e1rad on 27 August. === Revolt of Abaza Hasan Pasha === K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha's campaign against Transylvania was cut short by the large-scale revolt of several eastern provincial governors under the leadership of Abaza Hasan Pasha, then the governor of Aleppo. The rebels opposed K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed's violent purges of the military and demanded that he be killed. However, Sultan Mehmed IV remained steadfast in his support for K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc and dispatched an army against the rebels under the command of Murtaza Pasha, who was then guarding the Safavid frontier. Despite assembling a force of 30,000 men and defeating Murtaza Pasha in battle, the harsh winter and fading morale eventually forced the rebels to capitulate. Abaza Hasan's revolt was finally brought to an end in February 1659 with the assassination of all the rebel commanders in Aleppo, despite promises that they would be spared. ===Ayazmakapi Fire=== In July 1660 there was a big fire in Istanbul (the Ayazmakapi Fire) causing great damage to persons and buildings, leading later to a food scarcity and plague. K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha became personally involved in the reconstruction affairs. The honesty and integrity in conducting state affairs by K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed Pasha is shown by an episode in this task.Sakaoglu, 281 The burnt-out Jewish quarters from the Ayazmakapi Fire were decided to be compulsorily purchased by the state. ===Death and legacy=== Despite K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc's advanced age, he continued to display energy until the end of his life. When he fell mortally ill in 1661, the sultan came to his bedside. K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc convinced him to appoint his son, K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Faz\u0131l Ahmed Pasha, as the next grand vizier. He also allegedly advised the sultan never to take advice from a woman, never to appoint a minister who was too wealthy, to always keep the treasury full, and to always keep the army on the move. K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc died on 31 October 1661. He left behind a well-tuned administrative machine, having restored to the Ottoman Empire its reputation for military aggressiveness and its former prestige and power internally and externally. K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc Mehmed's victories in Transylvania would push the Ottoman border closer to Austria. ==See also== * K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc era * K\u00f6pr\u00fcl\u00fc family * List of Ottoman Grand Viziers ==References== * N.
