    "text": "An example of the modern merging of ceremonial magic and technology; a videoconference allows participants to practice the ritual when not physically in person Technopaganism is the use of modern technology or music within neopaganism and magical ritual. This can include the substitution of technology for traditional magical tools, such as using their oven for a hearth, keeping a \"Disk of Shadows\" instead of a \"Book of Shadows\", and using a laser pointer as a wand. In other practice, technology is the target of the magical work, such as the use of stones and other charms to help improve the performance of mundane items or online role-playing avatars. Modern tribal and urban primitive movements such as urban shamanism and rave culture are associated with electronic dance music. Technopaganism deals with spiritual and magical facets of technology and technological society. Associated with this is the use of technological metaphors (most often computer or telecommunications metaphors) to describe spiritual phenomena, as well as the use of symbolism from popular culture in spiritual contexts.Steven Vedro, \"teleconsciousness\" == Beliefs == When used to describe belief systems, technopaganism focuses on the spiritual side of technology. This can include the belief that technological items and artifacts of modern living - such as buildings, roads, parks, cars, and other such items - have pseudo-spirits, or totem spirits, of their own. This also extends to cities. One belief that faces substantial objections is that the Internet itself is attaining a unique spirit. Indeed, it is the stated objective of the creator of VRML to bring about the merging of the spiritual world with the physical world. ==In popular culture== In the TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the major character Jenny Calendar is a technopagan. ==References== == Further reading == *Erik Davis.
