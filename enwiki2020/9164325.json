    "text": "Raymond Bernard (10 October 1891 \u2013 12 December 1977) was a French film director and screenwriter whose career spanned more than forty years. He is best remembered for several large-scale historical productions, including the silent films Le Miracle des loups (The Miracle of the Wolves) and Le Joueur d'\u00e9checs (The Chess Player) and in the 1930s Les Croix de bois (Wooden Crosses) and a highly regarded adaptation of Les Mis\u00e9rables. ==Biography== Raymond Bernard was born in Paris in 1891, the son of the author and humorist Tristan Bernard and younger brother of the playwright Jean-Jacques Bernard. He began his career as an actor appearing on stage in plays written by his father, including Jeanne Dor\u00e9 (1913) alongside Sarah Bernhardt (also filmed in 1916).Richard Abel. French Cinema: the First Wave 1915-1929. Princeton University Press, 1984. p.546 In 1917 Bernard began to work behind the camera as assistant to Jacques Feyder at Gaumont and then continued as a director, principally adapting plays by his father.Cin\u00e9-Ressources.

In these popular entertainments, he soon gained experience of working with leading performers such as Max Linder and Charles Dullin.Dictionnaire du cin\u00e9ma fran\u00e7ais des ann\u00e9es vingt (1895): Raymond Bernard profile, 1895.revues.org; retrieved 6 October 2014. In 1924 Bernard embarked upon a new style of film, the historical spectacle, with Le Miracle des loups set in 15th century France in the reign of Louis XI. This proved to be not only the most expensive film of its day but also one of the most profitable.Lenny Borger. Programme notes for a Thames Television live presentation of The Chess Player, London, 1990. Bernard's ability to combine dramatic narrative with spacious settings and large numbers of performers was utilised in the two remaining productions of his silent film career, Le Joueur d'\u00e9checs (1927) and Tarakanova (1930). Bernard's film-making in the sound era continued for nearly three decades. Further large-scale productions included his film about the First World War, Les Croix de bois (1932), and a three-part adaptation of Victor Hugo's Les Mis\u00e9rables (1934) which was nearly five hours in length. In his later films he returned to more modest projects and budgets including a number of sophisticated comedies. During the wartime Occupation of France, Bernard as a Jew was obliged to remain in hiding and his film-making ceased until the end of the war. He retired from film-making in 1958, but in the 1970s, when he was in his 80s, he was able to supervise the reconstruction of Les Mis\u00e9rables which had been severely truncated in the 1940s for easier distribution. In 1977, shortly after the broadcast of a nearly complete version on French television, Bernard died aged 86.Michael Koresky. Raymond Bernard, criterion.com; retrieved 6 October 2014.
