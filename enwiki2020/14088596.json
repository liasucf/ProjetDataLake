    "text": "Soan papdi (also known as patisa, san papri, sohan papdi or shonpapdi) is a popular Indian dessert. It is usually cube-shaped or served as flakes, and has a crisp and flaky texture. It was traditionally sold loose in a rolled paper cone, but modern industrial production has led it to be sold in tightly formed cubes. With the popularity of the sweet, newer flavors such as mango, strawberry, pineapple and chocolate have been added. ==History== Soan papdi is said to have originated specifically in Western state Maharashtra; and spread across Gujarat, Punjab, and Rajasthan states. The Indian state Uttar Pradesh also has been proposed as potential origin of the sweet. ==Ingredients== Its main ingredients are sugar, gram flour, flour, ghee, milk,and cardamom. ==See also== *Sohan (confectionery) *Sohan halwa *Pi\u015fmaniye, a similar Turkish sweet ==References== ==External links== * Annotated video recipe illustrates traditional hand-made technique for creating Soan Papdi's crisp multi-layers (filmed at Shreya's Sweets Hampankatta, Mangalore); \u00b7Permaculturetravel\u00b7 YouTube Channel * Demonstration of modern mechanized equipment in the making of pi\u015fmaniye, a related Turkish confection Category:Indian desserts Category:Pakistani desserts Category:Cookies Category:Chickpea dishes ",
