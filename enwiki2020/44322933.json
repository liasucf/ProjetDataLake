    "text": "Bao Junhui (; ) was a late eighth-century Chinese poet. She came from a respected family during the Tang dynasty and achieved fame as a poet during the reign of Emperor Dezong (779-804). ==Poetry== Bao Junhui and other talented women, such as the five Song sisters, were invited to reside in the palace as scholars who were held in great esteem. She, like many of the other respected poets who resided in the palace, was called upon to write poetry during special occasions, including banquets. She was considered to be as talented as the five Song sisters. The little known about Bao Junhui comes from a memorial she presented to the emperor asking for permission to leave the palace to care for her aged mother: ==Notable poems== Notable poems by Bao Junhui:Chang, Kang-i Sun, Haun Saussy, and Charles Yim-tze Kwong. \"Bao Junhui.\" Women Writers of Traditional China an Anthology of Poetry and Criticism.

Meet for tea in the East Pavilion \u2013 clear views, in four directions. Staring far: the moat round the walls, see it in the mountains\u2019 colors. Looking down: strings and pipes, hear them in watery sounds. Deep bamboo thickets pull at the pond, and spout a lush new green. Sweet hibiscus draw down the eaves; soon they\u2019ll burst out red. Linger, sitting amid all this \u2013 high spirits, boundless, rise. And more love now, for this round fan that gives off cooling winds. ===Sung Out in Sympathy for Flowers=== Flowers on a branch; someone beneath the flowers. A blush on both that catches hearts: both are in their spring. Flower-gazing yesterday \u2013 flowers bright with bloom. Flower-gazing at dawn today \u2013 flowers soon to fall. Best drain it dry, this joy, this pleasure, underneath the flowers; Don\u2019t wait for those springtime winds to gust them all away. Warblers sing, butterflies dance, bright scenes linger long. Brewing tea on a dark-red stove: pine- flowers loose their scent. Makeup finished, singing ended, done with wandering free, Alone, hold on to a fragrant branch and go back to the cave of your room. ===Moon at the Frontier Pass=== High, sky-high: fall\u2019s moon glitters bright And off in the north illumines Liaoyang\u2019s fort. The border so far, yet that light covers all \u2013 The wind so great, a glory-ring grows round. Soldiers state toward their villages, and brood. Cavalry mounts hear battle drums, and shy. Northern winds blow sorrow through frontier grass, And barbarous sands obscure the enemy camps. Frost crystallizes swords within their scabbards. Winds wear out feathered banners above the steppes. Some day, some day \u2013 reporting near palace towers, No more to hear the clangorous camp-gongs\u2019 clash. ==References== Category:8th-century Chinese poets Category:Tang dynasty poets Category:Chinese women poets Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown ",
