    "text": "The Tour is a live recording album by American R&B; singer Mary J. Blige, released July 28, 1998. The album was recorded from two shows in Los Angeles at the Universal Amphitheater during her Share My World Tour in 1997-1998 in the U.S.. == Critical reception == In a contemporary review for Rolling Stone, Jancee Dunn wrote that The Tour \"deftly captures the energy and exuberance\" of Blige's live shows while calling the singer \"a commanding, self-assured performer\" who \"plays her audience like a damn fiddle\". Entertainment Weekly critic Matt Diehl said while the arrangements were occasionally overwrought, Blige compensated with passionate vocals and impressive covers of classic soul songs, \"blending motifs into each other like an expert DJ\". Robert Christgau deemed the record Blige's \"de facto best-of\" in The Village Voice; he explained in 2003 why it remained his favorite album of hers: ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1998) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |} ==Track listing== #\"Intro\" #\"Real Love\" #\"You Remind Me\" #\"Reminisce\" #\"Sweet Thing\" #\"Mary Jane (All Night Long)\" #\"Love No Limit\" #\"Summer Madness\" #\"My Life\" #\"You Gotta Believe\" #\"Slow Down\" #\"Mary's Joint\" #\"I'm the Only Woman\" #\"Share My World\" #\"I'm Goin' Down\" #\"Thank You Lord\" #\"I Can Love You\" #\"Keep Your Head\" (with Dustin Adams) #\"Everything\" #\"Seven Days\" #\"Not Gon' Cry\" #\"Missing You\" #\"Day Dreaming\" #\"Misty Blue\" #\"A Dream\" (Japanese Bonus Track) ==Personnel== === Musicians === *Mary J.
