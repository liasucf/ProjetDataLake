The championship game was played at Homewood Field in Baltimore, Maryland during May 1999. All NCAA Division I women's lacrosse programs were eligible for this championship. Ultimately, 12 teams were invited to the tournament. Maryland defeated Virginia, 16\u20136, to win their seventh and fifth consecutive, national championship. This was a rematch of the previous year's final, also won by the Terrapins. This would subsequently become the fifth of Maryland's record seven straight national titles (1995\u20132001). Furthermore, Maryland's win secured an undefeated season (21\u20130) for the team. The leading scorer for the tournament, with 16 goals, was Jen Adams from Maryland. Adams was also named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. ==Teams== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Seed ! School ! Conference ! Berth !
