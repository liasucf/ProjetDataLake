He has received 17 awards for comedy and performance, plus a Legends of Industry Award. He is a patron for Scotty's Little Soldiers. ==Early life== Whilst a pupil at The Kingsway School, Stockport in 1989, Simon Gregory entered a search for the part of one of two new cast members to join the ITV soap opera Coronation Street as the 'McDonald Twins'. Fellow Kingsway pupil Nicholas Cochrane was selected out of the class to become Andy McDonald, and a search was on for another class member who had the same height, build and hair colouring as him. As Gregory was the only member of the class to fit these criteria, he was selected and the two were sent for further auditions at Granada Television, where they were selected for the roles. Gregory was initially credited under his real name, but later adopted the stage name 'Gregson' once he was old enough to join Equity, as there was already a member with the name Simon Gregory. ==Coronation Street== Gregson's first appearance in an episode of Coronation Street aired on 6 December 1989 and he currently appears on the soap as a regular cast member. It was announced on 19 September 2015 that Gregson was to take an extended break from the show for personal reasons. He returned to the soap in 2016. ==Guest appearances== In 2009, along with Coronation Street co-star Michelle Keegan, he appeared in the third part of Red Dwarf: Back to Earth as himself.
