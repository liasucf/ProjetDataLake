    "text": "Clayman is the fifth studio album by Swedish metal band In Flames, released via Nuclear Blast on July 3, 2000. It has a dark theme, with most of the lyrics dealing with depression and internal struggles. Clayman is the final In Flames album to feature their original melodic death metal sound. The band would later start to experiment with other styles on their next release, Reroute to Remain, gradually progressing these more experimental elements across their future releases later into the 2000s. The album's cover art is based on Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man drawing. The Jester Head appears in the background, both on the cover, and in the album booklet itself. Music videos were produced for the songs \"Pinball Map\" (directed by Tamara Jordan) and \"Only for the Weak\". ==Reception== In 2005, Clayman was ranked No. 448 in Rock Hard magazine's book \"The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time\". In 2020, \"Bullet Ride\", \"Pinball Map\", \"Only for the Weak\", and the title track were re-recorded for a 20th-anniversary edition of the album. Fan responses to the re-recordings have been mixed. ==Track listing== Apart from remastered versions of the original songs, the 20th Anniversary Edition features the following tracks: ==Personnel== ===In Flames=== *Anders Frid\u00e9n \u2013 vocals *Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte \u2013 lead guitar *Jesper Str\u00f6mblad \u2013 rhythm guitar *Peter Iwers \u2013 bass *Daniel Svensson \u2013 drums ===Additional personnel=== *Charlie Storm \u2013 programming, synthesizer *Christopher Amott (formerly of Arch Enemy) \u2013 guitar solo on \"Suburban Me\" *Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m \u2013 additional programming, synthesizer, recording, production *In Flames \u2013 recording, production *Axel Hermann \u2013 artwork, layout *Tobias Lundgren \u2013 photography ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+Chart performance for Clayman |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== *Details about In Flames albums Category:In Flames albums Category:2000 albums Category:Nuclear Blast albums Category:Albums produced by Fredrik Nordstr\u00f6m ",
