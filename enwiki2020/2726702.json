Victor, born into a Christian family, was a soldier in the Roman Praetorian Guard. After he had destroyed some pagan altars, he was arrested, tortured, and killed around 303. ==Veneration== Statue of St Victor in Museo del Duomo, Milan. Unknown Milanese sculptor, last decade of 15th century Gregory of Tours claimed miracles occurred above his grave; a church was built above the supposed site. His cause was promoted by Saint Ambrose, fourth-century bishop of Milan and numerous churches have been dedicated to him in the city itself and throughout the Diocese of Milan and its neighbours. His memorial day is May 8 in the Roman Catholic Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. ==External links== * The Passion of St. Victor of Milan * http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/52300 * http://www.deon.pl/imieniny/imie,3366,wiktora.html Category:3rd-century births Category:303 deaths Category:Saints from Mauretania Caesariensis Category:3rd- century Berber people Category:4th-century Christian martyrs Category:3rd- century Romans Category:Berber Christians ",
