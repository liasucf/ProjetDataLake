She was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives in 1998, and served until 2009, representing southern Douglas County. Morgan was elected a Douglas County Commissioner in 2008, and was reelected in 2012. In 2015, she filed a lawsuit against Douglas County, arguing term limits on elected officials were unconstitutional. Some residents of the county started a recall effort against Morgan, but the proposal failed because they did not collect enough signatures by the deadline. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1949 births Category:Oregon Republicans Category:Members of the Oregon House of Representatives Category:People from Nanaimo Category:County commissioners in Oregon Category:Women state legislators in Oregon Category:20th-century American politicians Category:21st-century American politicians Category:University of Oregon alumni Category:People from Myrtle Creek, Oregon Category:Lane Community College alumni Category:20th- century American women politicians Category:21st-century American women politicians ",
