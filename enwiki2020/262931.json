Daddy wouldn't buy me a bow-wow! bow wow! I've got a little cat And I'm very fond of that But I'd rather have a bow-wow Wow, wow, wow, wow We used to have two tiny dogs Such pretty little dears But daddy sold 'em 'cause they used To bite each other's ears I cried all day, at eight each night Papa sent me to bed When Ma came home and wiped my eyes I cried again and said Daddy wouldn't buy me a bow-wow! bow wow! Daddy wouldn't buy me a bow-wow! bow wow! I've got a little cat And I'm very fond of that But I'd rather have a bow-wow Wow, wow, wow, wow I'll be so glad when I get old To do just as I \"likes\" I'll keep a parrot and at least A half a dozen tykes And when I've got a tiny pet I'll kiss the little thing Then put it in its little cot And on to it I'll sing Daddy wouldn't buy me a bow-wow! bow wow! Daddy wouldn't buy me a bow-wow! bow wow! I've got a little cat And I'm very fond of that But I'd rather have a bow-wow Wow, wow, wow, wow ==References== Category:1892 songs Category:British songs ",
