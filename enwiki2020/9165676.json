In 2005, the Washington Post considered her Tosca in Washington, D.C. to be \"filled with sparkling, stratospheric moments\", noted that \"here was a pleasing artistry in her singing that merged accurate intonation with an ability to move her sound smoothly across a wide vocal range\" and wrote that \"the top of her soprano voice is nothing less than extraordinary\". Great Britain's The Daily Telegraph reported on Verdi's Macbeth at the London Proms 2007 that Valayre was \"a real find of a Lady Macbeth\" and that she would possess \"the ideal voice for the role: a dramatic soprano with an incisive edge and the dark-tinged richness of a mezzo.\" == Recordings == 1984: \"La Malibran\" Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Marigny, Paris DVD 1991: Raffaello de Banfield: \"Una lettera d'amore di Lord Byron\" Gianfranco Masini; Orchestra Sinfonica dell'Emilia Romagna \"Arturo Toscanini\" CD, Ermitage ERM 403 1991: Felice Lattuada: \"Le preziose ridicole\" Gianfranco Masini; Orchestra Sinfonica dell'Emilia Romagna \"Arturo Toscanini\" CD, Aura Classics 1992: Philippe Hersant: \"Le Chateau des Carpathes\" David Robertson; Orchestre Philharmonique de Montpellier CD, Accord 1995: \"Easter Concert from Paris\" (Jean-Louis Florentz: \"Mary's prayer at Golgotha\") Jean-Jacques Kantorow; Paris Orchestral Ensemble DVD, Goldline Classics 2004: \"La corona di pietra - Gala concert Arena di Verona with Placido Domingo\" (Bellini: finale of \"Norma\") Orchestra Arena di Verona DVD, Sony - BMG 2006: Giuseppe Verdi: \"Macbeth\" Bruno Bartoletti; Orchestra del Teatro Regio di Parma DVD, TDK Music 2007: Christmas Album (Sylvie Valayre sings the traditional \"What Child is This?\") Camerata of London CD, MSM-CD == External links == ===Links to audio and video examples === Audio: *\"In questa reggia\" (Turandot) from Berlin 2003 *\"Vissi d'Arte\" (Tosca) from Washington D.C. 2005 *\"Qui Radam\u00e8s verr\u00e0\" (Aida), Munich 2006 *\"Surta \u00e8 la notte\" (Ernani) from Berlin 2006 *Link to many new audio files (among others Nabucco, a complete recording of Otello and Turandot from 2007 Video: *\"Nel d\u00ec della vittoria\" (Macbeth) from Parma 2006 *\"La luce langue\" (Macbeth) from Parma 2006 *\"Una macchia\" / Sleepwalking (Macbeth) from Parma 2006 *\"Il tuo sangue\" (Tosca) from Tokyo 2000 *\"La mamma morta\" (Andrea Ch\u00e9nier) from Berlin 2006 *\"Surta \u00e8 la notte\" (Ernani), Madrid 2000 *\"Da quel d\u00ec\" (Ernani), Madrid 2000 - with Carlos Alvarez as Don Carlo *\"Prode guerrier\" (Nabucco), Arena di Verona 2000 *\"Ben io t'invenni ...
