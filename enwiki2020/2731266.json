It was designed by Dennis Livson, and located on the island of Kailo next to the old town of Naantali, in Southwest Finland. The blueberry-coloured Moomin House is the main attraction of the park, where guests are allowed to go to all five storeys. Hemulen's house is located next to the Moomin House.
