    "text": "The Sittard diphthongization (after Dols, 1953) extends into the German municipality Selfkant The Sittard dialect (, ) is a Limburgish dialect spoken mainly in the Dutch city of Sittard. It is also spoken in Koningsbosch and in a small part of Germany (Selfkant), but quickly becoming extinct there. Of all other important Limburgish dialects, the dialect of Sittard is most closely related to that of the . ==Characteristics== The Sittard dialect belongs to , which means it has a postalveolar consonant at the onset of words beginning with clusters such as sl and st, in contrast with other variants of Limburgish such as Maastrichtian and in Dutch. The most important characteristic which distinguishes the dialect of Sittard from adjacent Limburgish dialects is the so-called Sittard diphthongization, i.e. the replacement of the close-mid monophthongs ee, eu and oo with the wide diphthongs ei, ui and ou in some words such as neit (\"not\"), veil (\"fall\") beier (\"beer\") and awd (\"old\"). It is largely the same as the Polder Dutch phenomenon in Standard Dutch, though it does not affect the original closing diphthongs and it is extended to the environment before (where an epenthetic schwa is inserted before the consonant). This phenomenon was first examined thoroughly in the first half of the 1940s by Willy Dols, who showed that this Sittard diphthongization typically occurred in syllables with a push tone. New research at the beginning of the 21st century has shown that the diphthongization once served to emphasize the difference in vowel length which distinguishes syllables with a push tone from those with a dragging tone.http://www.let.ru.nl/gep/carlos/dols43.pdfCarlos Gussenhoven Over het waarom van de Sittardse diftongering Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen in DutchDe Sittardse Diftongering Willy Dols Stichting ==Phonology== ===Vowels=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:aut\" |+Vowel phonemesGebruikte tekens in het Sittards Willy Dols StichtingOn-Nederlandse klinkers Willy Dols Stichting ! rowspan=\"3\" | ! colspan=\"4\" | Front ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" | Central ! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" | Back |- ! colspan=\"2\" | ! colspan=\"2\" | |- ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |- align=\"center\" !
