Directed by Emmanuel Q. Palo and Trina N. Dayrit, the series stars Royal Princess of Drama Julia Montes in a dual role, as Kara Acosta and Sara Suarez, together with an ensemble cast consisting of Carmina Villarroel, Mylene Dizon, Ariel Rivera, Allen Dizon, Sam Milby, Alicia Alonzo, Edgar Allan Guzman, and John Lapus. This season marks the beginning of the second book of the series. The fourth season of Doble Kara is about Kara and Sara, and how they will both start to experience motherhood as they are pregnant. Sara goes to Japan to search for Edward but failed and decided to do everything for her daughter instead. Both babies are born and Kara's daughter's name is Isabella and Sara's is Rebecca. Twists change then when Rebecca tragically died because of premature labor. A suspect will give Sara, Kara's daughter and she will raise her as her own. Things become even worse for them both as Sara returns to the Suarez family and Alex continues her agenda to ruin them. ==Plot == Later on, Lucille (Carmina Villarroel) was again charged with temporary restraining order but as a wedding gift, the new couple is given many presents including Lucille's which is thought to be a bomb and Barbara (Alicia Alonzo) knows this, so she protected her daughter by imprisoning her again. A deranged Lucille who keeps on seeing Antonio (Allen Dizon) as an apparition continues with her agenda in ruining the Suarez and taking Kara (Julia Montes) back to her arms. Barbara, upon noticing her daughter's unstable state, persistently protects her. Sara (Julia Montes) is alone after being left by Edward (Edgar Allan Guzman) and the twins, after making up with their boyfriends, are revealed to be carrying babies. Lucille, desperate to retrieve back her only daughter and sole memory of Antonio, committed a crime of arson and set the house of the Suarez on fire. She was later pleaded guilty for the crimes she deliberately committed including the accident experienced by the Suarez during their holiday vacation. Instead of imprisoning her, Lucille was instituted by the court in a mental hospital as she was suffering from a late-onset schizophrenia. Hoping to find Edward, the father of her unborn child, Sara went to Japan, but failed miserably just as Chloe (Patricia Javier), believing that Sara would only bring her son misery and pain, led Sara astray and forced Edward to migrate in South Korea. Sara, with the help of a friend, decided to work and start her life anew in Japan for her baby instead. Both babies are born, christened as Rebecca and Isabella. However, Sara mourned and grieved as Rebecca shortly died after her birth and just like Lucille's daughter, it is caused by a premature birth brought about by a weak immune system. After the misfortunes Sara had experienced in Japan, she went home to the Philippines, but chose not to return to her family, thinking that she'll only be a hindrance and be judged by her family because of her wrong decisions in life again. While Sara is sorrowfully saddened and hasn't moved on, Kara and Sebastian (Sam Milby) promised to Isabella to protect and support her and be good parents. With all these happenings, Lucille, Alex (Maxene Magalona) and Sara started to suffer their consequences for their evil schemes and actions by having Lucille confined in a mental hospital, Alex being imprisoned and Sara losing her child. Not long after Isabella's few months, she was unfortunately separated from Kara and Sebastian which causes a family problem to the Suarez. Nobody knows who intended to kidnap the child and not stopping to search for her. Isabella was left in front of Sara's house under unknown circumstances and she took maternal care for her. Nowhere else to go, Sara was taken in by Cynthia (Mickey Ferriols) in her Club Felicidad where Sara and Isabella spend over the following years. Six years later, Isabella who's now Rebecca (Krystal Mejes) grew up with gratitude and kindness much like her true parents and Sara will also learn to live with Rebecca without knowing her identity. Kara will also meet Hannah (Myel De Leon) by accident and later developed some form of bonding with Hannah and adopted her as her daughter while Lucille stays in a mental hospital hoping for an acceptance from Kara and be together again. Rebecca will meet Banjo (Rayver Cruz) whom she misleads as her father because of Sara. But they will form a friendship and will treat each other a family. Meanwhile, Alex is slowly brainwashing Kara and Seb\u2019s adoptive daughter, Hannah, and instills in her that she is not well-loved, building hatred in the child\u2019s heart, thus causing her to be evil and vengeful. And their situation gets even more complicated now that Sara has finally returned to her family. Once Sara returns to the Suarez family, Alex starts to put her plan into motion. Alex brainwashes Hannah to do everything that she orders her to and Hannah starts to be as if she was Alex's puppet. Meanwhile, there are problems in the Dela Rosa Foundation, now managed by Kara, due to Lucille's absence and unstable state. Ishmael (Ariel Rivera) starts to suspect and become suspicious of Alex's actions, only annoying Alex greatly. One night when the whole family went to the Club Felicidad to watch Sara's performance, Ishmael followed Alex when she went to her accomplice, Dina (Cristine Yao), to give the money that she was demanding. He overheard Alex and Dina talking, and threatened to call the police after discovering their involvement in Isabella's abduction. This caused Alex and Dina to panic, and Ishmael got hit in the head by Dina. Alex, waking up to her senses, attempted to save Ishmael's life by bringing him to the nearest hospital. But she was threatened and stopped by Dina, causing Ishmael to die in the hospital later that night. The family becomes depressed after Ishmael's sudden death, even Alex, and especially Laura (Mylene Dizon). One night she has a dream of Ishmael in the hospital, she said that he was saying Kara's daughter's name, Isabella, over and over. Meanwhile, Alex realized that she shouldn't care about Kara's family that much and decides to resume her evil schemes of plotting her revenge and becomes part of a syndicate with the help of Dina. She asks her boss for help because Kara starts to become suspicious and starts to search who killed her father and who kidnapped her daughter. Alex's boss hired someone to pretend to be Ishmael's killer, but the one he hired got killed because Alex started to panic because she thought he would admit that he was only hired and that Alex and her connivant were the one who accidentally killed Ishmael. It is unknown to Kara's family and to her that Rebecca is really her long-lost daughter with Sebastian, Isabella Acosta. However, Sara is falsely accused of being a drug pusher and was imprisoned causing Club Felicidad to be closed. Unknown to all of them, this was planned by Sara's evil suitor, Mr. Delgado (Noel Colet). This urged Sara to leave Becca under the care of her family. Kara volunteers to be Rebecca's mother for the meantime while Rebecca decides to pretend as Isabella to make Kara happy. Unknown to them, they are already having a real mother-daughter bonding. Edward returns to make up for all his wrongdoings to Sara and his child, Rebecca. He asked Sara for one more chance to fix their relationship and he tries his best to be a father figure to Rebecca, much to the continuous disapproval of Sara. He never knew that their real child died as an infant back when Sara was in Japan and that Becca was just adopted. Despite Sara's disapproval, Edward never lost hope and continued to apologize to Sara day by day. One day Edward followed Kara and Rebecca to a bookstore, only to find out that Rebecca is accused of stealing a box of crayons because of Hannah's schemes. Edward did his best to save Becca by urging the shop to view the footage to prove Becca was innocent and that Hannah was the real cause of the incident. This was the start of a fatherly relationship between Edward and Becca. But Sara still disapproves of Edward coming back to their lives, causing him to lose hope. Now, Alex decides to use Edward by secretly offering of bringing Becca to see him daily. Edward was hesitant in the beginning because he didn't want to further damage his relationship with Sara, but he eventually accepted the offer and started a connivance with Alex and was hopeless that Sara will never let him bond with his daughter. Edward doesn't realize that he is being used as bait in Alex's plan to destroy Kara and Sara's relationship even further. Sara accepts Edward to be with Becca. == Cast and characters == === Main === * Julia Montes as Kara Dela Rosa-Acosta and Sara Suarez * Carmina Villarroel as Lucille Acosta-Dela Rosa * Mylene Dizon as Laura Hipolito-Suarez * Ariel Rivera as Ishmael Suarez * Sam Milby as Sebastian \"Seb\" Acosta === Supporting === * Allen Dizon as Antonio Dela Rosa * Alicia Alonzo as Barbara Acosta * Edgar Allan Guzman as Edward Ligaya * Gloria Sevilla as Anita * John Lapus as Pacito \"Itoy\" Delgado * Anjo Damiles as Andrew \"Andy\" Delgado * Krystal Mejes as Isabella Acosta / Rebecca \"Becca\" Suarez * Myel De Leon as Hannah Acosta === Recurring === * Rayver Cruz as Banjo Manrique * Mickey Ferriols as Cynthia Manrique aka \"Mother\" * Nash Aguas as Paolo Acosta * Alexa Ilacad as Patricia Hernandez * Alora Sasam as Camille Rose \"CR\" Sanchez * Patricia Javier as Chloe Cabrera * Jason Fernandez as Jhayson * Chrisha Uy as Jessica * Joe Vargas as Elvis * Andrew Gan as Jeremy * Luis Hontiveros as Patrick === Guest === * Maxene Magalona as Alexandra \"Alex\" Acosta * Jerry O'Hara as Atty.
