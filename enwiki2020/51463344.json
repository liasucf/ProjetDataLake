    "text": "Tony Marino (May 18, 1910 \u2013 February 1, 1937) was an American boxer who became the World Bantamweight Champion on June 29, 1936 when he defeated Baltasar Sangchili in a fourteenth-round knockout in New York. Marino had the famous trainer Ray Arcel and managers Reed Brown and Bill Newman. He died on February 1, 1937 of injuries he received from his bout with boxer Carlos Quintana, two days earlier in Brooklyn. On February 3, 1937, the New York State Athletic Commission, citing Marino's death, created the three-knockdown rule, which is now universal in the sport of boxing.\"Knockdown Rule Urged\", Sarasota Herald- Tribune, Sarasota, Florida, pg. 7, 4 February 1937 ==Early life and career== Tony Marino was born into a large and close Italian family on May 18, 1910 in Duquesne, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. Most sources list his birth year as 1912, but his headstone lists it as 1910. Since his brother, Ralph Marino, was born in September 1912, it wouldn't be possible for Tony Marino to have been born in May of that year. His parents, Anthony and Mary, would eventually have ten children, giving Tony a total of six sisters and three brothers. His older brother Charles would take the ringname Tommy Ryan, and become an accomplished boxer himself, competing for the World Bantamweight Title in 1924. Tony was named after his father, who eventually settled the family on South Fifth Street in Duquesne.\"Tony Marino Dies in Bout That was to Be His Last\", The Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 1, 1 February 1937 Marino was known as a studied boxer, not a strong puncher, though he had a good left hand, and a short, but accomplished career. According to one source, Marino fought as many as eighty bouts before becoming a professional, though many were as short as three rounds.Fought as many as eighty amateur bouts in \"Marino Faces Test in Fight Against Marty Gold Tonight\", Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 24, 21 January 1932 As an amateur, Marino represented Pittsburgh at the National tournament in Boston with teammate, Ted Yarosz, also a Pittsburgh area native. Yarosz would take the 1934 NYSAC Middleweight Championship.Marino fought in Nationals as an amateur in \"Marino Expects Tough Battle with Dodge\", Reno Gazette-Journal, Reno, Nevada, pg. 9, 9 August 1934 He fought his first well publicized professional bout at the age of eighteen on July 2, 1930 winning in six rounds against Young Ketchell in North Braddock, Pennsylvania. He beat Ketchell again on May 20, 1932 in an eight-round Unanimous Decision at Stanton Park Arena in Steubenville, Ohio. On March 14, 1932 he decisively defeated Joey Ross in an eight-round Split Decision at Motor Square Garden in Pittsburgh. Marino carried much of the fight with terrific combinations of rights and left hooks, but Ross finished strong, and won the last round, when Marino may have begun to fatigue. At least one reporter at ringside felt Marino had won all but the sixth and eighth rounds.Marino won all but sixth and eighth in \"Red Robinson Halts Bout in Third Round\", The Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 28, 15 March 1932 On January 21, 1932 he defeated Marty Gold at the Palisades Rink in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, in a ten-round points decision. As one of his earliest bouts with a more experienced boxer, the Pittsburgh Post, wrote that Marino had \"met his hardest test, ...and survived it.\" He won the important and well publicized match by a unanimous decision of the judges.\"Marino Tops Gold in Tube City Bout\", The Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 34, 22 January 1932 Marino staggered Gold with a left hook in the sixth, but was warned for low blows in the early rounds. In what was not entirely a one-sided bout, Gold knocked Marino to a sitting posture in the last round though some at ringside considered it one of Gold's few solidly landed blows.Gold knocked Marino down in the last round in \"Marino Beats Marty Gold\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 14, 22 January 1932 ===First bout with Midget Wolgast=== He fought Midget Wolgast for the first time on June 6, 1932, at the Myers Bowl in North Braddock, Pennsylvania, losing in a ten-round points decision. Wolgast had been the NYSAC World Flyweight Boxing Champion in 1930. On October 25 and November 12, 1934, he lost to Filipino boxer Small Montana in ten round points decisions in Sacramento and San Francisco, California. A worthy opponent, in 1935, Montana would take the NYSAC World Flyweight Championship. On April 11, 1936, he received his first of only two knockouts in his career from Willie Felice at Ridgewood Grove in Brooklyn, New York. The knockout occurred in the third round. On May 2, 1936, he showed he could avenge a dominating opponent, winning in a six-round points decision at Ridgewood Grove in New York. New York's Democrat and Chronicle considered the win \"impressive\".\"Tony Marino Gets Nod Over Felice\", Democrat and Chronicle, Rochester, New York, pg. 46, 3 May 1936 Though weighing in six pounds lighter, on March 28, 1936 at Ridgewood Grove in Brooklyn, he defeated Johnny \"Skippy\" Allen in an impressive fourth- round technical knockout.\"Feldman Gains Decision Over Joe Boscarino\", The Indianapolis Star, Indianapolis, Indiana, pg. 18, 29 March 1936 ===Win against Lou Salica=== On June 2, 1936, he defeated Lou Salica, former NYSAC World Bantamweight Title Holder, in Queensboro Arena in New York. He surprised the crowd with an unexpected ten round points decision against the former champion.\"Scores Unexpected Win\" The Pantagraph, Bloomington, Illinois, pg. 10, 3 June 1936 It was a victory that helped Marino rise to greater prominence.The win over Salica was important in \"Marino Starts Remaking Ring Rep At Grove\", Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, pg. 25, 30 October 1936 ==World Bantam Champion== Marino became the World Bantamweight champion on June 29, 1936 when he defeated Spanish boxer Baltasar Sangchili in a close and stunning fourteenth-round knockout in New York. Marino had been down four times in the bout and was well behind in points. In the fourteenth round Marino shot a jarring short left hook to the chin of Sangchili who thought he was close to finishing off Marino. After landing the surprise left, Marino \"rammed a right to the body (of Sangchili) and then shifted his attack to the head, hooking a series of punches with both hands. Sangchili crumpled until he fell over on his face to be counted out.\"Grayson, Harry, \"Cinderella Man Likely To Win Bantam Championship\", The Brownsville Herald, Brownsville, Texas, pg. 18, 15 July 1936 Many in the audience were stunned by the upset, and considered Marino a relative unknown who had fought several previous fights for as little as $40. Marino boxed Sangchili a second time, after his loss of the Bantamweight Championship on October 15, 1936, at Motor Square Garden near his birthplace of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He lost the ten round points decision. ==Loss of Bantam title== Only two months after taking the title, he lost it on August 31, 1936, in a thirteenth round Technical Knockout to Puerto Rican NYSAC World Bantamweight champion Sixto Escobar at Dyckman Oval in Manhattan, New York. As early as the second round, Escobar floored Marino five times for counts of three, eight, four, seven, and five. Finally, the ring physician ordered the bout halted in the thirteenth round because of facial cuts on Marino, particularly a nasty cut over his right eye which bled continuously since the fifth round. His left eye had swelling and a cut above it as well. Marino, going out in championship style, never ceased to cautiously continue the fight before the enthusiastic crowd of 8,500, though unable to score more than a draw in any of the rounds. Escobar had a swollen lip and swelling on the left side of his face, but weathered the bout in far better shape than his opponent.Kirksey, George, \"Puerto Rica Boxer Wins Bantam Toga\", The Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 26, 1 September 1936 On October 31, 1936 he defeated the accomplished Nicky Jerome in an eight-round points decision in Brooklyn, New York. In one of his last fights, On December 19, 1936, he defeated Jerome again in an eight-round points decision at Ridgewood Grove in Brooklyn. One newspaper noted that \"his superior boxing gave him the edge\", rather than strong punching.Won by boxing style in \"Tony Marino Wins in New York Bout\", The Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 21, 20 December 1936 ==Last fight and resulting death== On January 30, 1937, Marino fought Panamanian boxer Carlos \"Indian\" Quintana at the Ridgewood Grove Arena in Brooklyn, New York. He took a terrific beating and was floored five times. The bout went the scheduled distance of eight rounds. Marino collapsed in the center of the ring just as the referee raised Quintana's hand to indicate his victory. He was examined by the ringside doctor, Eugene Kenny, who diagnosed a brain concussion. He was carried to his dressing room. Shortly thereafter, he was rushed to Wyckoff Heights Hospital in Brooklyn. He never regained consciousness and died on February 1, two days after the fight.\"Tony Marino Dies of Ring Injuries\", The Wilkes-Barre Record, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, pg. 16, 2 February 1937 A benefit for his family was held in his honor in New York partly through the efforts of John Attell, a matchmaker who had arranged several of his fights; it netted a total of $1,212.74.\"1,212.74 Netted in Tony Marino Benefit\", Williamsport Sun-Gazette, Williamsport, Pennsylvania, pg. 12, 25 February 1937 Quintana headlined the card of fighters.\"Quintana Wins Bout Benefiting Victim\", The Spokesman-Review, Spokane, Washington, pg. 10, 22 February 1937 ==Death inspires boxing rule== Two days after he died, the New York State Athletic Commission convened to frame a new rule. Citing Marino's death, they determined that any fighter knocked down three times in a single round would be considered \"outclassed\" and the fight would be stopped. At the time of its creation, this rule did not apply to championship matches.\"New Knockdown Rule In New York\",The Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 27, 4 February 1937 Over the years, the three-knockdown rule spread beyond the boundaries of New York, being used in many states and other countries.Sanserino, Michael, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 28 January 2010, ==Selected fights== |- | align=\"center\" colspan=8|5 Wins, 3 Losses |- | align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Result | align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Opponent(s) | align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Date | align=\"center\" style=\"border- style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Location | align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Duration | align=\"center\" style=\"border-style: none none solid solid; background: #e3e3e3\"|Notes |- | Loss | Pablo Dano | Dec 7, 1934 | Watsonville | 10 Rounds | |- | Loss | Pablo Dano | Apr 11, 1935 | Sacramento, CA | 10 Rounds | |- | Loss | Midget Wolgast | Oct 2, 1935 | Oakland, CA | 10 Round | Former 1930 Fly champ |- | Win | Lou Salica | Jun 2, 1936 | Long Island City, Queens, NY | 10 Rounds | Former World Bantam champ |- | Win | Balthazar Sangchili | Jun 29, 1936 | New York City | 14th Round KO | Won World Bantam title |- | Loss | Sixto Escobar | Aug 31, 1936 | Manhattan, NY | 13th Round TKO | Lost World Bantam title |- | Win | Nicky Jerome | Oct 31, 1936 | Brooklyn | 8 Rounds | |- | Loss | Carlos Quintana | Jan 30, 1937 | New York | 8 Rounds | Died Feb. 1, Cerebral hemorrhage ==References== ==External links== * * Professional Boxing Record for Tony Marino, Cyber Boxing Zone * Death of a Champion, Birth of a Rule: The Tony Marino Story on IMDb * Category:1912 births Category:1937 deaths Category:Deaths due to injuries sustained in boxing Category:Bantamweight boxers Category:Featherweight boxers Category:World boxing champions Category:World bantamweight boxing champions Category:Boxers from Pennsylvania Category:Italian male boxers Category:American boxers of Italian descent Category:Sportspeople from Pittsburgh ",
