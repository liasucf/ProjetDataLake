    "text": "\u00d8stbanetorvet station is a railway station serving the central part of the city of Aarhus in Jutland, Denmark. Until 1983 it was known as the East Station () or Aarhus East (). The station opened in 1877 as the southern terminus of the Grenaa Line. From 1933, however, all trains were continued from the station via a connecting track along the harbour to Aarhus Central Station. In 2016, the station was temporarily closed along with the Grenaa Line while it's being reconstructed to form part of the Aarhus light rail system. The tracks at the station also handle freight trains to Grenaa, and will continue to do so after being converted into a lightrail station for the public.http://www.letbanen.dk/anlaeg/afsluttede-projekter/mindet/ == History == \u00d8stbanetorvet station in 2008. The station opened on 1 December 1877 as the East Station ( or Aarhus East (), the southern terminus of a new branch line from Aarhus to Ryomg\u00e5rd run by the railway company \u00d8stjyske Jernbane (\u00d8JJ). In Ryomg\u00e5rd the line connected to the Randers\u2013Ryomgaard\u2013Grenaa Line from Randers to Grenaa. Just a few years later, however, the trains started running directly between Aarhus and Grenaa, with the Ryomg\u00e5rd-Randers section being reduced to a branch line. Both lines were taken over by the Danish State Railways (DSB) in 1885. From 1933, all trains were continued from the station via a connecting track along the harbour to Aarhus Central Station. == Architecture == Street facade of the station building in 2013. The station building is designed by Danish architect Niels Peder Christian Hols\u00f8e who five years previously had used the same designs for the construction of Faaborg station on the island of Funen. Since 2000 the station building has housed a furniture store. == Operations == In 2016, the station was temporarily closed along with the Grenaa Line while it is being reconstructed to form part of the Aarhus light rail system. ==References== ==External links== * Banedanmark * DSB * Aarhus Letbane Category:Railway stations in Denmark Category:Transport in Aarhus ",
