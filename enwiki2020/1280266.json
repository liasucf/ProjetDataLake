    "text": "First Band on the Moon is the third studio album by The Cardigans. It features the international single \"Lovefool\". It was first released on 12 August 1996 and internationally on 9 September 1996. The album was a major breakthrough for the band, both in their native Sweden and internationally. It is their best-selling album in the United States, having sold around 664,000 copies there as of September 2010. ==Track listing== \"Happy Meal II\" is a re- recording of \"Happy Meal\", a song that was originally a bonus track on the US edition of Life, with some minor lyric changes. ===Black Sabbath connections=== At least two songs on the album directly reference Black Sabbath material. In addition to the cover \"Iron Man\", \"Heartbreaker\" begins and ends with a quotation of the primary material from the song \"Black Sabbath\", the first track on Black Sabbath's debut album.http://www.beautifulsongoftheweek.com/week-309-heartbreaker-cardigans/ ==Personnel== *Lars-Olof Johansson \u2013 keyboards, piano *Bengt Lagerberg \u2013 drums, percussion *Nina Persson \u2013 lead vocals *Magnus Sveningsson \u2013 bass, vocals *Peter Svensson \u2013 guitar, vocals ==Singles== * \"Lovefool\" (first release 14 September 1996, #21 UK) * \"Been It\" (30 November 1996, #56 UK) * \"Lovefool\" (re-release 24 February 1997, #2 UK) * \"Your New Cuckoo\" (31 August 1997, #35 UK) Release dates refer to UK single releases. In Europe and Japan, \"Your New Cuckoo\" was released much earlier than in the UK, where the release was delayed due to the continued success of \"Lovefool\" and also to commission new remixes for the single release. \"Been It\" and \"Your New Cuckoo\" were both slightly shortened for single release; the former also had the word \"whore\" obscured by a guitar lick to make it more palatable for radio play. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1996\u201397) !scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"|Australian Albums (ARIA Charts) | align=\"center\"|52 |- !scope=\"row\"|Canadian Albums (RPM) | align=\"center\"|41 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"|Japanese Albums (Oricon) | align=\"center\"|4 |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"|US Top Heatseekers (Billboard) | align=\"center\"|3 |- |} ===Year- end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1997) !scope=\"col\"|Position |- !scope=\"row\"|US Billboard 200 |137 |- |} ===Single charts=== United States *Billboard Hot 100 Airplay: \"Lovefool\"; #1 *Billboard Adult Top 40: \"Lovefool\"; #2 *Billboard Modern Rock Tracks: \"Lovefool\"; #9 *Billboard Top 40 Mainstream: \"Lovefool\"; #1 *Billboard Adult Contemporary: \"Lovefool\"; #23 *Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play: \"Lovefool\"; #5 *Billboard Hot Dance Music/Maxisingle Sales: \"Lovefool; #24 *Billboard Rhythmic Top 40: \"Lovefool\"; #18 *Billboard Top 40 Adult Recurrents: \"Lovefool\" #1 UK *UK Radio Airplay: \"Lovefool\"; #1 *UK Top 100 Singles: \"Lovefool\"; #21, \"Been It\"; #56, \"Lovefool\" (Re-issue); #2, \"Your New Cuckoo\"; #35 Australia *ARIA Top 100 Singles 1997 Year-End Chart: \"Lovefool\"; #52 Sweden *Swedish Top 100 Singles 1996 Year-end Chart: \"Lovefool\"; #60 ==Certifications== ==References== ==External links== * First Band on the Moon microsite * The Cardigans' discography on Rolling Stone website * IFPI Sweden *Polyhex UK chart information Category:1996 albums Mercury Records albums Category:The Cardigans albums Category:Albums produced by Tore Johansson Category:Stockholm Records albums ",
