    "text": "I Had to Fall in Love was the only solo album released by former Supremes lead singer Jean Terrell, released in 1978 on the A&M; label. The album was completed five years after she left the Supremes and when it was finished, promotion was stopped completely because of Terrell's strict religious beliefs that prevented her from promoting the album in a way that she did not favor. In 2006, an independent label re-released the album in CD format. The title track is also available on the Motown compilation CD The Supremes: Greatest Hits and Rare Classics, 70's. ==Track listing== #\"Don't Stop Reaching for the Top\" (Jimmie Davis, Jeffrey Osborne) - (4:13) #\"No One Like My Baby\" (Fred Bliffert) - (3:45) #\"Rising Cost of Love\" (Bobby Martin, Len Ron Hanks, Zane Grey) - (3:34) #\"Change Up\" (Len Ron Hanks, Zane Grey) - (5:00) #\"How Can You Live (Without Love)\" (Len Ron Hanks, Zane Grey) - (3:21) #\"I Had to Fall in Love\" (Benny Gallagher, Graham Lyle) - (4:16) #\"That's the Way Love Grows\" (Frank McDonald, Chris Rae, Gerry Shury, Ron Roker) - (3:30) #\"You've Been So Good for Me\" (Len Ron Hanks, Zane Grey) - (4:23) #\"No Limit\" (Len Ron Hanks, Zane Grey) - (3:19) ==Personnel== ===Singers=== * Jean Terrell - lead vocals * Sherlie Matthews, Venetta Fields, Clydie King, & Lynda Laurence - background vocals ===Musicians=== * Scotty Harris, Melvin Webb, & James Gadson - drums * Danny Whatley, Harry E.
