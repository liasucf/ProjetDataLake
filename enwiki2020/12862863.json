Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. ==Range== Bowenia spectabilis is found in northeastern Queensland from the McIlwraith Range on the Cape York Peninsula south to near Tully. It is a rainforest species, growing close to streams and on sheltered slopes in lowland wet sclerophyll forest, but also at an altitude of up to 700 metres in the Atherton Tableland. ==Gallery== The 1889 book 'The Useful Native Plants of Australia' records that the yam-like rhizome is used for food by the Indigenous Australians.
