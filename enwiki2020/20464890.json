Incumbent President Armando Guebuza ran for re-election as the FRELIMO candidate; he was challenged by opposition leader Afonso Dhlakama, who had stood as the RENAMO candidate in every presidential election since 1994. Also standing were Daviz Simango, the Mayor of Beira, who was a RENAMO member before founding his own party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), earlier in 2009.\"Mozambique opposition chief to do it again\", Sapa-AFP (IOL), 24 July 2009. ==Campaign== Campaigning for the election began on 13 September 2009. There were 17 parties and two coalitions competing in the parliamentary election. Provincial assemblies were also at stake in the election.\"Campaigning begins in Mozambique\", Sapa-AFP (IOL), 14 September 2009. Citing problems in the papers submitted by the MDM when it filed to run, the National Elections Commission barred it from contesting the parliamentary election in nine out of 13 regions. Simango, who insisted there were no problems with the papers, was allowed to stand as a presidential candidate.\"New party protest ahead of election\", Sapa-Associated Press (IOL), 27 October 2009. Prior to the election, Guebuza was heavily favored to win another term, and RENAMO, mired in a bitter feud with Simango and the MDM, was thought to have been seriously weakened since the previous election, held in 2004. On 14 October 2009, 20 minor parties backed Simango's candidacy. The Independent Party of Mozambique (PIMO), another minor party, chose to support Guebuza.\"Mozambique groups campaign for challenger\", Sapa-DPA (IOL), 16 October 2009. On the last day of campaigning, 25 October, each of the three main candidates held major rallies. At FRELIMO's rally in Nampula, Guebuza stressed a commitment to fighting poverty and working for \"national unity, peace and development\". Dhlakama concluded his campaign with rallies in Maputo, and he criticized the predominant role of FRELIMO in society: \"Everything is mixed together today in Mozambique. The party, the police, schools, roads, journalists--everything has to be through FRELIMO. This has to stop.\" Simango, meanwhile, held his last rally in Beira, declaring that it was time to \"end the games, end the abuses\"; he pointed to the problems of unemployment and lack of medicine in hospitals when urging his supporters to turn out for the vote.Joshua Howat Berger, \"Leaders rally on eve of polls in Mozambique\", Sapa-AFP (IOL), 26 October 2009. Voting at central Maputo's Polana secondary school on election day, Dklahama said that if he lost the election he would not run for president again. He also called for a high turnout, while stressing the importance of respecting the results and avoiding a post-election dispute.\"Dhlakama casts his vote\", Sapa, 28 October 2009. ==Results== According to provisional results announced on 2 November, incumbent president Guebuza won a landslide victory with about 75% of the vote. Turnout was estimated at about 42%. SADC observers said the election result was \"a true reflection of the will of the people of Mozambique\". Opposition party RENAMO was less content with the electoral conduct, demanding that the election be annulled. According to RENAMO spokesperson Ivone Soares, FRELIMO supporters stuffed ballot boxes with multiple votes and were assisted in doing so by the electoral commission, which provided them with additional ballot papers. A FRELIMO spokesperson, Edson Macuacua, dismissed the allegations, asserting that the election was free and fair and characterizing RENAMO as \"lost and desperate\".Charles Mangwiro, \"Renamo rejects poll results\", Reuters (IOL), 4 November 2009. On 11 November, the National Elections Commission officially announced that Guebuza had won the election with 75% of the vote; Dhlakama and Simango trailed with 16.5% and 8.6% respectively. Results for the parliamentary election were also announced, showing that FRELIMO had won 191 seats, followed by RENAMO with 51 seats and eight for the MDM.\"Mozambique's Guebuza re-elected in landslide\", AFP, 11 November 2009.
