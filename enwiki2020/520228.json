    "text": "The first Athlete of the Year award in the United States was initiated by the Associated Press (AP) in 1931. At a time when women in sports were not given the same recognition as men, the AP offered a male and a female athlete of the year award to either a professional or amateur athlete. The awards are voted on annually by a panel of AP sports editors from across the United States, covering mainly American sports. As a result, a large majority of the winners have been Americans. However, non-Americans are also eligible for the honor, and have won on a few occasions. {|class=\"wikitable\" |+List of award winners !scope=col rowspan=2| Year !scope=col colspan=2| Male !scope=col colspan=2| Female |- !scope=col| Name !scope=col| Sport !scope=col| Name !scope=col| Sport |- | 1931 || Pepper Martin || Major League Baseball || Helene Madison || Swimming |- | 1932 || Gene Sarazen || Golf || Babe Didrikson || Track and field |- | 1933 || Carl Hubbell || Major League Baseball || Helen Jacobs || Tennis |- | 1934 || Dizzy Dean || Major League Baseball || Virginia Van Wie || Golf |- | 1935 || Joe Louis || Boxing || Helen Wills Moody || Tennis |- | 1936 || Jesse Owens || Track and field || Helen Stephens || Track and field |- | 1937 || Don Budge || Tennis || Katherine Rawls || Swimming |- | 1938 || Don Budge || Tennis || Patty Berg || Golf |- | 1939 || Nile Kinnick || College football || Alice Marble || Tennis |- | 1940 || Tom Harmon || College football || Alice Marble || Tennis |- | 1941 || Joe DiMaggio || Major League Baseball || Betty Hicks Newell || Golf |- | 1942 || Frank Sinkwich || College football || Gloria Callen || Swimming |- | 1943 || Gunder H\u00e4gg || Track and field || Patty Berg || Golf |- | 1944 || Byron Nelson || Golf || Ann Curtis || Swimming |- | 1945 || Byron Nelson || Golf || Babe Didrikson Zaharias || Golf |- | 1946 || Glenn Davis || College football || Babe Didrikson Zaharias || Golf |- | 1947 || Johnny Lujack || College football || Babe Didrikson Zaharias || Golf |- | 1948 || Lou Boudreau || Major League Baseball || Fanny Blankers-Koen || Track and field |- | 1949 || Leon Hart || College football || Marlene Bauer || Golf |- | 1950 || Jim Konstanty || Major League Baseball || Babe Didrikson Zaharias || Golf |- | 1951 || Dick Kazmaier || College football || Maureen Connolly || Tennis |- | 1952 || Bob Mathias || Track and field || Maureen Connolly || Tennis |- | 1953 || Ben Hogan || Golf || Maureen Connolly || Tennis |- | 1954 || Willie Mays || Major League Baseball || Babe Didrikson Zaharias || Golf |- | 1955 || Howard \"Hopalong\" Cassady || College football || Patty Berg || Golf |- | 1956 || Mickey Mantle || Major League Baseball || Pat McCormick || Diving |- | 1957 || Ted Williams || Major League Baseball || Althea Gibson || Tennis |- | 1958 || Herb Elliott || Track and field || Althea Gibson || Tennis |- | 1959 || Ingemar Johansson || Boxing || Maria Bueno || Tennis |- | 1960 || Rafer Johnson || Track and field || Wilma Rudolph || Track and field |- | 1961 || Roger Maris || Major League Baseball || Wilma Rudolph || Track and field |- | 1962 || Maury Wills || Major League Baseball || Dawn Fraser || Swimming |- | 1963 || Sandy Koufax || Major League Baseball || Mickey Wright || Golf |- | 1964 || Don Schollander || Swimming || Mickey Wright || Golf |- | 1965 || Sandy Koufax || Major League Baseball || Kathy Whitworth || Golf |- | 1966 || Frank Robinson || Major League Baseball || Kathy Whitworth || Golf |- | 1967 || Carl Yastrzemski || Major League Baseball || Billie Jean King || Tennis |- | 1968 || Denny McLain || Major League Baseball || Peggy Fleming || Figure skating |- | 1969 || Tom Seaver || Major League Baseball || Debbie Meyer || Swimming |- | 1970 || George Blanda || National Football League || Chi Cheng || Track and field |- | 1971 || Lee Trevino || Golf || Evonne Goolagong || Tennis |- | 1972 || Mark Spitz || Swimming || Olga Korbut || Gymnastics |- | 1973 || O.J.
