It got a 58% rating from Nollywood Reinvented, who gave a general consensus that \"On a very plain level, Lotanna is a good movie but for what it could have been, it never truly achieves this\". It was recommended as one of ten films to watch by The Cable. Wilfred Okiche for 360nobs was impressed with the recreation of the 1970s in the film, but was unimpressed by the body language of \"Lotanna\" and \"Zara\", as well as the acting of the \"big names\", it concluded its review by describing the film experience as \"completely forgettable\". ==See also== * List of Nigerian films of 2017 == References == ==External links== * Category:Nigerian films Category:Films set in the 1970s Category:Nigerian musical drama films Category:2010s musical drama films Category:Films set in the 20th century Category:English-language films Category:Films about Alzheimer's disease ",
