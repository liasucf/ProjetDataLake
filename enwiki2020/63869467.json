Lebanon's government works within the framework of Confessionalism (politics), with parliamentary seats and others government positions allocated by religious confession. Many members of government have been in power since the Lebanese Civil War, with a simple shuffling of positions every election cycle. Many blame this system for the country's continued corruption. Government officials reportedly often award contracts to friends and family leading to many of the country's problems like daily power cuts. Many working class Lebanese citizens rely on economic assistance from their party which stops them from speaking up against the system, despite widespread opposition. Corruption happens on every level of society and is not strictly limited to high level officials. As in many neighboring countries, using personal family and party connections to get favors like skipping a long queue, getting into a selective institution, or finding a job; known locally as wasta; is common practice and has become the social norm. Although many believe that using wasta is understandable for each individual case as institutions are often inefficient without it, it is also agreed upon that the social phenomenon deepens economic inequality. == Public reaction and opposition == Anti-corruption sentiment has been one of the driving forces behind many of the large scale lebanese protests in recent history. Notably the 2015\u20132016 Lebanese protests sparked by the closure of a waste dump without a plan which triggered a \"garbage crisis\" and the 2019\u20132020 Lebanese protests sparked by an increase in taxes Many anti-system parties run on an anti-corruption platforms, most notably Beirut Madinati, which ran during the 2016 Beirut municipal election. Although the party lost, it gained unprecedented traction for an outsider party in lebanon's otherwise rigid political status quo. With 40% of the votes, it forced the March 14 Alliance and the March 8 Alliance, historical opponents, to form a coalition in order win == References == Lebanon Category:Politics of Lebanon ",
