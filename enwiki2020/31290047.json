She is a Nashville-based recording artist with an industrial hard rock style and Gothic influences to back up her theatrical stage presence. She's had radio airplay in over 200 cities and has had two Top Twenty National Christian rock singles on the R&R; charts. Her first single \"Take Me Away\" ranked at No. 18 and her second single \"Hold Me\" went to No. 15.

She also caught the attention of some of the top producers in the industry, including veterans Kevan Cyka (Lifehouse, R.E.M., Hilary Duff), Dan Needham (Stacie Orrico, Steven Curtis Chapman) and Matt Bronleewe (Plumb, Joy Williams).
