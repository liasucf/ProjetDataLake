    "text": "David Bain (5 August 1900 \u2013 22 February 1966) was a Scottish footballer who initially played as a forward but later became known as a centre-half. ==Career== Born in Rutherglen in Lanarkshire, Bain played for local Rutherglen Glencairn and was capped once for Scotland Juniors in April 1922 before signing for Manchester United, then in England's second tier, at the age of 21. In his second campaign at Old Trafford he scored 8 goals in 18 matches, attracting the attention of Everton, where he spent a four-year spell in the Football League First Division. He was a member of the inconsistent squad built around Dixie Dean who were nearly relegated but then immediately went on to take the league title in 1927\u201328, albeit by then Bain had fallen out of favour, featuring only twice in the championship season. After his Goodison Park experience he joined Bristol City, then moved down the divisions with Halifax Town and Rochdale, spending two seasons at each club. ==Personal life== Bain's older brother, Jimmy, also played for Manchester United. Although they were at the club at the same time for two years, they never appeared together in a competitive fixture. In 1927, Bain married a Welsh girl in Bootle and two sons were born of their marriage. From 1948, they lived in Mather Avenue in Allerton, Liverpool, where he died in 1966.England & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858-1966, 1973-1995 ==References== Category:1900 births Category:1966 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Rutherglen Category:Scottish footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Rutherglen Glencairn F.C. players Category:Scottish Junior Football Association players Category:Everton F.C. players Category:Bristol City F.C. players Category:Halifax Town A.F.C. players Category:Rochdale A.F.C. players Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Association football midfielders Category:Scotland junior international footballers ",
