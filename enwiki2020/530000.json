SO-DIMMs are a smaller alternative to a DIMM, being roughly half the size of regular DIMMs. SO-DIMMs are often used in systems that have limited space, which include laptops, notebooks, small-footprint personal computers such as those based on Mini-ITX motherboards, high-end upgradable office printers, and networking hardware such as routers and NAS devices. == Visual identification == Most types of SO-DIMMs can be recognized visually by the distinctive notches that \"key\" them for different applications: * 100-pin SO-DIMMs (SDR SDRAM) have two notches. * 144-pin SO- DIMMs (SDR SDRAM) have a single notch near the center. * 200-pin SO-DIMMs (DDR SDRAM or DDR2 SDRAM) have a single notch nearer to one side. The exact location of this notch varies (read below). * 204-pin SO-DIMMs (DDR3 SDRAM) have a single notch closer to the center than on 200-pin SO-DIMMs. * 260-pin SO-DIMMs (DDR4 SDRAM), wide and high, making them wider than DDR3 SO-DIMMs, with a single notch after pin 144. * 260-pin SO-DIMMs (UniDIMM), wide and or high, with a single notch placed differently than on DDR3 SO-DIMMs. === Variants of 200-pin SO-DIMMs === The 200-pin SO-DIMM can be of the types DDR and DDR2. In both cases the notch is located at one fifth of the board length (20 pins + notch + 80 pins), but in DDR2 the notch is located slightly closer to the center of the board. These two types of memory are not interchangeable. The different notch locations are designed to prevent cross-installation, aiding at the same time in visually identifying 200-pin SO-DIMM modules. This variance is designed to prevent coupling of memory and controllers of different DDR generations due to electrical incompatibility. DDR SO-DIMMs operate at 2.5 V while DDR2 SO-DIMMs operate at 1.8 V. === Variants of DDR3 SO-DIMMs === These modules, while using the same physical layout, may differ in the specified voltage 1.5 or 1.35 volts. The lower voltage modules are sometimes, but not always, identified as DDR3L see also DDR3 SDRAM. == General characteristics == 200-pin and 204-pin SO-DIMMs are long, wide, having a maximum total depth of .micron.com - 200 Pin, PC2700 DDR SDRAM Unbuffered SO\u2013DIMM REFERENCE DESIGN SPECIFICATION page 26 SO-DIMMs are nearly equal in power and voltage rating to DIMMs; SO-DIMM technology does not mean lower performance compared to larger DIMMs. For example, DDR3 SO-DIMMs provide clock speeds such as 533 MHz (1066 MT/s, PC3-8500), CAS latencies such as 7, and higher capacities such as 4 GB per module. DDR2 SO-DIMM memory modules commonly have clock speeds from 200 MHz upward (specifications). 204-pin SO- DIMMs can also contain DDR3 SDRAM, with specifications such as PC3-6400, PC3-8500, PC3-10600, PC3-14900 and PC3-17000. 260-pin UniDIMMs contain DDR3 or DDR4 SDRAM depending on configuration. Some SO-DIMMs provide ECC functionality; unbuffered ECC SO-DIMMs are called SO-CDIMMs. == See also == * Dual in-line package (DIP) * Memory scrambling * Memory geometry logical configuration of RAM modules (channels, ranks, banks, etc.) * Rambus in-line memory module (RIMM) * Single in-line memory module (SIMM) * Single in-line package (SIP) * Zig-zag in-line package (ZIP) == References == == External links == * How to Install PC Memory Guides * Ruggedizing RAM for industrial systems (XR-DIMM form factor) Category:Computer memory form factor ",
