With headquarters located in Darlinghurst, New South Wales, the research hub is home to more than 20 research laboratories and the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute Innovation Centre. The Institute's mission is \"the relief of pain and suffering, and the promotion of well-being, through an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of cardiovascular disease\". Its key research is focused on the prevention and treatment of various heart diseases, including arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, cardiomyopathy, congenital heart disease, heart attack, heart failure, high cholesterol, obesity, spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) and stroke. The Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute was founded in memory of pioneering cardiac surgeon Dr. Victor Chang . Established on 14 February 1994, approximately three years after Dr. Chang's death, and opened by then Prime Minister Paul Keating, the institute has become a world-class research and research training facility. ==History== === Early years === The Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute was officially launched on 14 February 1994, by then Prime Minister the Hon Paul Keating, with Mr Kerry Packer AC as Patron, and Professor Robert Graham as Executive Director. The Institute was originally founded under the auspices of the Sisters of Charity and St Vincent's Hospital. It was named in honour of heart transplant surgeon Dr. Victor Chang, who died in Sydney under tragic circumstances on 4 July 1991. Dr Chang passionately believed in the ability for research to better the lives of many more than surgery ever could, saying \"you can save hundreds of lives through surgery but you could save millions through medical research\". On 27 February 1995, the Institute was accredited as an independent research facility with the Hon. Neville Wran as its inaugural Chairman. ==== Official Opening by Diana, Princess of Wales ==== On 1 November 1996, Diana, Princess of Wales officially opened the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute\u2019s temporary premises in Darlinghurst at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research, touring several heart research laboratories. The Princess of Wales also attended the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute Royal Ball as the Guest of Honour on 31 October 1996, describing Dr Chang as \"No ordinary cardiac surgeon. He was a visionary.\" In the Princess' address at the Royal Ball she said \"The Institute helps us to remember Dr Chang's great talent and service as he established Australia's National Heart Transplant Program back in 1984. It helps us draw inspiration from his leadership as he sought to realise the dream of a world class research institute, dedicated to the fight against heart disease.\" Following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, the Institute established the inaugural Princess' Lecture which was first delivered by Professor Sir Magdi Yacoub in 1998. In 2000 Dr Victor Chang was voted Australian of the Century by the people of Australia. ====Building Opening by Her Royal Highness Crown Princess Mary of Denmark==== On 4 March 2005 Her Royal Highness Crown Princess Mary of Denmark was the Guest of Honour at the second Victor Chang Royal Ball. The Royal Ball aimed to raise funds to develop a purpose-built, world class research centre in honour of Dr Victor Chang. With the help of Atlantic Philanthropies, construction of the Lowy Packer Building commenced in August 2006 with a groundbreaking ceremony in Darlinghurst. The ten storey Lowy Packer Building would become the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute's new home. Construction was completed in 2008 and on 3 September, the Lowy Packer Building was formally opened by Her Royal Highness Crown Princess Mary of Denmark. Princess Mary also attended a dinner with His Royal Highness Crown Prince Frederik held inside the new complex. Her Royal Highness Crown Princess Mary is an Honorary Life Governor of the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute. === Growth and milestones === In 2008 former NSW Premier The Hon. Neville Wran retired as Chairman, becoming a patron of the Institute. Mr Steven Lowy AM takes up the position. In 2013 Mr Lowy stands down as Chairman, leaving the Board after six years as Chairman and 19 years as a Director of the Institute. Mr Matthew Grounds AM is appointed Chairman of the Board. In 2013, the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute established an additional research laboratory based at the University of Western Australia. Led by Professor Livia Hool, the expansion marks the initial phase of the Institute's plans to enhance cardiovascular research in Western Australia. In 2019 the Institute celebrated its 25th anniversary with a dinner at the Sydney Opera House. In 2020 the founding Executive Director of the Institute, Professor Robert M Graham stepped down after 25 years, handing over the leadership to Professor Jason Kovacic. == Research == The Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute focuses on medical research, centered around; * Arrhythmia * Atherosclerosis * Cardiac arrest * Cardiomyopathy * Congenital heart disease * Coronary heart disease * Genomics * Heart attack * Heart failure * Heart transplantation * High blood pressure * High cholesterol * Obesity * Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection * Stroke * Women and heart disease ==Location and facilities== The Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, located within the purpose-built Lowy Packer Building, is a major partner in the St Vincent's Hospital Research Precinct in Darlinghurst, Sydney.
