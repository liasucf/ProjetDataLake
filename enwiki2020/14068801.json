    "text": "Aurora Private School, commonly known simply as Aurora, was a private school located in Sundowner, Randburg. It was subsequently acquired by Curro Holdings to formulate Curro Aurora. The school was established in 1993 by Wendy Benbow- Hebbert, Judy Nicholas and Debbie Adam, three former inner City of Johannesburg teachers who sought to reform practises of the education system perceived as stifling and counter productive. As a result, Aurora was created as a liberal educational institution which drew significant attention from its inception in comparison with contemporary traditional private schools in South Africa. ==Location== Aurora was located where its present successor is currently located in Sundowner, Randburg. Entrances are located on both Taurus Road and Puttick Avenue. Aurora moved to this site in 1998 having previously occupied a site in Randpark Ridge called TV Park which now houses Willowridge Private School. The original layout of the school is unconventional in having circular building complexes named after the planets of the solar system positioned around the original school hall. The extraterrestrial theme of the school, which has carried through to its successor, mimics the theme of the surrounding suburban street names. The school is flanked by two sporting grounds, the older Galaxy Park to the west and relatively newer Dream Park to the east. Despite subsequently changing, it was intended that Mercury houses Grade 0 (Grade R), Venus house Grades 1\u20133, Mars house Grades 4\u20136, Jupiter house Grades 7\u20139 and both Saturn A and B house Grades 10 through to Matriculation. The pre-school has continued to operate along with the aftercare facilities in a complex called Solaria. Operating as a school quadrangle was the Luna piazza, with a fountain at its centre, it extended from the Hall to the Pavilion and a large outcrop of geological rocks which characterised the school's landscape. The rock face and piazza have subsequently been demolished and the Pavilion has been converted into an administrative extension of the present Primary School. ==Uniform== It was often incorrectly contended that Aurora had no uniform, a rarity in the South African educational system. The uniform of the school evolved throughout the history of the school but remained distinct and relatively casual. At inception the school required pupils to wear a simple T-shirt in any of the school's three colours with black trousers or shorts of any kind and any black footwear. Subsequently, takkies or sneakers were forbidden except for sport use and the school came to provide black denim pants with white stripes on the rear pockets. The primary school uniform consisted of white golf shirts with green collars paired with black shorts and black shoes. In the absence of a blazer, a red jumper was worn. Primary school pupils could wear an optional green sunhat. Socks and hair accessories could be in any of the school colours. The senior high school uniform originally mimicked the primary school with substituted black jumpers. Eventually, this gave way to a single uniform for the high school which consisted of white golf shirts with red collars as previously worn by pupils in the junior high school. The white jumpers previously worn by the junior high school were abandoned. Winter uniforms included black tracksuit pants coupled with red tracksuit jackets with a black chevron and green blazons from the shoulders down. Scarfs, gloves and beanies could be worn provided they were in the school's colours. As the school progressed, it introduced the traditional school blazer. For the primary school, irrespective of the pupils' achievements, this was black. In the high school, students became eligible for an Honours Blazer which was ivory-white in colour. Both had the school emblem on the left chest pocket. Honours were awarded for full colours in two or more disciplines in the codes of academics, sport or, as a cross-over for both, general. Scrolls, badges and trimmings were applied per participation and level of achievement of the pupil. The left sleeve's forearm was trimmed for team colours, the right equivalent was for half colours and a full blazer trimming was for full colours in a single discipline are correlated to a red scroll which was also affixed. In Grade 11 pupils entered into negotiations with representatives of the school's governing body concerning Matric privileges. Among these negotiations was a decision in respect of what the uniform would be for pupils in Grade 12 who would wear a different uniform from the rest of the school often of their own collective design. The School retained the right to refuse this privilege and often did when it deemed the uniform inappropriate, too casual or at odds with the school's identity. An area where the pupils had remarkable freedom in comparison with their contemporaries at other private schools was with respect to their bodily appearances. In the high school, students were permitted to do what they wished with their hair. This was provided that it remained clean and if it touched their collars it would be tied up. This was later restricted to remain within the realms of a natural colour. Further, high school students were permitted tattoos and piercings provided the former were not visible when wearing the uniform and were only worn with a bristle with regards to the latter. Pupils were allowed to wear makeup however the school retained the right to determine whether it was suitable on a case-by-case basis. ==Learning structure== Aurora is different from any other schools in Johannesburg, as they offer a number of external certificates which students can gain throughout their journey at Aurora, ranging from business management, event management and catering to the ICDL and ITSI computer certificates. . Aurora is affiliated with the IEB independent assessment agency and strives for all of the matrics to graduate with their NSC at the end of grade 12.
