    "text": "Voigt-Thomson law describes anisotropic magnetoresistance effect in a thin film strip as a relationship between the electric resistivity and the direction of electric current: ::\\rho (\\vartheta) = \\rho_0 + \\Delta \\rho \\cdot cos^2 \\vartheta where: : \\vartheta \\ is the angle of direction of current in relation to the direction of magnetic field : \\rho_0 \\ is the initial resistivity : \\Delta \\rho \\ is the change of resistivity (proportional to MR ratio) The equation can also be expressed as: ::\\rho (\\vartheta) = \\rho_\\parallel \\cdot cos^2 \\vartheta + \\rho_\\perp \\cdot sin^2 \\vartheta where: : \\rho_\\parallel \\ is the parallel component of resistivity : \\rho_\\perp\\ is the perpendicular component == References == Category:Spintronics ",
