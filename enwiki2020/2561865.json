    "text": "Drahom\u00edra of Stodor (; \u2013 died after 934 or 936) was Duchess consort of Bohemia from 915 to 921, wife of the P\u0159emyslid duke Vratislaus I. She also acted as regent of the Duchy of Bohemia from 921 to 924 during the minority of her son Wenceslaus. She is chiefly known for the murder of her mother-in-law Ludmila of Bohemia by hired assassins. ==Life== Drahom\u00edra was born in the present-day Havelland region centered around the fortress of Brandenburg (Brennabor), the daughter of a Hevelli (Stodoran) prince. According to Cosmas of Prague, she married Duke Vratislav I of Bohemia about 906. Drahom\u00edra gave birth to at least six children: her sons were Wenceslaus and Boleslaus, who both succeeded their father as Bohemian dukes. Among her four daughters was one P\u0159ibislava, whose considered to have married to a Croatian prince, who became a nun at the Prague St. George's Convent, and possibly St\u0159ezislava, the wife of the Bohemian nobleman Slavn\u00edk, founder of the Slavn\u00edk dynasty. The marriage led the P\u0159emyslid dynasty to cooperation with the Polabian Slavs and brought Bohemia in conflict with the Saxon duke Henry the Fowler, who became German king in 919 and later waged war against the Hevelli tribes. Ludmila and Drahom\u00edra with young Wenceslaus, 19th-century painting After her husband's untimely death in 921, the Bohemian nobles designated Drahom\u00edra regent for her minor son Wenceslaus. However, she had to divide the government of Bohemia with her mother-in-law Ludmila, widow of Duke Bo\u0159ivoj I, who took over the religious education of her sons. Popular history depicts Ludmila as a restrained and pious grandmother, but it is likely that the political demands of government called for more energy and worldliness than history records. Wenceslaus was one of the main reasons for the eventually fatal discord between Drahom\u00edra and Ludmila, who had exerted great influence over Drahom\u00edra's eldest son, leaving Drahom\u00edra to concentrate her efforts on her younger son, Boleslaus. Despite or perhaps as a result of her political and personal efforts, Ludmila attracted Drahom\u00edra's bitter enmity. She alleged that her mother-in-law, with the help of Bavarian missionaries, educated Wenceslaus to become a monk rather than a prince. Moreover, the two women may have disagreed whether to recognise the East Frankish supremacy of Henry the Fowler. Ludmila fled from Prague to Tet\u00edn Castle on the road to Regensburg, where on 16 September 921 Drahom\u00edra's henchmen, Tunna and Gommon, attacked and strangled her. The next year the troops of Duke Arnulf of Bavaria raided the Bohemian duchy. When Drahom\u00edra's son Wenceslaus came of age about 922, he sent his mother into exile, though he called her back in 925. She spent her later years in Prague, however, upon the murder of her son she fled from the court to the Croats. While some considered that the Croats lived near Prague, others noted that in the case of noble and royal fugitives tried to find security as distant as possible, indicating these Croats probably were located more to the East around Vistula valley. ==In culture== She is the subject of two operas, Drahom\u00edra by Franti\u0161ek \u0160kroup (1848), and Drahom\u00edra by Karel \u0160ebor (1867). ==References== ==Bibliography== *Ancestral Roots of Certain American Colonists Who Came to America Before 1700 by Frederick Lewis Weis; Line 244\u20137 ==External links== *Busta Drahom\u00edry, matky sv.
