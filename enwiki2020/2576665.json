    "text": "Enrique Santos Disc\u00e9polo (Discepol\u00edn) (27 March 1901 \u2013 23 December 1951) was an Argentine tango and milonga musician and composer, author of famous tangos such as \"Cambalache\" and many others performed by several of the most important singers of his time, amongst them notably Carlos Gardel. He was also a film actor, director and screenwriter. ==Life== Disc\u00e9polo was born in Buenos Aires on 27 March 1901. He was attracted to the arts from an early age and tried acting and theater writing (with moderate success) before finally \"arriving\" to Tango. Even when his decision to write popular music wasn't totally separated from his previous exchanges with theater and acting, his older brother Armando resisted this move and therefore in the beginning things weren't easy for Enrique. Armando had taken over his education after his parent died when Enrique was very young. He wrote a few songs (including, the later famous Que vachach\u00e9, an old lunfardo phrase meaning \"Whatcha gonna do\") with little success until his break came in 1928, when singer Azucena Maizani performed his Esta noche me emborracho (\"Tonight I'm getting drunk\"). Days after this performance, the lyrics to this tango circulated across the nation and gave him notoriety. Later on that year, actress and singer Tita Merello rescued Que vachach\u00e9, and propelled it to the same popularity as Esta noche me emborracho. To finish a great year in 1928, he also met his partner, Tania, who would be with him for the rest of his life. He continued to gain notoriety in the ensuing years, and, in 1934, he wrote \"Cambalache\", a song whose lyrics not only reflected the world political climate of the era, but also almost predicted its future. Argentines sometimes contemplate on how much those lyrics still reflect life in the world today, some 80 years later. Disc\u00e9polo died after suffering a stroke on Christmas Eve in 1951. ==Style== Disc\u00e9polo was not as prolific as some other Tango writers (like Enrique Cad\u00edcamo, for example), but he was very versatile in his styling. He was not only able to write ironic and moralistic songs (\"Que vachach\u00e9\", \"Yira... yira...\", \"Que sapa se\u00f1or\", \"Cambalache\"), but also romantic (\"Sue\u00f1o de juventud\"), sarcastic (\"Justo el 31\", \"Chorra\"), expressionist (\"Soy un arlequ\u00edn\", \"Qui\u00e9n m\u00e1s, qui\u00e9n menos\"), passionate (\"Confesi\u00f3n\", \"Canci\u00f3n desesperada\") and nostalgic ones (\"Uno\", \"Cafet\u00edn de Buenos Aires\"). His tango songs, as those of most other tango composers, make extensive use of lunfardo, thus making understanding his lyrics an exercise in patience for listeners unused to that dialect. ==Selected Songs== *Infamia (\"Infamy\") *Que vachach\u00e9 (\"Whatcha gonna do\") *Yira... yira... (\"Go round... and round...\") *Que sapa se\u00f1or (\"What's up sir\") *Cambalache (\"Junkshop\") *Sue\u00f1o de juventud (\"Dream of youth\") *Justo el 31 (\"Right on the 31\") *Chorra (\"She-Thief\") *Soy un arlequ\u00edn (\"I am a harlequin\") *Qui\u00e9n m\u00e1s, qui\u00e9n menos (\"Who more, who less\") *Confesi\u00f3n (\"Confession\") *Canci\u00f3n desesperada (\"Desperate song\") *Uno (\"One\", in the figurative sense of \"oneself\") *Cafet\u00edn de Buenos Aires (\"Buenos Aires Cafe\") ==Selected filmography== Disc\u00e9polo directed or co-directed a number of films: * Four Hearts (1939) * Caprichosa y millonaria (Capricious and Millionaire) (1940) * Un se\u00f1or mucamo (1940) * By the Light of a Star (En la luz de una estrella) (1941) * Fantasmas en Buenos Aires (Ghosts in Buenos Aires (1942) * Candida, Woman of the Year (1943) * The Fan (1951) ==References== ==External links== * Todo Tango * Brief biography and some lyrics * * * Category:1901 births Category:1951 deaths Category:20th-century Argentine male actors Category:20th-century dramatists and playwrights Category:20th-century Argentine singers Category:Argentine composers Category:Argentine dramatists and playwrights Category:Argentine film directors Category:Argentine film score composers Category:Argentine male film actors Category:Argentine male singer-songwriters Category:Argentine people of Italian descent Category:Argentine screenwriters Category:Argentine singer-songwriters Category:Burials at La Chacarita Cemetery Category:People from Buenos Aires Category:Male dramatists and playwrights Category:Male film score composers Category:Male screenwriters Category:Musicians from Buenos Aires Category:Tango musicians Category:20th-century Argentine male writers Category:20th-century male singers Category:20th-century screenwriters ",
