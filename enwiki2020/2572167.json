Perkins was reelected to the three succeeding Congresses (November 6, 1984 \u2013 January 3, 1993). The seat that he held, Kentucky's 7th district, was eliminated by redistricting and became Kentucky's 5th district and some counties in Kentucky's 4th district. He did not seek re-election to Congress in 1992 from the new 5th district, in part due to the House banking scandal.
