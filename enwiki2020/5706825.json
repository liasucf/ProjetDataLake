Athmallik is a town and a notified area committee and a Sub division of Angul district in the state of Odisha, India. == History == Athmallik was initially an estate (jagir) which was recognized as a princely state in 1874. Athmallik was one among the 26 feudatory states of Odisha. Kaintragarh was the capital of Athmallik State, being carved out of the erstwhile Baudh ex-feudatory state. In the 11th century it became a separate princely state, established by King Prattap Deo, a scion of the Kadamba Dynasty. Prattap Deo was said to have found a Honda (Metal Vessel) which was considered to be lucky enough, after which the territory was then named as \"Hondpa\". In the course of time, one of the chiefs divided the ex-state into eight divisions and placed one sub-chief called \"Malla\" in each division with a view of suppressing the unruly tribes; on this basis the kingdom changed its name from \"Hondpa\" to \"Athmallik\". The state merged with Dhenknal from the rule of Kishore Chandra Dev in 1948 and remained under Dhenkanal District until 31 March 1993. Due to bifurcation of the District Athmallik, a Sub-Division, is now under Angul District, as from 1993. === Rajas === Rajas of the princedom are as follows:. * Jogendra Samant (1874 - 1877)right * Mahendra Deo Samant (4 Feb 1877 - 190.) * Bibhendra Deo Samant (190.- 3 Nov 1918) * Kishor Chandra Deo Samant (b. 1904) (3 Nov 1918 \u2013 15 Aug 1947) * Raja Surajmani Deo Samant (b. 1995) == Demographics == India census, Athmallik had a population of 11,383.
