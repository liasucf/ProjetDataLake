    "text": "Club Deportivo Nacional is a Mexican football team founded in Guadalajara, Jalisco, M\u00e9xico in 1916. The club won its first title in 1922, playing in the second division. It also won seven Liga Amateurs de Jalisco between the 1925\u20131926 and 1938\u20131939 seasons, which is the second most years won by a team, behind C.D. Guadalajara, who have won 13. The club has played in the most important leagues in the country and currently plays in the Tercera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico. == History == === Amateur era === The club's origins date back to 1915 in the barrio (neighborhood) of Mexicaltzingo in the city of Guadalajara, Jalisco when Club Unico split into two clubs. It joined the Liga de Jalisco second division in 1919 where they played until 1922 when they won and were allowed to join the league's first division. However, the league made it difficult for the club to join and made them play an exhibition match to prove they were worthiness to play in the first division. Once allowed in, the club went on to win seven titles in 1925\u20131926, 1926\u20131927, 1930\u20131931, 1931\u20131932, 1933\u20131934, 1936\u20131937 and 1938\u20131939, which puts them behind only C.D. Guadalajara, who won 13. === 1924\u201325 title match === In the 1923\u201324 tournament the club finished second in the league thanks to Alfonso \u00c1vila, Lorenzo Camarena, Rafael Fierro, Juan Valencia, Manuel Benavides, Sim\u00f3n Garc\u00eda, Juan V\u00e1zquez, Te\u00f3filo Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Luis Valencia, Miguel Alatorre, and Daniel G\u00f3mez, along with Isabel Huerta, Francisco Espinosa, Francisco Fierro and Hilario L\u00f3pez. After the tournament ended, the club made its first appearance in Mexico City where they played a friendly series with Real Club Espa\u00f1a, which they lost. Later, Club Deportivo Nacional went on to play another friendly cup series against local club Club Alianza, this time winning and taking home the Copa Latino-Nacional. In the 1924\u201325 tournament, the club finished tied with C.D. Guadalajara, so a championship match was organized which took place on 5 April 1925. The Estadio Felipe Mart\u00ednez Sandoval was filled to capacity, causing a disturbance due to the number of supporters both inside and outside the stadium. It led to the soldiers shooting warning shots into the sky to try to keep order. The first goal was scored by Anastasio Prieto from C.D. Guadalajara. In the second half, Zuavo from Nacional scored the equalizer. Close to the end of the game a penalty was called in favor of C.D. Guadalajara, which Nacional protested and some players, in their rage, decided to leave the field. The referee decided that the game must continue regardless. Back-up goalkeeper Francisco Fierros did not leave and so the penalty was executed by Anastasio Prieto, who had scored the first goal for C.D. Guadalajara. This time he was not as fortunate, and his penalty was blocked. The players who had exited decided to return to the game, and a few minutes later the referee called full-time. The draw would have given El Nacional the title, which players from C.D. Guadalajara protested, claiming that the goalkeeper who had blocked the penalty was not a legal player as no substitution had been made. The referee decided to take this to the league's federation, who decided that the game should be played again. So the game was replayed on 20 April that same year. The first half finished with no goals scored. In the second half a penalty was called for El Nacional. The penalty was missed after the ball hit the goal post and so the game remained 0\u20130. At the end of the game, a long pass was made from the C.D. Guadalajara goalkeeper to Higinio \"El Perico\" Huerta who, in one swift move, headed the ball and scored the only goal giving C.D. Guadalajara the title. With this, the league's first rivalry was born. The line-ups for the clubs were as follows: * C.D. Guadalajara: F. Prieto, D. Huerta, Arias, J. Aceves, G. Prieto, Pellat, Aceves, A. Prieto, Carranza, Gonz\u00e1lez, H. Huerta. * El Nacional: A. \u00c1vila, L. Camarena, R. Fierros, Benavides, L\u00f3pez, Garc\u00eda, Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Valencia, Alatorre, D. G\u00f3mez, J. V\u00e1zquez. === 1925\u201326 first title === In the 1925\u201326 tournament, after having lost the match against C.D. Guadalajara the year prior, the club reinforced its squad by signing new players: Aurelio \"Mortero\" Delgado, Lorenzo Gonz\u00e1lez, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ch\u00e1vez and Antonio Casillas. The club managed to win its first title after beating F.C. Atlas in May 1926 with a score of 3\u20132. For that match, the Nacional supporters once again filled the stadium to capacity, but there were not as many incidents as the year before. The club finished with 17 points, two more than the runner-up C.D. Guadalajara; F.C. Atlas finished with 13. Club Deportivo Nacional did not lose any games during the tournament. == 1930s championships == === Copa Aviaci\u00f3n === In 1928, with the inauguration of Campo de Aviaci\u00f3n a series was organized with Selecci\u00f3n Jalisco, who represented the league from Jalisco, against Guerra y Marina from Mexico City. There were players from El Nacional in both clubs. Hilario L\u00f3pez was playing for Guerra y Marina. The trophy was donated by then-Mexican president L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas. Selecci\u00f3n Jalisco won and took that trophy, which later was giving to El Nacional in 1930\u201331 after the club won the first division league title as well as the third division inferior league. === League titles === After star player Lorenzo Camarena followed in the footsteps of Hilario L\u00f3pez and left the club to join Mexico City's Guerra y Marina, the club brought in new players Jos\u00e9 \"Carbonero\" S\u00e1nchez, Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1nchez Mut, Te\u00f3doro alba, Lorenzo Gonz\u00e1lez, \"El Salero\", Manuel V\u00e1zquez que junto con Luis Valencia, Juan V\u00e1zquez, Aurelio Delgado, R. S\u00e1nchez, Delfino R\u00edos, \"El Sihu\u00edn\" y \"El Talache\". The last two came from Atl\u00e9tico Latino. El Nacional went on to win the 1930\u20131931 and 1931\u20131932 league titles. In the 1933\u201334 season, the club managed to win the league's title for the fifth time, this time under the management of Luis Valencia, Juan V\u00e1zquez and Ram\u00f3n S\u00e1nchez. The roster included Francisco y Enrique M\u00fa\u00f1oz, Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, Juan Salcido, J. Jes\u00fas Ruelas, Hermilo Zamora, Manuel Garc\u00eda, Jos\u00e9 Luna, Jos\u00e9 Guzm\u00e1n, Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez \"Moco III\", Juan L\u00f3pez \"Moco II\", Rosal\u00edo Morales, J. Trinidad Gonz\u00e1lez, Santos Sandoval with Luis Valencia as team captain. At the end of the tournament, the club had its first international match against Chilean team Audax Italiano, who was on an off-season tour through Mexico playing with top clubs in the country's capital. Audax Italiano also played matches against Club Latino and Guadalajara. The match took place in April 1933 with a cup donated by Alfonso Rosales and Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Mart\u00ednez, the owners of Club Nacional. The match finished with a 2\u20132 draw. In a friendly gesture, they decided to split the cup in two, an agreement that Audax Italiano did not initially agree with. The club ended the 1930s by winning their sixth and seventh league titles in 1937\u20131938 and 1939\u20131940, and finished second in the 1935\u20131936 tournament. This gave them five league titles and various friendly cups in the 1930s. == 1940s == The club started the decade by finishing as the runners-up in 1940\u20131941. With President Manuel P. Carrillo, the club was invited to play in the Liga Amateur Del Distrito Federal, Mexico City's top football league at the time. The league decided to get the best players from the local league and let them play for Selecci\u00f3n Jalisco, which would represent all clubs from Jalisco in Mexico City until 1942\u20131943, when the country organized their first professional league. With the professionalization of football in Mexico, the Jalisco league lost important clubs. In 1945, Alfonso Rosales, Jos\u00e9 T. Meza and Mateo Zepeda took over the then-dismantled club that had many of their top players leaving to join clubs that offered them more money. Club Deportivo Nacional was purchased along with a group of reduced collaborators, Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez being the most important. From 1946 to 1951, Daniel Jaime and his sons took ownership and tried hard to promote it and place it in the best leagues in Mexico. The club kept producing good players, such as Jes\u00fas \"Chuco\" Ponce and Tom\u00e1s Balc\u00e1zar, standouts who later went on to be part of the Campeon\u00edsimo with C.D. Guadalajara in the 1960s. == 1950s == From 1951 to 1954, Antonio Casilla was the club's owner and saw it struggle during his ownership. In 1954, he sold the club to J. Guadalupe Vargas, who went on to register the club in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n Profesional, finally putting them in the professional leagues in Mexico. The club made it official on 26 February 1956 and played in their first tournament later in the year. The club's first game was played on 18 July 1956, against Club Celaya, who defeated them 2\u20131. El Nacional did not win a single match until the third round when the beat Club de F\u00fatbol Laguna 4\u20133. It played in the second division from 1956 to 1961 when the club won the championship and was awarded a promotion to the first division. == 1960s Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico == The club played its first Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico tournament in the 1960\u20131961 season. It finished with seven wins, nine draws, ten losses, and thirty scored goals and from an allowed 44. This gave them 23 points. The team was tied for eighth with Jaibos Tampico and Atlante F.C.. That same year Club Universidad Nacional was promoted and CD Zacatepec was relegated to the second division. In the 1962\u20131963 tournament, the club finished sixth overall with nine wins, nine draws, eight losses, scoring 37 goals from an allowed 43. This put them nine points shy of their crosstown rival CD Oro, who finished with 37 points. That same year, CD Zacatepec was promoted after a year in the inferior division and Jaibos Tampico was relegated to the second division. In the 1963\u20131964 tournament, the club finished last in the league with four wins, four draws, 18 losses, totaling 12 points. They scored 26 goals from allowed 71. The club had the worst goal differential in the league after allowing 45 more goals than they scored. Cruz Azul (Jasso), the Little White Bunnys (2nd Division Champion) and Veracruz Red Sharks (2nd place in a promotion tournament) were promoted, which increased the number of teams to 16, in which Nacional was first, and thus not relegated. In the 1964\u20131965 tournament, the club finished 14th, last in the league with a record of six wins, ten draws, 14 losses, and scored 29 goals from an allowed 50, for a total of 22 points. El Nacional started the tournament by losing against Club Am\u00e9rica 2\u20131 then losing 3\u20130 to Club Le\u00f3n in the third round. They lost 2\u20131 to Atletico Morelia, in the fourth, lost 2\u20130 to C.F. Monterrey, in the 5th round and lost again to Deportivo Toluca F.C. 2\u20130. In the sixth round, the club was humiliated after losing 6\u20131 to CD Oro and, as if that was not enough, in round 7 the club lost 5\u20131 to Club Universidad Nacional. In the round 8 the club finally earned their first point after drawing 0\u20130 with Necaxa. The club was relegated to the second division that year, the club's last season in the Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico to date. === Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico statistics === {| border=\"2\" class=\"wikitable\" |----- align=\"center\" | width=\"25\" | GP || width=\"25\" | W | width=\"25\" | D | width=\"25\" | L || width=\"25\" | GF | width=\"25\" | GA | width=\"25\" | Pts || width=\"25\" | DIF |----- align=\"center\" | align=\"left\" |108||26||32||50||122||198|| 84||\u221274 |} * Gp \u2013 Games Played * W \u2013 Wins * D \u2013 Draws * L \u2013 Loss * GF \u2013 Goals For * GA \u2013 Goals Allowed * Pts \u2013 Points * DIF \u2013 Difference == Present day == The club has participated on and off the pitch in the Mexican second and third divisions.
