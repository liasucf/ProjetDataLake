Because his older brother Klaus was an apprentice to his father as a wood sculptor, his father was able to register his son Albin, who was also seeking this profession, for higher education at the Peter-Anich-Gewerbeschule in Innsbruck under Professor Hans Pontiller. After half a year school attendance, however, Albin Moroder decided to renounce to his education because he did not feel well cared for, and yet completed the Holzbildhauer teaching within the family.Trapp Eugen.

Early on Albin Moroder felt in his work \"the need to simplify everything and make it more modern\". Thus, he has created more modern, but always representational figures, which he also showed at major exhibitions in Vienna, Paris, London and Salzburg. He has dealt mainly with the Christian motif of the crucifix. As a material of his work, he mainly uses wood, but also bronze.Adele Moroder de Len\u00e8rt: 'N memoria de Rudolf Moroder de Lenert do 50 ani che 'l i.e. tum\u00e0 tla gran vi\u00ebra mondiela 1914.
