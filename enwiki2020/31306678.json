Its initial building had one story. A 1933 earthquake caused damage, and the building from that point on was one story. In the 1970s area courts required school districts to move minority children into other schools as part of school busing, and the school district closed the school in 1972. From that point toward, it served as a preschool and a community center. A neighborhood committee circa the 1990s advocated for the school to reopen as the district was finding its schools to be overcrowded. It reopened with kindergarten in 1996 and added a new grade level each year. Jerry Hicks of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the community wanted the school back even though it meant that de facto segregation would increase. * Orangethorpe * Pacific Drive * Raymond * Richman * Rolling Hills * Sunset Lane * Valencia Park * Woodcrest ==References== ==External links== * Fullerton School District Category:School districts in Orange County, California Category:Education in Fullerton, California Category:Educational institutions with year of establishment missing ",
