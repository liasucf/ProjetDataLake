    "text": "Fran\u010desko Ratkov Micalovi\u0107 (birth name Ivan Vukosali\u0107 or Jovan Vukosali\u0107) was an early 16th-century Ragusan printer who printed the first books on vernacular language of population of contemporary Ragusa (modern-day Dubrovnik). Micalovi\u0107 printed books based on the agreements he concluded with Petar \u0160u\u0161i\u0107. \u0160u\u0161i\u0107 paid 108 golden ducats for printing while Micalovi\u0107 prepared Cyrillic script types and organized printing of prayer books in Venice in 1512. These prayer books are known as Molitvenik and Officio. Micalovi\u0107 was obliged to collect printed books and to sell them in his shop which he was to open in Dubrovnik and in Ottoman Serbia. In 1510 and 1513 documents signed by Micalovi\u0107, the language of the prayer book was referred to as \"in littera et idiomate serviano\" (). In sources the language of these prayer books and script in which it is printed is referred to as Bosnian, Ragusan, Serbian, Croatian or Serbo-Croatian, depending on the point of view of its authors. == Family == Fra\u010dnesko's birth name was Ivan or Jovan. His grandfather was a book trader. Fra\u010dnesko's father was Ratko Vukosali\u0107 whose nickname was Micalovi\u0107. Ratko Vukosali\u0107 belonged to a group of Ragusans who had very good connections with Ottomans and was engaged in a special type of trade, ransom slavery.Ekonomske veze izme\u0111u Dubrovnika i Dalmacije u 16 stole\u0107u, Ignacij Voje, Radovi, volume 10, Zagreb 1977 In Ragusan document composed on 23 August 1470 it was recorded that Ratko Vukosali\u0107 (with nickname Mazalovi\u0107) paid to Ivan Markovi\u0107 from Croatia a ransom for certain Turk Mustafa.Fragmenti o omembi Zagreba in Hrva\u0161ke v dubrovni\u0161kih arhivalijah, Voje, Ignacij, Arhivi, 2007, letnik 30, \u0161tevilka 2 Ratko bought silver for this transaction from Grgur Sumi\u010di\u0107 from Novo Brdo. Ransom for Mustafa of 500 ducats was paid by Isa-Beg Ishakovi\u0107 who also had to release Markovi\u0107's wife captured and kept in slavery in Sarajevo. On 16 September 1470 Ratko Vukosali\u0107, acting as an agent of \u017divan Prip\u010dinovi\u0107, brought wife of Ivan Markovi\u0107 to Dubrovnik. At the beginning of 1471 Ratko Vukosali\u0107 bought a house.\u0420\u0430\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043b\u043e \u0411. \u041f\u0435\u043a\u0438\u045b, \u041a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0434\u0440\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0443, \u0424\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0444\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u041a\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0446\u0430, \u0423\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u0443 \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0434, \u0414\u0443\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0410\u043d\u0442\u0443\u043d\u0438\u043d \u0413\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0430\u0446\u043e \u0411\u0440\u0443\u045a\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u0438\u0437 \u041c\u0430\u043d\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0435, page 62 Ratko Vukosali\u0107 died before 1501.\u0420\u0430\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043b\u043e \u0411. \u041f\u0435\u043a\u0438\u045b, \u041a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0434\u0440\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0443, \u0424\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0444\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u041a\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0446\u0430, \u0423\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0437\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442 \u0443 \u041f\u0440\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438 \u0440\u0430\u0434, \u0421\u0420\u0415\u0414\u040a\u041e\u0412\u0408\u0415\u041a\u041e\u0412\u041d\u0418 \u041d\u0410\u0414\u0418\u041c\u0426\u0418 \u0423 \u0421\u0412\u0408\u0415\u0422\u041b\u0423 \u0414\u0423\u0411\u0420\u041e\u0412\u0410\u0427\u041a\u0418\u0425 \u0418\u0417\u0412\u041e\u0420\u0410, page 13 After a certain time Ratko's nickname became a family name inherited by his son Fran\u010desko.

It is possible that Fran\u010desko learned the skill of melting metal and engraving from his father-in-law, so he was able to prepare types for printing books on presses that belonged to Rusconi in 1512.: \"Ratkovic era genero di un maestro orafo, Pavel Antoevic; da costui Ratkovic potrebbe aver appreso l'arte di incidere e fondere i metalli. L'operazione non and\u00f2 a buon fine, ma evidentemente Ratkovic doveva aver comunque preparato i caratteri, se nel 1512 riusci a portare a termine l'impresa, affidandosi ai torchi di Rusconi\". Mihailo Dini\u0107 discovered in Ragusan archives that Micalovi\u0107 signed two contracts in his attempt to publish Cyrillic script books for Ragusan Catholics.Anica Nazor: Hrvatski \u0107irili\u010dki molitvenik iz 1512. godine, FILOLOGIJA 62(2014), 17\u201431 Micalovi\u0107 and \u0160u\u0161i\u0107 signed the first contract with Girolamo Soncino in Pesaro on 28 September 1510. It was agreed that Girolamo would print in his printing house several prayer books on Cyrillic script. On 31 July 1511 Micalovi\u0107 signed an agreement with Petar \u0110uro \u0160u\u0161i\u0107 in which Micalovi\u0107's name appears as Fran\u010desko. According to this agreement Micalovi\u0107 and \u0160u\u0161i\u0107 established a company in which Micalovi\u0107 invested his labor (personam suam) and contract he signed earlier with Soncino, while \u0160u\u0161i\u0107 invested 108 golden ducats.\u00bbTim ugovorom Micalovic i Su\u0161i\u0107 sklopi\u0161e na neograni\u00f6eno vrijeme druStvo, u koje prvi ulozi svoj rad (personam suam) i ugovor sklopljen 28 septembra g. 1510 sa Stamparom Jeronimom Son\u00f6inom (Soncino) u Pezaru po kojem je ovaj imao ... It was agreed that printed books were to be collected by Micalovi\u0107 who was obliged to distribute them in Dubrovnik (in a small shop he was to open for this purpose) and Serbia. On 20 August 1513 Micalovi\u0107 began his journey into the Ottoman controlled territory of the Balkans to sell prayer books he printed. On that date Micalovi\u0107 and \u0160u\u0161i\u0107 signed another contract in which Micalovi\u0107 was obliged to return to \u0160u\u0161i\u0107 all the money he received from selling prayer books.Anica Nazor: Hrvatski \u0107irili\u010dki molitvenik iz 1512. godine, FILOLOGIJA 62(2014), 17\u201431 == Cyrillic script Catholic prayer books == In 1512 Micalovi\u0107 printed two Catholic prayer books in Venice, in the printing house of Giorgio Rusconi (Zorzi Ruskoni) from Milano. One book is known as Officio (Officio Beatae Mariae Virginis) and the other as Molitvenik (Officio Sanctae Brigittae). Both books were printed in Cyrillic script with elements of Glagolitic in Shtokavian dialect after being translated from Chakavian.: \"Franjo Ratkovi\u0107 Micalovi\u0107 (Franciscus Ratchi Mizalovich) i sam Dubrov\u010danin. ... da je Molitvenik dubrova\u010dko \u0161tokavsko-jekavski spomenik unato\u010d tomu \u0161to se u njemu nalaze tragovi \u010dakavsko-ikavske redakcije iz koje je potekao.\" On 18 September 1512, immediately after his return to Ragusa, Micalovi\u0107 stated that two cases of Slavic books belonged to \u0110uro, father of Petar \u0160u\u0161i\u0107.: \"\u041e\u0441\u0430\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0433 \u0441\u0435\u043f\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0431\u0440\u0430 1512 \u0438\u0437\u0458\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043e \u0458\u0435 \u041c\u0438\u0446\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b, \u0447\u0438\u043c \u0458\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043e \u0443 \u0414\u0443\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a, \u0434\u0430 \u0434\u0432\u0430 \u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0443\u043a\u0430 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u045a\u0438\u0433\u0430 (in idiomate Sclavo) \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0430\u0458\u0443 \u0402\u0443\u0440\u0438 \u0428\u0443\u0448\u0438\u045b\u0443, \u043e\u0446\u0443 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0458\u0438 \u0458\u0435 \u0441\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0438\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0432\u0438 \u0443\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440 \u0441\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0446\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b\u0435\u043c, \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e ...\" The four-part icon from church in the Orthodox Monastery of Virgin Mary's Birth in village Sogle, \u010ca\u0161ka Municipality (near Veles, North Macedonia) have decorative elements painted under influence of Cyrillic Molitvenik printed by Micalovi\u0107. According to Dejan Medakovi\u0107, renaissance decorative elements of this 16th- century icon are directly copied from Molitvenik printed by Micalovi\u0107. == Polemics about the language == These two books were rediscovered to the scientific public in 1932 which initially referred to the language of these prayer books as Serbian language. In the contract signed by Micalovi\u0107 the language of the prayer book was referred to as \"in littera et idiomate serviano\" ().Anica Nazor: Hrvatski \u0107irili\u010dki molitvenik iz 1512. godine, FILOLOGIJA 62(2014), 17\u201431 Milan Re\u0161etar performed detailed analysis of the letters, content, style and language of the prayer book and concluded that it is the first book printed on Serbian vernacular language because Oktoih (printed in 1494) was printed in Church Slavonic language.Anica Nazor: Hrvatski \u0107irili\u010dki molitvenik iz 1512. godine, FILOLOGIJA 62(2014), 17\u201431: \"ali mali molitvenik \u0161to ga je g. 1512. izdao Dubrov\u010danin Fran\u010desko (Franjo) Ratkovi\u0107 ima prema njima tu veliku prednost da je srpski i po jeziku, dok su obje Crnojevi\u0107eve knjige na \u010disto crkvenoslavenskom jeziku\u00ab\" In 1938 Re\u0161etar, who was a Serb Catholic from Dubrovnik, published a prologue of the phototypic edition of Micalovi\u0107s books.
