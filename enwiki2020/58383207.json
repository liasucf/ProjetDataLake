    "text": "Slime punk is a slime-themed electronic music microgenre and visual aesthetic that emerged in the early 2010s. The music is heavily influenced by chopped and screwed acid-house soundscapes, 1990s Hi-NRG techno, and noise experimentation, and features use of synthesizers, drum machines, obscure samples, and heavy saw bass with vocal samples from 1990s cartoons The slime punk visual aesthetic includes artwork and fashion inspired from 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s youth culture and media, such as Slime Time Live, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The Toxic Avenger, Mountain Dew, Ghostbusters, and toxic waste as well as the usage of typographic elements such Unicode symbols, common within the range of internet genres which spawned from vaporwave. The genre is more obscure than some of its 2010s vaporwave subgenre cousins, but still has a dedicated following on the internet. ==References== Category:Electronic dance music genres Category:Fusion music genres Category:Trap music Category:Microgenres ",
