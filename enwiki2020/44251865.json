Switzerland sold three times more gold than any other country. Drastic decline in Swiss gold reserves occurred during 1997- 2005 The Swiss government and the Swiss National Bank (SNB), however, do not agree with this citizen movement and stepped up efforts to block the motion that would force the country to almost triple the amount of its gold reserves.Currency traders eye Swiss vote on gold holdings The group argue that gold is a barrier to devaluation of fiat paper currencies and that there is a key flaw in the system of floating paper currencies. When a currency moves, it creates winners and losers, big movements can harm banks with loan portfolios outside abroad. The group argues that gold is a barrier to debasement of fiat currencies. The movement was started by 3 Swiss People's Party politicians \u2013 Parliamentarians Luzi Stamm, Lukas Reimann and Ulrich Schl\u00fcer \u2013 the initiative to \"Save Switzerland's gold\" was handed in to the Federal Chancellery in 2013.
