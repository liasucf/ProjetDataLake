    "text": "Creamfields is an electronic dance music festival series founded and organised by British club promoter Cream, with its UK edition taking place on August Bank Holiday weekend, with a number of international editions held across various territories worldwide. First held in 1998 in Winchester, the festival moved to Cream's home city of Liverpool the following year, taking place on the old Liverpool airport, before moving to its current location on the Daresbury estate in Cheshire. The festival, having initially begun as a one- day event with 25,000 people in attendance, is now a four-day event with camping options hosting 70,000 per day. The festival is the UK's oldest and most prestigious electronic dance music festival. ==History== Creamfields initially began in 1998 as a one-day annual event run by the Liverpool night club Cream. This first edition was held in Winchester, Hampshire and attracted 25,000 people. The following year Creamfields moved to Liverpool, Merseyside, with the festival being on the old Liverpool Airfield. The move put the festival closer to its parent night club and the new site was able to hold 50,000 people for the festival. In 2002, Cream was demolished, however the brand continued to run the festival. 2006 saw the festival move outside the city to its current location in Daresbury, Cheshire. The 10th anniversary of the festival saw it expanded to a two-day event with 50,000 people attending across the weekend. The festival saw its site expand over the next few years after its first sell out in 2009 of 60,000 across in weekend. In 2010, the site was expanded for extra tickets sales and growing demand for campers. In addition to this, the festival sold out 80,000 tickets and again in 2011 with 100,000. In 2012 the festival ownership changed hands as Cream was bought out by Live Nation who are the current organisers of the event. In 2012, the festival was also set to expand to a three-day event, however, on the final day the festival was abandoned due to heavy rain. The following year a \u00a3500,000 investment into the site was made to protect it against bad weather. The three-day event allowed an attendance of 150,000. 2014 saw the edition of a second primary stage, the North and South Stage; and in 2015, the festival was live streamed for the first time seeing 500,000 online attendees. 2016 saw the introduction of the Steel Yard stage which spawned a spinoff mini-festival with events held in Liverpool and London, it also saw the festival become a four-day event with site expansion in 2017 allowing for a maximum attendance of 280,000. In 2019, a \u00a32,000,000 investment was made to improve security and safety as well as reducing environmental impact. The festival itself saw Creamfields host Swedish House Mafia in their Save the World Reunion Tour. The show was the supergroup's first UK show since 2012 and saw the group as the sole occupiers of the festival's iconic Arc Stage on the day of the event. The 2020 edition of the festival was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with a virtual festival taking its place.https://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/news/dance/9428677/creamfields- announces-august-virtual-event-featuring-never-before-seen-performances ===Edition's summary=== Nb: Artists shown in the table below were headliners for the event.
