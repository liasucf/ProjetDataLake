    "text": "Tango in Harlem is an album by saxophonist Teddy Edwards recorded in 1995 and originally released on the French Verve/Gitanes label the following year.Teddy Edwards catalog accessed February 27, 2018Teddy Edwards discography accessed February 27, 2018Enciclopedia del Jazz: Teddy Edwards accessed February 27, 2018 == Reception == In his review for BBC Music Magazine, Chris Parker stated \"In his most sympathetic recording situation for a while, and playing a judicious mix of standards and bluesy originals with a first class rhythm section, Teddy Edwards (who is 72 this month) has produced what is probably his finest album since Together Again!!!! and Teddy's Ready!, the latter also featuring Billy Higgins. Edwards\u2019s sound is elegant, deceptively easygoing and intensely melodic but is laced with enough post-bop astringency to lift him firmly out of the easy-listening category. On ballads such as \u2018The Nearness of You\u2019 and \u2018Old Folks\u2019, their momentum miraculously sustained through murderously slow tempos by excellent rhythm-section work, he savours every lingering note. On up-tempo, bustling pieces, his solos, while supremely logical, are imbued with his trademark relaxed swing. ... Overall, a superb performance from a mature master\".Parker, C.
