    "text": "The Wax Girl is a Canadian post-rock project founded by Toronto-based producer and composer Alex Wright, in 2012. ==History== ===Formation=== In January 2012, Wright began writing and recording cinematic demos as a creative outlet. Wright explained in an interview in 2014 that he initially used the moniker \"The Wax Girl\" out of necessity for categorizing his demos, and that the name first entered his mind after rearranging the letters of his own name. As Wright continued to write and record music, he realized that he wanted to further pursue developing his body of work, and the name stuck around.\"#MusicHangout with The Wax Girl\", Way Too Indie, 8 August 2014.
