    "text": "Potassium chromate is the inorganic compound with the formula (K2CrO4). This yellow solid is the potassium salt of the chromate anion. It is a common laboratory chemical, whereas sodium chromate is important industrially. ==Structure== Two crystalline forms are known, both being very similar to the corresponding potassium sulfate. Orthorhombic \u03b2-K2CrO4 is the common form, but it converts to an \u03b1-form above 66 \u00b0C.Gerd Anger, Jost Halstenberg, Klaus Hochgeschwender, Christoph Scherhag, Ulrich Korallus, Herbert Knopf, Peter Schmidt, Manfred Ohlinger, \"Chromium Compounds\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2005. These structures are complex, although the sulfate adopts the typical tetrahedral geometry.Gaultier, M.; Pannetier, G. \"Structure cristalline de la forme 'basse temperature' du sulfate de potassium K2SO4-beta\" (Crystal structure of the \"low temperature\" \u03b2-form of potassium sulfate) Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Chimique de France 1968, vol. 1, pp. 105-12.

In solution, the behavior of potassium and sodium dichromates are very similar. When treated with lead(II) nitrate, it gives an orange-yellow precipitate, lead(II) chromate. ==Applications== Unlike the less expensive sodium salt, potassium salt is mainly used for laboratory work in situations where an anhydrous salt is required. It is as an oxidizing agent in organic synthesis. It is used as in qualitative inorganic analysis, e.g. as a colorimetric test for silver ion. It is also used as an indicator in precipitation titrations with silver nitrate and sodium chloride (they can be used as standard as well as titrant for each other) as potassium chromate turns red in the presence of excess of silver ions. ==Occurrence== Tarapacaite is the natural, mineral form of potassium chromate. It occurs very rarely and until now is known from only few localities on Atacama Desert. ==Safety== As with other Cr(VI) compounds, potassium chromate is carcinogenic. The compound is also corrosive and exposure may produce severe eye damage or blindness. Human exposure further encompasses impaired fertility, heritable genetic damage and harm to unborn children. ==References== Category:Potassium compounds Category:Chromates Category:Oxidizing agents ",
