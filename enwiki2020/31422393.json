    "text": "The 1977 LPGA Championship was the 23rd LPGA Championship, played June 9\u201312 at the Gold Course of Bay Tree Golf Plantation in North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Chako Higuchi won her only major title, three strokes ahead of runners-up Pat Bradley, Sandra Post, and Judy Rankin. The purse was nearly tripled this year to $150,000, up from $55,000 in 1976. It was the first golf major to be held in South Carolina. The Bay Tree Golf Plantation courses were closed and abandoned in 2006. Since then, the Senior PGA Championship (2007), PGA Championship (2012, 2021), and the U.S. Women's Open (2019) have been held or are scheduled to be conducted in the state, with all four in the Charleston market. ==Past champions in the field== ===Made the cut=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Player || Country || Year(s) won || R1 || R2 || R3 || R4 || Total || To par || Finish |- | align=left|Sandra Post || align=left| || 1968 || 72 || 72 || 69 || 69 || 282 || \u22126 || T2 |- | align=left|Kathy Whitworth || 67 71 75 align=left| || 1967, 1971, 1975 || 73 || 70 || 71 || 72 || 286 || \u22122 || T10 |- |align=left|Mickey Wright || align=left| || 1958, 1960, 1961, 1963 || 75 || 76 || 73 || 70 || 294 || +6 || T21 |- | align=left|Mary Mills || align=left| || 1964, 1973 || 71 || 77 || 76 || 74 || 298 || +10 || T37 |- | align=left|Marlene Hagge || align=left| || 1956 || 76 || 73 || 78 || 73 || 300 || +12 || T44 |- | align=left|Gloria Ehret || align=left| || 1966 || 76 || 76 || 76 || 73 || 301 || +13 || T47 |- |} Source: ===Missed the cut=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Player || Country || Year won || R1 || R2 || Total || To par |- |align=left|Kathy Ahern || align=left| || 1972 || 82 || 74 || 156 || +12 |- | align=left|Betty Burfeindt || align=left| || 1976 || 80 || 79 || 159 || +15 |- |} Source: ==Final leaderboard== Sunday, June 12, 1977 {|class=\"wikitable\" !
