Her major claim to fame is winning the 101 km Ultra-Trail Courmayeur-Champex-Chamonix (CCC) in Chamonix, France, in 2016 by a margin of almost half an hour, and the 121 km Ultra-Trail Sur les Traces des Ducs de Savoie (TDS) in the same location, in 2017 by almost two hours and a half, improving the previous course record from 2015 by 46 minutes. Kotka is a member of the Swedish National Team in ultratrail. She participated in the 2015 IAU Trail World Championships, placing 8th. For a living she works as a nutritionist. In 2018 Kotka together with fellow athletes Ida Nilsson and Emelie Forsberg started Moonvalley, an online shop dedicated to organic energy bars and sports drinks. ==Running career== In a 2016 interview Kotka talked about her running background: \"I have always loved outdoor life and kept active with skiing, biking, hiking, diving, yoga but not running. But in 2010 I signed up to run Liding\u00f6loppet as a challenge and got obsessed with trail running while practicing for it. That was my thing! Then I took it easy in 2012, 2013 and in January 2014 I decided to go all in. Train more focused. It was a little too focused in 2015. I ran a lot and got injured. In 2016 I took it easier and now I seem to have found a formula that works. It is more fun than ever to run and my body thrives.\" ==Personal life== Kotka is of Finnish descent through her father who is from Finland. ==Results== Swiss Alpine Marathon passing the Keschh\u00fctte 2010 * 126th Liding\u00f6loppet , Sweden 2011 * 2nd Liding\u00f6 Ultra , Sweden * 13th Swiss Alpine Marathon , Switzerland * 23rd Liding\u00f6loppet , Sweden 2012 * 2nd Trail des Balcons d'Azur , France * 5th AXA Fj\u00e4llmaraton , Sweden 2014 * 2nd Kullamannen Ultra , Sweden * 3rd AXA Fj\u00e4llmaraton , Sweden * 2nd Ultravasan , Sweden * 1st Coastal Trail Series \u2013 Dorset Ultra 44 miles, UK 2015 * 8th IAU Trail WC Annecy , France 2016 * 1st Trail des Balcons d'Azur , France * 1st Trail du Lac d'Annecy \u2013 Marathon Race , France * 1st Gran Trail Courmayeur , Italy (2nd overall) * 1st Ultra-Trail Courmayeur-Champex-Chamonix (CCC) , France * 23rd Limone Extreme Skyrace , Italy 2017 * 1st Run Stockholm , Sweden * 1st Marathon du Mont Blanc , Italy * 3rd High Trail Vanoise , France * 1st Swiss Alpine Marathon , Switzerland * 1st Ultra-Trail Sur les Traces des Ducs de Savoie (TDS) , France (new course record) * 5th Grand Trail des Templiers , France * 1st Kullamannen Dubbel- D\u00f6den (English: Double Death) , Sweden 2018 * 1st Madeira Island Ultra-Trail , Portugal * 1st MaXi-Race International \u2013 Annecy , France (3rd overall) * 1st Samo\u00ebns Trail Tour - Tour du Giffre , France * 1st Marathon du Mont Blanc , France (second straight victory on a course that was 9k longer than the previous year) * 6th, Grand Raid de la R\u00e9union (aka La diagonale des fous) , R\u00e9union, France * 3rd, Ultra-Trail Cape Town , South Africa 2019 * 1st, UTM Mar\u00e3o , Portugal * 13th, Madeira Island Ultra-Trail , Portugal * 1st, La 6000D , France (5th overall) * 20th, Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc (UTMB) , France/Italy/Switzerland * 2nd, Ultra Pirineu , Spain ==References== ==External links== * *Mimmi Kotka's profile at DUV *Mimmi Kotka's profile at Kikourou *Mimmi Kotka's profile at ITRA Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Swedish ultramarathon runners Category:Swedish mountain runners Category:Swedish female long-distance runners Category:Female ultramarathon runners Category:Swedish sky runners Category:Swedish people of Finnish descent ",
