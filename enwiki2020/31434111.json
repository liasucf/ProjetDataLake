    "text": "Pandanaris convexa is an extinct cowbird genus described in 1947 by Alden H. Miller. ==Physiology== Pandanaris convexa has an upper mandible similar to that of the Tangavius and Molothrus cowbird genera (7.0 mm in length), though its narial opening is approximately 30% larger. In addition, Miller found that the species' internarial bridge was entirely different from other cowbirds and blackbirds. The species has a distinct \"even\" curvature of its culmen that is not found in any other icterid. ==References== Category:Icteridae Category:Quaternary birds Category:Extinct birds of North America Category:Taxa named by Alden H.
