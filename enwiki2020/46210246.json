The accompanying music video shows DeGraw singing by himself with scenes of past memories of his love interest. ==Background== \"Best I Ever Had\" was the first single from singer- songwriter Gavin DeGraw's fifth album, Make a Move. It was a collaboration with Boys Like Girls' lead singer and songwriter Martin Johnson. DeGraw explains the beginning of the creation of this song by saying, \"I'm sitting in the room with Martin Johnson, the guy I'd been writing with before who's really gifted, and he's like, 'Hey man, what do you think of this track?' He just starts playing this jangle-y, uptempo kind of thing, which ultimately was the foundation for 'Best I Ever Had.'\" ==Music video== The music video was released on DeGraw's YouTube page on YouTube/VEVO on August 6, 2013. It features shots of DeGraw, televisions showing videos of him singing, and past memories of his love interest. By the end of the video, he is singing with a band to a full audience. ==Cover versions== The song was covered by George Horga Jr. and Juhi in the Battle Rounds at the fifth season of The Voice. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2013) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2013) ! scope=\"col\"| position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Adult Top 40 (Billboard) | 49 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:Gavin DeGraw songs Category:Rock ballads Category:2013 singles Category:Pop ballads Category:Soul ballads Category:Songs written by Gavin DeGraw Category:2013 songs Category:RCA Records singles Category:Songs written by Martin Johnson (musician) Category:2010s ballads ",
