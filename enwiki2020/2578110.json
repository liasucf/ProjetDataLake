In the Holy Roman Empire, Windsheim held the rank of Imperial City (until 1802). Since 1810 Windsheim is part of Bavaria. In 1961, it became a spa town and has since been called \"Bad Windsheim\". ==Climate== The climate in this area shows only small differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The K\u00f6ppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \"Cfb\" (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).Climate Summary for Bad Windsheim (from Weatherbase.com) ==History== A document from 741 proves for the first time the existence of the town, then called Uuinidesheim. The name changed to \"Windsheim\" by linguistic development, meaning \"the home of the wind\". In the late stage of World War II, a Volkssturm battalion took control of the town and refused to surrender to the approaching American troops, declaring Windsheim a \"fortress\". American troops eventually captured the town after deploying fire bombs through aerial bombing. The civilian population was forced to flee from Windsheim under enemy fire. The town was rebuilt after the war. ==Attractions== The town is known for its waters and spa, Franken-Therme, and an open-air museum, the Freilandmuseum, which brings together old farms and farmhouses from the area.
