The riddle is almost universally solved as 'mead'.Helen Price, 'A Hive of Activity: Realigning the Figure of the Bee in the Mead-Making network of Exeter Book Riddle 27', Postmedieval: A Journal of Medieval Cultural Studies (2015), 1-19 (p. 1); doi:10.1057/pmed.2015.1; Wendy Hennequin, 'Commentary for Riddle 27' (8 September 2014), https://theriddleages.wordpress.com/2014/09/02/commentary-for-riddle-27-2/. ==Text== As edited by Krapp and Dobbie in the Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records series, Riddle 27 runs: > Ic eom weor\u00f0 werum, wide funden, > brungen of bearwum ond of burghleo\u00feum, > of denum ond of dunum.

However, in recent years commentary has emphasised how it undermines the association with mead in Old English heroic poetry with martial masculinity.Wendy Hennequin, 'Commentary for Riddle 27' (8 September 2014), https://theriddleages.wordpress.com/2014/09/02/commentary-for-riddle-27-2/. Other work has shown how the riddle not only elucidates Anglo-Saxons' relationships with bees, but has argued that the riddle enables us to chart the complex interrelations between humans and other ecological actors in the medieval past.Helen Price, 'A Hive of Activity: Realigning the Figure of the Bee in the Mead-Making network of Exeter Book Riddle 27', Postmedieval: A Journal of Medieval Cultural Studies (2015), 1-19; doi:10.1057/pmed.2015.1. ===Recordings=== * Michael D.
