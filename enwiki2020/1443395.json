Adams was educated at Impington Village College in Cambridge,\"Adams, Lewis Drummond\", Who's Who then started his career with British Rail at the age of 15,Union boss hops on board Virgin BBC News 19 October 1998 working his way up to become a steam locomotive driver. A local Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) trade union representative, Adams was voted in as General Secretary in 1994. Towards the right of the trade union political spectrum, he vigorously opposed the Conservative governments' privatisation of British Rail via the Railways Act 1993, and was attacked and labelled by the right wing tabloids, most famously as \"The Black Prince of Militancy\" by the Daily Mail during the 1995 rail strike.Curriculum vitae: Lew Adams BBC News - 19 October 1998 However, in 2004 Adams declared: \"I was vehement that we wanted to stay in the public sector, and of course there were all the usual concerns trade unionists have regarding privatization, safety issues, job losses, protecting the conditions of service, and pensions. But accepting the will of Parliament, it was time to look at the arguments. So we said to management, \u2018Well, if that\u2019s what you want, this is what we want.\u2019 Today I cannot argue against the private entrepreneur coming into the rail industry. We are running 1,700 more trains per day since it was privatized. The entrepreneurs built traffic to the extent that we are having to build more infrastructure. What is true is true: 4.2 billion pounds spent on new trains. We never saw that in all the years I\u2019ve been in the rail industry. All the time it was in the public sector, all we got were cuts, cuts, cuts. And today there are more members in the trade union, more train drivers, and more trains running. The reality is that it worked, we\u2019ve protected jobs, and we got more jobs. If a private company is making more money, I look at that from a union\u2019s point of view, \u2018Well, that looks like a wage increase to me.\u2019 And we can argue that. And the more secure they are and the more productive they are in delivering train services, well, that means more jobs. I was there when the public railways had some 600,000 people and it came down to 100,000 in the time I worked in the rail industry. Now we are expanding on jobs.\".Interview with Lew Adams, Board Member, Strategic Rail Authority, UK 26 November 2004 , on the Canadian Council for Public-Private Partnerships website In 1998, Adams had a Class 87 locomotive named after him by Virgin Rail Group boss Richard Branson using the same \"Black Prince\" name, the first union secretary to have such an honour since former ASLEF secretary William P.
