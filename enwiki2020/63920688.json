In February 2019, Wagner issued a public statement amid allegations of emotional abuse and support acts pulling out of Wagner's band (The Smith Street Band) national tour. Wagner issued a statement on his band's official Instagram account after emails dating back to 2013 were published on social media. Wagner said \"I'm not hiding from anything, I said some incredibly hurtful things that I completely regret. I ask that you make up your own minds based on what has actually been said rather than form an opinion based on someone else's version.\" The band's statement went on to thank people for their support. In September 2020, Wagner released Spiralling, a 7 track mini-album recorded at his bands off grid, solar powered studio, just before stage three restrictions were placed on regional Victoria.
