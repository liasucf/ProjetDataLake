Rowman & Littlefield, 2007. p.146 Ptolemy's map shows the city of Albanopolis (located Northeast of Durr\u00ebs). Ptolemy also mentions the Illyrian tribe named Albanoi, who lived around this city.William Smith, LLD, Ed., Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, 1854. Ptolemy is the earliest writer in whose works the name of the Albanians has been distinctly recognised. He mentions (3.13.23) a tribe called ALBANI (\u1f08\u03bb\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af) and a town ALBANOPOLIS (\u1f08\u03bb\u03b2\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2), in the region lying to the E. of the Ionian sea; and from the names of places with which Albanopolis is connected, it appears clearly to have been in the S. part of the Illyrian territory, and in modern Albania. There is no means of forming a conjecture on how the name of this obscure tribe came to be extended to so considerable a nation. The area was part of Roman Macedon, specifically the Epirus Nova subdivision.

The province, belonged to the Roman province of Macedonia.Handbook of Ancient Geography and History by Ptz Wilhelm, , The (734) southern portion, or Illyria Graeca, belonged to the province of Macedonia.Atlas of Classical History by R.

Dyrrachium (or Epidamnus) was established as the capital of Epirus nova.Hendry, p. 299. The geography is entirely correct for Servius' time, since Diocletian's rearrangement of provincial boundaries included the creation of the province of Epirus Nova out of southern Illyricum with Dyrrachium (=Epidamnus) as its capital.

It is disputed, however, whether the \"Albanoi\" of the events of 1043 refers to Albanians in an ethnic sense or whether \"Albanoi\" is a reference to Normans from Sicily under an archaic name (there was also tribe of Italy by the name of \"Albanoi\").The wars of the Balkan Peninsula: their medieval origins G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series Authors Alexandru Madgearu, Martin Gordon Editor Martin Gordon Translated by Alexandru Madgearu Edition illustrated Publisher Scarecrow Press, 2008 , It was supposed that those Albanoi from 1042 were Normans from Sicily, called by an archaic name (the Albanoi were an independent tribe from Southern Italy), p. 25 However a later reference to Albanians from the same Attaliates, regarding the participation of Albanians in a rebellion in 1078, is undisputed.The wars of the Balkan Peninsula: their medieval origins G - Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series Authors Alexandru Madgearu, Martin Gordon Editor Martin Gordon Translated by Alexandru Madgearu Edition illustrated Publisher Scarecrow Press, 2008 , It was supposed that those Albanoi from 1042 were Normans from Sicily, called by an archaic name (the Albanoi were an independent tribe from Southern Italy).
