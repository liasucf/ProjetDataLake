On September 10, 2013, Howard released a new single called \"Switch\" which was supposed to be the lead single off the album. It received positive reviews, and won \"Best Dance/Club Single of the Year\" at the 2013 UB Honors, which was voted by the public. Howard announced in November 2014 that she signed a new label deal with SMG/Sony Red in addition to news of a new single \"Bad 4 Me\" set for release in December. She released a cover of Amy Winehouse's \"Love is a Losing Game\" in January 2015 to media outlets.
