The primary election will take place on September 21 and in races where no one candidate gets a majority of the votes, the top two move on to the Nov. 2 general election. The general election is held on the Saturday immediately following the first Friday of November every four years. Enrolled citizens, 18 years of age and above are eligible to register to vote in Muscogee (Creek) Nation elections. Incumbent Principal Chief James R. Floyd announced in June 2019 that he will not seek re-election for that position while Second Chief Louis Hicks is unable to seek re-election due to term limits. == Candidate Eligibility == Muscogee (Creek) Nation Territory {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\" |+Eligible Voters !District !Number of Voters |- |Creek |2,091 |- |McIntosh |2,135 |- |Muskogee |1,179 |- |Okfuskee |1,729 |- |Okmulgee |3,940 |- |Tukvptce |1,540 |- |Tulsa |3,468 |- |Wagoner |847 |- |Total |16,929 |} Employees of Muscogee (Creek) nation that file for candidacy must file for a leave of absence from their employment from the day they file for candidacy until the day after the elections. == Candidates == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\" |+Important Election Dates |Candidate Filing Period |July 15 - July 17 |- |Early Primary Voting |September 18&19 |- |Primary Election |September 21 |- |Early General Voting |October 30&31 |- |General Election |November 2 |} === Principal Chief === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Candidate Name !Slogan !Notes |- |Steve Bruner |Better with Bruner |Former Speaker of National Council |- |David Hill |Prosperity and Progress for All Mvskokvlke |Current National Council representative for the Creek District |- |George Tiger | |Former principal chief |- |Monte Randall |#DR4Chief |Former Dean of Academic Affairs at Tribal College |- |Lucian Tiger III | |National Council Speaker |- |Joseph Rogers Jr. | |Tulsa construction business owner |- |Brenda Golden | |Okmulgee attorney |- |Jackie Jackson | |Planning Director for the Otoe-Missouria Tribe |- |Timothy Good Voice | |Thlopthlocco Tribal Town Administrator |- |Samuel Alexander | |Tulsa District Representative |} === Second Chief === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Candidate Name !Notes |- |Del Beaver |Okmulgee District Representative |- |Adam Jones III |McIntosh District Representative |} === National Council === {| class=\"wikitable\" !Creek District A !McIntosh District A !Muskogee District A !Okfuskee District A !Okmulgee District A !Tukvpvtee District A !Tulsa District A !Wagoner District A |- |Joseph Hicks Dode Warrington Barnett Dean Hughes Jr. |Darrell Proctor Charles Colbert |Mary Crawford Lora Harjo-King Jessina Brown |Randall Hicks Bert Robinson |Grover Wind Carmin Tecumseh- Williams William Lowe Patrick Moore Brian Jones |Rufus Scott Edwin Marshall Anna Marshall |Jerry Wilson Cynthia Tiger Robert Hufft |Dierdra Soap Pamela Snyder-Osmun Charles McHenry Terri Jorgensen |} Source: == Primary Elections == On September 21, the primary elections took place with nearly 5,000 voters. On September 28, the election board announced the official results. On October 2, the MCN Supreme Court nullified the results of the MCN Primary Election following receipt of petitions alleging fraud, irregularities, and recount of absentee ballots. The MCN election board announced November 2 as the new primary election date. The November 2 election resulted in no changes in the winner of each race. In the Tulsa District Seat A race, Cynthia Tiger and Jerry Wilson withdrew after the Sept. 21 primary, leaving the incumbent, Robert Hufft as the winner of that race. In the Okfuskee and McIntosh races, the winning candidate received a super majority and avoided the need to participate in the general elections. Del Beaver defeated Adam Jones III 3,480 votes to 1,535 which meant that the second chief election would not be held during the general election. === September 21 Nullified Results === {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Principal Chief !Candidate !Votes !% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |David Hill |1272 |25.44% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Bim Steve Bruner |1039 |20.78% |- |Lucian Tiger |1029 |20.58% |- |Monte Randal |617 |12.34% |- |Timothy Good Voice |306 |6.12% |- |Brenda Golden |261 |5.22% |- |Jackie Jackson |168 |3.36% |- |George Tiger |135 |2.70% |- |Samuel Alexander |125 |2.50% |- |Joseph Rogers |48 |0.96% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Second Chief !Candidate !Votes !% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Del Beaver |3065 |63.05% |- |Adam Jones |1798 |36.95% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Creek (Seat A) !Candidate !Votes !% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Dean Hughes |1819 |38.66% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Joseph Hicks |1492 |31.71% |- |Dode Warrington-Barnett |1394 |29.63% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+McIntosh (Seat A) !Candidate !Votes !% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Darrell Proctor |3181 |68.64% |- |Charles Colbert |1453 |31.36% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Muskogee (Seat A) !Candidate !Votes !% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Lora Harjo-King |1891 |41.45% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Mary Crawford |1708 |37.44% |- |Jessina Brown |963 |21.11% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Wagoner (Seat A) !Candidate !Votes !% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Charles McHenry |2042 |43.74% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Dierdra Soap |1410 |30.20% |- |Terri Jorgensen |839 |17.97% |- |Pamela Snyder-Osmun |378 |8.10% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Okfuskee (Seat A) !Candidate !Votes !% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Randall Hicks |3031 |65.65% |- |Bert Robison |1586 |34.35% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Okmulgee (Seat A) !Candidate !Votes !% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Carmin Tecumseh-Williams |1384 |28.99% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |William Lowe |1059 |22.18% |- |Grover Wind |1056 |22.12% |- |Brian Jones |677 |14.18% |- |Patrick Moore |598 |12.53% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Tulsa (Seat A) !Candidate !Votes !% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Robert Hufft |2974 |63.04% |- |Cynthia Tiger |1053 |22.32% |- |Jerry Wilson |691 |14.65% |} === November 2 Primary Results === {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Principal Chief !Candidate !Votes !% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |David Hill |1966 |38.27% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Bim Steve Bruner |1172 |22.81% |- |Lucian Tiger |1161 |22.60% |- |Monte Randal |496 |9.66% |- |Timothy Good Voice |254 |4.94% |- |Samuel Alexander |88 |1.71% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Second Chief !Candidate !Votes !% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Del Beaver |3480 |69.39% |- |Adam Jones |1535 |30.60% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Creek (Seat A) !Candidate !Votes !% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Dean Hughes |1687 |34.75% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Joseph Hicks |1760 |36.25% |- |Dode Warrington-Barnett |1408 |29.00% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+McIntosh (Seat A) !Candidate !Votes !% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Darrell Proctor |3347 |69.76% |- |Charles Colbert |1451 |30.24% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Muskogee (Seat A) !Candidate !Votes !% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Lora Harjo-King |2165 |45.63% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Mary Crawford |1746 |36.80% |- |Jessina Brown |834 |17.58% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Wagoner (Seat A) !Candidate !Votes !% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Charles McHenry |2328 |48.07% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Dierdra Soap |1712 |35.35% |- |Terri Jorgensen |803 |16.58% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Okfuskee (Seat A) !Candidate !Votes !% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Randall Hicks |3242 |67.39% |- |Bert Robison |1569 |32.61% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Okmulgee (Seat A) !Candidate !Votes !% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Carmin Tecumseh-Williams |1509 |30.83% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |William Lowe |1248 |25.50% |- |Grover Wind |1149 |23.47% |- |Brian Jones |554 |11.32% |- |Patrick Moore |435 |8.89% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Tulsa (Seat A) !Candidate !Votes !% |-style=\"background:#595959;color: white\" |Robert Hufft |Unchallenged |100% |- |Cynthia Tiger |Withdrew |0.00% |- |Jerry Wilson |Withdrew |0.00% |} == General Election == On December 14, the general election was held and three days later on December 17, 2019 the unofficial final election results were released showing David Hill as the front runner for the Principal Chief race.
