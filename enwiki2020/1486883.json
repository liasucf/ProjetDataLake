Instead it was inspired partly by myth, and partly by a troll that appears in Poul Anderson's Three Hearts and Three Lions.\"Trolls, however, are not identified well by the Professor; these game monsters are taken from myth, influenced somewhat by Poul Anderson.\" This includes their appearance\u2014tall and thin humanoids with long noses and rubbery skin\u2014their ability to \"regenerate\" (that is, for their bodies to heal wounds extremely rapidly), and their weakness to fire.

The hide of trolls is rubbery, and usually either moss green, putrid grey, or mottled gray and green. Their coarse hair is typically iron grey, or greenish- black. Trolls initially seem to be somewhat shorter, due to their sagging shoulders and tendency to hunch forward. They walk with an uneven gait, and their arms dangle and drag the ground when running. Despite this apparent awkwardness, trolls are quite agile. Trolls are infamous for their regenerative abilities, able to recover from the most grievous of wounds or regenerate entire limbs given time. Severing a troll's head results merely in temporary incapacitation, rather than death. After cutting off a troll's head or other limbs, one must seal the wounds with fire or acid to prevent regeneration. Because of this, most adventurers will typically carry some sort of implement capable of creating fire. ===Alignment=== Trolls are usually chaotic evil. ==Society== Trolls speak Giant, and usually worship Vaprak the Destroyer. ==Troll variants== * Black troll \u2013 Also known as Demon Trolls, these horned trolls reside in the Abyss and possess powerful magical abilities. * Blood troll \u2013 Lawful evil red-skinned trolls who often serve devils. * Cave troll \u2013 Powerful, feral trolls that often live underground. * Crystalline troll \u2013 Charismatic troll with crystalline skin. * Deep sea troll \u2013 These trolls have a primal connection to water.

Includes variant Halruuan mountain troll. * Mur-Zhagul \u2013 Planetouched creatures descended from the mingling of trolls and demons. * Phaze troll \u2013 Mutated by great concentrations of magic or Underdark radiations, these trolls possess some magical powers and are more intelligent than their brethren. * Pseudo-troll \u2013 Troll from the Far Realm with the pseudonatural creature template. * Rock troll \u2013 Trolls with an affinity for earth, they possess natural camouflage in areas of stone.

These are usually unique to the Mystara setting. * Trollhound \u2013 Wolf-like creatures that share many of the same traits as trolls, including the powerful regenerative capabilities. They often associate with trolls. * Gnoll \u2013 Back when the Gnoll creature was still in development, it was meant to be a hybrid between a Gnome and a Troll (hence the name Gnoll). The designers abandoned the hybrid idea and gave the name to a creature with a Hyena-like appearance for unknown reasons. ==Critical reception== The troll was ranked second among the ten best mid-level monsters by the authors of Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies. The authors described the troll as \"a great mid-level monster that can challenge heroes for a number of levels\" noting that \"the troll is the players' first introduction to a regenerating monster \u2013 a creature that's almost impossible to kill unless you've got fire handy\". ==Miniatures== Trolls appear in the D&D; Miniatures: Harbinger set #77 (2003). ==Other publishers== The troll is fully detailed in Paizo Publishing's book Classic Monsters Revisited (2008), on pages 58\u201363.Baur, Wolfgang, Jason Bulmahn, Joshua J.
