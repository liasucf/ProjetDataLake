Finlay continued to progress through the age groups earning his first professional contract with the club on his sixteenth birthday. He made his first team debut for Dundee in the final game of the 2018\u201319 Scottish Premiership season against St Mirren. New manager James McPake introduced Robertson into the first team squad for the 2019\u201320 season. After an impressive start to his rookie season, Robertson earned a call-up to the Scotland U19 squad for two matches against Japan in September 2019. Robertson received consistent praise regarding his performances while being such a young age, becoming a first-team regular for the Dee and earning several Man of the Match and SPFL Team of the Week nominations. Despite his first senior season finishing early due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Finlay was named as Dundee's Isobel Sneddon Young Player of the Year. In September 2020, Finlay signed a three-year extension with Dundee, keeping him at the club until 2023. ==Career Statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Club ! rowspan=\"2\" |Season ! colspan=\"3\" |League ! colspan=\"2\" |National Cup ! colspan=\"2\" |League Cup ! colspan=\"2\" |Other ! colspan=\"2\" |Total |- !Division !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Dundee |2018\u201319 |Scottish Premiership |1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |2019\u201320 | rowspan=\"2\" |Scottish Championship |16||0||0||0||5||0||0||0||21||0 |- |2020\u201321 |1||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||2||0 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Career total !18!!0!!0!!0!!6!!0!!0!!0!!24!!0 |} ==References== Category:Living people Category:2002 births Category:Dundee F.C. players Category:Scottish footballers Category:Scottish Professional Football League players Category:Footballers from Dundee Category:Association football midfielders ",
