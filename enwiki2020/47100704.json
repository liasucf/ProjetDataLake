    "text": "Saint Mary's Battery (), also known as Qolla s-Safra Battery () or Gironda Battery (), was an artillery battery in Marsalforn, limits of \u017bebbu\u0121, Gozo, Malta. It was built by the Order of Saint John in 1715 as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands. The battery formed part of a chain of fortifications built to defend Marsalforn and nearby bays from Ottoman or Barbary attacks. Although the area was fortified by a number of towers, batteries, redoubts and entrenchments, all of these have been destroyed except for Qolla l-Bajda Battery between Qbajjar and Xwejni Bays. The battery consisted of a semi-circular gun platform ringed by a parapet, and two blockhouses joined together by a wall. It has been demolished and no remains can be seen. ==References== Category:Batteries in Malta Category:Castles and fortifications of the Knights Hospitaller Category:Military installations established in 1715 Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Malta Category:\u017bebbu\u0121, Gozo Category:Limestone buildings in Malta Category:18th-century fortifications Category:1715 establishments in Malta ",
