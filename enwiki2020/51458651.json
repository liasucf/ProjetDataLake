It is considered to be an alligatoroid, but its exact phylogeny is uncertain. ==Taxonomy== The type species, P. huiningensis, was originally named Eoalligator huiningensis.Young CC. 1982. A Cenozoic crocodile from Huaining, Anhui. Selected Works of Yang Zhongjian. China: Academia Sinica. 47-48 However, the type species of Eoalligator, E. chunyii, is more closely related to crocodiles than to alligators, so in 2016 the new genus Protoalligator was coined for \"E.\" huiningensis.Wang Y, Sullivan C, Liu J.
