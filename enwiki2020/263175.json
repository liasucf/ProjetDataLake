    "text": "Air West Fairchild F-27A in 1970 at San Francisco International Airport Hughes Airwest was an airline in the western United States, backed by Howard Hughes' Summa Corporation. The airline's original name was Air West. Hughes Airwest flew routes in the western U.S. and to several destinations in Mexico and Canada; it was purchased by Republic Airlines on October 1, 1980. Its headquarters were on the grounds of San Francisco International Airport (SFO) in unincorporated San Mateo County, California.\"World Airline Directory.\" Flight International. April 28, 1979. 1379. The company slogan was Top Banana in the West. == History == On April 17, 1968, three \"local service\" airlines in the western U.S. merged to form Air West: * Pacific Air Lines, which previously operated as Southwest Airways when it was founded in 1941, was based in San Francisco and flew along the coast and also California's Central Valley, linking cities from Medford, Oregon, to Southern California. Pacific operated Boeing 727-100s and Fairchild F-27s in 1968. * Bonanza Air Lines routes reached west from its Phoenix base to Southern California and north to Las Vegas, Reno and Salt Lake City. Bonanza flew Douglas DC-9-10s and Fairchild F-27s in 1968, with a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 on order, delivered after the merger. * West Coast Airlines, based at Boeing Field in Seattle, served the Pacific Northwest, Idaho, Utah, Montana and northern California. West Coast operated Douglas DC-9-10s, Fairchild F-27s and Piper Navajos in 1968. The initial Air West fleet included Boeing 727-100s, Douglas DC-9s, Fairchild F-27s, and Piper Navajos. The first new addition to the Air West fleet was a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 which had been ordered by Bonanza Air Lines. Hungry for another adventure in the airline industry, TWA's former owner Howard Hughes sought the airline in 1968, and the deal was finalized in 1970. The airline was renamed Hughes Air West and its call sign became \"Hughes Air.\" It expanded to several cities in the western United States, Canada and Mexico. With the new yellow paint scheme, unveiled 28 September 1971, the airline began calling itself Hughes Airwest, two words instead of the initial three word name. The airline participated in some movies in the 1970s, notably The Gauntlet with Clint Eastwood and Sondra Locke in 1977. Eastwood's character arrives in Las Vegas from Phoenix on the airline and when he phones the airport for flight departure times, Locke's character sarcastically called the airline, \"Air Worst.\" Also in 1977, the airline was operating service from both Burbank (BUR) and Orange County (SNA) to Denver (DEN) via an interchange flight agreement with the original Frontier Airlines (1950-1986).http://www.departedflights.com, 1977 Frontier Airlines Annual Report, route map Hughes Airwest would then subsequently introduce its own jet service to Denver from a number of cities in the western U.S. Like other local service airlines in the 1970s, Hughes Airwest eliminated many stops and opened longer routes. Service expanded to resorts in Mexico; domestic routes didn't reach east of Utah and Arizona until Denver, Des Moines, Milwaukee, and Houston Hobby Airport were added in 1978. Hughes Airwest became an all-jet airline with Boeing 727-200s, Douglas DC-9-10s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s when it ended Fairchild F-27 turboprop flights in 1979. In September 1979 the airline was grounded for two months by a walkout by their ticket agents, reservations handlers, and office employees, who had been without a contract for over a year. During 1979 several airlines showed interest in buying Hughes Airwest, including Alaska and Allegheny, with the latter soon becoming USAir. The strike was resolved in late October and flights resumed in November. Four months later they were the target of a buyout by Republic Airlines, which was finalized on October 1, 1980, for $38.5 million. Republic had been formed in July 1979 via the merger of North Central Airlines and Southern Airways, the first under airline deregulation. Republic was acquired by Northwest Airlines in 1986, which in turn was merged into Delta Air Lines in 2010. {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Revenue Passenger-Miles (Millions) |+(Sched Service Only) |- ! !!

Its new headquarters were located in San Mateo.Standard & Poor's Register of Corporations, Directors and Executives, Volume 3. Standard & Poor's, 1976. p. 638. \"Hughes Air Corp d/b/a Hughes Airwest Airlines, 3125 Clearview Way, San Mateo, Cal.\" The airline scheduled the move to a new headquarters from Thursday August 25, 1973, to August 28, 1973. The complex was on a hill overlooking San Mateo and San Francisco Bay. The airline relocated two departments from the offices at San Francisco International Airport: flight control and reservations.\"'Big Move' under way to new international headquarters in San Mateo.\" (Archive) Hughes Airwest newsletter. August 1973. Vol. 5, No. 8. p. 1. ==Livery== Air West paint scheme, prior to conversion to Sundance Yellow and Universe Blue (simulated image) Hughes Airwest DC-9s in 1979 Hughes Airwest's planes were recognizable by their banana-yellow fuselage and tail colors.Hughes promoted their new colors as \"Sundance Yellow\" and \"Universe Blue.\" The blue has sometimes been described as purple, but this is an optical illusion when viewed on the yellow expanse of aircraft hull. Since these were not standards-compliant color names, the exact color values are uncertain, and can only be approximated by examining color photographs of Hughes Airwest aircraft. Their airplanes were often dubbed \"flying bananas\" and the airline launched an advertising campaign with the catchphrase \"Top Banana in the West.\" Most nicknames given to Hughes Airwest airplanes in aviation books and magazines have to do with bananas. Apart from their all- yellow scheme, the airplanes also featured a blue logo on the vertical stabilizer (tail) that resembled three diamonds connected (possibly a reference to the initials of Howard Hughes). The name Hughes Airwest, in stylized lettering, was featured unconventionally below the front passenger windows. This livery was devised by the southern California design firm of Mario Armond Zamparelli,http://www.marioarmondzamparelli.com/html/awards.htmlhttp://www.marioarmondzamparelli.com/html/P2-1.html following the crash of Flight 706 in June 1971, caused by a mid-air collision with a U.S. Marine Corps F-4B jet fighter near Duarte, California. In late 1971, the company launched a new marketing campaign which included new colors and repainted planes. The cabin windows also had a metallized PET film coating originally, but this proved too costly to maintain. Zamparelli also designed the uniforms of the flight attendants in the new colors, primarily in Sundance Yellow trimmed with Universe Blue. After the sale in October 1980 the all- yellow paint scheme was gradually replaced by Republic's white with blue and green trim, and the mallard \"Herman the Duck.\" == Fleet == Air West and Hughes Airwest operated the following aircraft types at various times during their existence: * 49 Douglas DC-9-14/15/31/32 (includes 17 Douglas DC-9-10s and 32 McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s. Bonanza Air Lines and West Coast Airlines both operated DC-9-10s when they merged with Pacific Air Lines) * 3 Boeing 727-193 (operated by Air West and previously operated by Pacific Air Lines) * 11 Boeing 727-2M7 plus two on order which were delivered to Republic Airlines (1979-1986) * 1 de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter * 34 Fairchild F-27 (Bonanza Air Lines, Pacific Air Lines and West Coast Airlines all operated F-27s when the three carriers merged) * ? Piper Navajo (PA-31 model) (operated by Air West until 1969-70; previously operated by West Coast Airlines) ==Accidents and incidents== ===Hughes Airwest Flight 706=== On the evening of Sunday, June 6, 1971, Hughes Airwest Flight 706, a Douglas DC-9-31, departed Los Angeles, California, for Seattle, Washington, with five intermediate stops. The DC-9 collided in mid-air with a U.S. Marine Corps F-4B fighter over southern California near Duarte, killing all except the radar intercept officer of the F-4. ===1972 hijacking=== Two months after the celebrated hijacking by D. B. Cooper of Northwest Orient flight 305, Hughes Airwest was the target of a copycat hijacker in early 1972. After boarding Flight 800 at McCarran airport in Las Vegas in late morning on Thursday, January 20, 23-year-old Richard Charles LaPoint claimed he had a bomb while the plane was on the taxiway and demanded $50,000 cash, two parachutes, and a helmet. When these demands were met, 51 Reno-bound passengers and two flight attendants were released; the DC-9 departed eastward toward Denver, followed by two F-111 aircraft of the U.S. Air Force from nearby Nellis AFB. The parachutes were high-visibility and equipped with emergency locater devices. Without a coat and in cowboy boots, the hijacker bailed out from the lower aft door over the treeless plains of northeastern Colorado in mid-afternoon. He was apprehended a few hours later, with minor injuries and very cold. The plane, with two pilots and a flight attendant on board, landed safely at Denver's Stapleton airport at 2:55 p.m. MST. Facing potential death penalty charges for air piracy, the Vietnam veteran, a former U.S. Army paratrooper, was sentenced to forty years, but served less than eight and was released from a halfway house in 1979. He died at age 60 in New Hampshire in 2008. == Destinations == ===Air West in July 1968=== This is a list of destinations taken from the Air West system timetable dated July 1, 1968 when the merger to form Air West became effective.http://www.timetableimages.com, July 1, 1986 Air West system timetable Cities served with jets are noted in bold.
