    "text": "The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;) Barton Wright 4-4-0 was four- coupled eight-wheeled bogie express engine which entered service in 1880. ==Design and construction== Locomotive superintendent William Barton Wright ordered the first eight of the type in 1879 from Sharp Stewart and Company for the Hellifield\u2212Chatburn line. Sharp Stewart supplied a further 16 in 1881 with Neilson and Company supplying 20 in 1883 and 10 in 1884, the latter having Joy valve gear. The final batches Barton Wright batches went back to link motion: 20 from Kitson & Co. in 1885 and 20 from Vulcan Foundry up to 1886. Following Barton Wright's resignation and John Apsinall's appointment the final 16 ordered from Vulcan Foundry delivered in 1887 had 4in longer wheelbase between the driving wheels, Timmis springs on the eight axles, and bogie wheels reduced to permitting straight main frames and a horizontal grate. Subsequent developments based on the design were the Aspinall L&YR; Class 2 of which 30 were ordered from Beyer Peacock with Joy valve gear and 160psi boilers and other variations and the L&YR; Class 3 with driving wheels. ==Service== The driving wheels were suited to more challenging routes but on a non arduous route the Ramsbottom 2-4-0s could be faster. Smaller tenders were initially necessary until bigger turntables were installed. Most were withdrawn in the early 1900s with only two, Nos. 922 and 924 going past 1914 to be classified Class 2 by Hughes in 1919 and passing by amalgamation into the LNWR and finally becoming London Midland and Scottish Railway Nos. 10100 and 10101 respectively before withdrawal in November 1930. ==1887 Royal Jubilee Exhibition== One of the final Vulcan Foundry batch with 3 ft bogie wheels batch was exhibited at the Royal Jubilee Exhibition, Manchester 1887. ==Notes== == References == == Bibliography == * * Category:4-4-0 locomotives Category:Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1880 Category:Standard gauge steam locomotives of Great Britain Category:Scrapped locomotives ",
