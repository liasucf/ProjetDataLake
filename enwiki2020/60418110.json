Its nearest higher peak is Mount Kerkeslin, to the southwest, and Mount Hardisty is situated to the northwest. All three are part of the Maligne Range. Evelyn Peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Cambrian period and pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. The mountain is located at the headwaters of Evelyn Creek, and three kilometers south of Evelyn Pass. The creek and pass were named in 1921 for Evelyn Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire (1870\u20131960), who visited nearby Maligne Lake in 1920. The mountain's name however, has not yet been officially adopted by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Evelyn Peak is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.
