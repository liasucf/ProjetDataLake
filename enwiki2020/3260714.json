It serves the town of Dungog opening on 14 August 1911.\"NSWRail.net: Dungog Station NSWrail.net Originally built with only one face, in 1944 the platform was converted to an island platform and the present station building constructed.Dungog Railway Station NSW Environment & Heritage ==Platforms & services== Dungog has an island platform with two faces. It also has a passing loop to the east of the station. It is the terminating point for NSW TrainLink's Hunter line services from Newcastle and a stopping point for NSW TrainLink XPT services. There are five local services to/from Newcastle on weekdays, with three per day on weekends and public holidays. Each day northbound XPT services operate to Grafton, Casino and Brisbane, with three southbound services operating to Sydney. This station is a request stop for the southbound Casino XPT, so this service stops here only if passengers booked to board/alight here. Usually the XPTs use Platform 1, and the terminating services Platform 2, but these can be alternated for operational reasons. ==Gallery== File:Dungog railway station centre of platform.JPG|Looking towards station building in centre of platform File:Dungog_railway_station_platform_2.JPG|Hunter railcar on platform 2 File:Dungog railway station end of platform 1.JPG|End of platform 1 File:Dungog railway station looking west on platform 1.JPG|Looking towards station building from end of platform 1 File:Dungog railway station looking west.JPG|Looking west on the platforms File:Dungog railway station east end between platforms.jpg|Area between platforms at east end File:Dungog_railway_station_entrance.JPG|Entrance File:Dungog railway station level crossing.JPG|Level crossing File:Dungog railway ramp.JPG|Ramp entry to platforms ==References== ==External links== * *Dungog station details Transport for New South Wales Category:Easy Access railway stations in New South Wales Category:Railway stations in the Hunter Region Category:Railway stations in Australia opened in 1911 Category:Regional railway stations in New South Wales Category:North Coast railway line, New South Wales ",
