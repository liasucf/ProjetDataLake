    "text": "Publius Galerius Trachalus was a Roman senator, who was active during the middle of the first century AD. He was consul for the year 68 as the colleague of Silius Italicus.Paul A. Gallivan, \"Some Comments on the Fasti for the Reign of Nero\", Classical Quarterly, 24 (1974), pp. 292, 311 Trachalus was a noted Roman orator praised by Quintilian.Institutes 10.1.119 Hailing from Ariminum, Trachalus is thought to possibly be a descendant of the equites Gaius Galerius, praefectus or governor of Egypt (AD 16-23).Werner Eck, \"Galerius (4)\", Brill's New Pauly, Volume 4 (Stuttgart:Metzler, 1998), Col. 758 He was also likely related to Galeria Fundana, the second wife of Otho.Gwyn Morgan, 69 A.D., the Year of Four Emperors (Oxford: University Press, 2006), p. 77 An inscription from Mediolanum (modern Milan), now lost, attests that Trachalus had been co-opted into the Septemviri epulones, one of the four most prestigious ancient Roman priesthoods. Trachalus' skill in oratory and at the bar led Otho, upon becoming Emperor during the Year of the Four Emperors (AD 69), to make him an advisor.Tacitus Histories I.90.2 However, with the suicide of Otho and the advent of his rival Vitellius to Rome and imperial power, the life of Trachalus was in danger. Here he was protected by Vitellius' wife Galeria.Tacitus, Histories, II.60 Trachalus managed to evade further danger in that tumultuous year and was permitted to be governor of Africa proconsularis for the term 78/79.Werner Eck, \"Jahres- und Provinzialfasten der senatorischen Statthalter von 69/70 bis 138/139\", Chiron, 12 (1982), p. 300 It is unknown whether Trachalus had any children or if he was married. ==References== Category:1st-century Romans Category:People of the Year of the Four Emperors Category:Imperial Roman consuls Category:Roman governors of Africa Category:Epulones of the Roman Empire Trachalus, Publius ",
