    "text": "Lyall Scott (1835 - 3 April 1887) was a Scottish-born Australian politician. He was born at Balwyllo to farmers Robert Scott and Susana Lyall. He migrated to New South Wales around 1852 and worked as a timber merchant and clerk. On 17 December 1858 he married Mary Louisa Pashley; although this union resulted in no children, a second marriage on 10 March 1866 to Martha Matilda Pashley resulted in three. In 1885 he was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Wollombi, but he resigned a year later due to ill health and died in Sydney in 1887. ==References== Category:1835 births Category:1887 deaths Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:19th- century Australian politicians ",
