ChestertonThe Catholic literary revival is a term that has been applied to a movement towards explicitly Catholic allegiance and themes among leading literary figures in FranceRichard Griffiths, The Reactionary Revolution: The Catholic Revival in French Literature 1870-1914 (Constable, 1966). and England,Ian Ker, The Catholic Revival in English Literature (1845\u20131961): Newman, Hopkins, Belloc, Chesterton, Greene, Waugh (University of Notre Dame Press, 2003). roughly in the century from 1860 to 1960. This often involved conversion to Catholicism or a conversion-like return to the Catholic Church. The phenomenon is sometimes extended to the United States. ==France== French authors sometimes grouped in a Catholic literary revival include L\u00e9on Bloy, J. K. Huysmans, Charles P\u00e9guy,Brian Sudlow, Catholic Literature and Secularization in France and England, 1880-1914 (Manchester University Press, 2011). Paul Claudel, Georges Bernanos and Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac,Martin Turnell, \"A Catholic Literary Revival\", The Spectator, 14 January 1966. as well as the philosophers Jacques Maritain and Gabriel Marcel.The Maritain Factor: Taking Religion into Interwar Modernism, edited by Rajesh Heynickx and Jan De Maeyer (Leuven University Press, 2010). ==England== The main figures who have been seen as constituting a revival of a leading Catholic presence in national literary life in England include John Henry Newman, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Hilaire Belloc, G. K. Chesterton, Alfred Noyes, Robert Hugh Benson, Ronald Knox, Graham Greene, and Evelyn Waugh. Of these, Belloc was the only writer raised a Catholic; the others were adult converts. J.R.R. Tolkien, although a convinced Catholic, \"is not generally perceived to be one of the key protagonists of the Catholic literary revival\".Joseph Pearce, Catholic Literary Giants: A Field Guide to the Catholic Literary Landscape (Ignatius Press, 2014), digital edition (pages unnumbered), chapter 38. In his writing, his own Catholic convictions and his use of Catholic themes are far less explicit than was the case for the other writers mentioned. There is, however, a growing tendency to look at Tolkien within the English Catholic literary tradition of his time.e.g. Owen Dudley Edwards, \"Gollum, Frodo and the Catholic Novel\", in A Hidden Presence: The Catholic Imagination of J.R.R. Tolkien, edited by Ian Boyd and Stratford Caldecott (2003). Although distinct, a movement towards explicit religious loyalty and themes in Anglican and Anglo-Catholic writers such as George MacDonald, T. S. Eliot, C. S. Lewis and Dorothy L. Sayers is sometimes linked to the Catholic literary revival as a broader phenomenon.Joseph Pearce, Literary Converts: Spiritual Inspiration in an Age of Unbelief (Ignatius Press, 2006). ==United States== Due to the influence of Catholic literature from England in the United States,Arnold Sparr, To Promote, Defend, and Redeem: The Catholic Literary Revival and the Cultural Transformation of American Catholicism, 1920-1960 (Greenwood Press, 1990). the concept of \"Catholic revival\" is sometimes extended to include American authors such as Dorothy Day, Thomas Merton, Fulton Sheen, Walker Percy, J. F. Powers and Flannery O'Connor. One of the early leaders of the revival in the United States was the editor and publisher Francis X. Talbot. ==References== === Citations === === Sources === * Category:Literary movements Category:19th- century literature Category:20th-century British literature Category:20th- century French literature Category:20th-century American literature Category:Catholic culture ",
