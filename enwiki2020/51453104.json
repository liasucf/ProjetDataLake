    "text": "Matthew Ahn is a lawyer from Ohio who holds the Guinness World Record for fastest time to travel to all New York City Subway stations, a feat commonly known as the Subway Challenge. The New York Times has dubbed him \"King of the Subway\". A graduate of New York University School of Law, the self-described \"transit enthusiast\" has created a replica of the New York City Subway map showing only stations which are wheelchair-accessible. It has been lauded for highlighting the relative paucity of such stations. In 2017, Ahn made MTA- related headlines again when he raced a subway train between the adjacent Chambers Street and Park Place stations on foot. Ahn has also gained recognition as a YouTube musician for his mashup of the opening number from the hit musical Hamilton with the theme song to the movie Space Jam. In 2015, Ahn published a widely read comprehensive ranking of every Cleveland Browns loss since 1999. He appeared as a contestant on Jeopardy! in 2013. == References == Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Ohio lawyers Category:New York University School of Law alumni ",
