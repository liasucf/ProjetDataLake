    "text": "A cuban prime (from the role cubes (third powers) play in the equations) is a prime number that is a solution to one of two different specific equations involving third powers of x and y. The first of these equations is: :p = \\frac{x^3 - y^3}{x - y},\\ x = y + 1,\\ y>0Cunningham, On quasi-Mersennian numbers and the first few cuban primes from this equation are: 7, 19, 37, 61, 127, 271, 331, 397, 547, 631, 919, 1657, 1801, 1951, 2269, 2437, 2791, 3169, 3571, 4219, 4447, 5167, 5419, 6211, 7057, 7351, 8269, 9241, ... The general cuban prime of this kind can be rewritten as \\tfrac{(y+1)^3 - y^3}{y + 1 - y}, which simplifies to 3y^2 + 3y + 1. This is exactly the general form of a centered hexagonal number; that is, all of these cuban primes are centered hexagonal. the largest known has 65537 digits with y = 100000845^{4096},Caldwell, Prime Pages found by Jens Kruse Andersen. The second of these equations is: :p = \\frac{x^3 - y^3}{x - y},\\ x = y + 2,\\ y>0.Cunningham, Binomial Factorisations, Vol. 1, pp. 245-259 This simplifies to 3y^2 + 6y + 4. The first few cuban primes of this form are : :13, 109, 193, 433, 769, 1201, 1453, 2029, 3469, 3889, 4801, 10093, 12289, 13873, 18253, 20173, 21169, 22189, 28813, 37633, 43201, 47629, 60493, 63949, 65713, 69313 With a substitution y = n - 1, the equations above can also be written as follows: :3n^2 -3n + 1, \\ n>1. :3n^2 + 1, \\ n>1. == Generalization == A generalized cuban prime is a prime of the form :p = \\frac{x^3 - y^3}{x - y}, x>y>0.
