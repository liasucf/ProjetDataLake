    "text": "Lukas Ridgeston (born 5 April 1974) is a Slovak actor and director in gay erotic movies and model in Bel Ami gay erotic magazines and books.\"Lukas Ridgeston.\" BelAmiModels, 2012. Web. 18 Feb. 2012. He was born in Bratislava, then part of the former Czechoslovakia, now capital of Slovakia. Lukas Ridgeston is best known as \"The King of Gay Porn\" or just \"The King\". == Career == His stage name originated with the editors of Freshmen magazine. (It is common practice for magazines to assign names to photos of models, rather than the studios or the models themselves.) The magazine did not want to use a name from an Eastern Bloc country and chose the name \"Lucas Ridgeston\" as sounding more \"Ivy League\". BelAmi changed the spelling to \"Lukas\" and both have been used ever since. Ridgeston performed nearly exclusively as a top in his films; however, he does bottom in the films Lukas' Story 2: When Boy Meets Boy and Lucky Lukas. (Lukas' Story and Lukas' Story 2 have since been combined and marketed as Lukas' Stories.) When asked, \"Do you identify as gay, straight or bi-sexual?\", he replied, \"I always say I am sexual\".'Gio. (November 2006). 'Below the Belt with Lukas Ridgeston'.
