    "text": "The Arizona Territorial Legislature was the legislative body of Arizona Territory. It was a bicameral legislature consisting of a lower house, the House of Representatives, and an upper house, the Council. Created by the Arizona Organic Act, the legislature initially consisted of nine members in the Council and eighteen members in the House. The legislature initially met once a year, but this was changed by the U.S. Congress to biannually in 1869. In 1881, the membership was expanded to twelve Council members and twenty-four Representatives. The Arizona Territorial Legislature was replaced by the Arizona State Legislature after Arizona achieved statehood. ==Legislative sessions== {|class=\"wikitable\" font=90% !Session !Year !Location |- |1st Arizona Territorial Legislature||1864||Prescott |- |2nd Arizona Territorial Legislature||1865||Prescott |- |3rd Arizona Territorial Legislature||1866||Prescott |- |4th Arizona Territorial Legislature||1867||Prescott |- |5th Arizona Territorial Legislature||1868||Tucson |- |6th Arizona Territorial Legislature||1871||Tucson |- |7th Arizona Territorial Legislature||1873||Tucson |- |8th Arizona Territorial Legislature||1875||Tucson |- |9th Arizona Territorial Legislature||1877||Tucson |- |10th Arizona Territorial Legislature||1879||Prescott |- |11th Arizona Territorial Legislature||1881||Prescott |- |12th Arizona Territorial Legislature||1883||Prescott |- |13th Arizona Territorial Legislature||1885||Prescott |- |14th Arizona Territorial Legislature||1887||Prescott |- |15th Arizona Territorial Legislature||1889||Prescott-Phoenix |- |16th Arizona Territorial Legislature||1891||Phoenix |- |17th Arizona Territorial Legislature||1893||Phoenix |- |18th Arizona Territorial Legislature||1895||Phoenix |- |19th Arizona Territorial Legislature||1897||Phoenix |- |20th Arizona Territorial Legislature||1899||Phoenix |- |21st Arizona Territorial Legislature||1901||Phoenix |- |22nd Arizona Territorial Legislature||1903||Phoenix |- |23rd Arizona Territorial Legislature||1905||Phoenix |- |24th Arizona Territorial Legislature||1907||Phoenix |- |25th Arizona Territorial Legislature||1909||Phoenix |} ==See also== *Members of the Arizona Territorial Legislature ==References== ==External links== * Legislature Territorial Legislature Category:Former territorial legislatures of the United States Arizona Territory Category:1864 establishments in Arizona Territory Category:1909 disestablishments in Arizona Territory ",
