    "text": "Gyeongdeok of Silla was the 35th ruler who reigned from 742 to 765 over the kingdom of Silla. He is perhaps best known today for his efforts to encourage Buddhism. The Bulguksa Temple was built by his orders in 751. He also built Seokguram Grotto, which also included Buddhist art. The grotto has features relevant to the pre-existing shamanistic religion as well. Lastly, he commissioned the Divine Bell of King Seongdeok, named for his father. This bell was finished after his own death during the reign of his son, King Hyegong. It is considered one of the finest examples of Buddhist art. ==See also== *Silla *Korean Buddhism *Korean shamanism *List of Korean monarchs *List of Silla people ==References== Category:Silla rulers Category:Silla Buddhists Category:Korean Buddhist monarchs Category:765 deaths Category:8th- century monarchs in Asia Category:Year of birth unknown Category:8th-century Korean people ",
