It was finally shot in Bahia, Distrito Federal, and Rio de Janeiro. ==Reception== It was Rocha's last film and the one that caused the most controversy. Because it was produced by Embrafilme, a state company, during the Brazilian military dictatorship, it was boycotted by critics and \"crucified at the 1980 Venice Film Festival\", where it was nominated for the Golden Lion. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1980s avant-garde and experimental films Category:1980 drama films Category:1980 films Category:Brazilian avant-garde and experimental films Category:Brazilian films Category:Brazilian drama films Category:Films directed by Glauber Rocha Category:Films shot in Bras\u00edlia Category:Films shot in Rio de Janeiro (city) Category:Portuguese-language films ",
