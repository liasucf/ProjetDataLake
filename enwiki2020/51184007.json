    "text": "Doomsday Party is a 2013 Hong Kong drama film directed by newcomer Ho Hong and featuring an ensemble cast including Paul Wong, Kay Tse, Kelvin Kwan , Teddy Robin and Wilfred Lau. == Plot == The film opens with scenes of angry protests in front of Hong Kong's LegCo building. Following a double bomb scare, police attempt to disperse the crowd, only to fuel further rage. A few blocks away, Lang (Kelvin Kwan) and his acolyte Fish (Fish Liew) take advantage of the surrounding chaos to hold up a bank. Armed with a pistol and makeshift bombs, they threaten employees and customers, among whom police detective Kin-Ho (Paul Wong), celebrity English tutor Victor Lo (Wilfred Lau), bank clerk Wan Yee (Kay Tse), councillor Ho (KK Cheung), his mistress Rebecca (Maggie Chan), and an old man clinging to a mysterious envelope (Teddy Robin). After the opening credits, the action goes back in time to follow the intertwining lives of these eight characters. == Reception == In the South China Morning Post, Yvette Leh rated the film 3/5, stating \"Ho, who directed, wrote and co- produced the film, is to be commended for an ambitious work packed with substantive content and believable characters.\" Clarence Tsui of The Hollywood Reporter showed less enthusiasm: \"the initial rage against Hong Kong's ruling machine ... quickly dissipates to reveal clich\u00e9d romantic or familial melodrama\". == References == == External links == * Category:Hong Kong films Category:2013 films Category:Hong Kong drama films Category:2013 drama films Category:Films set in Hong Kong Category:Films shot in Hong Kong ",
