    "text": "Sang-e-Mar Mar () () or Sang e Mar Mar Ka Dil (translation: Heart Like Marble) (previously titled Daasi ) is a Pakistani romantic drama serial that was first aired on Hum TV on 1 September 2016. It stars Sania Saeed, Mikaal Zulfiqar and others. It is the fourth appearance of Noman Ijaz on Hum TV after his 2013 appearance in the serial Rehaai. It is the second appearance of Uzma Hassan and Tipu Sharif after their appearance in the 2015 serial Mohabbat Aag Si and Uzma Hassan's second appearance with Mikaal Zulfiqar as well after their 2014 serial Tum Meray He Rehna. The entire production was shot in the Swat District, mainly in the village of Ronyal and its outskirts. ==Synopsis== Sang-e-Mar Mar is a story of love and revenge, and lies that can annihilate families and relations. The story rotates around youth companions Shireen and Aurang. Shireen lives with the misconception that Aurang is the love of her life since when they were childhood friends, despite the fact that they hadn't seen each other for many years. Aurang, much to the disapproval of his father, had gone off to the city to study (story takes place in villages) and is completely unaware of Shireen's love for him. He, on the other hand, has feelings for Palwasha, his sister-in-law's sister. Although the story seems to revolve around these three people, a wide array of characters are introduced, who, in the end, play a bigger part in the story. Other key characters are Aurang's sister (Bano) and her vengeful husband (Torah), Aurang's mother (Shameem), father (Gulistan Khan), brothers (Saifullah and Goher) and the Pashtun family from which Shireen comes from. ==Plot== Sang-e-Mar Mar depicts the story of Pashtuns (also known as Pathans), starring the strict head of the family, Gulistan Khan (Noman Ijaz) married to Shameem (Sania Saeed). They have three sons, Safiullah (Omair Rana), Aurang (Meekal Zulfiqar), and Goher (Agha Mustafa Hassan); and a daughter, Bano (Uzma Hassan). The drama opens with the death of Gulistan's aged father Baran Khan (Qazi Wajid) whom he kills with his own hands at Baran's request. Gulistan Khan follows strict Pashtun traditions including hatred for western clothing, which is considered a threat to Pashtun traditional values. Gulistan's youngest son Aurang Khan was sent to Peshawar University and, unlike his elder siblings, he possesses an urban and liberal thought and his only emotional attachment is to his mother, for whom he often visits his village \"Garhi Baran.\" The second storyline involves Shireen (nicknamed Shiri, played by Kubra Khan), the younger sister of Saif-ur-Rehman (Tipu Sharif), a contractor. Shireen lives with her elder brother and his scheming and selfish wife, Pari. As a child, Shireen had a crush on Aurang, as they studied at the same Madrasa, but since both families live in different villages and Saif-ur-Rehman despises Gulistan Khan, this makes it difficult for Shireen and Aurang to interact. The third storyline involves Gulistan Khan's daughter, Bano, who was forcibly married to Torah Khan (her cousin) by his late grandfather. Bano is an abusive wife who hates her husband, as she feels she is too beautiful for him (because she is light-skinned and of her \"pure\" Pashtun heritage). Torah Khan is the nephew of Gulistan Khan and is ostracized by his family members due to his Bengali heritage on his mother's side. Torah gains his revenge, despite being a generally nice man, by scheming against Gulistan's family. The storylines converge with Gulistan's second son Goher, a cruel, spoiled goon. Goher is a womanizer, and sets his sights on Durkhanay (Shireen's friend). He writes love letters to Durkhanay, who falls in love with him and confides to Shireen. Shireen warns Durkhanay that he is conning her, but it is all in vain. Unfortunately, Pari, Shireen's sister-in- law, manipulates Shireen even though she knew Shireen was innocent of the affair with Goher. Torah found out about Goher's love affair and sent one of his spies after him. Goher met Durkhanay by a stream where he tries to trap Durkhanay but she refused to show her veiled face. Goher asked Durkhanay to meet him again next week, and gifted her with bangles and a pranda (braid band). Torah's spy, Bulbul, saw Goher and a veiled girl together and when Durkhanay left for her home, Bulbul started spying on Durkhanay in order to find her home. Durkhanay went to Shireen's home (typically known as Saif-ur- Rehman's home), so Bulbul misunderstands and thinks that Saif-ur-rehman's sister was the girl, and reports this back to Torah. Meanwhile, Durkhanay shows Shireen the bangles and pranda and asks her to keep the pranda for herself. Despite Shireen's protests, Durkhanay ties the pranda in Shireen's braid. A village midwife arrived at Shireen's home to see Pari, who is pregnant. The woman, Gul, sells prandas (a type of Barrette in Pakistan) and recognized the pranda in Shireen's braid and told Pari that Gulistan Khan's son bought the pranda from her some days ago for someone, and suggests Shireen must be having an affair with him. Pari plans to tell this to Saif-ur-Rehman so that Shireen will get married soon. Torah decides to tell Saif-ur-Rehman about his sister's affair; meanwhile, Aurang plans to leave for Peshawar. Shireen and Durkhanay come to know about the true identity of Goher (that he is Gulistan's son) and that he is going to cheat her, so both girls decide to return the gifts to him. Pari reveals that she \"knows\" about Shireen's affair, confronting her about it. This time, Shireen wants to go on behalf of Durkhanay to meet Goher and return the gifts, but Durkhanay insists she should go instead. Torah's spy lies to Saif-ur-Rehman about Shiri meeting Goher, and in a rage, he leaves to go kill them for honor's sake. Durkhanay returned the gifts to Goher and asks him, if he truly loves her to send a proposal to her house, he makes excuses and eventually tries to grab her and perhaps force himself upon her. However, Saif-ur-Rehman arrives with his men, catch Goher and kill him. They can't find any girl with him, but Saif-ur-Rehman thinks it was Shireen as a result of his wife's suggestions and village gossip. Durkhanay was left heartbroken and now only Shireen, Durkhanay and Pari are the ones who know that Shireen is innocent. Shireen takes the blame for Durkhanay when she discovers the villagers have already been gossiping about her, no one confesses the truth. Goher's father and older brother, Safiullah, are enraged by Goher's murder and decide to kill Saif-ur-Rehman as soon as they find out that he is the killer. However, Pari goes to Gulistan Khan and pleas for mercy and offers Shireen as Vani. Vani is a cultural custom found in parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan whereby a young girl is forcibly married as part of punishment for a crime committed by her male relatives. Shireen is overjoyed thinking that she is going to marry the love of her life, Aurang, but finds out that she has to marry Safiullah on her wedding day as the Mullah reads her Nikah. Heartbroken and betrayed, she leaves to start her new life as Safiullah's wife and a woman who was given in Vani. Shireen suffers oppression from the sister in law, and the daughter of Gulistan. Shameem reveals to Aurang about Gulistan's past killing of his sister-in-law Rakhi (Torah's mother) because she wore a sari and was dancing in the rain, which he felt was inappropriate. Torah's spy tells Safiullah that it was Goher who always met with his new wife Shireen, not knowing it was actually Durkhanay, as she came to the river veiled. Safiullah asks Aurang to secretly take Gulalai to the city and take her to a gynecologist. Shameem overhears this and tries to stop Aurang from taking Gulalai, for if Gulistan Khan finds out, he will be enraged, as he finds the city corrupt. This stops Aurang and Safiullah's plans. Gulalai accuses Shireen of eavesdropping on the conversation and reporting it to Shameem. Though Shireen is innocent, Safiullah believes Gulalai and hits Shireen. Shameem tells Gulalai that Shiri did not report any conversation and forces Gulalai to apologize to Shiri for blaming her, and Gulalai makes a fake apology to Shiri and promises Shameem that she won't go to the city. Aurang witnesses the abuse of Shiri, but only supports her on a minimal level. Gulalai leaves for her brother's house, in another village, at Gulistan's request (as he wants Safiullah and Shireen to have time alone together since he is concerned about his lineage). Gulalai and Safiullah have other plans: she is to leave with Aurang for the city from her brother's house. Before Aurang leaves for the city, he and Shameem visit Bano. Aurang and Palwasha have a romantic conversation between them, and Bano interrupts angrily when Aurang says that he one day is going to marry Palwasha. When Bano tells her mother, Shameem is secretly happy but appeases Bano telling her Aurang is not interested in marrying a village girl. Later, when an overjoyed Shameem tells this to Shiri, she is heartbroken but aware there is no future between her and Aurang, since she is his brother's wife. Shiri gives Palwasha the peacock feather that Aurang gave to Shiri when they were young, a sign that Shiri understands that Aurang is destined to be Palvasha's and not hers. To get his revenge for his brother's death, Safiullah kills Saif-ur-Rehman, goaded on by Tohra, who wants to set up the deaths of both Saif-ur-Rehman and Safiullah. Torah wants to amass more property, which he believes belonged to his own father and hated Gulistan for killing his mother, as well as how the family used him and made snide remarks about his Mum and her skin colour, as well as his own. Meanwhile, Aurang and Gulalai are returning to their village from the city, having found out that Gulalai has no fertility problems, and is just anaemic. Aurang halts the car to do an errand, and following him, Gulalai exits the car to cross the road. She is hit by a fast-approaching truck and dies. As the news of the three deaths is revealed to the respective families, they all break down. Even Gulistan Khan cries. Aurang is now the only remaining son of Gulistan Khan, and the two repair their relationship. Gulistan reveals the \"mad dog\" that he feels is cursing his life; he partakes in the haram practice of usury. After much deliberation and Shameem breaking down at dinner, begging Gulistan Khan to stop taking interest under the guise of business, Aurang wraps all of his father's accounting books with the yellow sheet traditionally laid over someone that has gone mad from a dog's bite and burns them to ashes. Palvasha arrives at Aurang's house at night under the guise of bringing Shameem food, but Aurang sees through her attempts at being coy, and the two flirt. Unbeknownst to them, Shiri stands outside, hearing every word and looking stricken at how in love they are. Zarri, an aunt of Pari, convinces her to set up her son, Kalimullah, with Durkhanay. Pari agrees in order to eliminate the last person who knows the truth about who had an affair with Goher, and when Durkhanay's brother Sharifullah, a laborer from Dubai, arrives, he consents to this proposal. Durkhanay mourns the deaths occurring around her and blames herself for Shireen's suffering; she goes to offer Shireen her condolences, and at her brother's request, vows to cheer her up. Shiri insists that Durkhanay look forward to the life ahead of herself instead of craving death, wistfully reciting the days of the wedding Durkhanay will have that Shiri herself did not experience. Meanwhile, Sharifullah stays in Pakistan and works for Pari as a zameendar, and at first wanted to remarry Shiri, but falls prey to Pari's hateful words against Shiri, who she resents once again for having a share in Saif-ur-Rehman's will, and declares her an evil woman; he then forbids Durkhanay to visit Shiri again. Shiri does not know what to do \u2013 and in the meantime Gulistan Khan asks Shiri if she would like to marry Aurang. Durkhanay tells her brother that it was her who used to see Gauhar, not Shiri and gives him a pistol and a Quraan and expects him to kill her but he doesn't, as he hears the call to prayer and decides against killing her. He says he would like to marry Shiri and Durkhanay and her brother decide to go to Gulistan Khan's house and ask for Shireen's hand, without letting Pari know about this. When Durkhanay and Shiri meet, Shiri tells Durkhanay that her young dream of marrying Aurang is coming true. Durkhanay tells Shiri that her brother wants to marry Shiri after learning the truth. But after knowing about the possible match between Shiri and Aurang, she backs off and is happy for Shireen. The relationship between Gulistan Khan and Aurang is becoming slightly better but Aurang overhears his father telling Shamim that he killed Baraan Khan as a mercy killing. He is angry and leaves the house. Bano is contacted by Pari as Pari hears about Aurang and Shireen's match. Bano decides to tell Aurang that Shireen is 'impure' and is responsible for the murder of Safiullah and Gauhar because her warped thoughts are suggesting that Shiri is responsible for all her problems. Pari falsely swears on the Quran and subsequently gives birth to a still born child. She slowly loses touch with reality and becomes completely delusional. Durkhanay sees this and is afraid of her own fate since she also has concealed the truth. She decides to go to Garhi Baraan and speak to Gulistan Khan. In the meantime, Aurang has told Shireen that he has never loved her but fell in love with Palwasha for as long as he knew what love was. Shiri, previously so patient through adversity, seems to gradually become an angrier person, and curses Aurang. As she appears to have lost everything, she holds scissors to Bano's throat after Bano taunts her about telling everyone she was responsible for all her brother's deaths. In actual fact Durkhanay and Torah Khan were responsible \u2013 Bano raises a ruckus and tells everyone that Shiri attacked her. Shiri tells everyone that she is indeed responsible for the death of Gauhar since she was the one who had an affair with him, which is false. Shamim slaps her and Bano starts beating her up brutally with a stick and Aurang, Palwasha, Gulistan Khan, Shamim and Torah Khan quietly watch this happening. Torah Khan does intervene after getting flashbacks of his Mum being beaten by Gulistan Khan. Bano hits him on the head too. Aurang gets up to stop Bano but Palwasha holds his hand to prevent him intervening. Durkhanay arrives with the letter that Goher gave her and confesses the entire truth. She tells them how Goher left her gifts. How she would go to meet him. How Shireen advised her against meeting him. How Goher met her that fateful day on the Black Hill where he attempted to rape her but she tried to get away and how Saif-ur-rehman arrived and killed Goher. Durkhanay has also confessed this all to her husband who apparently accepted her despite this past \u2013 because they are seen going back to their own village on their motorcycle together. Upon hearing this, everyone feels stricken. Shamim is seen on the prayer mat praying for forgiveness. However, Aurang leaves for the city with his new smiling wife, Palwasha. Shameem begs forgiveness from Shiri. Torah Khan asks Shiri to marry him as he is fed up of getting bullied for his skin colour but Shireen rejects. A day after Torah is telling Bano that if she does anything wrong she will divorce her in the name of Allah and at that moment Shireen comes and says she accepts Torah's request so now Shirley and Torah are married. Bano, heartbroken, goes to her father's house. The next day, Torah Khan wants Shiri to wear his mother's sari but she is uncomfortable with the idea and makes excuses. He told her he would help her and slaps her saying that she tried to hurt his sister Palwasha by loving Aurang. Both of them go to Gulistan's house, after Shiri goes inside, he points his gun at Gulistan Khan to take revenge for his mother's death telling that if he did not let Bano go with him, he will kill him like he killed Safiullah and Goher. He was about to shoot Gulistan Khan, Shamim, who overhears that Torah Khan killed her sons, shoots Torah Khan and kills him, claiming that she took Safiullah's and Goher's deaths revenge from him. == Cast == * Noman Ejaz as Gulistan Khan; husband of Shameem, father of Aurang, Bano, Safiullah, Goher, and the father-in-law of Torah, Shireen and Gulalai * Sania Saeed as Shameem; wife of Gulistan Khan, mother of Aurang, Bano, Safiullah, Goher, and the mother-in-law of Torah and Gulalai * Mikaal Zulfiqar as Aurang; the main character of the series who is the youngest son of Shameem and Gulistan Khan and the love interest of Shireen and Palwasha. * Kubra Khan as Shireen; the younger sister of Saif Ur Rehman who has a crush on Aurang * Paras Masroor as Torah; the nephew of Gulistan Khan who is a crook * Sharmeen Ali as Palwasha; the sister of Torah who also has a crush on Aurang * Uzma Hassan as Shehrbano \"Bano\"; the good for nothing sister of Aurang and the wife of Torah * Beenish Raja as Durkhanay; Shireen's best friend who is being tortured by Goher * Tipu Sharif as Saif Ur Rehman; a contractor and Shireen's older brother * Omair Rana as Safiullah; the oldest son of Shameem and Gulistan Khan * Kaif Ghaznavi as Pari; the good for nothing wife of Saif Ur Rehman and the sister-in-law of Shireen * Najiba Faiz as Gulalai; wife of Safiullah and the daughter-in-law of Shameem and Gulistan Khan * Agha Mustafa Hassan as Goher; the middle son of Shameem and Gulistan Khan and a womanizer who targets Durkhanay (Shireen's best friend) * Abdullah Khan as Baru Kaka; the driver of Saif Ur Rehman * Khalida Nasreen as Kaleemullah's mother * Hassan Noman as Bulbul * Shaharyar Irfan as Subhan; Aurang's best friend * Ahmed Ali * Arshad Hussain * Khalida Yasmeen * Nasir * Amjad * Naik Muhammad * Iffat Siddiqui * Zahida Tanha * Shehzad Khalil === Guest appearance === * Qazi Wajid as Baran Khan (Dead) Gulistan Khan's father, (can be seen only on flashbacks) * Suhaee Abro as Rakshi (Dead) Torah's and Palwasha's mother,(can be seen on flashback) === Child stars === * Wajdan as Aurang * Roshina as Shireen * Dilawar Khan as Goher * Sanan as Bano * M Asad Khan as Saif Ur Rehman * Ijaz Gul as Nakli Angraiz == Release == ===Broadcast=== * In USA, the show was broadcast on Hum TV USA. * In UAE, the show was broadcast on Hum TV Mena. * In UK, the show was aired on Hum TV Europe and was broadcast twice, simultaneously with Hum TV Pakistan and in 2020. * In Afghanistan, the show was dubbed in Pashto and was broadcast by Hum Pashto 1 under the title \u0633\u0646\u06a9 \u0645\u0631\u0645\u0631. it was aired in 2020. ===Digital release=== The show is available digitally on: * iflix(till 2019) * MX Player app * Starzplay == Reception == Sadaf Haider of Dawn News praised Sang-e-Mar Mar saying it the best critique for obsession of ghairat.
