He took power after killing his predecessor, and his father's killer, Conaing Bececlach. He ruled for six years, until he was killed by F\u00edachu Tolgrach and his son Dui Ladrach. According to the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn, he was succeeded by his son Ailill Finn;R. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, p. 259 KeatingGeoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn 1.27 and the Four MastersAnnals of the Four Masters M4388-4404 agree he was succeeded by his killer, F\u00edachu Tolgrach, who was later killed by Ailill Finn. The Lebor Gab\u00e1la synchronises his reign with that of Darius II of Persia (423\u2013404). The chronology of Keating's Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn dates his reign to 599\u2013593 BC, that of the Annals of the Four Masters to 812\u2013806 BC. ==References== Category:Legendary High Kings of Ireland ",
