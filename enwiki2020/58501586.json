In February 1897, Rand was appointed as plague commissioner of the city. Rand took measures that he noted as \"perhaps the most drastic that had ever been taken to stamp out an epidemic.\"Draft of Report to Government of Bombay by W. C. Rand as cited in Rand's efforts to control plague were considered tyrannical and brutal by many in Poona including Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak.Tilak wrote in his newspaper Mahratta that \"Plague is more merciful to us than its human prototypes now reigning the city. The tyranny of Plague Committee and its chosen instruments is yet too brutal to allow respectable people to breathe at ease.\" Rand and his military escort Lt. Ayerst were shot by Chapekar brothers on 22 June 1897. Ayerst died on the spot, while Rand died of his injuries on 3 July. Prior to being posted at Poona, Rand was posted as assistant collector of Satara. His assassination rapidly became a part of the \"myth\" of Indian national movement, especially in Maharashtra. ==References== Category:1897 deaths Category:Year of birth missing Category:Indian Civil Service (British India) officers Category:Assassinations in India ",
