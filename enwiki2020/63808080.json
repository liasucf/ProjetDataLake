From the backyard bowls to the concrete plaza covered in graffiti, the landscapes of Venice, California were integral to the development of skateboarding. Starting in the 2000s, a group of Venice locals, headed by Jesse Martinez, organized an effort to build the Venice Beach Skate Park. In April 2020, the park was covered in sand to discourage gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. == Gallery of photos from Venice Beach Skate Park == File:Ghosts in a panorama of a pool (31329444473).jpg File:Venice bowl.jpg File:500px photo (83567169).jpeg File:500px photo (83567529).jpeg File:Venice Beach Skater (78715865).jpeg File:Bennett Harada Venice Beach (8597127416).jpg File:Skaters in Venice (23704327493).jpg File:Drop In (Unsplash).jpg File:Skateboarding@VeniceBeach.jpg File:Venice Beach Skatepark (Unsplash).jpg == External links == * LA Parks Website - Venice Skate Park ==References== Category:Skateparks in the United States Category:Venice, Los Angeles ",
