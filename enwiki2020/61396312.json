    "text": "Op med hodet! (literally, Up with Your Head!, or Cheer Up!) is a Norwegian comedy film from 1934. It was directed by Tancred Ibsen and produced by Erling Bergendahl. The actors appearing in the film include Lillebil Ibsen, Lalla Carlsen, and Leif Juster. The film was very experimental for its time, and it included special effects, multiple exposures, reverse motion, and color sequences. The title of the film is a reference to the opening line of a poem in Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson's novel En glad Gut (A Happy Boy): \"L\u00f8ft ditt hode, du raske gutt!\" (Lift your head, you restless youth!), spoken by a Bj\u00f8rnson statue in the film. ==References== ==External links== * * Op med hodet! at the National Library of Norway Category:1934 films Category:Norwegian black-and- white films Category:Norwegian films Category:Norwegian comedy films Category:Films directed by Tancred Ibsen ",
