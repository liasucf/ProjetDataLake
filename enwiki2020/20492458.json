    "text": "The Paterson and Hudson River Railroad was a railroad that operated in New Jersey and connected the cities of Jersey City and Paterson. The railroad was started in 1833. The company was the first in the United States to build moveable bridges for rail, crossing the Passaic River and Hackensack River. Originally the Paterson and Hudson River Railroad used a fleet of horses to pull the train cars.Jersey City And Its Historic Sites - (Get NJ!) (Accessed November 30, 2008). The first steam locomotive to operate on the line was called the McNeil and manufactured by Robert Stephenson and Company then assembled by Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works. A decade after opening, the railroad's importance increased when the Paterson and Ramapo Railroad was built, enabling a connection to it in Paterson. The two lines provided a shorter route from Suffern to New York City than did the New York and Erie Railroad, though initially it did require using other transportation for the between the stations. In 1852, the New York and Erie Railroad leased the track rights of the P&HR; and P&R; and made their lines the new New York and Erie Railroad mainline.Erie Railroad Home Page (Erie Lackawanna Historical Society) (Accessed November 30, 2008.)
