    "text": "North Pole view of the Bering Strait A Bering Strait crossing is a hypothetical bridge or tunnel spanning the relatively narrow and shallow Bering Strait between the Chukotka Peninsula in Russia and the Seward Peninsula in the U.S. state of Alaska. The crossing would provide a connection linking North America and Eurasia. With the two Diomede Islands between the peninsulas, the Bering Strait could be spanned by a bridge or tunnel. There have been several proposals for a Bering Strait crossing made by various individuals and media outlets. The names used for them include \"The Intercontinental Peace Bridge\" and \"EurasiaAmerica Transport Link\".A Transcontinental Eurasia-America Transport Link via the Bering Strait , at the 1st International Conference \"Megaprojects of the Russian East\" Tunnel names have included \"TKMWorld Link\" and \"AmerAsian Peace Tunnel\". In April 2007, Russian government officials told the press that the Russian government will back a US$65 billion plan by a consortium of companies to build a Bering Strait tunnel.\"Russia wants a rail link to North America,\" Der Spiegel, April 20, 2007 == History == Satellite image of Bering Strait. Cape Dezhnev, Russia is on the left, the two Diomede Islands are in the middle, and Cape Prince of Wales, Alaska is on the right. === 19th century === The concept of an overland connection crossing the Bering Strait goes back before the 20th century. William Gilpin, first governor of the Colorado Territory, envisioned a vast \"Cosmopolitan Railway\" in 1890 linking the entire world through a series of railways. Two years later, Joseph Strauss, who went on to design over 400 bridges, and then serve as the Project Engineer for the Golden Gate Bridge, put forward the first proposal for a Bering Strait rail bridge in his senior thesis.Kevin Starr. Endangered Dreams: The Great Depression in California, 330. Oxford University Press, 1996. The project was presented to the government of the Russian Empire, but it was rejected.An excerpt from memoirs of the Russian Empire Minister of Land Forces Aleksandr Rediger === 20th century === A syndicate of American railroad magnates proposed in 1904 (through a French spokesman) a SiberianAlaskan railroad from Cape Prince of Wales in Alaska through a tunnel under the Bering Strait and across northeastern Siberia to Irkutsk via Cape Dezhnev, Verkhnekolymsk and Yakutsk. The proposal was for a 90-year lease, and exclusive mineral rights for each side of the right-of-way. It was debated by officials and finally turned down on March 20, 1907.Theodore Shabad and Victor L. Mote: Gateway to Siberian Resources (The BAM) pp. 70-71 (Halstead Press/John Wiley, New York, 1977) Czar Nicholas II approved a tunnel (possibly the American proposal above) in 1905. Its cost was estimated at $65 million and $300 million including all the railroads. These hopes were dashed with the outbreak of the 1905 Russian Revolution then World War I. Interest was renewed during World War II with the completion in 194243 of the Alaska Highway linking the remote territory of Alaska with Canada and the continental United States. In 1942, the Foreign Policy Association envisioned the highway continuing to link with Nome near the Bering Strait, linked by highway to the railhead at Irkutsk, using an alternative sea-and-air ferry service across the Bering Strait. At the same time the road on the Russian side was extended by building the 2000 km (1250 mi) Kolyma Highway. In 1958, engineer Tung-Yen Lin suggested the construction of a bridge across the Bering Strait \"to foster commerce and understanding between the people of the United States and the Soviet Union\". Ten years later he organized the Inter-Continental Peace Bridge, Inc., a non-profit institution organized to further this proposal. At that time he made a feasibility study of a Bering Strait bridge and estimated the cost to be $1 billion for the span. In 1994 he updated the cost to more than $4 billion. Like Gilpin, Lin envisioned the project as a symbol of international cooperation and unity, and dubbed the project the Intercontinental Peace Bridge. === 21st century === According to a report in the Beijing Times in May 2014, Chinese transportation experts had proposed building a roughly long high-speed rail line from northeast China to the United States. The project would include a tunnel under the Bering Strait and connect to the contiguous United States via Canada. Several American entrepreneurs have also advanced private-sector proposals, such as an Alaska-based limited liability company founded in 2010 to lobby for a cross-straits connection and a 2018 cryptocurrency offering to fund the construction of a tunnel. In 2005, investor Neil Bush, younger brother of US President George W. Bush and son of President George H. W. Bush, traveled abroad with Reverend Sun Myung Moon of the Unification Church as he promoted a proposal to dig a transportation corridor beneath the Bering Strait. When questioned by Mother Jones during the Republican primary campaign of his brother Jeb Bush a decade later in 2015, he denied having supported the tunnel project and said that he had traveled with Moon because he supported \u201cefforts by faith leaders to call their flock into service to others.\u201d ==Technical concerns== Bering Strait depth === Depth of water === The depth of the water is a minor problem, as the strait is no deeper than . The tides and currents in the area are not severe. === Weather- related challenges === ==== Restrictions on construction work ==== The route is just south of the Arctic Circle, and the location has long, dark winters and extreme weather, including average winter lows of and possible lows approaching . This would mean that construction work would likely be restricted to five months of the year around May to September and centered during summer. ==== Exposed steel ==== The weather also poses challenges to exposed steel. In Lin's design, concrete covers all structures, to simplify maintenance and to offer additional stiffening. ==== Ice floes ==== Although there are no icebergs in the Bering Strait, ice floes up to thick are in constant motion during certain seasons, which could produce forces of the order of on a pier. === Tundra in surrounding regions === Roads on either side of the strait would likely have to cross tundra, requiring either an unpaved road or some way to avoid the effects of permafrost. ==Likely route and expenses== Place for the bridge. === Bridge option === If the crossing is chosen as a bridge, it would probably connect Wales, Alaska to a location south of Uelen. The bridge would also be divided by the Diomede Islands, which are at the middle of the Bering Strait. However, a tunnel would be necessary through the Diomede Islands, as Big Diomede Island is well over at its highest point. In 1994, Lin estimated the cost of a bridge to be \"a few billion\" dollars. The roads and railways on each side were estimated to cost $50 billion. Lin contrasted this cost to petroleum resources \"worth trillions\". Discovery Channel's Extreme Engineering estimates the cost of a highway, electrified double-track high-speed rail and pipelines, at $105 billion, five times the cost of the Channel Tunnel. === Connections to the rest of the world === This excludes the cost of new roads and railways to reach the bridge. Aside from the obvious technical challenges of building two bridges or a more than tunnel across the strait, another major challenge is that, , there is nothing on either side of the Bering Strait to connect the bridge to. ==== Russian side ==== The Russian side of the Strait, in particular, is severely lacking in infrastructure. No railways exist for over in any direction from the strait. The nearest major connecting highway is the M56 Kolyma Highway, which is currently unpaved and around from the strait. However, by 2025, the Anadyr Highway is planned to be built connecting Ola and Anadyr, which is only about from the Strait. ==== American side ==== On the American side, probably about of highways or railroads would have to be built around Norton Sound, through a pass along the Unalakleet River, and along the Yukon River to connect to Manley Hot Springs Road - in other words, a route similar to that of the Iditarod Trail Race. A project to connect Nome, from the strait, to the rest of the continent by a paved highway (part of Alaska Route 2) has been proposed by the Alaskan state government, although the very high cost ($2.3 to $2.7 billion, about $5 million per mile, or $3 million per kilometer) has so far prevented construction. In 2016, the Alaskan road network was extended westwards by to Tanana which is from the strait, by building a fairly simple road. The Alaska Department of Transportation & Public Facilities project was supported by local indigenous groups such as the Tanana Tribal Council. ====Track gauge==== Russia uses a different track gauge from the US and Canada Another complicating factor is the different track gauges in use. Mainline rail in the US, Canada, China, and the Koreas uses standard gauge of 1435 millimeters. Russia uses the slightly broader Russian gauge of 1520 mm. To avoid transshipment difficulties, a new line would likely be built to a single gauge, but causing logistical issues wherever it met the rest of the rail network. On the increasingly popular China\u2013Europe rail freight route (which has two breaks of gauge) this is solved by having all cargo in containers which are fairly easily reloaded from one train to another. ==The TKMWorld Link== Map showing the proximity of Chukchi Peninsula in Russia to Seward Peninsula in America The TKMWorld Link (Russian: \u0422\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0441\u041a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043c\u0430\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c, English: Transcontinental Railway) also called ICL-World Link (Intercontinental link) is a planned 6,000-kilometer link between Siberia and Alaska providing oil, natural gas, electricity, and rail passengers to the United States from Russia. Proposed in 2007, the plan includes provisions to build a tunnel under the Bering Strait which, if completed, would become the longest tunnel in the world, surpassing the Line 3 (Guangzhou Metro) tunnel. The tunnel would be part of a railway joining Yakutsk, the capital of the Russian Yakutia republic, and Komsomolsk-on-Amur, in the Russian Far East, with the western coast of Alaska. The Bering Strait tunnel was estimated to cost between $10 billion and $12 billion, while the entire project was estimated to cost $65 billion. In 2008, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin approved the plan to build a railway to the Bering Strait area, as a part of the development plan to run until 2030. The more than tunnel would run under the Bering Strait between Chukotka, in the Russian far east, and Alaska. The cost estimate was $66 billion. In late August 2011, at a conference in Yakutsk in eastern Russia, the plan was backed by some of President Dmitry Medvedev's top officials, including Aleksandr Levinthal, the deputy federal representative for the Russian Far East. It would be a faster, safer, and cheaper way to move freight around the world than container ships, supporters of the idea believed. They estimated it could carry about 3% of global freight and make about $7 billion a year. Shortly after, the Russian government approved the construction of the $65 billion Siberia-Alaska rail and tunnel across the Bering Strait. Other observers doubt that this will be cheaper than container ships, bearing in mind that the cost for transport from China to Europe by rail is higher than by container ship (except for expensive cargo where lead time is important).Logistics concept for the Chinese growth market (Deutsche Bahn, March 2014) In 2013, the Amur Yakutsk Mainline connecting the Yakutsk railway ( from the strait) with the Trans-Siberian Railway was completed. However, this railway is meant for freight and is too curvy for high-speed passenger trains. Future projects include the and Kolyma\u2013Anadyr highway. The Kolyma\u2013Anadyr highway has started construction, but will be a narrow gravel road. ==China\u2013Russia\u2013Canada\u2013US railway== In 2014, reports emerged that China is considering construction of a China\u2013Russia\u2013Canada\u2013US bullet train that would include a undersea tunnel crossing the Bering Strait and would allow passengers to travel between the United States and China in about two days. Although the press remains skeptical of the project, China's state-run China Daily claims that China possesses the necessary technology, which will be used to construct a tunnel underneath the Taiwan Strait. It is unknown who is expected to pay for the construction, although China has in other projects offered to build and finance them, and expects the money back in the end through fees or rents. ==Trans-Eurasian Belt Development== In 2015, it was reported another possible collaboration between China and Russia that will be part of the Trans-Eurasian Belt Development; a transportation corridor across Siberia that would also include a road bridge with gas and oil pipelines between the easternmost point of Siberia and the westernmost point of Alaska. It would link London and New York by rail and superhighway via Russia if it were to go ahead. China's Silk Road Economic Belt Initiative has similar plans so the project would work in parallel for both countries. ==See also== * Artificial island * Bering land bridge * Cosmopolitan Railway * Eurasian Land Bridge * Intercontinental and transoceanic fixed links * Land reclamation * Pan-American Highway * Transportation in Alaska * Transport in Russia ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * ==External links== * Discovery Channel's Extreme Engineering * World Peace King Tunnel * Trans- Global Highway * The Bering Strait Crossing * Alaska Canada Rail Link - Project Feasibility Study * The Bridge Over the Bering Strait by James Cotter * A Superhighway Across the Bering Strait, The Atlantic * BART's Underwater Tunnel Withstands Test Crossing Category:Exploratory engineering Category:International bridges Category:Proposed bridges in Russia Category:Proposed bridges in the United States Category:Proposed railway bridges Category:Proposed railway lines in Alaska Category:Proposed railway tunnels in Asia Category:Proposed railway tunnels in North America Category:Proposed roads in the United States Category:Proposed transcontinental crossings Category:Proposed transport infrastructure in Russia Category:Proposed transportation infrastructure in the United States Category:Proposed tunnels in Russia Category:Proposed tunnels in the United States Category:Proposed undersea tunnels in Asia Category:Proposed undersea tunnels in North America Category:Railroad bridges in Alaska Category:Railroad tunnels in Alaska Category:Railway bridges in Russia Category:Railway tunnels in Russia Category:Transport in the Russian Far East Category:Transportation in Unorganized Borough, Alaska Category:Proposals in the Soviet Union ",
