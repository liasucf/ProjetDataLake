    "text": "Blue balls is slang for the condition of temporary fluid congestion (vasocongestion) in the testicles accompanied by testicular pain, caused by prolonged sexual arousal in the human male without ejaculation. The term is thought to have originated in the United States, first appearing in 1916. Some urologists call this condition \"epididymal hypertension\". == Research== The condition is sometimes associated with certain demographics, such as men who are experiencing delayed ejaculation or inhibited ejaculation. Although the condition has been widely discussed, there is scant information in the research literature. A brief article by Chalett and Nerenberg in Pediatrics agrees that little formal data exists regarding the condition. The article concludes that \"[t]he treatment is sexual release, or perhaps straining to move a very heavy object\u2014in essence doing a Valsalva maneuver.\" ==See also== * Cock tease * Delayed ejaculation * Edging (sexual practice) * Erotic sexual denial * Prostatic congestion * Sexual frustration ==References== == External links == * \"Understanding Male Sexuality\" * \"Blue Balls\" by DiscoveryHealth.com writers * \"Blue Balls\" by Paul Aitken at AltPenis.com on vasocongestion Category:Mammal male reproductive system Category:Sexual slang ",
