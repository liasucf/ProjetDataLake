Her work has been associated with an avant-garde language that drew apart from the Pictorialist tradition that was in vogue at the beginning of the 20th century, due to the capture of geometric forms, the presence of foreground elements, and the process of overprinting. == Artistic trajectory == Aurora Eugenia Latap\u00ed was born in Mexico, in 1911. In 1926, when she was fifteen years old, she returned from a trip in Europe with a camera that had been given to her by her mother, Aurora Est\u00e9vez de Latap\u00ed.Rodr\u00edguez, Jos\u00e9 Antonio. \"Aurora Eugenia Latap\u00ed, una fot\u00f3grafa vanguardista\" In Alquimia. Sistema Nacional de Fototecas. Jan-Apr 2015, year 18, number 53. Number entitled Precursoras en la imagen fotogr\u00e1fica, p. 63. Three years later, she began her career as a photographer. In an interview published in Alquimia magazine in the year 2000, she explains she began taking photographs as a hobby: \u201cI enjoyed taking pictures, and since my mother liked it, I took them.\u201dRodr\u00edguez, Jos\u00e9 Antonio. \"Aurora Eugenia Latap\u00ed.

For this reason, she started studying photography at the American Photo Supply Co and at the industrial school Malina X\u00f3chit. A few years later, she was admitted at the Academy of San Carlos, where she studied with the renowned Mexican photographer Agust\u00edn Jim\u00e9nez. In December 1929 she participated in the group show Guillermo Toussaint y 11 fot\u00f3grafos mexicanos en la Galer\u00eda de Arte Mexicano at the National Theater (now Palacio de Bellas Artes) in Mexico City. The exhibit was organized by Carlos M\u00e9rida and Carlos Orozco Romero, and it featured works by sculptor Guillermo Toussaint, photographers Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo, Hugo Brehme, Rafael Garc\u00eda, Librado Garc\u00eda Smart, Agust\u00edn Jim\u00e9nez, Ricardo Mantel, Luis M\u00e1rquez, Juan Oc\u00f3n and Roberto Turnbull, as well as Aurora Eugenia and her mother Aurora Latap\u00ed. Criticism of the show was positive and, according to Jos\u00e9 Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, this exhibition allowed Latap\u00ed to formally enter the Mexican photography scene, which was still ruled by the already weak Pictorialist style. In November 1931, during her first year at San Carlos, she showed 50 pictures in the Exposici\u00f3n Fotogr\u00e1fica Jim\u00e9nez-Latap\u00ed at Galer\u00eda Exc\u00e9lsior, along with Agust\u00edn Jim\u00e9nez. Latap\u00ed exhibited still lifes portraying organic materials or industrial objects, which allowed her to experiment with different mechanical processes such as overprinting negatives, and which she would push toward abstraction. In this second exhibition, her work spoke an avant-garde language that reflected, according to Jos\u00e9 Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, a more \u201cmature\u201d approach toward photography. On this occasion, the critics\u2019 opinion was divided. On the one hand, Latap\u00ed's and Jim\u00e9nez's works were praised by some for \u201caccurately expressing the aesthetic inquiries of our time\u201d.Del R\u00edo, Carlos. \u201cDos artistas: Agust\u00edn Jim\u00e9nez y Aurora Eugenia Latap\u00ed\u201d In Revista de revistas. Mexico, November 29th, 1931. From Rodr\u00edguez, Jos\u00e9 Antonio (2012). Fot\u00f3-grafas en M\u00e9xico, 1872-1960. Madrid: Turner. p. 72. On the other hand, an anonymous review was printed in Helios magazine (published by the Asociaci\u00f3n de Fot\u00f3grafos de M\u00e9xico, where the most influential Pictorialist photographers of Mexico came together), in which both photographers were accused of imitating the work of Edward Weston and Tina Modotti.\"La exposici\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez-Latap\u00ed.\" Helios: Revista mensual fotogr\u00e1fica (M\u00e9xico) 2, no.17 (December, 1931): 6 It was common then, for Mexico-based photographers, like Weston and Modotti, but also like Latap\u00ed, Agust\u00edn Jim\u00e9nez, and Lola and Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo to capture aspects of Mexican culture and landscape, as well as valuing high contrasts and compositional rhythms in photography, so it was frequent to find these similarities in photos taken by many artists in Mexico during those years. In December 1931, La Tolteca, a Mexican cement company, and the newspaper Exc\u00e9lsior, organized a painting, drawing and photography contest, around the topic of the recently built and inaugurated cement factory in Mexico City's area of Mixcoac. The winning works were to be exhibited at the National Theater in an exhibition called La Tolteca. Aurora Eugenia Latap\u00ed was awarded fourth place with the picture Chalchiuhtlanetzin (the first place was won by Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo; Agust\u00edn Jim\u00e9nez won second; and third was awarded to Lola \u00c1lvarez Bravo). Once again, the jury's decision, which Diego Rivera was part of, was widely criticized in Helios magazine by members of the Asociaci\u00f3n de Fot\u00f3grafos de M\u00e9xico.\u201cAlgo sobre la exposici\u00f3n de La Tolteca.\u201d Helios: Revista mensual fotogr\u00e1fica (M\u00e9xico) 3, no.18 (January, 1932): 2-3. Latap\u00ed's series \u201cLa Tolteca\u201d (1931) presents different views of the cement factory. Many of the photos show architectural structures covered with cement: a great wall with attached cylinders, grids, chimneys, towers; all of which contrast with metallic scaffolds, staircases and pipes. This large industrial landscape, however, is deprived of human form so, when one of the untitled photos shows someone climbing a scaffold tower in front of an architectural structure with three concrete cylinders and doors in the lower part, it becomes exceptional. As in other photographs by Latap\u00ed, the framing in the pictures of this series is mostly diagonal, and the closely captured large structures tend to exceed the limits of the frame. In this sense, and also due to the contrast between shadows and highlights, these compositions tend toward geometric abstraction. After this show, Latap\u00ed's work was featured in many magazines, like Jueves de Exc\u00e9lsior, Revista de revistas and Nuestro M\u00e9xico, but according to Jos\u00e9 Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, it disappeared from the public sphere my the mid-1930s.Rodr\u00edguez, Jos\u00e9 Antonio. \"Aurora Eugenia Latap\u00ed, una fot\u00f3grafa vanguardista\" In Alquimia. Sistema Nacional de Fototecas. Jan-Apr 2015, year 18, number 53. Number entitled Precursoras en la imagen fotogr\u00e1fica, p. 65. Emma Cecilia Garc\u00eda Krinsky, nonetheless, points out that the photographs Latap\u00ed took between the 1930s and 40s were very important for avant-garde photography in Mexico. In 1950, she was the first woman to become a member of the Club Fotogr\u00e1fico de M\u00e9xico: \u201cI was sent out to develop, to do anything because they didn\u2019t think I could do photography. So I took my photos to the right person, they liked it, and came up with something that they should not have done, put my photos in different classes [categories], to top it off I won a price in all of them. That\u2019s why the men, as I was the first woman to enter, made me see my luck\u201d.Rodr\u00edguez, Jos\u00e9 Antonio. \"Aurora Eugenia Latap\u00ed, una intuici\u00f3n vanguardista\" In Alquimia. Sistema Nacional de Fototecas. Ene-abr 2000, year 3, number 8. Number entitled Fot\u00f3grafas en M\u00e9xico 1880-1955, pp. 37, 38. By the end of that year, Latap\u00ed founded the Sal\u00f3n Femenil (the Women Salon) of the Club Fotogr\u00e1fico de M\u00e9xico, of which she would later become president. During the 1950s and 60s, Latap\u00ed opened the commercial photographic studio \u201cFoto Cui\u201d in the Polanco neighbourhood, in Mexico City. In 1961 she received an honorable mention in the National Photography Contest \u201cAs\u00ed es M\u00e9xico\u201d, and in 1963 she had her last solo show in the same contest. After that and due to her husband's business activity she moved to the United States, but later returned to Mexico City where she died September 4, 2000. == Work == In most of her photographs, Latap\u00ed used diagonal frames that make the captured objects and buildings exit the compositional space. The general composition of most of her photos is guided by strong, multiple and/or parallel diagonal axis that, along with shadows and highlights, provide the pictures with movement and depth. Diagonal frames, close-ups, rhythm and contrasts between shadows and highlights, also create geometric patterns that render some of the images abstract. Her preferred technique was gelatin silver. In her photos, objects like corncobs and zucchini, Mexican toys like trompos and maracas, palm woven objects, or industrial buildings, among others, become the main subject. Textures and contrasts between them is also important: the detail of a corn leaf embracing the grains of its cob (Mazorcas or Elotes, 1931); the smooth wooden finish of maracas on top of a palm woven petate (Guajes, ca. 1940); or the skin of a hand holding a large metallic nail (Obrero, 1931).
