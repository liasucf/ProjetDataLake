It has flown for more than 60 years, and the Chinese licence-built Xian H-6 remains in service with the People's Liberation Army Air Force. ==Development== Monino Museum (1998) In the late 1940s, the Soviet Union was strongly committed to matching the United States in strategic bombing capability. The Soviets' only long-range bomber at the time was Tupolev's Tu-4 'Bull', a reverse-engineered copy of the American B-29 Superfortress. The development of the notably powerful Mikulin AM-3 turbojet led to the possibility of a large, jet-powered bomber. The Tupolev design bureau began work on the Tu-88 (\"Aircraft N\") prototypes in 1950. The Tu-88 first flew on 27 April 1952. After winning a competition against the Ilyushin Il-46, it was approved for production in December 1952. The first production bombers entered service with Frontal Aviation in 1954, receiving the service designation Tu-16. It received the NATO reporting name Badger-A. Rear side view of a Tu-16 Badger reconnaissance variant (most likely Tu-16R) (1989) It had a new, large swept wing and two large Mikulin AM-3 turbojets, one in each wing root. It could carry a single massive FAB-9000 conventional bomb (the Russian equivalent of the British Grand Slam) or various nuclear weapons for a range of around Production took place in 3 aviation plants - in Kazan, Kuybyshev and Voronezh. Although the Tu-16 began as a high-altitude, free-fall bomber, in the mid-1950s it was equipped to carry early Soviet cruise missiles. The Tu-16KS-1 (Badger-B) version could carry AS-1 missiles over a combat radius of . These very large weapons were aerodynamically similar to the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fighter, fitted with either a nuclear or conventional warhead, having a range of about . They were intended for use primarily against US Navy aircraft carriers and other large surface ships. Subsequent Tu-16s were converted to carry later, more advanced missiles, while their designations changed several times. Egyptian Tu-16s (1980) A versatile design, the Tu-16 was built in numerous specialized variants for aerial reconnaissance, maritime surveillance, electronic intelligence gathering (ELINT), and electronic warfare (ECM). A total of 1,507 aircraft were constructed in three plants in the Soviet Union, in 1954\u20131962. A civilian adaptation, the Tupolev Tu-104, saw passenger service with Aeroflot. The Tu-16 was also exported to Indonesia, Egypt, and Iraq. It continued to be used by the Air Forces and naval aviation of the Soviet Union and subsequently Russia, until 1993. Delivery of the Tu-16 to China began in 1958, and the Xi'an Aircraft Industrial Corporation (XAC) license-produced the aircraft under the Chinese designation Xian H-6. At least 120 of these aircraft remain in service. On 14 May 1965, one of the PLAAF Tu-16 bombers carried out the first airborne nuclear weapon test inside China. ==Variants== Among the main production variants of the Badger were the Tu-16 and Tu-16A bombers and Tu-16KS and Tu-16K-10 missile carriers, Tu-16SPS, \"Elka\", and Tu-16Ye ECM aircraft, Tu-16R reconnaissance aircraft, and Tu-16T torpedo bombers; others were produced from conversions. Individual aircraft could be modified several times, with designations changed, especially concerning missile-carrying aircraft. * \"Aircraft 88\" - Initial prototype. * \"Aircraft 97\" - Twin-engined long-range bomber development project of Tu-16 with two RD-5 engines. * \"Aircraft 103\" - Supersonic bomber development project of Tu-16 with four VD-7 AM-13 engines. * Badger A (Tu-16) \u2013 This is the basic configuration of the Tu-16 bomber deployed in 1954 to replace the Tu-4. Several modified models of this variant existed, all of which were known as Badger A in the West. ** Tu-16A \u2013 Modified Tu-16s designed to carry nuclear bombs, one of main versions, with 453 built. Many of these were subsequently converted into other variants. ** Tu-16Z \u2013 An early specialized version of the Tu-16 that served as airborne tankers (a refuelling method: wing-to-wing), though retaining their medium bomber role. ** Tu-16G (Tu-104G) \u2013 Fast air mail model, Aeroflot aircrew training version. ** Tu-16N \u2013 A dedicated tanker version for Tu-22/Tu-22M bombers, with probe and drogue system. Entered service in 1963. Similar aircraft Tu-16NN converted from Tu-16Z. ** Tu-16T \u2013 Limited production maritime strike version (torpedo bomber), that served in the Soviet Naval Aviation, and carried torpedoes, mines and depth charges. 76 built and some more converted. All units subsequently converted into Tu-16S configuration. ** Tu-16S \u2013 A lifeboat carrier version used for search and rescue operations. ** Tu-16Ye \u2013 These were equipped with heavy electronic warfare and electronic intelligence (ELINT) equipment. * Badger B (Tu-16KS) \u2013 Variant designed as a launch platform for two AS-1 Kennel/KS-1 Komet missiles. 107 built in 1954\u20131958, served with the Soviet Naval Aviation, Egypt and Indonesia. Soviet ones later converted with newer missiles. Tu-16K-10-26 Badger C * Badger C (Tu-16K-10) \u2013 Another Naval Aviation variant, units of this version carried a single AS-2 Kipper/K-10S anti-ship missile. 216 built in 1958\u20131963. It differed from other variants in having a radar in a nose. A further development, the Tu-16K-10-26, carried a single K-10S and two KSR-2 or KSR-5 AS-6 Kingfish missiles (K-26 missile complex). Some were later converted into ELINT platforms. * Badger D (Tu-16RM-1) \u2013 Maritime reconnaissance model with ELINT equipment; 23 converted from Tu-16K-10. It retained its radar in a nose and could guide K-10S missiles, fired from other planes, at targets. * Badger E (Tu-16R) \u2013 Reconnaissance version of the airframe, with ELINT equipment, first of all meant for maritime reconnaissance. It could guide KS missiles. ** Tu-16RM-2 \u2013 modified Tu-16R, serving in the Naval Aviation. It could guide KSR-2 missiles. ** Tu-16KRM \u2013 Launch platforms for target drones (a variant of Tu-16K-26). * Badger F (Tu-16RM-2) \u2013 Another reconnaissance version based on the \u221216R/RM but with the addition of external ELINT equipment. Tu-16 Badger G with KSR-5 missile * Badger G (Tu-16K/Tu-16KSR) \u2013 Serving in the Naval Aviation, these were conversions from earlier models. These were designed to carry bombs in internal bays in addition to carrying air-to-surface missiles externally, such as the AS-5 Kelt and AS-6 Kingfish. There existed numerous variants, designated either from carried missile complex (K-11, K-16 and K-26) or from missiles of these complexes (KSR-11, KSR-2 and KSR-5). Following further modifications, they were also given suffixes. Main variants: **Tu-16KSR-2 \u2013 carrying the K-16 complex (two KSR-2 missiles). Used from 1962. Similar aircraft, converted from other variants, were designated Tu-16K-16. **Tu-16K-11-16 \u2013 carrying the K-16 complex (KSR-2 missiles) or the K-11 complex (two anti-radar KSR-11 missiles). Used from 1962. Similar aircraft were designated Tu-16KSR-2-11. Over 440 Tu-16 could carry the K-16 or K-11 complex. Tu-16K-26 or Tu-16KSR-2-11-16, with KSR-5 missiles under wings (1998) **Tu-16K-26 \u2013 carrying the K-26 complex (two KSR-5 missiles), retaining a capability of KSR-2 and 11 missiles. Used from 1969. Similar aircraft were designated Tu-16KSR-2-5-11 or Tu-16KSR-2-5 (no KSR-11 capability). Over 240 Tu-16 could carry the K-26 complex. **Tu-16K-26P \u2013 carrying the K-26P missiles (two anti-radar KSR-5P missiles, as well as KSR-5, 2 or 11). * Badger H (Tu-16 Elka) \u2013 Designed for stand-off electronic warfare and electronic counter- measures support. * Badger J (Tu-16P Buket) \u2013 Another electronic warfare variant configured as an ECM strike escort. * Badger K (Tu-16Ye) \u2013 Believed to be a version of the Badger F configuration possessing enhanced ELINT capability. * Badger L (Tu-16P) \u2013 Another version of the Badger J with more modern systems and used in ELINT role. * \"Aircraft 90\" - Turboprop-powered project. * Tu-104 - Civilian airliner version. ==Former operators== H-6 in bright red, former operators in dark red ; *Armenian Air Force : 30 aircraft inherited from the Soviet Union.
