    "text": "New Narrative is a movement and theory of experimental writing launched in San Francisco in the late 1970s by Robert Gluck and Bruce Boone. New Narrative strove to represent subjective experience honestly without pretense that a text can be absolutely objective nor its meaning absolutely fluid. Authenticity is paramount in New Narrative, and is possible with a variety of devices, including fragmentation, meta-text, identity politics, explicit descriptions of sex and undisguised identification with the author's physicality, intentionality, interior emotional life and external life circumstances. The New Narrative movement includes many gay and lesbian authors, and the works were greatly influenced by the AIDS epidemic in the '80s. In addition to founders Bruce Boone and Robert Gluck, New Narrative writers include Gail Scott, Michael Amnasen, Dodie Bellamy, Kevin Killian, Sam D'Allesandro, Cookie Mueller, Dennis Cooper, Kathy Acker, Bo Huston, Camille Roy, Steve Abbott, Gary Indiana and filmmakers Warren Sonbert. == Overview == The term \"New Narrative\" was first coined in Steve Abbott's magazine Soup. The movement was founded by Robert Gl\u00fcck and Bruce Boone, two poets living in San Francisco in the late 1970s as a reaction and growth from the Language poets. The New Narrative writers began to emerge from a workshop held at Small Press Traffic Bookstore by Robert Gl\u00fcck. New Narrative writings strive to combine a representation of the author as theory-based with a representation of the author as a member of a particular identity without alienating any certain demographic of readers.Gl\u00fcck, Robert. \u201cLong Note on New Narrative.\u201d Biting the Error: Writers Explore Narrative. Ed. Mary Burger et al. Toronto: Coach House Books, 2004. == The Role of the Author == In New Narrative writing, the author acknowledges being a physical being and confronts sexuality directly.Bellamy, Dodie. \u201cLow Culture.\u201d Biting the Error: Writers Explore Narrative. Ed. Mary Burger et al. Toronto: Couch House Books, 2004. 226. This closeness between writing and writer as a body is also achieved by transgressions that appear in many of the New Narrative authors\u2019 works.Schultz, Kathy Lou. \u201cProceed Queerly: The Sentence as Compositional Unit.\u201d Biting the Error: Writers Explore Narrative. Ed. Mary Burger et al. Toronto: Couch House Books, 2004. 222. Authors create a dialogue between themselves and the readers by directly addressing and engaging the reader in their pieces. The authors also situate themselves in time and space by including pop culture references. Some authors define New Narrative writing by physical space rather than actual writing style, since the movement originated from the physical space in the writing workshops held by Robert Gl\u00fcck in the back of Small Press Traffic Bookstore. == Characteristics of New Narrative == The characteristics of New Narrative are determined and explained by members of the movement itself. In her essay \"Reading Tour\" in Pink Steam, with Kevin Killian\" In his piece Long Note on New Narrative, Robert Gl\u00fcck defines the New Narrative movement as writings that possess the following characteristics: awareness of physical space, metatext, poetic strategies applied to prose, creating works out of found material of autobiography, and \"gossip as legitimate art.\" Cunningham, Brent. Recent Bay Writing. == New Narrative and Language Poets == In \"Long Note on New Narrative,\" Robert Gl\u00fcck says that Language Poetry seemed very \"straight male,\" and he strove to find a genre that would embrace those of different identities, specifically one affiliated with the gay, lesbian, and feminist writing encompassed in New Narrative. New Narrative authors make \"emotions and the experience of the body\" and celebrate the idea of experimenting with prose as a community of writers rather than as individuals, two elements that Language Poetry seems to be lacking.Neigh, Janet. Review of Biting the Error. To summarize the difference, Dodie Bellamy wrote, \"I think of Bob Perelman's parody of lyric poetry, 'I look out the window and I am deep.' New Narrative, at its worst, would be, 'I have sex and I'm smarter than you.'\" Bellamy, Dodie. \u201cThe Cheese Stands Alone.\u201d Academonia. San Francisco: Krupskaya, 2006. 115. In an interview, Kevin Killian said that the New Narrative authors agreed with the Language Poets' ideas of transforming narrative structure, but they thought language poetry lacked \"fun.\" Also, he claimed that Language Poets were more well-versed in theory.An interview with Kevin Killian While Killian states that one of the differences between Language Poets and New Narrative writers is the Language Poets' knowledge of theory, Gl\u00fcck says that the New Narrative has its inspiration in the theorists Georg Luk\u00e1cs, Walter Benjamin, Louis Althusser, and Georges Bataille. For Killian and other New Narrative writers, the key difference here is more than simply whether or not New Narrative works use theory in general; rather, these New Narrativists are drawing our attention to their distinctly punk means of learning theory in the first place. Far from the ivory tower origins of most LANGUAGE Poetry, New Narrative writers often came into a theoretical and philosophical maturity via the free, open-to-the-public workshops that were something between a book club, a street protest, and a lecture hall.For more on the early days of New Narrative and the origin of its first wave of authors, see Dodie Bellamy and Kevin Killian's anthology \"Writers Who Love Too Much: New Narrative Writing 1977-1997\" (Nightboat Books). == Publications == Presses that publish New Narrative writing include Hard Press, Serpent's Tail, Black Star Series, and Semiotext(e). New Narrative work is also included on Robert Gl\u00fcck's online magazine, Narrativity, and in the published companion Biting the Error: Writers Explore Narrative, edited by Gl\u00fcck, Gail Scott, Mary Burger and Camille Roy. In 2017, Nighboat Books published Writers Who Love Too Much: New Narrative Writing 1977-1997, an anthology edited by Bellamy and Killian. == References == Category:LGBT literature in the United States Category:Writing circles Category:American literature ",
