Turner was given the commission to sculpt the two figures in 1899 when the hall was being redecorated. He received the commission based on the recommendation of William Silver Frith and was paid around 600 guineas for each statue. ===Statue of Queen Victoria=== After the success of \"Fishergirl\", Turner secured commissions for three public monuments in bronze of Queen Victoria who died on 22 January 1901. ;Delhi, India One was for Delhi and was unveiled by the Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab on 26 December 1902. Turner showed a bronze statuette of this work at the Royal Academy in 1903. Sadly the crown and the small statuettes representing \"Justice\" and \"Peace\", which were positioned on either side of the Queen's head were subsequently removed by vandals in 1905 when the statue was in India.

Turner described the Fulham Memorial as follows: \"In it I aimed firstly, that it should be essentially a Memorial to the fallen men, and not in any sense merely a monument to Victory. Secondly, that it should have a Spiritual significance. The surmounting figure on the cenotaph represents Glory to the Dead, holding the torch of Freedom for which they died. The sorrowing Love on the Shrine at the base, will, I think, appeal to all who have lost dear ones in the War. The symbol over the Cross is an old Celtic sign for the Voice or Presence of God\".
