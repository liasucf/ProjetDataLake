She married Herbert (Hub) Stern and helped raise ten children: a daughter, Ann Dain; three sons, Peter Suber, Tom Suber, and Jack Suber; a stepdaughter, Gwen Stern; two stepsons, Bob Stern and Hub Stern III; and three foster children, Joann Shimizu Sweet, Mark Shimizu, and Leonard Gowers. ==Career== She raised her family in Highland Park, Illinois, and began her political career in 1966 as assistant township supervisor for Deerfield Township, Illinois. With a campaign slogan \"Not one of the boys\", Stern was elected to the Lake County, Illinois Board, serving from 1967-70. In 1970, she became the first Democrat to win election to countywide office in Lake County since the American Civil War, and served as the Lake County clerk from 1970 to 1982. Stern became the Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor in 1982, but she and the party's gubernatorial nominee, Adlai Stevenson III, lost narrowly (by 5,074 votes statewide, or 0.14 percent of the vote) to incumbent Republican Governor James R. Thompson and his running mate (later disgraced Governor) George Ryan. Stern continued to be known for her wit, charm and dedication to public service as she served in the Illinois House of Representatives from 1985 to 1993. Mrs. Stern also became known for her support of women's issues, equal rights, gun control, voter registration, the disadvantaged and the mentally ill. In 1992 Stern narrowly defeated Republican Roger Keats based on winning 77% of the Lake County votes in the two-county, 29th senatorial districtGlenview Announcements Nov. 5, 1992 p. 1 and served in the Illinois State Senate from 1993 until 1995. Knowing that she was a prime target of North Shore Republicans hoping to regain the seat and control of the Illinois Senate, Stern sometimes even taped a target to her back.http://chicagoargus.blogspot.com/2011/01/extra-grace-mary-stern-handled- gag-with.html In 1994, a poor election year for Democrats, Stern narrowly lost her campaign for re-election to Republican Kathy Parker.Pioneers Press voters guide Nov. 3, 1994 p.23http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-11-09/news/9411160193_1_favor-gop- candidates-36th-district-republican-challenger ==Death and legacy== Stern died at her Highland Park home after a two year battle with brain cancer.'Illinois Blue Book 1993-1994, Biographical Sketch of Grace Mary Stern, pg. 94'Grace Mary Stern, 72, former Illinois state representative,' Chicago Tribune, May 24, 1998 She was survived by her children and ten grandchildren.
