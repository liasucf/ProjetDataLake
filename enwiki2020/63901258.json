    "text": "The 1991 NCAA Women's Golf Championships were contested at the tenth annual NCAA-sanctioned golf tournament to determine the individual and team national champions of women's collegiate golf in the United States. Until 1996, the NCAA would hold just one annual women's golf championship for all programs across Division I, Division II, and Division III. The tournament was held at the Ohio State University Golf Club in Columbus, Ohio. UCLA won the team championship, the Bruins' first. UCLA defeated San Jose State in a sudden- death playoff tie-breaker, a first for a women's NCAA championship. Future multi-LPGA major champion Annika S\u00f6renstam, from Arizona, won the individual title. ==Individual results== ===Individual champion=== * Annika Sorenstam, Arizona (290, \u22122) ==Team leaderboard== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! dat-sort-type=number|Rank !!
