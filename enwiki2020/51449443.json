    "text": "Harley and Rose is the sixth studio album by Australian rock band The Black Sorrows. The album was released in September 1990 and peaked at number three on the ARIA Charts, becoming the band's first top five album. The album remained in the top 50 for 51 weeks. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1991, the album was nominated for two ARIA Awards; ARIA Award for Album of the Year and ARIA Award for Best Group but lost to Blue Sky Mining by Midnight Oil for both awards. ==Critical reception== Tom Demalon of AllMusic felt that although \"rooted in country, folk, and blues ... the band doesn't allow themselves to be stuck in any one genre and they flirt from one style to another, enthusiastically anchored only by the literate songwriting and tight musicianship displayed throughout\". ==Track listing== ;CD (CBS \u2013 467133 2) (All track written by Joe Camilleri and Nick Smith except where noted. # \"Harley + Rose\" \u2013 3:54 # \"Never Let Me Go\" \u2013 4:03 # \"Love Goes Wild\" \u2013 3:25 # \"Hold It Up to the Mirror\" \u2013 5:43 # \"Carried by the Light\" \u2013 4:45 # \"Angel Street\" \u2013 3:55 # \"Tears for the Bride\" \u2013 4:03 # \"Small Changes\" \u2013 4:01 # \"Soul on Fire\" \u2013 5:56 # \"Calling Card\" (Burt) \u2013 4:34 # \"Cannonball Cafe\" \u2013 3:54 # \"Rise and Fall\" \u2013 3:50 # \"House of Light\" \u2013 5:01 # \"Baby It's a Crime\" \u2013 3:55 # \"Deadline Blues\" \u2013 3:16 # \"Lay Your Head Down\" \u2013 4:48 ;Vinyl (CBS 467133 1) Side A # \"Harley + Rose\" \u2013 3:54 # \"Never Let Me Go\" \u2013 4:03 # \"Love Goes Wild\" \u2013 3:25 # \"Hold It Up to the Mirror\" \u2013 5:43 # \"Angel Street\" \u2013 3:55 Side B # \"Soul on Fire\" \u2013 5:56 # \"Carried by the Light\" \u2013 4:45 # \"House of Light\" \u2013 5:01 # \"Tears for the Bride\" \u2013 4:03 # \"Cannonball Cafe\" \u2013 3:54 ==Personnel== * Accordion \u2013 George Butrumlis * Bass \u2013 Richard Sega, Joe Creighton, Stephen Hadley * Congas \u2013 Alex Pertout * Drums, percussion \u2013 Peter Luscombe * Electric guitar \u2013 Ross Hannaford * Guitar \u2013 Wayne Burt * Guitar, mandolin \u2013 Jeffrey Burstin, Sam See, Phil Butson * Harmonica \u2013 Anthony Harkin * Horns \u2013 The Brasstards * Lead vocals, harmony vocals \u2013 Vika and Linda Bull * Hammond organ, piano, Harmonium, guitar, sitar \u2013 James Black * Piano \u2013 Paul Grabowsky * Steel guitar \u2013 Lucky Oceans * Strings \u2013 Gabby O'Halloran, Stephen McTaggart * Tin whistle \u2013 Dobe Newton * Trumpet \u2013 Peter Bishop * Violin \u2013 Jen Anderson, Danny Bourke * Harmony vocals \u2013 Venetta Fields, Joe Creighton * Vocals, saxophone, guitar, Hammond organ \u2013 Joe Camilleri ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1990\u201391) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end chart=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1990) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) Chart | 72 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1991) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) Chart | 21 |} ==Certifications== ==References== ==External links== * \"Harley and Rose\" at discogs.com Category:1990 albums Category:The Black Sorrows albums Category:CBS Records albums Category:Albums produced by Joe Camilleri ",
