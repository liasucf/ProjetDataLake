In April 2014, it was announced that Dunn was signed as the new face of Maybelline New York. As of July 2014, she was declared an icon by models.com. Dunn is considered to be one of this generation's supermodels. ==Early life and discovery== Jourdan Dunn was born in Brent, London,http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales- births-1837-2006?firstname=jourdan%20s&lastname;=%20dunn and grew up in nearby Greenford with her mother.

She admitted to being self-conscious as a teenager, due to her height and weight. She stated growing up, people would often tell her she should become a model, but she was apprehensive as she was not really sure what a model did. She commented that shows like America's Next Top Model intrigued her, as they gave her a new perspective of the job. In early 2006, at the age of 15, she was scouted by an agent from Storm Management, while accompanying a friend in a London Primark. === Personal life === She has a son born in 2009 named Riley.https://www.vogue.com/article/supermodel-jourdan- dunn-sons-battle-sickle-cell-anemia-help-fight-disease/ On 1 February 2020, Dunn became engaged to rapper Dion Hamilton. ==Career== At the age of 16, Dunn made her runway debut in the New York shows in the autumn of 2007, walking in shows for Marc Jacobs and Polo Ralph Lauren, among others. Soon after, she quickly rose to prominence within the industry. In 2007, she was featured on British Vogue as a \"new star,\" and in 2008 Style.com listed her as one of the top 10 newcomers. She also walked 75 shows during the spring/summer 2008 season, including Louis Vuitton and Valentino. Dunn has since become a major fixture on runways, having walked for the industry's biggest designers. She was often distinguished for being the only black model in shows, for which she later condemned designers. She has garnered attention for her legs and for her walk which she says she practises frequently with very tall heels, walking over 60 shows during the spring 2009 season. In July 2008, Steven Meisel selected Dunn to appear on the cover of the Vogue Italia issue devoted entirely to black models. She featured as a 'Face of the Moment' in May 2009's US Vogue.

She continued to model until she was six months pregnant and couldn't fit into any of the clothes, notably walking the catwalk for the Spring 2010 Jean Paul Gaultier show, with a baby bump. At the age of 19, ten weeks after giving birth, Dunn returned to the runway at London Fashion Week for the Winter 2010 season. For returning to work so quickly, she said her motivation was her son: > More than anything, having a son has made me realise I have to make shit > work: I'm his voice, I'm his lifeline, I have to be driven. I think he > pushed me in the right direction. I've always been ambitious, but now I have > more focus. I'm more hardworking.
