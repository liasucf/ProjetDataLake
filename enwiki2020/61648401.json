His father was J\u00f8rgen Carl Scheel (1874-1944) and his mother was Erikka Ellen Estrup (1891-1960); his parents married in 1912. He was baptized in the Marie Magdalene Church in S\u00f8nderhald. Scheel was a landgrave of the Danish aristocracy. Scheel joined the Royal Danish Army as a Sekonl\u00f8jtnant in the infantry in 1939, being promoted to L\u00f8jtnant in the Royal Life Guards in the same year. In 1939 he also married Anne-Sophie Emerentze Gyldenkrone in Copenhagen on 15 July. They had four children Suzanne, Anne Beate, Christiane and Christian Detlev. In 1954 he was a Kaptajn in the Guards and he ended his military career as an Oberst in command of Denmark's Defence Motor School. Scheel is best known for his activities as an aquarist and ichthyologist. He did much to promote the hobby of fish keeping in Denmark and beyond and wrote a number of books on the subject. He also undertook a number of expeditions, often funded by the Carlsberg Foundation. On these expeditions Scheel discovered many new species of fish, especially killifishes, which he described. He was an honorary member of many aquarium societies in Denmark and elsewhere and was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Giessen in 1973. The African killifish Fundulopanchax scheeli is named in his honour. ==References== Category:Danish military personnel Category:Danish ichthyologists Category:1916 births Category:1989 deaths Category:20th-century zoologists ",
