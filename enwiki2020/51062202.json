He played college golf at the University of Tennessee after transferring from Santa Clara University. At Tennessee, he won three events. In his final collegiate event, Lamb finished T-2 at the 2013 NCAA Division I Championship. Lamb earned limited status on the 2016 Web.com Tour after a tie for 79th at qualifying school in December 2015, but had to rely on sponsor exemptions and Monday qualifying to get into tournaments. In July 2016, he won the LECOM Health Challenge, becoming the first Monday qualifier to win on the Web.com Tour since Sebastian Cappelen at the 2014 Air Capital Classic. ==Personal life== Lamb grew up playing both golf and hockey at a high level, later choosing to attend IMG Academies in Bradenton, Florida to pursue golf. Lamb's identical twin brother Scott currently plays on PGA Tour Latinoam\u00e9rica. ==Amateur wins (3)== *2012 Yale Spring Opener, Gifford Collegiate-CordeValle *2013 SeaBest Invitational Sources: ==Professional wins (1)== ===Web.com Tour wins (1)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !Margin of victory !Runners-up |- |align=center|1 |align=right|Jul 10, 2016 |LECOM Health Challenge |\u221219 (69-69-68-63=269) |Playoff | Dominic Bozzelli, Rhein Gibson, Pan Cheng-tsung |} Web.com Tour playoff record (1\u20130) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No.!!Year!!Tournament!!Opponents!!Result |-style=\"background:#D0F0C0;\" |align=center|1 |2016 |LECOM Health Challenge | Dominic Bozzelli, Rhein Gibson, Pan Cheng-tsung |Won with birdie on second extra hole |} ==See also== *2016 Web.com Tour Finals graduates ==References== ==External links== * * Category:American male golfers Category:Santa Clara Broncos men's golfers Category:Tennessee Volunteers men's golfers Category:PGA Tour golfers Category:Korn Ferry Tour graduates Category:Golfers from Indiana Category:Left-handed golfers Category:Sportspeople from South Bend, Indiana Category:1990 births Category:Living people ",
