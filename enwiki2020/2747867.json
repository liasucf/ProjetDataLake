    "text": "The 1998\u201399 NBA season was the 53rd season of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Due to a lockout, the season did not start until February 5, 1999, after a new six-year Collective Bargaining Agreement was reached between the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association. All 29 teams played a shortened 50-game regular season schedule and the 16 teams who qualified for the playoffs played a full post-season schedule. That season's All-Star Game was also canceled. The season ended with the San Antonio Spurs winning the franchise's first NBA championship, beating the New York Knicks 4 games to 1 in the 1999 NBA Finals. This was the 50th season since the BAA and NBL had merged into the NBA. ==Lockout== The second lockout in the history of the NBA lasted from July 1, 1998, to January 20, 1999. NBA owners were seeking changes to the league's salary cap system and a ceiling on individual player salaries. The National Basketball Players Association opposed the owners' plans and wanted raises for players who earned the league's minimum salary. As the labor dispute continued into September, the preseason was shortened to just two games instead of the normal eight, and training camps were postponed indefinitely. By October, it became the first time in NBA history that games were canceled due to a labor dispute. Further games were canceled by November and December, including the All-Star Game, which had been scheduled to be played on February 14, 1999. The preseason consisted of 2 exhibition games. An agreement between the owners and players was eventually reached on January 18, 1999. When play resumed, the regular season was shortened to 50 games per team, as opposed to the normal 82. To preserve games between teams in the same conference, much of the time missed was made up for by skipping well over half of the games played between teams in the opposite conference. As a result, some teams did not meet each other at all during the course of the shortened season. ==Notable occurrences== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"float:right\" |+Coaching changes ! colspan=\"3\"|Offseason |- !

He would later return to play two more seasons for the Washington Wizards from 2001\u20132003. *The New York Knicks became only the second #8 seed to advance in the playoffs by defeating a #1 seed. As of 2020, they remain the only #8 seed to have advanced to the NBA Finals. *The Los Angeles Lakers played their final season at the Great Western Forum. Because the Great Western Bank ceased to exist two seasons prior, the arena name was replaced by the team name on center court, in anticipation of the move to the Staples Center. *The Los Angeles Clippers played their final season at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. *The Indiana Pacers played their final season at the Market Square Arena. *The Denver Nuggets played their final season at the McNichols Sports Arena. *The Miami Heat played their final full season at the Miami Arena, although they still played the first two months of the following season at this arena before moving to the American Airlines Arena in January 2000. *The Toronto Raptors played their first game in Air Canada Centre on February 21. *The San Antonio Spurs became the first former ABA team to win a championship.

In December 2009, this record was broken by the New Jersey Nets who lost the first eighteen games of the season. *Hall of Fame coach Red Holzman died on November 13, 1998, at age 78. *For the first time in 15 seasons, the Chicago Bulls missed the playoffs. They would also become the second defending champion in NBA history that failed to make the playoffs, joining the 1969\u201370 Boston Celtics. ==1998\u201399 NBA changes== * The Indiana Pacers added new gold pinstripe alternate uniforms. * The Minnesota Timberwolves added new black alternate uniforms. * The New Jersey Nets added new gray alternate uniforms. * The Orlando Magic changed their uniforms, replacing the pinstripes with slightly visible stars on their jerseys. * The Sacramento Kings added new purple alternate uniforms. * The Toronto Raptors moved into Air Canada Centre during the regular season. * The Utah Jazz added new black uniforms. ==Final standings== ===By division=== ===By conference=== Notes *z \u2013 Clinched home court advantage for the entire playoffs *c \u2013 Clinched home court advantage for the conference playoffs *y \u2013 Clinched division title *x \u2013 Clinched playoff spot ==Playoffs== Teams in bold advanced to the next round.
