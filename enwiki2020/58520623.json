    "text": "Vega flight VV02 was the second flight of the Vega launcher. It occurred from the Guiana Space Centre on at 02:06:31UTC. == Payload == The flight was a multi-payload mission that deployed 3 satellites (2 Earth observation satellites and 1 educational CubeSat) into orbit, with a total payload mass of about including the satellites themselves (about 255 kg) and the satellites adapter and dispenser. === PROBA-V === PROBA-Vegetation, with a mass of , was in the upper position and was the first satellite to be separated, approximately 55 minutes and 27 seconds after liftoff. Its target was a quasi- circular sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of and an inclination of 98.73\u00b0. === VNREDSat-1 === VNREDSat-1, with a mass of , was in the lower position. Its target orbit was a quasi-circular sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of and an inclination of 98.1\u00b0, to be deployed 1 hour, 57 minutes and 24 seconds after liftoff. === ESTCube-1=== The Estonian Student Satellite-1 (ESTCube-1), with a 1U volume and a mass of , was the only CubeSat onboard Vega's second flight. It was accommodated in the lower position of the structure, and was deployed by the ISIPOD dispenser 3 minutes and 24 seconds after VNREDSat-1 in approximately the same orbit. It operated for more than 2 years before contact was completely lost on . == Mission description == === Launch date === After being postponed twice, the successful Vega flight took place on at 02:06:31UTC ( at 23:06:31 local time) from the ELV launch pad in Kourou, French Guiana. It was the Arianespace launch of after Ariane 5 VA212, followed by another 3 Ariane 5 and 2 Soyuz flights. === Orbit === The mission was planned to last 2 hours and 48 seconds, placing its respectively primary and secondary payloads into quasi-circular sun-synchronous orbits at altitudes of respectively and . == References == Category:Vega (rocket) Category:2013 in French Guiana Category:2013 in spaceflight Category:Rocket launches in 2013 ",
