    "text": "Michel-Philippe Bouvart (Chartres, 11 January 1717 - Paris, 19 January 1787) was a French medical doctor. He was made a member of the French Academy of Sciences in 1743 and a professor in the Paris Faculty of Medicine in 1745 and also in the Coll\u00e8ge Royal in 1745, where he took the medical chair previously held by Pierre-Jean Burette. Louis XV granted him letters of nobility and the Order of St. Michael in 1768 or 1769.Hugh James Rose, A New General Biographical Dictionary, 1848 4:484, s.v. Bouvart was famous for his quick diagnoses and accurate prognoses, but also for his caustic wit and polemical writing against his fellow physicians, notably Th\u00e9odore Tronchin, Th\u00e9ophile de Bordeu, Exup\u00e8re Joseph Bertin, Antoine Petit. He was opposed to inoculation against smallpox. He championed Virginia polygala or Seneka as a remedy for snakebite.Alexander Chalmers, The General Biographical Dictionary etc., 6:247 Although he was able and learned, he is perhaps best known for his witticisms.Gaston de L\u00e9vis, Souvenirs et portraits, 1780-1789, 1813, p. 240 ==Witticisms== Variants of Bouvart's quip about the placebo effect of using a new treatment or medicine \"while it still works\" are often quoted without crediting him. A \"regular prelate\" (pr\u00e9lat r\u00e9gulier) is a high-ranking churchman; this is a play on words, implying that he was irregular, that is, immoral. Abbot Terray is Joseph Marie Terray. This story has been compared to Euricius Cordus's epigram: ==Early life== Bouvart's father Claude was a physician.Gu\u00e9net, Eloge historique Michel-Philippe received his medical degree in Reims in 1730 and practiced in Chartres. In 1736, he left for Paris. ==Bibliography== * Antoine Jean Baptiste Maclou Guenet, \u00c9loge historique de Michel-Philippe Bouvart, chez Quillau, Paris, 1787 full text * Nicolas de Condorcet, \u00c9loge de M.
