It is one of the components of Pro-Vision, Inc., which also operates an after- school program and an aquaponics facility. it was the city's only school catering to students classified as at risk that was headed by a former professional American football player. ==History== Roynell Young established the institution in 1990; initially it only admitted male students and was solely an after-school program. He received inspiration after visiting many predominately low-income African-American neighborhoods. He began a partnership with the Houston Independent School District (HISD), to establish a district-affiliated charter school for boys, then in the Third Ward. It was the first charter middle school only for male students in the city; Young argued that having female students would break the concentration of male students. Young acquired the land for a permanent campus in 2008. Donations from private entities provided the funding. The occurrence of Hurricane Ike delayed the move, which occurred in November 2008. In 2013 Pro-Vision ended its HISD affiliation and became a charter school with direct oversight from the State of Texas. In 2014 the school began admitting female students. In 2019 The Robert and Janice McNair Foundation, of Bob McNair, sent more $4,500,000 to the school, making it the largest donation it ever received. The donation was used to fund an addition for its building. The school also, by 2016, received a grant from the federal government for the expansion, and it was expected to receive $2.8 million. In addition it hoped to use donations from private entities. ==Governance== Jeff Van Gundy is on the board of directors. Young had asked Van Gundy to join the board. ==Operations== the school expects its teachers to work, each, for ten months, with sixty hours per week, and also doing extra unpaid volunteer work on weekend and summer periods.

The National Football League (NFL) sponsored the football field. The Third Ward facility used prior to the Sunnyside site was in a one-story building at Cullen Boulevard and Balkin Street. The building was made of brick. From 1995 to 2000 it had occupied around five different sites.
