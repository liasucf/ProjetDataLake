This included an online Change.org petition addressed to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the House of Commons of Canada. The House of Commons voted unanimously on September 27, 2018 to revoke her honorary citizenship. The Senate of Canada approved a motion to the same effect unanimously on October 2, 2018. With revocation motions passed by both houses, the Government of Canada stated that it recognized Parliament's decision to revoke the honour. ==See also== * Citizenship * Honorary citizenship of the United States ==Notes== ==References== Canada Category:Canadian awards Category:Canadian nationality law ",
