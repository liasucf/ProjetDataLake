Like the Durannies, the Thompson Twins take a ride on the back of the dance explosion and water it down to a whimper.\" Billboard described \"Get That Love\" as a \"cheerful pop romp\" which \"seems to signal a swing back to jumpy spontaneity over hi-tech polish\". Cash Box picked the single as one of their \"feature picks\" of March 1987 and described it as a \"sparkling pop spectacle\", with a \"good, solid performance\". In a review of Close to the Bone, Fred Dellar of Hi-Fi News & Record Review picked \"Get That Love\" as one of three tracks that had \"the hooks and looks of hits\". ==Formats== ;7\" Single #\"Get That Love\" \u2013 4:00 #\"Perfect Day\" \u2013 4:26 ;12\" Single #\"Get That Love (Extended version)\" \u2013 6:28 #\"Get That Love (7\" version)\" \u2013 4:00 #\"Perfect Day\" \u2013 4:26 ;12\" Single (America only #\"Get That Love (7\" version)\" \u2013 3:57 #\"Perfect Day\" \u2013 4:26 #\"Get That Love (Extended version)\" \u2013 6:25 #\"Get That Love (Dub)\" \u2013 6:58 ;CD Single #\"Get That Love (Extended version)\" \u2013 6:33 #\"Perfect Day\" \u2013 4:31 #\"Get That Love (Dub)\" \u2013 7:03 #\"Get That Love (7\" version)\" \u2013 4:03 ==Personnel== * Tom Bailey \u2013 lead vocals, keyboards, guitar, bass, associate producer, programming * Alannah Currie \u2013 percussion, backing vocals, artwork direction ;Additional Personnel * Rupert Hine \u2013 producer * Griff Fender, Pikey Butler, The Mint Juleps \u2013 backing vocals * Stephen W.
