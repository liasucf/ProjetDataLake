    "text": "Corunastylis laminata, commonly known as the red midge orchid, is a small terrestrial orchid endemic to New South Wales. It has a single thin leaf fused to the flowering stem and up to twenty bright reddish flowers. It grows in heath and grassy forest in a few places on the South Coast and Central Tablelands. ==Description== Corunastylis laminata is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single thin leaf long and fused to the flowering stem with the free part long. Between five and twenty bright reddish flowers are arranged along a flowering stem long. The flowers lean downwards slightly and are long and wide. As with others in the genus, the flowers are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is about long and wide with hairless edges and darker coloured bands. The lateral sepals are long, about wide, turn downwards, with a humped base and a sharply pointed tip. There is sometimes a small gland on the tip of the lateral sepals. The petals are long, about wide with hairless edges. The labellum is oblong to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, about long and wide and fleshy. There is a broad, tapering callus in the centre of the labellum and extending nearly to its tip. Flowering occurs from January to May. ==Taxonomy and naming== The red midge orchid was first formally described in 1885 by Robert D. FitzGerald who gave it the name Prasophyllum laminatum and published the description in Journal of Botany, British and Foreign. In 2004, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to Corunastylis laminata. The specific epithet (laminata) is derived from the Latin word lamina meaning \"a thin plate\", \"blade\" or \"sheet\". The World Checklist of Selected Plant Families lists C. laminata as a synonym of Genoplesium rufum. ==Distribution and habitat== Corunastylis laminata grows in heathy or grassy forest between Jervis Bay and Bowral. ==References== ==External links== * laminata Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Plants described in 1885 ",
