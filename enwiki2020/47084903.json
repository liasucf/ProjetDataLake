    "text": "Qalet Marku Battery (), also known as D'Orbeau Battery (), was an artillery battery in Ba\u0127ar i\u010b-\u010aag\u0127aq, limits of Naxxar, Malta. It was built in 1715\u20131716 by the Order of Saint John as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands. The battery has been largely destroyed, but some remains can still be seen. ==History== Qalet Marku Battery was built in 1715\u20131716 as part of the first building programme of coastal batteries in Malta. The nearest fortifications to the battery were Saint Mark's Tower to the north, Qalet Marku Redoubt to the west (now demolished) and Ba\u0127ar i\u010b-\u010aag\u0127aq Redoubt to the east. Construction of the battery cost 1165 scudi. Foundations of Qalet Marku Battery with Saint Mark's Tower in the distance The battery originally consisted of a pentagonal gun platform with an embrasured parapet wall. A rectangular blockhouse was located in the centre of the battery, while the entire structure was surrounded by a rock-hewn ditch. The battery was still in good condition until the first half of the 20th century. It seems to have been severely damaged before or during World War II. At this point, a concrete bunker was built on one side of the ruined battery. ==Present day== Today, only the ditch and part of the scarp wall are still visible, although they are covered in vegetation. Despite this, the site is considered to have significant archaeological potential if properly excavated and studied. ==References== ==External links== *National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands Category:Batteries in Malta Category:Castles and fortifications of the Knights Hospitaller Category:Military installations established in 1715 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in the 20th century Category:Ruins in Malta Category:Naxxar Category:Limestone buildings in Malta Category:National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands Category:18th-century fortifications Category:1715 establishments in Malta ",
