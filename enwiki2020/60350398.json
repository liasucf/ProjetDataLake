He played his junior rugby league for the Greta Branxton Colts. ==Career== Young made his debut in Round 3 of the 2019 NRL season against the Newcastle Knights. In round 25 against the New Zealand Warriors, Young was referred to the match review committee after it was alleged by Fox Sports that he tried to gouge the eyes of New Zealand player Adam Pompey. Young was subsequently found guilty and suspended for 8 matches. This was the second time during the 2019 NRL season in which Young was suspended for eye gouging. The first incident occurred earlier in the year when Young was found guilty of attempting to eye gouge Canterbury- Bankstown player Aiden Tolman. Young was suspended for 5 matches over that incident. ==References== ==External links== *Raiders profile Category:1998 births Category:Australian rugby league players Category:Canberra Raiders players Category:Living people Category:Rugby league second-rows ",
