He was a member of Czechoslovak Army in the interwar period. In his free time he was perfecting his swimming skills in Jewish sport clubs Makabi Brno and Bar Kochba Brno. In July 1942, three years into the occupation of Czechoslovakia by Nazi forces, he managed to escape from the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia to Switzerland, swimming through Bodensee from the German side. He spent the wartime in Geneva helping the Czech delegate at the League of Nations in the Information Office. After World War II, he returned to Czechoslovakia, where he continued to serve in the military. After the communist coup d'etat of 1948, Piowaty emigrated with the whole family to Canada, where he worked as a furniture merchant. ==References== Category:1900 births Category:1978 deaths Category:Czech male swimmers Category:Olympic swimmers of Czechoslovakia Category:Swimmers at the 1924 Summer Olympics Category:Sportspeople from Brno Category:Czech Jews Category:Jewish sportspeople Category:Czechoslovak emigrants to Canada ",
