    "text": "Childebrand I (678 - 751 or 743) was a Frankish duke (dux), illegitimate son of Pepin of Heristal and Alpaida, and brother Charles Martel. He was born in Autun, where he would later die. He married Emma of Austrasia and was given Burgundy by his father, becoming a duke. He distinguished himself in the expulsion of the Saracens from Francealongside his brother. He was the patron of the continuator of the Chronicle of Fredegar, as was his son Nibelung I. Some scholars believe that Childebrand was actually the half-brother of Charles Martel, related through his father. His date of death is also contentious, as some sources place his death at 743 while others claim he lived until 751. ==References== === Notes === * Category:678 births Category:751 deaths Category:8th-century Frankish nobility Category:Frankish warriors Category:Pippinids Category:People from Autun Category:European royalty stubs Category:7th-century Frankish nobility ",
