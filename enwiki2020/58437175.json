    "text": "\"Believe\" is a song by Lenny Kravitz from his third album, Are You Gonna Go My Way. It was released as the second single from the album on May 10, 1993 by Virgin Records. It is a rock ballad with string orchestration, and was co- written, arranged and produced by Kravitz, with Henry Hirsch also contributing to the orchestration and composition. Its lyrics concern one being able to achieve freedom and \"eternal grace\" if they believe in themselves and put their faith in God. \"Believe\" was the first song from the album to be issued as a commercial single and to chart in the US, where it reached number 60 on the Billboard Hot 100. It found bigger success internationally, reaching number one in Iceland and the top 10 in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. ==Critical reception== Like much of Kravitz's previous material and the Are You Gonna Go My Way album, critics noted its musical influences, with Scott Poulson-Bryant of Rolling Stone pointing out the similarity between its \"string-laden\" coda and that of the 1971 song \"Layla\" by Derek and the Dominos. Writing for the Chicago Tribune, Patrick Kampert compared its sound, along with that of album track \"Just Be a Woman\", to the works of the Beatles. In retrospective reviews of the album, Renowned for Sound said the track \"still sounds relevant today\", calling it an \"uplifting rock ballad\" and acclaiming its \"impressive vocals and violin filled chorus [that is] very pleasant to the ear\". Reviewing the album's deluxe edition for The Morton Report, Chaz Lipp called it a \"rock radio hit\" and \"one of the biggest production numbers, with lush orchestration and phased lead vocals. It's a soaring, inspirational gem.\" ==Music video== The music video for \"Believe\" was directed by French director Michel Gondry, with visual effects contributed by the French company BUF Compagnie. It is an homage to Stanley Kubrick's 1968 science fiction film 2001: A Space Odyssey, with the Deutsches Filminstitut calling it \"pretty close\" to the look of the original film. ==Track listing== ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from album liner notes. * Lenny Kravitz \u2013 lead and background vocals, bass guitar, drums, production * Henry Hirsch \u2013 Wurlitzer, engineering, mixing * Craig Ross \u2013 acoustic and electric guitar * Michael Hunter \u2013 French horn * Eric Delente \u2013 violin * Soye Kim \u2013 violin * Robert Lawrence \u2013 violin * Sarah Adams \u2013 viola * Liuh-Wen Ting \u2013 viola * Allen Whear \u2013 cello * Frank Murphy \u2013 cello * Carolyn Davies Fryer \u2013 double bass ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1993) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Iceland (\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40) |1 |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Poland (LP3) |12 |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1993) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA) |54 |- !scope=\"row\"|Canada Top Singles (RPM) |52 |- !scope=\"row\"|Iceland (\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40) |18 |- !scope=\"row\"|New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) |25 |} ==Certifications== ==References== Category:1993 singles Category:1993 songs Category:Lenny Kravitz songs Category:Rock ballads Category:Number-one singles in Iceland ",
