He succeeded his father, A\u0161\u0161ur- n\u0113r\u0101r\u012b II, to the throne and is best known for his treaty with Kassite king Karainda\u0161. ==Biography== Schroeder's line art for one of A\u0161\u0161\u016br-b\u0113l-n\u012b\u0161\u0113\u0161u\u2019s memorial cones.Cone VAT 7442, first published KAH 2 no. 22 (1922). As was the practice during this period of the Assyrian monarchy, he modestly titled himself \u201cvice-regent\u201d, or i\u0161\u0161i'ak A\u0161\u0161ur, of the god Ashur. \u00a7236\u2014240. The Synchronistic ChronicleSynchronistic Chronicle (ABC 21), tablet K4401a, i 1\u20134. records his apparently amicable territorial treaty with Karainda\u0161, king of Babylon, and recounts that they \u201ctook an oath together concerning this very boundary.\u201d His numerous clay cone inscriptions (line art for an example pictured) celebrate his re-facing of Puzur-A\u0161\u0161ur III\u2019s wall of the \u201cNew City\u201d district of Assur. Contemporary legal documents detail sales of land, houses, and slaves and payment in lead. The Assyrian credit system was fairly sophisticated, with loans issued for commodities such as barley and lead, interest coming due when repayment way delayed. The security posted for loans could include property, the person of the debtor or indeed his children. There is a discrepancy in the data about his son and eventual successor. The Assyrian King List gives his immediate successor, A\u0161\u0161ur-r\u0101\u2019im-ni\u0161\u0113\u0161u, as his son, but A\u0161\u0161ur-r\u0101\u2019im-ni\u0161\u0113\u0161u's own contemporary inscriptionCone VAT? 2764, first published KAH 1 no. 63 (1911). names his father as A\u0161\u0161ur-n\u0113r\u0101r\u012b II, suggesting that he may have been a brother of A\u0161\u0161\u016br-b\u0113l-n\u012b\u0161\u0113\u0161u. The confusion is further compounded with the Khorsabad Kinglist and the SDAS Kinglist identifying Eriba-Adad I, who ascended the throne eighteen years later, as his son while the Nassouhi copy identifies him as the son of A\u0161\u0161ur-r\u0101\u2019im-ni\u0161\u0113\u0161u. ==Inscriptions== ==References== Category:15th-century BC Assyrian kings Category:14th-century BC Assyrian kings Category:Assyrian kings Category:15th- century BC rulers Category:14th-century BC rulers Category:1398 BC deaths Category:Year of birth unknown ",
