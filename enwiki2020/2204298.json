He was granted the Seigneury of Villena in 1252, created for him to govern that lordship as \"apanage\" (a medieval micro-state that would return to the central crown if the minor lineage ends with no successor). This lordship would grow by receiving the cities around the Vinalop\u00f3 River (Elda valley, Aspe, Crevillente, Elche). He also received the Adelantamiento of the Kingdom of Murcia. Manuel travelled to Italy in 1259 as part of the embassy sent by his father to Pope Alexander IV. Later, when his brother became king Alfonso X the Wise, served him as Alf\u00e9rez and Majordomo of the king. He died at Pe\u00f1afiel in 1283 and was buried in the Monastery of Ucl\u00e9s. His son Juan Manuel, who succeeded him in Villena and Pe\u00f1afiel among the others, and became prince of Villena, was a notable medieval writer. Manuel of Castile, as son of Ferdinand III of Castile, belonged to the royal House of Burgundy of Castile and Le\u00f3n, but he was also the first of a new family branch, the House of Manuel of Villena.
