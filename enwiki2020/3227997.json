    "text": "Dragonlord is an American symphonic black metal band that was formed in 2001 as a side project by Eric Peterson & Steve Di Giorgio of Testament, and Steve Smyth of Nevermore. The band is a result of Eric Peterson's interest in darker music, and not being able to do that with Testament he formed Dragonlord. The band combines elements of black metal (screeching vocals, keyboards) with some thrash guitar influences. Lyrical themes vary, either about the rage of a dragon (hence the name), death, war, lost love, Satanic or otherwise anti- religious themes (common in black metal), or combinations. DiGiorgio later left the group and was replaced by former Testament bassist Derrick Ramirez. Former Psypheria member Lyle Livingston plays keyboards for the band, and Jon Allen is their drummer. They have released three albums, Rapture in 2001,Black Wings of Destiny in 2005 and Dominion in 2018. In 2009, Eric Peterson released the following statement via Kerrang magazine:KERRANG! : Peterson says no Dragonlord album until 2011. In 2010, Eric Peterson issued another statement via Terrorizer magazine: On March 7, 2012, Dragonlord was signed to Spinefarm/Universal Records. As of October 2013, according to Eric Peterson, Dragonlord is recording a new album, \"Dominion\", which is set to release in early 2017. In April 2015, it was announced \"Dominion\" is currently in the mixing stage. The album \"Dominion\" was released September 21 2018. ==Members== ===Current members=== * Eric Peterson - vocals, guitars, bass * Lyle Livingston - keyboards * Alex Bent - drums * Leah \u2013 female vocals and choirs ===Former members=== * Steve Di Giorgio - bass (2000\u20132001) * Steve Smyth - guitars (2000\u20132005) * Derrick Ramirez - bass * Mark Black - guitars * Jon Allen - drums * Claudeous Creamer - guitars * Steve Schmidt - bass * Gian Pyres - touring guitarist (2005-2006) ==Discography== * Rapture (2001) * Black Wings of Destiny (2005) * Dominion (2018) ==References== ==External links== *Official Dragonlord website *Dragonlord at Encyclopaedia Metallum Category:American black metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 2001 Category:Symphonic black metal musical groups Category:Musical quintets ",
