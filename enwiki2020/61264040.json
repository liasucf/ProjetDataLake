Constantinos Trompoukis and John Lascaratos stated in \"Greek Professors of the Medical School of Constantinople during a Period of Reformation (1839\u201376),\" that Greeks were well-represented among founding staff due to their foreign- language skills and their study experiences in Europe; they took the roles as many Ottoman Muslims hitherto did not focus on foreign languages. Johann Strauss, author of \"Twenty Years in the Ottoman Capital: The Memoirs of Dr. Hristo Tanev Stambolski of Kazanlik (1843-1932) from an Ottoman Point of View,\" wrote that in the teaching staff \"Greeks were especially conspicuous\". In addition professors from Germany joined the faculty, and the non-Ottomans and non-Muslims made up a sizeable portion of the teaching staff. The building suffered from a fire in 1848 which destroyed some official records. The school moved to the Golden Horn. In 1850 the school had eleven regular professors; four of them were ethnic Greeks. In 1861 the Counsel of Civil Medical Affairs requested that the medical college begin licensing pharmacists after incidents with unlicensed pharmacists caused injuries and deaths in the empire. Afterwards pharmacists were required to have a master of pharmacy from the Imperial Medical School, or an equivalent from a university in Europe.American Druggist and Pharmaceutical Record, Volume 42. American Druggist Publishing Company, 1903. p. 143. It moved to the gardens of Topkap\u0131 Palace in Sarayburnu (Seraglio Point) in 1866, and that year alumnus Salih Effendi became the head of the school. By the 1860s advocates of French medium instruction and Ottoman Turkish medium instruction were engaged in conflict; Turks advocated for Turkish while minority groups and foreigners advocated for French. Spyridon Mavrogenis, employed in the imperial medical school as a professor, advocated for the usage of French. \\- First published November 1, 2003. - Cited: p. 228 (PDF p. 3/5). The governing body, the Dari-Choura, adopted the proposal of Ahmet Bey to make Ottoman Turkish the instructional language, arguing that Muslim students were at a disadvantage with French; at the time Muslims made up about 66% of the students.Sarell, R. \"Turkey.\" In: Dobell, Horace Benge (editor).

By 1871, after the Tanzimat movement gave additional rights to Christian minorities, the school had a Greek director. Of the 18 other professors, nine were Greeks. It merged with the civilian medical school in 1909 to form what was known as the Medical School. ==Governance== Circa 1871 the Dari-Choura were the governing body of the school. According to Dr. R. Sarell, who was a doctor employed at the Imperial Maternity Hospital in the city, many members had a military background or lacked an education altogether, something he criticised them for. ==Notable people== ; Professors * Constantinos Caratheodory (1802-1879) * Spyridon Mavrogenis Strauss identified Sarandes Archigenes (1809-1874) a.k.a.
