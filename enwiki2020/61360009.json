Capsules are nearly spherical and 2mm long. It thrives in acidic, rocky mountain soils, especially where there is snow cover for a large part of the year, and on summit ridges. It grows in continental Europe and in Scotland. This species became extinct in England in the 1950s. ==References== Category:Bartramiales category:Flora of Europe ",
