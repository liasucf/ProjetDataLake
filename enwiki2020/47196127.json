    "text": "The Multinational Land Force (MLF), also known as the Italian\u2013Hungarian\u2013Slovenian Battlegroup is an EU Battlegroup led by Italy, in which Hungary and Slovenia also participate. The MLF originated in the late 1990s, when Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi took the initiative to form a Trilateral Brigade with Slovenia and Hungary. The Italian Alpine Brigade Julia formed the core of the new battlegroup, and also provided its headquarters in Udine; the Slovenian 10th Motorized Battalion and the Hungarian 1st Light Infantry Battalion moved in with them on 5 September 2001. On 10 January 2002, the MLF was formally established, after which training exercises began. == References == Category:Battlegroups of the European Union Category:Military of Hungary Category:Military of Italy Category:Military of Slovenia ",
