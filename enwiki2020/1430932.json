In the early 1990s (1992) they had the opportunity to record what was the sequel to the explosion of Puerto Rican hip-hop, as it was the second production of \"the Noise.\" On this tape, they had the opportunity to record about ten minutes, a song that the audience welcomed well by the strong content that was talking about blunts, whores, a ton of bad words (that at that time no one heard of), about \"Guillaera\", \"Bellakeo\", \"Perreo\", things that were not common at that time was very extroverted and full of controversy. For the next years a tragedy, the murder of a close friend called Misael, is what motivates them to write a very deep song and had the opportunity to record it in \"The Noise 3\" and is nothing more than the song \"Amigo\" that was a hit and gave an incredible fame to \"Las Guanabanas\", because their lyrics were very mature for that time and for them that they were Teenagers. People who have follow them through their entire careers have truly seen what this singers have gone through and have seen their evolution in the world of Caribbean Hip-Hop, Rap and Reggaeton. In 1998 they released their first production \"Back To Reality\" in the hands of Dj Nelson and Flow Music. Then in 1999, they released the sequel \"Back to Reality 2\". In 2002, they launched their third production \"G-3: Guillaera,\" although it did not have the same impact as their previous productions for their explicit dirty content, this production was of greater international projection that together with previous songs of the Duo to this date are still played on the radio and are considered classic hits of Reggaeton.
