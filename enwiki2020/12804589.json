    "text": "Lutheran viewpoints concerning homosexuality are diverse because there is no one worldwide body which represents all Lutherans. The Lutheran World Federation, a worldwide 'communion of churches' and the largest global body of Lutherans, contains member churches on both sides of the issue. However, other Lutherans, including the Confessional Evangelical Lutheran Conference and International Lutheran Council (another worldwide bodies of Lutherans), completely reject homosexuality. ==Luther's view== Martin Luther, who had spent time in Rome said that Pope Leo X had vetoed a measure that cardinals should restrict the number of boys they kept for their pleasure, \"otherwise it would have been spread throughout the world how openly and shamelessly the pope and the cardinals in Rome practice sodomy;\" encouraging Germans not to spend time fighting fellow countrymen in defense of the papacy.; This allegation (made in the pamphlet Warnunge D. Martini Luther/ An seine lieben Deudschen, Wittenberg, 1531) is in stark contrast to Luther's earlier praise of Leo's \"blameless life\" in a conciliatory letter of his to the pope dated 6 September 1520 and published as a preface to his Freedom of a Christian. See on this, . Luther also noted: :I for my part do not enjoy dealing with this passage [Genesis 19:4-5], because so far the ears of the Germans are innocent of and uncontaminated by this monstrous depravity; for even though disgrace, like other sins, has crept in through an ungodly soldier and a lewd merchant, still the rest of the people are unaware of what is being done in secret. The Carthusian monks deserve to be hated because they were the first to bring this terrible pollution into Germany from the monasteries of Italy.Luther\u2019s Works, Vol. 3, 251-252 == Synods allowing homosexual relationships == ===In North America=== In 1970, Strommen, et al. surveyed 4,745 Lutheran adults between the ages of 15 and 65. They were members of the American Lutheran Church, Lutheran Church in America, and Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod. 1% stated that they frequently had homosexual intercourse during the past year and 3% stated that they did so occasionally. 90% said that they never had homosexual intercourse during the past year, and 7% did not respond.See Merton P. Strommen et al., A Study of Generations (Minneapolis: Augsburg Publishing, 1972), p. 372. ==== Evangelical Lutheran Church in America ==== The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the largest Lutheran church body in the United States, allows for LGBTQ+ marriage and ordination of LGBTQ+ clergy. ELCA policy states that LGBTQ+ individuals are welcome and encouraged to become members and to participate in the life of the congregation. The ELCA has provided supplemental resources for the rite of marriage in Evangelical Lutheran Worship which use inclusive language and are suitable for use in LGBTQ+ marriage ceremonies. The group ReconcilingWorks supports the full inclusion of LGBTQ+ members in Lutheran churches in the ELCA, and provides resources to assist ELCA congregations in becoming more welcoming communities for LGBTQ+ persons. ReconcilingWorks recognizes ELCA congregations that have committed to embracing LGBTQ+ persons as Reconciling in Christ congregations. The current policy on LGBTQ+ inclusion in the ELCA developed over a period of several years. In 2001, a Social Statement on Sexuality was requested by the Churchwide Assembly and entrusted to a Task Force. In light of the ongoing work of that task force, the 2007 Churchwide Assembly passed a resolution asking bishops to exercise restraint in discipline of those congregations and pastors in violation of 'Vision and Expectations.' Prior to August 2009, the ELCA expected \"ordained ministers who are homosexual in their self- understanding\" to \"abstain from homosexual sexual relationships\". The 2009 ELCA Churchwide Assembly in Minneapolis passed \"Human Sexuality, Gift and Trust\",ELCA:Legislative summary 4 & 5 which approved more positive assessments of same-gender partnerships in the church. On 21 August 2009, the same body passed four ministry policy resolutions that opened the way for congregations to recognize and support such partnerships and for those in committed same- gender partnerships to be rostered leaders within the ELCA.ELCA:Legislative summary 8 & 9 StarTribune:ELCA validates 'chaste' same-sex relationships A separate motion at the same assembly recommended that a rite of blessing for same-sex unions be provided. In 2013, Guy Erwin, who has lived in a gay partnership for 19 years, was installed in California as Bishop of the ELCA's Southwest California Synod, becoming the first openly gay person to serve as a Bishop in the ELCA. ==== Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada ==== In July 2011 Churchwide Assembly of Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada passed a new sexuality statement, permitting clergy in committed same-gender partnerships and allowing the blessing of same-sex unions.Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada votes to bless same-sex marriage and is cheered on by the anglican Church of Canada === In Europe === In many European Lutheran churches, open LGBT people can work as Lutheran pastors. The Lutheran Church in Great Britain has stepped back from a more accepting position of LGBT Christians for fear of losing its African and Asian congregations. ==== EKD in Germany ==== Emmaus Church in Berlin, Germany. EKD, where blessings of same-sex marriages were allowed in 2018 (dark purple). In the year 2000, the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) passed the resolution Verantwortung und Verl\u00e4sslichkeit st\u00e4rken, in which same-gender partnerships are supported.EKD:Verantwortung und Verl\u00e4sslichkeit st\u00e4rken In November 2010, EKD passed a new right for LGBT ordination of homosexual ministers, who live in civil unions.EKD:EKD-Synode beschlie\u00dft neues Pfarrdienstgesetz (german) Most churches within the EKD allowed blessing of same-sex marriages.Evangelisch.de: Segnung homosexueller Paare.

Starting in November 2009, the church officiates same-sex marriage, since the Riksdag allowed same- sex marriage starting 1 May said year\u2014however, individual priests can choose not to perform marriages for couples of the same gender. The Church of Denmark also provides for such blessings, as does the Church of Norway, which also ordains gays and lesbians. The largest Lutheran church in Europe that doesn't\u2014despite ongoing controversy\u2014permit blessing of same-sex unions is the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland. The Church of Finland does, however, allow priests to pray for same-sex couples, as of October 2010. For registered partnerships, the church says that \"the [same-sex] couple may organise prayers with a priest or other church workers and invited guests.\" Additionally, Archbishop Kari M\u00e4kinen expressed his support for the new law permitting same- gender marriages. In 2016, although the bishops in Finland did not agree to perform same-sex marriages, \"bishops have taken the position that it is possible to hold prayer services to bless same-sex couples.\" Tens of thousands of Finns have resigned from the church during the 2010s due to comments made by church officials either supporting or condemning same sex marriages and relations.Eroakirkosta.fi - Tasa-arvoinen avioliitto -\u00e4\u00e4netys sai konservatiivit eroamaan kirkostaEroakirkosta.fi - Yli 56 000 eronnut t\u00e4n\u00e4 vuonna - Homoillan j\u00e4lkeen 30 000 eroamista The Church of Iceland allows same- sex marriage. https://www.queer.de/detail.php?article_id=12303 === South America === ==== Argentina and Uruguay ==== The Evangelical Church of the River Plate, which includes Lutherans and Waldensians, and the United Lutheran Church have supported civil unions and same-sex marriages. ==== Evangelical Church of the Lutheran Confession in Brazil ==== In 2011, the church released a pastoral letter accepting the Supreme Court's decision to allow same-sex marriage in Brazil, and supported the families of same-sex couples. == Denominations against homosexual activity == === In North America === At least five denominations view \"homosexual behavior\" to be sinful and believe that it is contrary to Scripture: * The Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod,For an example of a classic Missourian doctrinal text mentioning homosexuality, see \"The Law condemns every one who carnally knows himself, or a brute, or another person of the same sex, or a person of the other sex with whom he is not or, because of a prohibited degree of consanguinity or affinity, or because of an existing marriage of either party with a third person, cannot be joined in lawful wedlock, or who, without a sufficient cause, refuses to live with or to love and honor his lawful spouse, or who annuls a valid betrothal, or who, by any manner of lewdness or indecency in deed word, or desire, defiles his body or soul.\" * The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod,WELS Statement on homosexuality http://www.wels.net/what-we-believe/questions-answers/social- issues *The Association of Free Lutheran Congregations * The Evangelical Lutheran SynodPress Release: ELS Disagrees with ELCA on Homosexuality * The North American Lutheran Church * Lutheran Congregations in Mission for Christ * Church of the Lutheran Brethren of AmericaCLBA Statement on Sexuality http://www.clba.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Statement_on_Sexuality.pdf * Church of the Lutheran Confession === In Europe === * The Silesian Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession condemns homosexual behavior as sin.Stanovisko Slezsk\u00e9 c\u00edrkve evangelick\u00e9 a.v. k lidem s homosexu\u00e1ln\u00ed orientac\u00ed (2003); Stanovisko Slezsk\u00e9 c\u00edrkve evangelick\u00e9 a.v. k ot\u00e1zce homosexuality (2006) * The Evangelical Lutheran Free Church (Germany) views homosexuality as hurting the natural order.http://elfk.de.dd21408.kasserver.com/html/main/2013/01/unsere-stellung- zum-thema-homosexualitat/ * The Independent Evangelical-Lutheran Church, Germany. * The Evangelical Lutheran Church of England (ELCE). * The Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church. * The Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Poland. * The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia. === In South America === * Argentinian Evangelical Lutheran Church. http://www.iela.org.ar * Confessional Lutheran Church of Chile. http://www.soyluterano.cl ==See also== *Homosexuality and Christianity *2009 ELCA Churchwide Assembly ==References== Category:Lutheran theology ",
