    "text": "Vanadium(II) iodide is the inorganic compound with the formula VI2. It is a black micaceous solid. It adopts the cadmium iodide structure, featuring octahedral V(II) centers. The hexahydrate is also known. It forms purple crystals. ==Preparation== The original synthesis of VI2 involved reaction of the elements. Solvated vanadium(II) iodides can be prepared by reduction of vanadium(III) chlorides with trimethylsilyl iodide. It reacts with anhydrous ammonia to give the hexaammine complex. ==References== Category:Vanadium compounds Category:Iodides Category:Metal halides ",
