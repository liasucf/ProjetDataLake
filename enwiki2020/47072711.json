    "text": "The David W. Campbell House is a historic house on Main Street in Cherryfield, Maine. Built in 1828 as a Federal-style structure, it was altered in the mid-19th century to include a significant number of Italianate features. Built by a member of the locally prominent Campbell family, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990 for its architectural significance, and is a contributing member of the 1990 Cherryfield Historic District. ==Description and history== The Campbell House is set on the east side of Main Street, just south of the public library. The main block is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof that has a center gable at the front, twin end chimneys, and a square cupola. A long series of ells lengthen the house to the rear (east). Most of the house is finished in wood clapboards; the front is finished in flushboard. The entrance is centered on the western facade, sheltered by a hip-roof porch with turned posts and a spindled frieze. The front and side gables are fully pedimented, with round-arch windows within the field. A porch on the south side features Italianate brackets and chambered posts. The interior retains a significant amount of Federal period woodwork, but the dining room was clearly updated in the mid-19th century. The main block was built in 1828 by David W. Campbell, a descendant of General Alexander Campbell, a prominent local citizen during the American Revolutionary War. The ells and much of the Italianate styling were added in the mid-19th century, and the front porch, whose styling is more Queen Anne, was probably added in the late 19th century. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Maine ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Federal architecture in Maine Category:Italianate architecture in Maine Category:Houses completed in 1828 Category:Houses in Washington County, Maine Category:Cherryfield, Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Washington County, Maine Category:Historic district contributing properties in Maine ",
