It is native to eastern Asia, where it is found in China, Japan, Korea, and eastern Russia.Euphorbia sieboldiana Flora of China Its natural habitat is in grassy areas and forest margins. It is a common species in Japan. It is an rhizomatous perennial growing to 70 cm tall. It produces small flowers in compact pseudoumbels. These lack petal-like appendages. This species can be readily identified by the horn-like projections on the glands of the involucre. Blooming time is in spring and early summer. ==Toxicity and Medicinal Uses== The plant is used medicinally in China, where it has the common name Langdu (\u72fc\u6bd2\u82b1) lit. \"wolf poison\" (\u72fc lang \"wolf\" + \u6bd2 d\u00fa \"poison\" + \u82b1 hu\u0101 \"flower\"). It shares this vernacular name with two other medicinal plants: Euphorbia fischeriana and the unrelated Stellera chamaejasme (family Thymelaceae) - which nonetheless has similar qualities, medicinal properties and uses, these being pungency, toxicity, cathartic, anthelmintic and expectorant activity, and topical use to treat ulcers and skin diseases.
