    "text": "The Seppelt Mackinnon Stakes, registered as the LKS Mackinnon Stakes, is a Victoria Racing Club Group 1 Thoroughbred horse race run under Weight for Age conditions over a distance of 2000 metres at Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne, Australia on the last day of the Melbourne Cup Carnival, the Saturday after the Melbourne Cup. Total prize money is A$2,000,000 and $2,500 trophy. == History == The original race was named after a former chairman of the Victoria Racing Club, Lauchlan Kenneth Scobie (\"L.K.S.\") MacKinnon (1861-1935). It was originally held on the first day of the Melbourne Cup Carnival, VRC Victoria Derby Day. In 2016, the VRC moved the race to the last day of the carnival and renamed the race that was formally called the Emirates Stakes. Prior to 2016, many horses with a ranking high enough to avoid the ballot for the Melbourne Cup used the race as a lead-in to the 3,200 metre Cup, run on the first Tuesday in November (otherwise they race in the longer Lexus Stakes). The VRC believed that placing the race on the last day of the Melbourne Cup Carnival would attract quality horses, that raced in the W.S. Cox Plate, to run at the distance, rather than using the race to prepare for the Melbourne Cup. == Name == *1869-1936 - Melbourne Stakes In 1937 the VRC moved the Melbourne Stakes to earlier in the spring, running it in September, over a shorter distance of . The race was the predecessor to the Turnbull Stakes. *1937-2015 - LKS Mackinnon Stakes *2016-2017 - Emirates Stakes *2018 - Seppelt Mackinnon Stakes == Distance == *1869-1971 - 1 miles (~2000 metres) *1972 onwards - 2000 metres == Grade == *1869-1978 - Principal Race *1979 onwards - Group 1 == Doubles wins == The following thoroughbreds have won the LKS MacKinnon Stakes - Melbourne Cup in the same year. * Malua (1884), Carbine (1890), Phar Lap (1930), Peter Pan (1932, 1934), The Trump (1937), Comic Court (1950), Delta (1951), Dalray (1952), Rising Fast (1954), Rain Lover (1968), At Talaq (1986), Empire Rose (1988), Let's Elope (1991), Rogan Josh (1999) == Winners since 2000== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- ! width=\"36px\" | Year ! width=\"120px\" | Winner !
