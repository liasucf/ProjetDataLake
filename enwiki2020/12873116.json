It is threatened by habitat loss.Oleas, N. & Pitman, N. 2003. Eucrosia dodsonii. 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Downloaded on 21 August 2007. It grows from bulbs 2.5\u20135 cm in diameter. The stalked (petiolate) leaves have blades (laminae) 20 cm long by 12 cm wide. The zygomorphic flowers are yellow, produced in an umbel on a 60 cm tall stem (scape); the stamens have prominent long filaments. Unlike most species in the genus, E. dodsonii does not have nectaries. In cultivation, plants should be kept warm and dry when the leaves wither, and watered only when the flowers or leaves begin to grow again, when a sunny position is required for about half the day. ==References== ==External links== * Image of E. dodsonii at ARKive dodsonii Category:Endemic flora of Ecuador Category:Vulnerable plants Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
