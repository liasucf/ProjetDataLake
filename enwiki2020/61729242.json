Juan Gerson (active c. 1562) was a high status indigenous Nahua painter, named after the French theologian Jean Gerson, working in Tecamechalco, Puebla. Not until 1962 when a group of Mexican scholars found documentation to his high status indigenous heritage was Gerson identity revealed. It was previously thought he was Flemish, trained in Italy,Toussaint, Manuel. Colonial Art in Mexico. Translated by Elizabeth Wilder Weisman. Austin: University of Texas Press 1967, p. 92.

Art historians Carolyn Dean and Dana Leibsohn consider Gerson's case of misrecognition as \"reveal[ing] once again our refusal to recognize the indigene unless his or her work is visibly pre- Hispanic. Further, the revisions of scholarship that follow the discovery of these artists' genetic make-up involve a literal re-seeing of their work.\"Dean and Leibsohn, \"Hybidity and its Discontents\", pp. 22-23. Mexican art historian Francisco P\u00e9rez Salazar considers his work \"mediocre and defective.\"P\u00e9rez Salazar, Francisco. Historia de la Pintura en Puebla. Mexico City: Imprenta Universitaria 1963, p. 50. His paintings decorated chapels in sixteenth- century central Mexico. He is known to have painted the church of St Francisco de Tecamechalco. Manuel Toussaint attributes murals to him in Epazoyucan, based on style.Toussaint, Colonial Art in Mexico, p. 129. He painted scenes of the Old Testament and the Apocalypse in bright colors on amate paper, then applied to the walls, rather than painted on them directly. Likely he used European printed woodcuts available in New Spain by this time as models.Donahue-Wallace, Kelly. Art and Architecture of Viceregal Latin America, 1521-1821. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico Press 2008, p. 40. The 28 scenes in Tecamechaldo start with Cain and Abel, the Flood, the Tower of Babel, Abraham's sacrifice of his son Isaac, the Dream of Jacob, and Ezekiel's \u201cvisions of the Heavenly Jerusalem and the Altar of the Holocaust.\u201dDonahue-Wallace, Art and Architecture of Viceregal Latin America, p. 40. \"Some scholars believe that he chose the Apocalypse as a subject because it resonated with pre-Hispanic traditions.\"Bailey, Gauvin Alexander.
