Pre-contest, \"Terminal 3\" had been rated as one of the front runners in a field with no obvious stand-out song, and Martin gave a vocally strong and visually striking performance. The early voting was very close, with the lead changing hands regularly between Ireland, Denmark and Spain. However from the half-way point, to the surprise of most observers, the unrated song from Sweden pulled away from the rest to claim victory with 145 points, with Ireland eventually finishing in second place with 137 points. \"Terminal 3\" received four maximum 12s - from Belgium, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland - with only Yugoslavia failing to award it any points at all. The Irish jury awarded its 12 points to Sweden.ESC History - Ireland 1984 ===Points awarded to Ireland=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=5|Points awarded to Ireland |- !width=20%|12 points !width=20%|10 points !width=20%|8 points !width=20%|7 points !width=20%|6 points |- | valign=\"top\" | * * * * | valign=\"top\" | * * * * * | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | |- !width=20%|5 points !width=20%|4 points !width=20%|3 points !width=20%|2 points !width=20%|1 point |- | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * * | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | |- |} ===Points awarded by Ireland=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"gold\"|'|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"silver\"|10 points|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"#CC9966\"|8 points|| |- |width=20%|7 points|| |- |width=20%|6 points|| |- |width=20%|5 points|| |- |width=20%|4 points|| |- |width=20%|3 points|| |- |width=20%|2 points|| |- |width=20%|1 point|| |- |} ==See also== *Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1984 == References == Category:1984 in Irish music Category:1984 in Irish television Category:1984 in Ireland Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1984 Category:Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest ",
