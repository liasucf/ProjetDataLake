    "text": "David Spencer Gossett (born April 28, 1979) is an American professional golfer who played on the PGA Tour and the Web.com Tour (formerly the Nationwide Tour). Gossett was born in Phoenix, Arizona. His father introduced him to the game of golf and he competed in his first tournament at age 10. He went to Germantown High School in Germantown, Tennessee. Gossett attended the University of Texas, and was a two-time first-team All-American member of the golf team. He won the U.S. Amateur, the Big 12 Championship, and was the Big 12 Student-Athlete of the Year in 1999. He was also a member of the Walker Cup team in 1999. He turned pro in 2000. As winner of the U.S. Amateur, Gossett was supposed to play in the U.S. Open in the same group as defending champion Payne Stewart, but Stewart perished in a plane crash in October 1999. Gossett won his first official PGA Tour event in 2001 at the John Deere Classic. He lost his fully exempt status in 2004, and has had to split his playing time between the PGA Tour and the Nationwide Tour in recent years. He spent the early part of the decade trying to get back on the PGA Tour through the Web.com Tour and the Adams Pro Tour. Gossett qualified for the 2014 U.S Open, his first since 2000. Gossett also played in the John Deere Classic and the Barracuda Championship, but missed the cut in both. Once considered a golf prodigy with comparisons to Tiger Woods, Gossett's PGA Tour status is extremely limited due to lack of play and results. He is currently a commercial real estate agent in Nashville, Tennessee.http://www.cbre.us/people-and-offices/david-gossett ==Amateur wins== *1998 Red River Classic, Tucker Invitational, Golf Digest Collegiate Invitational *1999 U.S. Amateur, Big 12 Championship ==Professional wins (1)== ===PGA Tour wins (1)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !Margin of victory !Runner-up |- |align=center|1 |Jul 29, 2001 |John Deere Classic |\u221219 (68-64-68-65=265) |1 stroke | Briny Baird |} ==Results in major championships== {| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font- size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text- align:center;\" |- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\" !align=\"left\"|Tournament !2000!!2001!!2002!!2003!!2004!!2005!!2006!!2007!!2008!!2009!!2010!!2011!!2012!!2013!!2014 |- |align=left|Masters Tournament |T54 |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=left|U.S. Open |CUT |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |CUT |- |align=left|The Open Championship |CUT |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |- |align=left|PGA Championship |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |CUT |CUT |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"| |} CUT = missed the half-way cut \"T\" indicates a tie for a place ==U.S. national team appearances== Amateur *Junior Ryder Cup: 1997 *Walker Cup: 1999 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:American male golfers Category:Texas Longhorns men's golfers Category:PGA Tour golfers Category:Golfers from Arizona Category:Golfers from Texas Category:Sportspeople from Phoenix, Arizona Category:People from Germantown, Tennessee Category:People from Travis County, Texas Category:1979 births Category:Living people ",
