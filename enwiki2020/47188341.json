After the conquest the area became part of the encomienda system. What is now Cuncunul was a part of three different encomiendas. The first one, which covered 1/3 of the current municipality was established as an encomienda in 1549 for Francisco Manrique, Juan de Triana, and Juan de C\u00e1rdenas. In 1607 it passed to Francisco Mall\u00e9n and Francisco Mall\u00e9n de Rueda and in 1645 passed to Gaspar de Ayala Pacheco and Francisca Dorantes y Sol\u00eds. In 1686 Pedro Pardo de Lagos was the encomendero. The second part, which also covered 1/3 of the territory which is now Cuncunul was encompassed in an encomienda established in 1549 for Juan de Triana and Juan de C\u00e1rdenas. In 1579 Juan de C\u00e1rdenas II came into possession, and in 1607 the encomenderos were Fernando Parias Zapata and Francisco Zapata de Ayala. In 1648 Antonio Osorio Maldonado assumed the trust and was followed in 1668 by Diego de Sol\u00eds Osorio and in 1688 by Francisco de Sol\u00eds.\"Garc\u00eda Bernal (1978)\", p 523 The final 1/3 followed the succession of Chichen-Itza.\"Garc\u00eda Bernal (1978)\", p 511 In the eighteenth century, the encomenderos were: Fernando Maldonado, Francisco V\u00e1zquez Carrasco and Andr\u00e9s de Vales in 1700; Javier del Valle, Juan de Vergara and Bernardo Marcos Bermejo in 1722; and Juan Calder\u00f3n and Beatriz Montiel y Cosgaya in 1785.
