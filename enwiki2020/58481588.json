    "text": "Rashid Sarwar (born 3 March 1965) is a Scottish former footballer who played for Kilmarnock. Although his career at senior level was short and unremarkable, he is notable as one of very few Asian-Scots to have been involved in professional football even to that extent. ==Career== Born in Paisley, Sarwar was signed for Kilmarnock by manager Eddie Morrison, who is said to have struggled with the spelling of his new recruit's personal details on the contract \u2013 including the local birthplace. He made his competitive debut in May 1985 in a 4\u20131 defeat to Airdrieonians at Rugby Park, his only appearance that season. In the next campaign, 1985\u201386, he made 19 league starts plus one in the Scottish Cup, also scoring what proved to be his only goal in a 4\u20132 win over Brechin City. His final game was in August 1986 in a 3\u20131 loss to Forfar Athletic. Having failed to keep his place in the Kilmarnock squad, Sarwar moved on to the Junior grade with Maryhill. He later played for Ayrshire teams Glenafton Athletic and Largs Thistle (where he also served as a coach, and encountered racist abuse from supporters of his own team in 2001). ==See also== * British Asians in association football ==References== ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:1965 births Category:Footballers from Paisley, Renfrewshire Category:Scottish footballers Category:Scottish people of Pakistani descent Category:Association football wingers Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Scottish Junior Football Association players Category:Kilmarnock F.C. players Category:Maryhill F.C. players Category:Glenafton Athletic F.C. players Category:Largs Thistle F.C. players Category:British sportspeople of Pakistani descent ",
