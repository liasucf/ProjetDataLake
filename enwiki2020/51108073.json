    "text": "The County of Robe is one of the 49 cadastral counties of South Australia. It was proclaimed by and named for Governor Frederick Robe in 1846. It covers a portion of the state's south-east from the west coast at Robe all the way across to the border with Victoria on the east. This includes the following contemporary local government areas of the state: * District Council of Robe * Naracoorte Lucindale Council (excluding north third) * Kingston District Council (small south portion) * Wattle Range Council (small north portion) The French explorer Nicholas Baudin first viewed the bay in 1802 on which Robe was later settled in 1802, and he named it Guichen Bay in honour of Admiral de Guichen. The Boandik aboriginal tribe lived relatively undisturbed around the Robe region, with \u201cBlack Maggie\u201d being the first to meet white men in Guichen Bay in the 1830s, who were probably whalers, seal- ers or sailors visiting the area long before South Aus- tralian settlement. == Hundreds == The County of Robe is divided into the following 18 hundreds: * Hundred of Mount Benson (Wangolina) * Hundred of Bowaka (Reedy Creek) * Hundred of Townsend (Avenue Range) * Hundred of Joyce (Lucindale) * Hundred of Spence (Spence) * Hundred of Naracoorte (Naracoorte) * Hundred of Jessie (Hynam) * Hundred of Waterhouse (Robe) * Hundred of Ross (Mount Benson) * Hundred of Conmurra (Conmurra) * Hundred of Robertson (Bool Lagoon) * Hundred of Joanna (Joanna) * Hundred of Bray (Bray) * Hundred of Smith (Greenways) * Hundred of Fox (Fox) * Hundred of Coles (Coles) * Hundred of Killanoola (Maaoupe) * Hundred of Comaum (Coonawarra, Comaum) ==References== Robe ",
