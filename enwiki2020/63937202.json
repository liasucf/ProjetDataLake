    "text": "Peru Secure Homeland () is a Right-wing Peruvian political party founded on September 26, 2013 by former members of the defunct Cambio 90, founded by Alberto Fujimori and Renzo Reggiardo in 1990. Debuting in national politics in 2014, Peruvians for Change leader Salvador Heresi was invited to be the party's nominee for Mayor of Lima, finishing in fourth place with 5.9% of the popular vote. In 2018, leader Renzo Reggiardo ran for Mayor of Lima. Leading most of the polls throughout the entire campaign, Reggiardo's absence in the mayoral debate proved decisive in the rise of candidates Jorge Mu\u00f1oz and Daniel Urresti, finishing third in the election with 8.9% of the popular vote. == Origin == With the name change of the party, in addition to seeking to distance itself from Alberto Fujimori, it seeks to highlight the meaning of the word security, for aspects such as economic, legal, citizen and investment. ==References== Category:Political parties in Peru Category:2013 establishments in Peru Category:Political parties established in 2013 ",
