She said in Paper: \"Growing up, I would see Brandy on Moesha and see her keeping in her cornrows and her braids, but still flourish in her art and music, looking fly. I loved Moesha as a child, but now I take away something more special from it. Just because you're a black girl, it doesn't mean you need to only care about hair and makeup. Brandy cared about books, culture and where she was going \u2014 you can do both.\" ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * Pregnant with Success (2015) * JP3 (2018) *JP4 (2020) ===Mixtapes=== * Satisfaction Guaranteed (2014) ===Singles=== * \"You Don't Know\" (2015) * \"Now or Later\" (2015) * \"State of the Union\" (2018) * \"Showers\" (2018) * \"Trader Joe\" (2018) * \"They Know\" (2018) * \"Spiders\" (2019) ===Guest appearances=== * Dai Burger \u2013 \"Titty Attack\" from Raw Burger (2011) * Le1f \u2013 \"Oils\" from Tree House (2013) * Rome Fortune \u2013 \"Payin' for It\" from Drive, Thighs & Lies (2014) * Scooter Island \u2013 \"#NOTYOURS\" from Broad City (Original Series Soundtrack) (2015) * Shy Girls \u2013 \"Always the Same\" from 4WZ (2015) * Le1f \u2013 \"Swirl\" from Riot Boi (2015) * Lion Babe \u2013 \"Still in Love\" from Sun Joint (2016) * Brenmar \u2013 \"Like a Hoe\" from High End Times (2016) * Nick Hook \u2013 \"Dive for You\" from Relationships (2016) * Nadia Rose \u2013 \"Breathe Slow\" (2017) * Gabriel Garz\u00f3n- Montano \u2013 \"The Game Remix\" (2018) * TXS \u2013 \"Don't Tempt Me\" from Everything Is Bigger (2018) * Pussy Riot - \u201cHangers\u201d (2019) ==Filmography== ===Film=== * Support the Girls (2018), Danyelle ===Television=== * Random Acts of Flyness (2018) ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== * * Category:1991 births Category:Actresses from New York City Category:American female rappers Category:American people of Jamaican descent Category:American people of Trinidad and Tobago descent Category:African-American female rappers Category:Living people Category:Rappers from Brooklyn Category:Underground rappers Category:21st-century American rappers Category:21st-century American women musicians ",
