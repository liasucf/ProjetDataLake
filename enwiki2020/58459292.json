Her thesis was The code of beneficence in the works of Jean- Jacques Rousseau : a study of the precariousness of justice in relations between non-equals : with special reference to pudicity. Her research focuses on the 18th and 20th centuries, and \"is informed by feminist and poststructuralist theory (in particular the work of Jacques Derrida, Helene Cixous and Luce Irigaray)\". In 2018 she was elected a Fellow of the British Academy. Commenting on this she said that she hoped to add to the Academy's diversity, as a woman and a critical theorist but also \"in that I was first in my family to go to University, supported by a loving single mother and a State that gave me a full and unconditional grant throughout my studies\". she is President of the Society for French Studies. ==Selected publications== *Derrida and hospitality: theory and practice (2013, Edinburgh UP: ) *Derrida and other animals: the boundaries of the human (2015, Edinburgh UP: ) *Enlightenment hospitality: cannibals, harems and adoption (2011, Voltaire Foundation: ) *Feminine economies: thinking against the market in the enlightenment and the late twentieth century (1997, Manchester UP: ) *Justice and difference in the works of Rousseau: bienfaisance and pudeur (1993, Cambridge UP: ) ==References== Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:British women academics Category:Alumni of University College London Category:Academics of the University of Nottingham Category:Critical theorists Category:Literary critics of French Category:Fellows of the British Academy ",
