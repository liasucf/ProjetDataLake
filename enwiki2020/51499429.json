There is one effigy mound in the shape of a panther that is long and wide. There are also compound mounds in the preserve. The mounds were constructed during the Woodland period (500 BCE and 900 CE). They were used for burials and ceremonial places, and are now protected by law. The preserve is also home to a variety of trees, prairie grasses and flowers. The mounds were first surveyed in 1885, and Ellison Orr studied them in the 1930s. People from Dubuque, Iowa bought the property in 1934 and gave it to the Iowa Conservation Commission in 1940. Other archaeological surveys were undertaken in 1964 and 1973. It was dedicated as a state preserve in 1968 for its archaeological, geological, and biological qualities. The preserve was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district in 1990. ==References== Category:Protected areas established in 1968 Category:Mounds in Iowa Category:Iowa state preserves Category:Native American history of Iowa Category:Protected areas of Clayton County, Iowa Category:National Register of Historic Places in Clayton County, Iowa Category:Historic districts in Clayton County, Iowa Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa Category:Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa Category:Protected areas on the Mississippi River Category:Woodland period Category:Driftless Area Category:Geoglyphs ",
