Roughly 20 chapters developed, including at Lafayette College, Washington & Jefferson College, Columbia College and Norwich University. Membership was not restricted to college students. In 1874, the fraternity was dissolved at a convention held in Easton, Pennsylvania. Following dissolution, the Washington & Jefferson College chapter founded the Phi Delta Kappa fraternity and became its first chapter. Following the collapse of Phi Delta Kappa, that chapter joined Phi Gamma Delta as the Alpha chapter. ==References== Category:Student organizations established in 1858 Category:1874 disestablishments Category:Student societies in the United States Category:Defunct fraternities and sororities Category:1858 establishments in New York (state) ",
