It should not be confused with the geographic southern region of the modern borough of Brooklyn, which includes the neighborhoods of Gravesend, Seagate, Coney Island, Brighton Beach, Manhattan Beach, Sheepshead Bay, Gerritsen Beach, Marine Park, Mill Basin, and Bergen Beach. \"South or Southern Brooklyn\" is also in use in the modern borough of Brooklyn, but without total consistency as to what it refers to. It has been used about neighborhoods as various and physically separated as Mill Basin, Bensonhurst,Goldensohn, Rosa. \"Police Identify Man Sought for Raping his Girlfriend in South Brooklyn\" DNAinfo (August 25, 2014) Carroll Gardens,\"Dining Briefs: South Brooklyn Pizza and Artisanal\" The New York Times (June i8, 2008) Gowanus,Blau, Eleanor. \"Neighborhood Report: South Brooklyn;The Mr. Fix-It of the Pipe Organ The New York Times (December 24, 1995) Red Hook,Venugopal, Nikhita. \"Red Hook Transfer School's Cheerleading Team Is Only for the 'Tough'\" DNAinfo (January 27, 2014) Smith Street,\"Smith Street - Shops, Restaurants, Bars Singles, Couples and Family Living\" South Brooklyn Local Development Corporation website Sunset Park,South Brooklyn Marine Terminal website Windsor Terrace,Albrecht, Leslie. \"South Brooklyn Rezoning Will Save P.S. 154 Science Lab, Principal Says\" DNAinfo (November 11, 2014) as well as Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights, and Park Slope.Wisloski, Jess. \"Power Outage Affecting 7,500 in South Brooklyn is Over, Con Ed Says\" DNAinfo (February 15, 2014) ==Transportation== The New York City Subway's IND Culver Line () serves the area at the Carroll Street and Smith\u2013Ninth Streets stations.
