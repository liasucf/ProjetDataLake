During the fight with the Nazis in Eastern Bosnia, he was killed. He was awarded the \"Order of the People's Hero\" in 1952. ==Early life== Slobodan Baji\u0107 Paja was born in village Banovci in Croatia where he lived until his sixth year. He was son of a local Orthodox priest in St. Petka's Church. From 1922, he lived in Pe\u0107inci in Serbia, where his father was transferred. He graduated from high school in Sremski Karlovci. Slobodan started participating in the work of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia while still in high school but he formally joined the party during his studies at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy in 1938. ==Legacy== Elementary Schools in Indija, Pe\u0107inci, Novi Karlovci, Bresta\u010d, Donji Tovarnik, and Sremska Mitrovica bear his name. His name also has a city library in Ruma. Before the Croatian War of Independence, School in \u0160idski Banovci also bears his name but the Croatian government decided to rename the school in Elementary School Ila\u010da-Banovci by the villages where the school is located. However, the bust of Slobodan Bajic Paja in front of the school in \u0160idski Banovci has not been removed, and one of the streets in the village still bears his name. Unfortunately, at the same time a monument to Slobodan Bajic Paji together with mausoleum of 33 anti-fascist partisans in Kalesija was destroyed and the bones were then confiscated and lost by local Bosniaks authorities four months after the end of the war in that country. Although the Public Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina subsequently attempted to investigate the matter, competent investigative institutions in Tuzla refused to open a formal investigation. ==Honorific eponyms== * : Slobodan Baji\u0107 Paja Street, Banovci * : Slobodan Baji\u0107 Paja Street, Pe\u0107inci * : Elementary School Slobodan Baji\u0107 Paja in Novi Karlovci * : Elementary School Slobodan Baji\u0107 Paja in Pe\u0107inci * : Elementary School Slobodan Baji\u0107 Paja in Man\u0111elos * : Elementary School Slobodan Baji\u0107 Paja in Sremska Mitrovica * : Public Library Slobodan Baji\u0107 Paja in Ruma ==See also== *Serbs of Croatia *Banovci *Pe\u0107inci ==References== ===Bibliography=== *Narodni heroji Jugoslavije(eng-People's Hero of Yugoslavia), \"Mladost\", Beograd 1975. godina Category:1916 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Yugoslav Partisans members Category:Serbs of Croatia Category:University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy alumni ",
