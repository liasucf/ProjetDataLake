S\u00e9verine won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1971 for Monaco, performing \"Un banc, un arbre, une rue\" (A bench, a tree, a street), with music by Jean- Pierre Bourtayre and words by Yves Dessca. It was recorded in English as \"Chance In Time\", in German as \"Mach die Augen zu (und w\u00fcnsch dir einen Traum)\" and Italian as \"Il posto\". The original French version made #9 in the UK Singles Chart in May 1971, whereas the English version, released on CBS rather than Philips, did not chart. The song charted highly in most other European markets. S\u00e9verine had further success in France and Germany, but never again on an international scale. S\u00e9verine made two further attempts at winning the Eurovision Song Contest, participating in the German national finals of 1975 and 1982. Neither song won. She accompanied Monaco's delegation to the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 in Athens, Greece. ==Discography and chart success== *\"Un banc, un arbre, une rue\" (#1 Sweden, #1 Canada, #2 Benelux, #3 France, #3 Ireland, #9 UK, #23 Germany) *\"Chance in Time\" *\"Mach die Augen zu (und w\u00fcnsch dir einen Traum)\" (#23 Germany) *\"Il posto\" (#53 Italy) *\"Vivre pour moi\" (#32 France) *\"Ja der Eiffelturm\" (#27 Germany) *\"Comme un appel\" (#24 France) *\"J'ai besoin de soleil\" (#29 France) *\"Olala L'Amour\" (#19 Germany) *\"L\u00e0 ou tu n'es pas\" (#44 France) *\"Mon tendre amour\" (#47 France) *\"Der Duft von Paris\" (#40 Germany) *\"Il faut chanter la vie\" (a cover version of Cliff Richard's 1973 Eurovision entry \"Power to All Our Friends\") (#46 France) *\"Vergessen hei\u00dft verloren sein\" (#47 Germany) *\"Du bist f\u00fcr mich der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Schatz\" (#49 Germany) *\"Sieben Tr\u00e4nen\" (a cover version of Goombay Dance Band's 1981 hit \"Seven Tears\")(#49 Germany) ==References== ==External links== *Official website * Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Singers from Paris Category:French female singers Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants for Monaco Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 1971 Category:Eurovision Song Contest winners Category:Philips Records artists ",
