It is located between Wilders Plads to the south and Gr\u00f8nlandske Handels Plads to the north. The current buildings were completed in 2016 and are inspired by the historic warehouses that dominate the waterfront. ==History== Kr\u00f8yers Plads is part of an area that was reclaimed by Andreas Bj\u00f8rn for use as a shipyard in the 1750s. The northern part of the area was acquired by the Royal Greenland Trade Department in the 1790s and became known as Gr\u00f8nlandske Handels Plads. The southern part of the area was purchased by the captain and merchant Hans Kr\u00f8yer in 18+2. The site was reacquired by the Royal Greenland Trade Department in 1938. The ships were moved to Aalborg in the 1970s. The deserted area was in 1998 ceded to the new state-owned property company Freja Ejendomme. In July 2001, it was converted into am urban beach setting under the name Lufthastellet with the use of 17 t of sand from R\u00e5bjerg Mile. In February 2003, an invited architectural competition was launched for the area. It was won by Erick van Egeraat. In April 2004, NCC acquired Kr\u00f8yers Plads with the intention of realizing Egeraat's winning proposal. The plans resulted in comprehensive complains from neighbours and interest organisations. In March 2005, the district plan proposal was rejected by the City Council. A new masterplan for the area was subsequently commissioned from a team consisting of Bjarke Ingels Group, Henning Larsen Architects and Kim Utzon Architects. In August 2005, NCC sold the project to Carlyle Group. The new plan for the area was presented in May 2006 but it is once again rejected by City Hall and the project is put on hold as a result of the Financial Crisis. In 2010, NXX reacquired the site. A new plan for the area was subsequently created by Vilhelm Lauritzen Arkitekter, Cobe and GHB Landskabsarkitekter. It was approved in 2011 and construction finally began in autumn 2012. The last phase of the project was completed in 2016. ==Notable residents== Present and former owners of apartments include: *Peter Asschenfeldt, businessman * Michael Laudrup, footballer ==References== ==External links== * Source in English Category:Christianshavn Category:Apartment buildings in Copenhagen Category:Residential buildings completed in 2016 ",
