In 1784 Baade became a vicar at Borgund Church, and a few years later he became dean of Sunnm\u00f8re. He retired in 1816 due to debility of old age.Lampe, Johan Fredrik. 1895.Bergens Stifts Biskoper og Pr\u00e6ster efter Reformationen: Biografiske Efterretninger. Kristiania: Cammermeyers Boghandel. He was a member of the election board for the district of Romsdal in the selection of delegates to the Norwegian Constituent Assembly in 1814. Baade himself was chosen as a representative for Eidsvoll, but he declined the position due to his advanced age and the election board had to find another.Lindst\u00f8l, Tallak. 1914.

Baade was a skilled and highly regarded cleric of the Enlightenment, with a mildly Orthodox orientation and an enthusiasm for culture. He maintained the school in good condition. Baade owned land in the district, had a knowledge of botany and was a pioneer in farming and gardening. For many years he was the chairman of Sunnm\u00f8re Practical Agricultural Society (Syndm\u00f8re practiske Landhuusholdningsselskab). Bishop Johan Nordahl Brun considered him the ablest provost in the diocese, and he was nominated by Brun for the Order of the Dannebrog (awarded in 1811). In 1819 he became a member of the Order of the Polar Star. During a visitation, Brun noted that Baade, a friend of his since youth, was probably drunk, writing that Baade \"did not speak very sensibly\u2014I do not know if it was due to the impending dog day heat or the gifts of Bacchus.\" A few days later, Brun described Baade's sermon: \"Baade expounded on 2 Corinthians 5:15 with exceptional depth and dogmatism. Today I have certainly heard the best speech since leaving Bergen, very brief but powerful.\"Brun, Johan Nordahl: Visitasprotokoll 1794\u20131812. online publication ==References== Category:1737 births Category:1823 deaths Category:People from Trondheim Category:People educated at the Trondheim Cathedral School Category:Norwegian expatriates in Denmark Category:Norwegian Lutheran priests Category:Norwegian jurists Category:Norwegian librarians Category:Order of the Dannebrog Category:Order of the Polar Star ",
