She won her first major trophy on 24 February 2008 when Grindav\u00edk defeated Haukar, 77-67, in the Icelandic Cup finals. On 25 November 2009, she tore her anterior cruciate ligament in a game against Haukar in the \u00darvalsdeild and missed the rest of the season. After recovering, she joined Keflav\u00edk prior to the 2010-2011 season and helped the club win both the national championship and the Icelandic Cup, where she was a key player down the stretch in Keflav\u00edk's 62-72 victory. On 21 September 2011, she again tore her anterior cruciate ligament, this time four minutes into Keflav\u00edk's first game of the Company Cup, and missed the rest of the season.

During the 2016-2017 season, she again had problems with injury, missing several games because of broken ribs.
