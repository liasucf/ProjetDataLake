Monroe to ensure his own preservation, and to further set G-low up. Slice has Detective Jones mark two kilos in evidence, when there were really three in their possession. Feeling the pressure of being incarcerated and interrogated, G-low allows himself to be blackmailed by Det. Jones and agrees to pay him $5,000, and then plans to run. Slice figures that G-low will run, leave Sharon behind, and then he can blame G-low for the missing drugs when it comes time to answer to their supplier's inevitable inquiries about his missing drugs and money. And, of course- Slice figures he could win back Sharon, even though he has a very jealous live-in girlfriend, Lisa. G-low unknowingly throws a wrench in Slice's plan and pays their supplier, Rico, a visit to update him and smooth things over. This is when G-low learns that there were three kilos in the car- not two like he originally thought. It dawns on G-low that Slice has set him up. As he's coming out of Rico's apartment, he runs into Slice who realizes the cat is out of the bag. Up until now, neither detective was aware that his partner has a non-kosher relationship with their respective detainees, which feeds into the distrust between Slice and G-low. Slice figures out that there's something fishy and pays Detective Monroe a visit to get the rest of the drugs Monroe was holding, and to kill him. His next target is G-low. G-low now has more problems than he ever expected. Sharon leaves him in the midst of the chaos and he is still left to deal with a crooked cop, who upped the ante on him, and a former business partner with a major personal vendetta against him. Detective Jones drags G-low to Slice's apartment to get in on the deal with the extra kilo that Slice took from Detective Monroe. In the meantime, a young kid who is trying to make a name for himself in the streets learned that Slice killed his homey.
