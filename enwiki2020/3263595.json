The term may have its origins in Roman Catholic Church usage, similar to the British term parish. The concept forms a very settled part of the popular consciousness, but it has never become an official political division. In Galicia there are 3781 parroquias, each comprising between three and fifteen or more villages. They developed over time as de facto entities, although the Galician Statute of Autonomy of 1981 recognises them as territorial entities below the concello (municipality) and above villages. In Asturias there are 857 parishes (parroquias) integrating the 78 concejos or conceyos (municipalities) in the region, and they usually coincide with the ecclesiastic divisions. ==See also== * Parroquia ==References== Category:Subdivisions of Spain Category:Politics of Asturias Category:Politics of Galicia (Spain) Category:Fifth-level administrative country subdivisions ",
