    "text": "Nick Seeler (born June 3, 1993) is an American professional ice hockey defenseman who currently plays for the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted by the Minnesota Wild in the fifth round, 131st overall, in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft. Prior to turning professional, Seeler played for the University of Nebraska Omaha and University of Minnesota. ==Playing career== As a student at Eden Prairie High School for four years, Seeler played on both the junior varsity hockey team and school golf team. However, he saw limited playing time due to his short stature until after a growth spurt in his junior year where he began to develop more as a player. Before graduating, Seeler had been honored as a First-Team All-State selection, an All-Metro First Team choice, All-Lake Conference and a member of the All-Tournament Team in the State Tournament. While in his senior year at Eden Prairie High School, Seeler committed to play NCAA Division 1 hockey for the University of Nebraska Omaha. He was later drafted 131st overall in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft by the Minnesota Wild. Following the draft, he then went on to play with the Muskegon Lumberjacks and the Des Moines Buccaneers in the United States Hockey League for the 2011\u201312 USHL season where he was named to the USHL All-Rookie Team. He stated that he felt going through the USHL before joining the collegiate league would be the best way to prepare for the jump from junior hockey to college. Seeler then played for the University of Nebraska Omaha for two seasons before transferring to the University of Minnesota in 2014. He was not allowed to play in the 2014\u201315 season due to NCAA transfer rules. He then played one season for the University of Minnesota before signing an entry level contract with the Minnesota Wild and joining their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Iowa Wild, for the 2016\u201317 AHL season. After attending the Minnesota Wild's 2017 training camp, Seeler was reassigned to the AHL to begin the 2017\u201318 season. He scored his first AHL goal on January 7, 2018, against the Cleveland Monsters. Seeler was called up to the NHL from the Iowa Wild on February 11, 2018. He made his NHL debut the next day against the New York Rangers. Seeler recorded his first NHL point on February 22, 2018, in a game against the New Jersey Devils. He assisted on Chris Stewart's goal to help the Wild win 4\u20132. After his first NHL fight against Luke Witkowski on March 4, 2018, Seeler missed three games due to a bicep strain. He returned to the lineup on March 13, 2018, to play in a 5\u20131 loss to the Colorado Avalanche. Seeler made his playoff debut during the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs against the Winnipeg Jets. He recorded two points in five games as the Wild lost in five games to the Jets. As a restricted free agent, Seeler agreed to a three-year, $2.175 million contract with the Wild on July 1, 2018. On November 3, after going pointless in his first 12 NHL games that season, Seeler recorded two assists and his first NHL goal in a 5\u20131 win over the St. Louis Blues. During the 2019\u201320 season, on February 3, 2020, Seeler was claimed by the Chicago Blackhawks off waivers from the Wild. ==Personal life== His parents are Dan and Kris Seeler and he has two older sisters, Ashley and Kelly. Kelly was a member of the Minnesota's national championship hockey team in 2012. ==Career statistics== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
