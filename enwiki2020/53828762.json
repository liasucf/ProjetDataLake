NEMA stepper motors are labeled most notably by faceplate size, NEMA 17 being a stepper motor with a 1.7 x 1.7 inch faceplate. == NEMA 17 stepper motor == NEMA 17 stepper motor is a stepper motor type specified by NEMA. NEMA 17 steppers have a 1.7 x 1.7 inch faceplate. NEMA 17 steppers have usually more torque than the smaller variants, such as NEMA 14. NEMA 17 steppers are commonly used in 3D-printers, CNC router, Linear actuators and mid-torque precise movement applications. == References == == Further reading == http://reprap.org/wiki/NEMA_Motor Stepper motor ",
