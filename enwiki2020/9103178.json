    "text": "Damien Robitaille (born 1981) is a Canadian musician from the village of Lafontaine, Ontario, which is located in the Georgian Bay area, two hours north-west of Toronto. Robitaille started his music career at a young age, when he started playing the piano when he was eight years old, and later in his childhood he learned to play such instruments as the trumpet, guitar and violin. Later on, Robitaille attended Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo to study classical music. While at Laurier, he was a member of the rock band The Mezameeze (made to sound like \"Mes Amis\" in French, meaning \"My Friends\"). Halfway through his university career he was a finalist in Ontario Pop, a Franco-Ontarian competition, in which he won a scholarship to attend a one- year program at \"L'Ecole Nationale de la Chanson\" in Granby, Quebec. In 2004, Robitaille, a young poetic musician, played at the Festival de la chanson de Granby (Granby Song Festival) in Granby, Quebec in which he was a finalist. This festival, as well as the Francouvertes festival in Montreal, Quebec where he won first prize, helped Robitaille become a successful musician in Quebec. Robitaille performs the vocals, guitar and piano for all of his songs. Damien Robitaille.jpg In 2006, Robitaille released his first full-length album titled L'homme qui me ressemble (The Man Who Looks Like Me). The title is a reference to the duality of being a performer having to take on a persona, which is a large part of Damien's act. On September 8, 2009, he launched his album Homme Autonome. On November 16, 2016, he released the single \"Tout feu tou flamme\". He is released under Audiogram. ==Discography== *Damien (2000) - Independently released album which Damien recorded with the help of his high school music teacher *Damien Robitaille (2003) - Mini-album featuring tracks from Francouvertes *L'homme qui me ressemble (2006) *Homme Autonome (2009) *Omnipr\u00e9sent (2012) *Univers parall\u00e8les (2017) ==References== ==External links== *Damien Robitaille's Official Site (In French) Category:1981 births Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Franco-Ontarian people Category:Canadian pop singers Category:Canadian male singers Category:Musicians from Ontario Category:People from Simcoe County Category:Audiogram (label) artists Category:Canadian singer-songwriters Category:French-language singers of Canada Category:21st- century Canadian singers Category:21st-century male singers ",
