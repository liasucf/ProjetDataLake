    "text": "Fusinus ocelliferus, common name the long-siphoned whelk, is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Fasciolariidae, the spindle snails, the tulip snails and their allies.Gofas, S. (2014). Fusinus ocelliferus. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=225337 on 2014-12-13 ==Spelling== The specific name was originally spelled \"ocelliferus\"; although this is not a correct latinization it is not liable to a justified emendation (cf. ICZN art. 32.5.1. \"Incorrect transliteration or latinization ... are not to be considered inadvertent errors\"). The spelling ocellifer is therefore an unjustified emendation, which may be traced to Kaicher, 1976 (card no 1857) ==Description== ==Distribution== This marine species occurs off South Africa. ==References== Fusinus ocelliferus, abapertural view ==External links== * Branch, G.M. et al.
