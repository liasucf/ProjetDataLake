Height ~ 10\". Aaron-Taylor has created a body of artwork that consists of modest-sized sculptural objects which depict fantasy-like figures recalled from her dreams, including dogs, cats and other small creatures. The distortions from the anatomical correctness of the objects results from a practice of using tree roots, affixing felt in multiple colors for the basis of the core figure's form. She hand-processes her own felt. which she uses emulate an animal's pelt. She incorporates other natural and man-made materials, such as gemstones, pieces of metal, teeth and bone. She uses meditation and Jungian imagery as a source for inspirations. One of Aaron- Taylor's most prominent work was in the Dreamscapes and Soul Shards series which focuses on the psychology of marriage, dreams, and turning the ordinary into the extraordinary. The Soul Shards series focuses on the retrieval of these broken pieces of soul. Before creating a series and gathering her materials, Aaron-Taylor will research her pieces to build upon her ideas to enhance the story-telling process. She believes that the process of making a piece is journey and as a long-time student of the Jungian psychology, most of her work comes from dreams that are a direct response from her interest in The Tarot, shamanism, ritual, alchemy, archetypes, and the collective unconscious. She brings forth parts from her dreams that bring poignancy, humor, and meaning. === Significant works === * Deity series * Dreamscape series * Dream Games series * Threshold series * Soul Shard series * Teapot Series * Journeying Series Each series stems from an important aspect of Aaron-Taylor's life whether it was from childhood or dreams, they deal with fascination and narrative story-telling. === Shows and collection === * Selected one-person exhibitions *Soul Shard #30, 2006; Wayne State University Art Permanent Collection, Detroit, MI *Deity VIII, 1990; Cranbrook Art Museum Permanent Collection No. CAM 1992.17, Cranbrook Academy of Art, Bloomfield Hills, MI. * Renaissance Center, Commissioned Wall Relief - Westin Hotels,Detroit, MI * K-Mart Corporation, Permanent Collection, Troy, MI * Westin Hotels, Commissioned Wall Relief, Renaissance ===Bibliography=== * Dennis Alan Nawrocki; Steve Panton; Matthew Piper. \"Essay'd 3: 30 Detroit artists\".
