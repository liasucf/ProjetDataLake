In 1839 he was appointed professor of foreign literature in the Facult\u00e9 des lettres at the University of Bordeaux. Between 1834 and 1842 he published editions of many works written between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries in French, English, and Saxon, including the Roman de la rose and the Chanson de Roland. He got his licence in literature in 1842, and his doctorat in 1846, with a thesis in Latin on Virgil and a thesis in French, entitled: Histoire des races maudites de la France et de l'Espagne. Subsequently, he published French translations of Goldsmith, Sterne, Shakespeare, and Tennyson.
