    "text": "The Historian is the 2005 debut novel of American author Elizabeth Kostova. The plot blends the history and folklore of Vlad \u021aepe\u0219 and his fictional equivalent Count Dracula. Kostova's father told her stories about Dracula when she was a child, and later in life she was inspired to turn the experience into a novel. She worked on the book for ten years and then sold it within a few months to Little, Brown and Company, which bought it for . The Historian has been described as a combination of genres, including Gothic novel, adventure novel, detective fiction, travelogue, postmodern historical novel, epistolary epic, and historical thriller. Kostova was intent on writing a serious work of literature and saw herself as an inheritor of the Victorian style. Although based in part on Bram Stoker's Dracula, The Historian is not a horror novel, but rather an eerie tale. It is concerned with history's role in society and representation in books, as well as the nature of good and evil. As Kostova explains, \"Dracula is a metaphor for the evil that is so hard to undo in history.\" The evils brought about by religious conflict are a particular theme, and the novel explores the relationship between the Christian West and the Islamic East. Little, Brown and Company heavily promoted the book and it became the first debut novel to become number one on The New York Times bestseller list in its first week on sale. As of 2005, it was the fastest-selling hardback debut novel in U.S. history. In general, the novel received mixed reviews. While some praised the book's description of the setting, others criticized its structure and lack of tonal variety. Kostova received the 2006 Book Sense award for Best Adult Fiction and the 2005 Quill Award for Debut Author of the Year. Sony has bought the film rights and, as of 2007, was planning an adaptation. == Plot summary == The Historian interweaves the history and folklore of Vlad \u021aepe\u0219, a 15th-century prince of Wallachia known as \"Vlad the Impaler\", and his fictional equivalent Count Dracula together with the story of Paul, a professor; his 16-year-old daughter; and their quest for Vlad's tomb. The novel ties together three separate narratives using letters and oral accounts: that of Paul's mentor in the 1930s, that of Paul in the 1950s, and that of the narrator herself in the 1970s. The tale is told primarily from the perspective of Paul's daughter, who is never named. ===Part I=== Part I opens in 1972 Amsterdam. The narrator finds an old vellum- bound book with a woodcut of a dragon in the center associated with Dracula. When she asks her father Paul about it, he tells her how he found the handmade book in his study carrel when he was a graduate student in the 1950s. Paul took the book to his mentor, Professor Bartholomew Rossi, and was shocked to find that Rossi had found a similar handmade book when he was a graduate student in the 1930s. As a result, Rossi researched \u021aepe\u0219, the Dracula myth surrounding him, and the mysterious book. Rossi traveled as far as Istanbul; however, the appearance of curious characters and unexplained events caused him to drop his investigation and return to his graduate work. Rossi gives Paul his research notes and informs him that he believes Dracula is still alive. The bulk of the novel focuses on the 1950s timeline, which follows Paul's adventures. After meeting with Paul, Rossi disappears; smears of blood on his desk and the ceiling of his office are the only traces that remain. Certain that something unfortunate has befallen his advisor, Paul begins to investigate Dracula. While in the university library he meets a young, dark- haired woman reading a copy of Bram Stoker's Dracula. She is Helen Rossi, the daughter of Bartholomew Rossi, and she has become an expert on Dracula. Paul attempts to convince her that one of the librarians is trying to prevent their research into Dracula, but she is unpersuaded. Later, the librarian attacks and bites Helen. Paul intervenes and overpowers him, but he wriggles free. The librarian is then run over by a car in front of the library and apparently killed. Upon hearing her father's story, the narrator becomes interested in the mystery and begins researching Dracula as she and her father travel across Europe during the 1970s. Although he eventually sends her home, she does not remain there. After finding letters addressed to her that reveal he has left on a quest to find her mother (previously believed to be dead), she sets out to find him. As is slowly made clear in the novel, Helen is the narrator's mother. The letters continue the story her father has been telling her. The narrator decides to travel to a monastery where she believes her father might be. ===Part II=== Part II begins as the narrator reads descriptions of her father and Helen's travels through Eastern Europe during the 1950s. While on their travels, Helen and Paul conclude that Rossi might have been taken by Dracula to his tomb. They travel to Istanbul to find the archives of Sultan Mehmed II, which Paul believes contain information regarding the location of the tomb. They fortuitously meet Professor Turgut Bora from Istanbul University, who has also discovered a book similar to Paul's and Rossi's. He has access to Mehmed's archive, and together they unearth several important documents. They also see the librarian who was supposedly killed in the United States \u2013 he has survived because he is a vampire and he has continued following Helen and Paul. Helen shoots the vampire librarian but misses his heart and consequently, he does not die. From Istanbul, Paul and Helen travel to Budapest, Hungary, to further investigate the location of Dracula's tomb and to meet with Helen's mother, who they believe may have knowledge of Rossi \u2013 the two had met during his travels to Romania in the 1930s. For the first time Helen hears of her mother and Rossi's torrid love affair. Paul and Helen learn much, for example that Helen's mother, and therefore Helen herself and the narrator, are descendants of Vlad \u021aepe\u0219. ===Part III=== Part III begins with a revelation by Turgut Bora that leads the search for Dracula's tomb to Bulgaria. He also reveals that he is part of an organization formed by Sultan Mehmed II from the elite of the Janissaries to fight the Order of the Dragon, an evil consortium later associated with Dracula. In Bulgaria, Helen and Paul seek the assistance of a scholar named Anton Stoichev. Through information gained from Stoichev, Helen and Paul discover that Dracula is most likely buried in the Bulgarian monastery of Sveti Georgi. After many difficulties Paul and Helen discover the whereabouts of Sveti Georgi. Upon reaching the monastery they find Rossi's interred body in the crypt and are forced to drive a silver dagger through his heart to prevent his full transformation into a vampire. Before he dies, he reveals that Dracula is a scholar and has a secret library. Rossi has written an account of his imprisonment in this library and hidden it there. Paul and Helen are pursued to the monastery by political officials and by the vampire librarian \u2013 all of them are seeking Dracula's tomb, but it is empty when they arrive. Paul and Helen move to the United States, marry, and Helen gives birth to the narrator. However, she becomes depressed a few months afterwards. She later confesses that she feared the taint of the vampiric bite that she acquired earlier would infect her child. The family travels to Europe in an attempt to cheer her up. When they visit the monastery Saint-Matthieu-des-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales, Helen feels Dracula's presence and is compelled to jump off a cliff. Landing on grass, she survives and decides to hunt him down and kill him in order to rid herself of his threat and her fears. When the narrator arrives at Saint-Matthieu-des- Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales, she finds her father. Individuals mentioned throughout the 1970s timeline converge in a final attempt to defeat Dracula. He is seemingly killed by a silver bullet fired into his heart by Helen. In the epilogue, which takes place in 2008, the narrator attends a conference of medievalists in Philadelphia, and stops at a library with an extensive collection of material related to Dracula. She accidentally leaves her notes and the attendant rushes out and returns them to her, as well as a book with a dragon printed in the center, revealing that either Dracula is still alive or one of his minions is imitating the master. ==Background and publication== ===Biographical background=== Kostova's interest in the Dracula legend began with the stories her father told her about the vampire when she was a child. The family moved from the U.S. to Ljubljana, Slovenia in 1972, while her father was teaching for a year at a local university. During that year, the family traveled across Europe.

LexisNexis (subscription required). Retrieved 6 May 2009. Kostova's interest in books and libraries began early as well. Her mother, a librarian, frequently took her and her sisters to the public library \u2013 they were each allowed to check out 30 books and had a special shelf for their library books.Sarah Karush, \"The Legend That Never Dies Brings Author a Stake to Publish a First Novel\", The State (5 June 2005).

The recordings they made will be deposited in the Library of Congress. While Kostova was in Europe, the Berlin Wall collapsed, heralding the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe, events which shaped her understanding of history. ===Composition and publication=== Kostova had her \"eureka moment\" when she realized that the location of Vlad \u021aepe\u0219's remains was unknown.Bob Thompson, \"The Writers Bitten by the Vampire Bug\", The Washington Post (28 July 2005). Access World News (subscription required). Retrieved 10 May 2009. Five years later, in 1994, when Kostova was hiking in the Appalachian Mountains with her husband, she had a flashback to those storytelling moments with her father and asked herself \"what if the father were spinning his Dracula tales to his entranced daughter and Dracula were listening in? What if Dracula were still alive?\" She immediately scratched out seven pages of notes into her writer's notebook. Two days later, she started work on the novel. At the time she was teaching English as a second language, creative writing and composition classes at universities in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, entered the writing program at the University of Michigan and finished the book as she was obtaining her Master of Fine Arts degree.Robyn Dorei, \"Death becomes her\", The Sun-Herald (11 September 2005). Access World News (subscription required). Retrieved 7 May 2009. Kostova did extensive research about Eastern Europe and Vlad \u021aepe\u0219.

Her husband, whom she had met in Bulgaria, assisted her with related geographical descriptions and diction. It took her ten years to finish the novel. Kostova finished the novel in January 2004 and sent it to a potential literary agent in March.

According to Kostova, Bram Stoker \"created Dracula as a brilliant figure; a creature that is part monster and part genius. Dracula represents the best and worst of us.\"Bill Castanier, \"Novel takes a different look at Dracula through lost letters\" (original), www.lansingcitypulse.com. Retrieved 10 May 2009. Archived copy. Kostova wanted to write a serious literary novel, with scholarly heroes, that was at the same time reminiscent of 19th-century adventures. She was inspired by Victorian writers such as Wilkie Collins; his novel The Moonstone (1868), with its plot twists and bevy of narrators, was \"a major model\".Anna Carey, \"Mad about Vlad\", The Irish Times (6 August 2005). LexisNexis (subscription required). Retrieved 7 May 2009. The primary literary ancestor of The Historian, however, is Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897).

Retrieved 7 May 2009. Archived copy. Yet, Kostova shapes Dracula into her own character. While Stoker's vampire is the focus of his novel, Kostova's is at the edges. Moreover, the blend of the fictional Dracula and the historical Vlad \"adds a sinister and frightening edge\" to the character, according to scholar Stine Fletcher.Stine Fletcher, \"Reader, Unbury Him with a Word\" (original), Necropsy: The Review of Horror Fiction (1 November 2005). Retrieved 28 May 2005. Archived copy. Despite its Gothic roots, The Historian is not suffused with violence nor is it a horror novel. Kostova aimed to write a \"chilling\" Victorian ghost story, and her realistic style is what creates this effect. Marlene Arpe of The Toronto Star praises Kostova's imagery in particular, quoting the following passage: As Peter Bebergal explains in The Boston Globe, \"Instead of fetishizing blood, Kostova fetishizes documents (manuscripts, maps, letters) and the places that house them (libraries, archives and monasteries).\"Peter Bebergal, \"Literary take on vampires gives 'Historian' bite\" (original), The Boston Globe (15 June 2005). Retrieved 7 May 2009. Archived copy. As one critic explains, \"the real horror rests in the possibility of what Dracula truly is\". For example, the narrator comments: The novel's tone and structure place it within the serious literary tradition for which Kostova was aiming. For example, the alternating timelines are suggestive of A. S. Byatt's Possession (1990) and the intermingling of academia and the occult suggests Arturo Perez-Reverte's The Club Dumas (1993).Steve Murray, \"A Dracula with teeth\", The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (26 June 2005). Access World News (subscription required). Retrieved 10 May 2009. Although many reviewers compared The Historian to Dan Brown's historical thriller The Da Vinci Code (2003), Kostova has said her book \"is part of a tradition where literary craft and experiments in form are all as important as action ... the only overlap is this idea of people searching for something in history. I'm still surprised when people make this comparison, I'm very grateful my publisher has never pushed it.\" Moreover, the only real historical personage in her novel is Vlad \u021aepe\u0219 and she changed the name of some locations \"fearing some readers might confuse fantasy and reality, as they have with Brown's novels\".Marti Davis, \"'The Historian' \u2013 UT prof's spooky stories inspired author-daughter's best-selling novel\", Knoxville News- Sentinel (3 July 2005).

Reviewers praised Kostova's lush descriptions of the setting and the fascinating European cities and countries which the story traverses: Amsterdam, Slovenia, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, France, Oxford, Switzerland and Italy. ==Themes== The Historian is suffused with \"the sensual and intellectual pleasures to be found in dusty old libraries, with their leather- bound books and fading maps\". History and questions about its role in society pervade The Historian. In particular, the novel argues that knowledge of history is power, particularly as it is written in books. The title can refer to any of the major characters, including Dracula.Jane Halsall, et al., \"The Historian\", School Library Journal 51:10 (October 2005). EBSCO (subscription required). Retrieved 20 June 2009. As Nancy Baker explains in The Globe and Mail, the novel is \"about the love of books\" and the knowledge and comfort they offer the characters \u2013 even Dracula himself is a bibliophile. As one critic explains, the novel is specifically about the love of scholarship.Susan Larson, \"He's baaack\", The Times-Picayune (15 June 2005). Access World News (subscription required). Retrieved 10 May 2009. At the heart of the novel is an exploration of \"the power and price of scholarly obsession\". As Paul explains in the novel: The novel explores questions of good and evil and as Jessica Treadway states in The Chicago Tribune, it \"is intriguing for its thorough examination of what constitutes evil and why it exists\". For example, Dracula at one point asks Rossi: As Kostova explains, \"Dracula is a metaphor for the evil that is so hard to undo in history.\" For example, he is shown influencing Eastern European tyrants and supporting national socialism in Transylvania. He is \"vainglorious, vindictive, [and] vicious\".Sarah Murdoch, \"Impaled on a serpentine plot\", National Post (9 July 2005). LexisNexis (subscription required). Retrieved 7 May 2009. As Michael Dirda explains in The Washington Post, the novel conveys the idea that \"Most of history's worst nightmares result from an unthinking obedience to authority, high-minded zealotry seductively overriding our mere humanity.\" It is in the figure of the vampire that Kostova reveals this, since \"our fear of Dracula lies in the fear of losing ourselves, of relinquishing our very identities as human beings\". In fact, the narrator is never named in the novel, suggesting, as one critic explains, \"that the quest for the dark side of human nature is more universal than specific to a concrete character\".Jessica Treadway, \"Raising the undead\", Chicago Tribune (12 June 2005). Access World News (subscription required). Retrieved 10 May 2009. Religion is also a dominant theme of The Historian. Dracula is Christian and, as Bebergal explains, \"Much of what is frightening in the novel is the suggestion of heretical Christian practices and conspiratorial monks.\" Kostova herself notes that the world is still \"wracked by religious conflict\", therefore historical fiction about the topic is relevant.Patti Thorn, \"Vampire tale stirs in author's blood\", Rocky Mountain News (13 August 2005).

The West, which is laden with the \"dead\" weight of this past (represented by the vampires) needs the help of Turkey (and perhaps the entire Muslim world) to recover. As Taheri points out, one of the most appealing characters in the novel is Professor Bora, a Turkish professor who is part of an ancient Ottoman society dedicated to defeating Dracula.Amir Taheri, \"Review of The Historian\" (original), Asharq Alawsat (31 December 2005).
