He has a younger sister, Feng Yue, with a very rare blood type. Therefore, he recruits Shan Shan (Zhao Liying), who shares the same blood type as Feng Yue, into the company to be a blood donor. Interesting anecdotes occur when Feng Teng intentionally tries to fatten up Shan Shan, who loves eating. As Feng Teng gets to know Shan Shan, he discovers her innocence and kind heart beyond her clumsy nature, and falls in love with her. When Feng Teng's childhood friend, Yuan Lishu (Li Chengyuan) returns to the country, she is dismayed to discover that Feng Teng is in love with Shan Shan. She tries to compete with Shan Shan for Feng Teng's love. Together with Feng Teng's best friend, Zheng Qi (Huang Ming), the two try to separate the couple by inciting conflicts. ==Cast== ===Main=== *Hans Zhang as Feng Teng *Zhao Liying as Xue Shanshan *Huang Ming as Zheng Qi *Li Chengyuan as Yuan Lishu ===Supporting=== ====People around Feng Teng==== *Zhang Yang Guo'er as Feng Yue, Feng Teng's sister *Bai Keli as Yan Qing, Feng Yue's husband ====People around Shan Shan==== *Shi Anni as Xue Liuliu, Shan Shan's cousin *Wang Ting as Lu Shuangyi, Shan Shan's best friend *Cui Yongxuan as Du Fan, Shuangyi's boyfriend and Shan Shan's colleague *Zhu Jian as Shan Shan's father *Zhou Hong as Shan Shan's mother *Lian Shuliang as Shan Shan's grandfather *Qin Yue as Shan Shan's aunt and Liu Liu's mother *Yao Chenghao as Xue Tongtong, Shan Shan's cousin and Liu Liu's brother ====People in Feng Teng Company==== *Li Fangding as Zhou Xiaowei *Long Yiyi as Linda *He Huan as Ah Mei *Cao Shiping as Chief Lian *Liu Yujin as Ah Jia *Zhang Youyi as Xiao Xuan *Jiang Dai as Xi Xi *Han Yan as Qiao Qiao *Suriya as Cheng Juan ====Others==== *Yang Kailin as Wang Pinruo, Feng Teng's ex-girlfriend *Chai Haowei as You Chenghao, Liu Liu's boyfriend ==Soundtrack== == Ratings == {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible jquery-tablesorter\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+Jiangsu TV Happiness Theater Premiere Ratings ! rowspan=\"2\" |Air date ! rowspan=\"2\" |Episode ! colspan=\"3\" |CSM50 city ratings ! colspan=\"3\" |CSM34 City ratings |- !Ratings (%) !Audience share (%) !Rank !Ratings (%) !Rating share (%) !Rank |- |July 08, 2014 |1-3 |1.045 |3.004 |2 |1.081 |3.045 |2 |- |July 9, 2014 |4-6 |1.127 |3.254 |2 |1.149 |3.261 |2 |- |July 10, 2014 |7-9 |1.330 |3.848 |1 |1.320 |3.755 |1 |- |July 11, 2014 |10-12 |1.427 |4.150 |1 |1.380 |3.946 |1 |- |July 12, 2014 |13-14 |1.382 |4.077 |1 |1.383 |4.032 |1 |- |July 13, 2014 |15-16 |1.368 |4.018 |2 |1.374 |3.971 |2 |- |July 14, 2014 |17-19 |1.381 |4.014 |2 |1.342 |3.828 |2 |- |July 15, 2014 |20-22 |1.466 |4.247 |2 |1.419 |4.033 |2 |- |July 16, 2014 |23-25 |1.650 |4.846 |2 |1.561 |4.520 |2 |- |July 17, 2014 |26-28 |1.767 |5.084 |1 |1.689 |4.791 |1 |- |July 18, 2014 |29-31 |1.725 |4.926 |1 |1.659 |4.683 |1 |- |July 19, 2014 |32-33 |1.575 |4.678 |1 |1.473 |4.319 |1 |- |July 20, 2014 |34 |1.157 |3.085 |2 |1.075 |2.841 |2 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Average !1.44 !4.183 !/ !1.402 !4.008 !/ |} * Highest ratings are marked in red, lowest ratings are marked in blue ==Awards and nominations== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
