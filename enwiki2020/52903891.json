Her third capture occurred while she was on a whaling voyage. Her last voyage took her from \u00cele de France to Bordeaux where she was decommissioned in January 1809. ==British career== Diamond was the first 500-ton (bm) vessel built at Quebec since the British occupation. Diamond entered Lloyd's Register in 1800 with Anderson, master, Beatson, owner, and trade London-Halifax.Lloyd's Register (1800), Seq. \u2116276. The French privateer Grand D\u00e9cid\u00e9 captured \"The Diamond Transport, from Halifax to Portsmouth\" around end-October 1800.Lloyd's List 7 November 1800, \u21164100. On 1 November the Royal Navy Cutter Viper recaptured Diamond. Viper sent Diamond into Falmouth, where she arrived on 3 November. In 1801 Diamonds ownership changed. The entry in Lloyd's Register is illegible, but the entry in the 1802 issue shows her master as Clark, her owner as Parry & Co., and her trade as London-Africa.Lloyd's Register (1802), Seq. \u211698. On 24 August 1801 Captain James Clark received a letter of marque.Letter of Marque, - accessed 14 May 2011.

However, recaptured Diamond on the 12th and sent her into The Downs.Lloyd's List 23 August 1800, \u21164378. A few days later Diamond ran on shore a few miles below Gravesend and bilged.Lloyd's List 30 August 1800, \u21164380. Diamond arrived back in London on 31 August. Next, Diamond became a whaling ship for J. Hill & Co. with destination the South Seas.Lloyd's Register (1805), Seq. \u2116113. Captain Mark Munro (or Monro) received a letter of marque on 31 August 1804, and sailed her from Britain on 17 September 1804 with destination Isle of Desolation. She was at Desolation on 25 February 1805.British Southern Whale Fishery Database \u2013 voyages: Diamond. She was also reported to have been \"all well\" there on 5 May.Lloyd's List 8 October 1805, \u21164260. On 10 November, the French privateer Napol\u00e9on captured Diamond in the Mosambique Channel, after a three-day chase. Then on 10 December Napol\u00e9on captured . The capture occurred off Cape Agulhas as Hercules was returning to England from Bombay, and Napol\u00e9on sent her into Port Louis. At her capture, Hercules was carrying a cargo of cotton.. In November 1805, Napol\u00e9on brought the prisoners from Hercules and from Diamond into the Cape Colony, then in Dutch hands. There Alex Tennant, resident in the Cape, arranged at his own expense for the prisoners to be sent to St Helena.Records of the Cape Colony from February 1793 (1901), Government of the Cape Colony; pp.404-12. The Danish ship Beshriermerin arrived at St Helena on 6 January 1806 with the British crews.Lloyd's List 4 March 1806, \u21164302. ==French career== The French renamed Diamond Diamant. An ambiguous report has \"The Napoleon, prize of the Diamant, consignees of the Lenouvelle brothers, three masted vessel, of about 400 tons, copper-lined, to be sold 5 April [1806] by notary Gu\u00e9rin.\" At \u00cele de France the French commissioned Diamant in September 1808 under the command of Captain Joseph Potier \"en guerre et en marchandises\", that is an armed merchantman that was also authorised to take prizes should the opportunity arise. In mid-October, Diamant left Mauritius, bound for Lorient. She arrived in Quiberon Bay in the evening of 21 January 1809 and ran into the British blockade; a frigate gave chase, but Potier managed to escape by throwing his artillery overboard. Diamant arrived off Bordeaux on the 23rd, where a storm forced Potier to cut down her masts to save the ship; he finally arrived in Bordeaux harbour on the 25th. She was decommissioned after her arrival at Bordeaux in January 1809.{{sfnp|Demerliac|2003 ==Notes, citations, and references== Notes Citations References * * * * * * Category:1798 ships Category:Age of Sail merchant ships Category:Merchant ships of the United Kingdom Category:Slave ships Category:Whaling ships Category:Captured ships Category:Merchant ships of France ",
