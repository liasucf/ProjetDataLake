It has a capacity of 60,720. ==History== ===Construction=== As early as 1912, the Spanish architect An\u00edbal Gonz\u00e1lez \u00c1lvarez-Ossorio had an initial design of a stadium for the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929. The executive committee has commissioned the architect Antonio Illanes del R\u00edo to complete the design in 1923. Several locations were considered for the new stadium when finally the current location was chosen by commissar Cruz Conde. The technical study for its construction was carried out by Manuel Mar\u00eda Smith who has designed the San Mam\u00e9s Stadium of Bilbao in 1913. The construction works were launched in 1923 and finally completed by the end of 1928. ===Inauguration to 1939=== Estadio de la Exposici\u00f3n in 1929 The newly built Estadio de la Exposici\u00f3n was officially inaugurated on March 17, 1929, hosting an international match where Spain defeated Portugal 5-0. In 1936, Real Betis gained the lease of the stadium and became its sole tenant. During the Spanish Civil War, Seville City Council requisitioned the stadium and handed it over to the military. The stadium suffered major damages as a result of the war and required renovation. The work was carried out with the help of Gonzalo Queipo de Llano, and the stadium was reopened on March 12, 1939. ===After the Benito Villamar\u00edn era=== In 1958, the extension of the northern and southern stands was carried out by the architect Antonio Delgado y Roig. In 1959 electric lighting was installed with 4 towers of 48 spotlights each. On August 12, 1961, the stadium became owned property by Real Betis. Few days later, the stadium was renamed after Benito Villamar\u00edn who served as the club president between 1955 and 1965. The stadium was blessed by Cardinal Jos\u00e9 Bueno y Monreal. Between 1971 and 1973, the northern and southern stands were entirely demolished to be rebuilt. With continuous expansion works during the 1970s, the capacity of the stadium was increased up to 48,500 spectators. However, major renovation works were carried out between 1979 and 1982 for the 1982 FIFA World Cup and the capacity of the stadium was increased up to 50,253. The stadium hosted 2 group matches during the tournament. ===Current status=== The stadium in 2008 Sunset in Seville over the Benito Villamar\u00edn in 2014 In 1997, the stadium was renamed after the then-club president Manuel Ruiz de Lopera.
