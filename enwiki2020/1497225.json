It was originally conceived as the second in a series of three maps, along with The Streets of Ankh-Morpork and A Tourist Guide to Lancre. For this work, Briggs became known as the \"cartographer of Discworld.\" A fourth atlas, Death's Domain, was added to the series. After its publication, Pratchett was surprised to learn that British bookstores were displaying it in their nonfiction sections because, they argued, it was a real map, though of a fictional place. ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * Clute, John and John Grant.
