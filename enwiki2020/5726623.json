    "text": "His New Profession His New Profession is a 1914 American comedy silent film made at the Keystone Studios and starring Charlie Chaplin. The film involves Chaplin taking care of a man in a wheelchair. It is also known as \"The Good for Nothing\". ==Synopsis== Charlie is hired by a man to wheel his elderly invalid uncle around a seaside park for a short time. Although he begins his new job with enthusiasm, Charlie soon thinks he should be earning extra money for his efforts to spend at a saloon. Accordingly, he takes a beggar's sign and tin and puts them on the wheelchair of the sleeping old man. A pretty girl, a real beggar, a park policeman and the old man's nephew (who is furious because Charlie allowed his uncle's wheelchair to nearly roll off a high, long pier) soon ensure that Charlie's new profession is a thing of the past. ==Review== Motion Picture News commented, \"Charlie Chaplin appears in this picture and, as usual, whenever he appears it is a laugh throughout.\" ==Cast== * Charles Chaplin as Charlie * Charley Chase as Nephew * Cecile Arnold as Girl with Eggs * Harry McCoy as Policeman * Roscoe Arbuckle as Bartender * Helen Carruthers as Woman (uncredited) * Charles Murray as Drinker (uncredited) * Vivian Edwards as Nurse (uncredited) * Jess Dandy as Invalid Uncle ==See also== * Charlie Chaplin filmography ==External links== * * * Category:1914 films Category:American films Category:1914 comedy films Category:Short films directed by Charlie Chaplin Category:American black-and-white films Category:American comedy films Category:American silent short films Category:Keystone Studios films Category:Films produced by Mack Sennett Category:Articles containing video clips Category:1914 short films Category:Comedy short films Category:Mutual Film films ",
