    "text": "Ligeia is an American metalcore band from Massachusetts formed in 2003. ==History== Originally formed in the winter of 2003 by Keith Holuk and Ryan Ober, Ligeia solidified their line-up with the additions of Brandon Whipple and Patrick Murphy in 2007. Their debut album, Your Ghost Is a Gift, was recorded in December 2004 by Ken Susi of Unearth and released in late March 2006 on Ferret Music. Ligeia released their second album, Bad News, in August 2008 on Ferret Records. Ligeia has maintained a DIY work ethic since their inception and because of their \"take no prisoners\" attitude, have played over 600 shows in the last two years, including a highly successful run on the \"Two Dollar Brawler\" tour in 2007. Ligeia has toured across the U.S. and Canada countless times, as well as pulling stints in the U.K., Europe and South America. They have toured with such bands as The Acacia Strain, Misery Signals, Haste The Day, Remembering Never, August Burns Red, in addition to countless others. Their debut album Your Ghost Is a Gift was produced by Ken Susi (Unearth) and released in late March 2006 on Ferret Music. Now, two years later Ligeia returns with the release of Bad News. With Ken Susi once again handling the producer duties, Ligeia is poised and ready to take the next step. \"Bad News is the story of our lives for the last couple of years,\" says front man Keith Holuk. \"Touring non stop...problems we've faced and overcome, members coming and going. This album is how we feel, it's who we are. We're having fun and we hope the kids like it. And this time around, it's not just about the breakdowns.\" ==Break Up== On May 21, 2009, Ligeia failed to show up to a scheduled show in Connecticut at the El-N-Gee Club.
