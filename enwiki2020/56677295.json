    "text": "alt=Winston Morales Chavarro|thumb| Winston Morales Chavarro Winston Morales Chavarro is a Colombian poet, novelist and journalist born in Neiva, in 1969. He has a master's degree in Latin American Literature from the Simon Bolivar Andean University in Quito. He is now a full-time professor teaching at the University of Cartagena. His poetry explores the history of mythology and the mystery of life. In his writing he seeks to analyse some of the most poets of the twentieth century in Latin America, including Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ramos Sucre, Carlos Obregon, C\u00e9sar D\u00e1vila Andrade and Jaime S\u00e1enz. His texts have been partially translated into French, Italian, English, Polish, German, Rumanian and Chinese included in different national and foreign anthologies. He has given lectures and lectures at the Universities of Antioquia, Surcolombiana and Cartagena (Colombia); Szczecin, Krakow, Warsaw, Wroclaw, Zielona Gora and Poznan (Poland); Harvard, California, Salem, Merrimack and Northern Essex Community College (United States); Sonora (Mexico), and Granada (Spain). == Review == Winston Morales is a universal opita, creator of a country where everyone, starting with the towel carriers and rifles on their shoulders, should go live, because there, as in the musical world of Macondo, it makes you want to sing \"when the words they become aware of non-being in the presence of so many ghosts invisible \". There in Schuaima, the planet country of the Neivan poet, one can sip with the nose curled by the wind the smell of \"the skirts invaded with geraniums\" of the girls who inhabit it and who, like all its inhabitants, have \"very heart close to the nose \"and whose language makes it possible\" to converse with the heights, with the acorns, with the wind in its state of purity, with the cosmos in its millenary harmony. \" Ignacio Ram\u00edrez In her verses it happens, the living sage of authentic poetry is latent. Adriana Herrera Aniquirona It is about from a collection of poems that points to another collection of poems -hightest spiral- where there are no words but silences as in the flowers, in tenderness, or in love. Luis Rafael G\u00e1lvez The raid on Back to Schuaima means conquering territories in the company of the most charming and enchanted character: Aniquirona, the beloved of all the dreamers on earth; the idealized one that puts us in communication with the beings that live beyond the daily flow. This thoughtfulness, the arrival of \"Settlers\" with their display of beauty captivating almost to delirium. The space that invades the one that follows with its unique aroma of forests and gardens, secret seas or aggressive rocks, or the subversive challenge of presences that are ignored despite their dazzling, sustain the spell, the great orchestration of all the elements. Matilde Espinosa These poems also appropriate an overwhelming poetic personality that, as in the other books of the author, creates a world and defends the features of that world, going through all the shades of black and gray, until achieving the very white texture, the turns sublime, religious, mystical, that distinguish the great poets. In Colombia, a country without a doubt difficult, there is poetry of great height, and this is the proof. Enrique Serrano By reading these Memoirs of Alexander de Brucco, we are witnessing the creation of a world that is indisputably supported by the aforementioned sacred history but is not defined there. It is now specified through the poem itself and the writing of the verse, defined and defended by the author himself through his images, his metaphors, through the poetic language and the tone that he reaches, through his own world and of his particular conception of history and myth. A book of poems that illuminates, that is full of light and colors and the nuances that are produced when the word passes through the prism that is the verse. Santiago Tobon Aniquirona: poetry, affluent towards mystery, deity of sounds and language, which can be transmuted into a woman, into magic or into the fire of things, but which will be, essentially, a song of nature. What river to wade, then, to reach the shore, to the transcendent? Travel with the poet through the forests \"of winds and honeysuckle\" and \"very old chestnut trees\", join in \"the ceremony of flowers\" and woo the light \"in the breath of the air\". Letting \"the continuous voice of the rain\" hit the road forever and abandon man in \"the sap of the trees\", in the ancestral shadow of poetry. Daniuska Gonzalez In his Memoirs, Brucco-Morales Chavarro manages to recreate -and that earned him the National Poetry Prize of the University of Antioquia-, in the poetic world, people of blood and bone who love, suffer, fight and have hope; manages to tear life and a new language from the myth.
