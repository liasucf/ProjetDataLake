When PA 44 was commissioned in 1927, the route was designated from U.S. Route 220 in Jersey Shore to the New York- Pennsylvania border. Northeast of Coudersport from PA 49 to PA 244, and from US 6 to US 220, the road was not paved. From Jersey Shore to Turbotville, PA 44 was assigned the Pennsylvania Route 54 designation. From Turbotville to Jerseytown, the road was designated as Pennsylvania Route 454. From Jerseytown to Buckhorn, 44 was numbered as Pennsylvania Route 342. These designations were eliminated with an extension of PA 44 in 1941. By 1940, PA 44 was extended east to Turbotville, replacing the previous PA 54 alignment. Also in the 1940s, PA 44 was completely paved from Coudersport to the New York state line. In the 1950s, PA 44 was largely extended to Mahanoy City in Schuylkill County. By 1970, the road was truncated to its current southern terminus in Buckhorn. On June 28, 2018, Governor Tom Wolf approved legislation that named the section of PA 44 in Potter County between the Lycoming County line and US 6 as Highway to the Stars, as it passes through Cherry Springs State Park. The idea for the name came from photographer Curt Weinhold, a Potter County resident. State Representative Martin Causer sponsored the legislation for naming the section of PA 44 as Highway to the Stars. ==Major intersections== ==See also== * * ==References== ==External links== *Pennsylvania Highways website on PA 44 *Junction List for PA 44 *Photos of the ends of PA 44 044 Category:Transportation in Clinton County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Columbia County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in McKean County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Montour County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Potter County, Pennsylvania Category:Transportation in Union County, Pennsylvania ",
