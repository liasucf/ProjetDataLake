This working group was founded in 2007 as the Business Architecture Working Group (BAWG). == History == === Foundation === The 2007 announcement for the OMG Technical Meeting on Dec. 12, 2007 in Burlingame, California gave the following rationale for the foundation of a specialized working group on business architecture: > In looking at the link between IT and the business, it has become apparent > that there needs to be more formally defined sets of relationships between > IT architecture and business architecture. In addition, the concept of > business architecture is probably 10-15 years behind the maturity of the IT > architecture world. For example, the relationship between business rules and > processes is not apparent and the role of organizational governance is > similarly disconnected. Therefore, we are initiating the business > architecture working group (BAWG). Business architecture was recently > defined as - \"Formal models and diagrammatic representations of governance > structures, business semantics and value streams across the extended > enterprise.\" This can certainly be debated, but there is no argument to the > fact that there is a need for formalization of business architecture to > align business to business and business to IT...OMG Business Architecture > Working Group. \"Notes on BAWG Technical Meeting: December 10-14, 2007 - > Burlingame, CA.\" at omg.org/docs/bmi/07-12-09, now web.archive.org. Maglio (2010) summarized, that \"in 2007, the Business Architecture Working Group (BAWG) was founded as part of the Object Management Group (OMG). The BAWG aims at establishing industry standards, supporting the creation, and alignment of business blueprints.\"Paul P. Maglio, Cheryl A. Kieliszewski, James C. Spohrer (2010) Handbook of Service Science. p. 259 === Definition of Business Architecture === As already quoted the 2007 announcement, the working group proposed the following working definition of Business Architecture: > Formal models and diagrammatic representations of governance structures, > business semantics and value streams across the extended enterprise. The initial definition developed into the following well known 2008 definition: > A blueprint of the enterprise that provides a common understanding of the > organization and is used to align strategic objectives and tactical > demandsOMG Business Architecture Working Group. \"Business Architecture > Working Group,\" at bawg.omg.org, Oct 10, 2008. (archive.org, Oct. 10, 2008). The definition was first published on the working groups homepage bawg.omg.org, and first cited in Solaimani et al. (2010) Solaimani, Sam, Harry Bouwman, and Mark de Reuver. \"Smart home: aligning business models and providers processes; a case survey.\" (2010). In the Business Architecture Working Group (BAWG) wiki (2010) there was a further discussion on the definition, which was presented as: > A formal blueprint of governance structures, business semantics and value > streams across the extended enterprise.What is Business Architecture? > (Draft) Last modified: 2010/09/21 10:40 by jimrhyne === Different views of an organization === In order to develop an integrated view of an enterprise, many different views of an organization are typically developed. Each \"view\" is typically a diagram that illustrates a way of understanding the enterprise by highlighting specific information about it. The key views of the enterprise that may be provided by business architecture address several aspects of the enterprise; they are summarized by the Object Management Group (2012)OMG Business Architecture Working Group, \"Business architecture overview,\" at bawg.omg.org. Accessed December 18, 2014 as follows: > * The Business Strategy view captures the tactical and strategic goals that > drive an organization forward... * The Business Capabilities view describes > the primary business functions of an enterprise and the pieces of the > organization that perform those functions... * The Value stream view defines > the set the end-to-end set of activities that deliver value to external and > internal stakeholders... * The Business Knowledge view establishes the > shared semantics (e.g., customer, order, and supplier) within an > organization and relationships between those semantics (e.g., customer name, > order date, supplier name)... * The Organizational view captures the > relationships among roles, capabilities and business units, the > decomposition of those business units into subunits, and the internal or > external management of those units. In addition to the above views of the enterprise, the relationships connect the aforementioned views form the foundation of the business architecture implementation. This foundation provides the framework that supports the achievement of key goals; planning and execution of various business scenarios; and delivery of bottom line business value. == Organization == === Meetings === BAWG Technical Meetings: * December 10\u201314, 2007 - Burlingame, CA, meeting notes * March 10\u201314, 2008 - Washington, DC, * June 23\u201327, 2008 - Ottawa, CA * September 22\u201326, 2008 - Orlando, FL * December 8\u201312, 2008 - Santa Clara, CA * March 23\u201327, 2009 - Washington, DC === Chairs === * 2007 Dec. 12, 2007 meeting, Facilitators: Geoff Balmes & Neal McWhorter. * 2008 Co-Chair: Neal McWhorter, Enterprise Agility, Inc.; Geoff Balmes, Collaborative Consulting & William M.
