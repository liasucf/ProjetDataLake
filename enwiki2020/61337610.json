    "text": "Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Gouin-D\u00e9carie (born September 30, 1923) is a Canadian developmental psychologist and educator living in Quebec. She is known for her work on intellectual and emotional development in young children. == Biography == Gouin-D\u00e9carie was born in Montreal on September 30, 1923, to Yvette Ollivier, an artist and playwright, and L\u00e9on-Mercier Gouin, a lawyer, professor, and Canadian senator. She studied psychology at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, earning a bachelor's degree in 1945 and a master's degree in 1947. She pursued clinical training at the Centre d'orientation in Montreal (1948), at the Children's Center in Boston (1948), and at the Centre m\u00e9dico-p\u00e9dagogique at the Universit\u00e9 de Paris (1948-1949). In 1949, she married the Canadian philosopher Vianney D\u00e9carie. In 1949, Gouin-D\u00e9carie returned to teach psychology and complete her dissertation at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, where she would remain for the rest of her career. She completed her PhD in 1960. She earned the title of full professor in 1965 and, after her retirement, professor emeritus in 1991. == Research == Gouin-D\u00e9carie conducted research on children's development. Her dissertation, Emotional Intelligence in Young Children, reconciled the developmental theories of Jean Piaget and Sigmund Freud. This work was published as Intelligence and Affectivity in Early Childhood, and included a foreword by Piaget. It was later translated into several languages. In the 1960s, Gouin-D\u00e9carie led a longitudinal study of children born to mothers who had taken thalidomide during their pregnancy. Her work assessed the psychological and emotional health of these children, and received international attention. Gouin-D\u00e9carie's later research examined topics of early social development, including infants' responses to strangers and toddlers' perspective-taking skills. == Awards and honours == In 1969, Gouin-D\u00e9carie was named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. She was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1971. She was named a Distinguished Fellow of the International Society for Infant Study in 1990. In 1994, she was named an Officer of the National Order of Quebec. In 1988, she was awarded the Prix L\u00e9on-G\u00e9rin. In 1991, she received the Innis-G\u00e9rin Medal from the Royal Society of Canada. She received the Prix Acfas Marcel-Vincent from the Association francophone pour le savoir for her work in the social sciences in 1986; in 2013, the prize was renamed the Prix Acfas Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Gouin-D\u00e9carie in her honour. ==Publications== * Le d\u00e9veloppement psychologique de l'enfant., 1953 * De la\u0315dolescence \u00e0 la maturit\u00e9, 1955 * Le fasi della crescita. : Il libro dei genitori., 1964 * Intelligence and affectivity in early childhood; an experimental study of Jean Piaget's object concept and object relations.
