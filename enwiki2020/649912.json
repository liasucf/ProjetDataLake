    "text": "The Flakpanzer IV \"Wirbelwind\" (Whirlwind in English) was a German self- propelled anti-aircraft gun based on the Panzer IV tank. It was developed in 1944 as a successor to the earlier M\u00f6belwagen self-propelled anti-aircraft gun. In the first years of World War II, the German military forces had less interest in developing self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, but as the Allies began to gain air superiority, the need for more mobile and better-armed self- propelled anti-aircraft guns increased. During the early summer of 1944, SS- Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer Karl Wilhelm Krause with the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend came up with the concept of the Flakpanzer IV Wirbelwind. He presented the concept to SS-Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer Max W\u00fcnsche, commanding officer of the 12th SS Panzer Regiment and it was approved by Adolf Hitler. The Panzer IV's turret was removed and replaced with an open-top, nine-sided turret that housed a 2 cm Flakvierling 38, a quadruple mount of 20 mm cannon. A closed-top design would have been preferable, but this was not possible due to the heavy smoke generated by the four anti-aircraft guns. The shape of the turret earned it the nickname Keksdose (\"biscuit tin\"). Production of the tank was carried out by Ostbau Werke in Sagan, Silesia. However, in combat the 2 cm shells, while being able to be fired at a high rate and devastating to any aircraft in a precise burst, the guns lacked range and were sometimes ineffective if several shells did not hit an aircraft at once. Thus, a more powerful successor, with an armament that hit harder and had a longer range, was produced which eventually replaced it. Known as the Flakpanzer IV Ostwind (\"East Wind\"), the successor was equipped with a single 3.7 cm Flak 43.

Between 87 and 105 Wirbelwinds were converted from repaired Panzer IV chassis, but due to discrepancies between the recorded production numbers at Ostbau Werke and Wehrmacht service records, the actual number may never be known. ==Surviving vehicles== * Milit\u00e4rhistorische Ausstellung Flugabwehr, Kiel (Germany) (Historical Military Anti-aricraft Exhibition) * Base Borden Military Museum Flakpanzer Restoration Project The Wirbelwind at CFB Borden is currently undergoing a full running and firing restoration by the Borden military museum by military and volunteers. ==References== ==External links== * Panzerworld Wirbelwind specifications * Achtung Panzer article on Flakpanzer IV * Surviving Panzer IV variants - A PDF file presenting surviving Panzer IV variants * Flakpanzer Restoration Project Interview Category:World War II self-propelled anti-aircraft weapons of Germany ",
