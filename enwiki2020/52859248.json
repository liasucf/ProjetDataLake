Kothandaraman, son of Gajaaranya Dravida Kavimani Muthuswamy Iyer, was a Tamil scholar and an expert in reading palm leaf manuscripts. He has written several poems and authored many books. The title 'Balakavi' was conferred on him by the Senior Sankaracharya of Kancheepuram Sankara Math, as he had written many poems as a young child. He worked at the U. V. Swaminatha Iyer Library and the International Institute of Tamil Studies. He strove for the preservation and documentation of palm leaf manuscripts, opening a new department for that purpose. He also helped several Ph.D. Tamil students in their research work. Among his several works was his translation of Battathiri's Narayaniyam into Tamil in poetic form, which won him the first prestigious \u2018Odakkuzhal Award\u2019, instituted by Gnanapeetha Award winner G. Sankara Kurup. == References == Category:1926 births Category:2017 deaths Category:People from Kanchipuram district Category:Poets from Tamil Nadu Category:Tamil poets Category:Tamil writers ",
