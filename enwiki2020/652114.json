    "text": "Ronald David Mael (born August 12, 1945)Family Tree Legends is an American musician, songwriter, composer and record producer. He is the keyboard player and principal songwriter in the band Sparks which he founded with vocalist, occasional songwriter and younger brother Russell Mael in 1971. Mael is known for his quirky and idiosyncratic approach to songwriting, his intricate and rhythmic keyboard playing style and for his deadpan and low key, scowling demeanour onstage often remaining motionless over his keyboard in sharp contrast to Russell's animated and hyperactive frontman antics. Ron Mael is also noted for his conservative clothes and unfashionable moustache. The Mael brothers are the founders of Lil' Beethoven Records. ==Early life== Ronald David Mael was born on August 12, 1945, in Culver City, California. The Mael brothers grew up in Pacific Palisades \u2013 an affluent beach suburb of Los Angeles \u2013 with their father, Meyer Mael (of Russian and Austrian Jewish descent), [The author is a cousin of Russell and Ron; her father, Alvin, is listed as being Meyer's brother on the 1940 census] who was a graphic designer and caricaturist for the Hollywood Citizen-News, and their mother, Miriam (n\u00e9e Moskowitz), a librarian. After being educated at Palisades High School, both brothers enrolled at the UCLA; Ron began a course in Cinema and Graphic Arts in 1963 while Russell studied Theater Arts and Filmmaking between 1966 and 1968. ==Sparks== Ron Mael plays the keyboards and synthesizers and writes most of the songs for Sparks. When the band hit the peak of its popularity in the 1970s, he was well known for his strange appearance, often remaining motionless over his keyboard in sharp contrast to Russell's animated and hyperactive frontman antics. Ron's conservative clothes and unfashionable, Charlie Chaplin-esque toothbrush moustache attracted much attention, as does his current pencil moustache. Onstage, Ron alternates between playing the keyboard and engaging in comic mime routines, often in connection with projections on backdrop. Mael has used Roland keyboards and synthesizers for many years, customising the \"Roland\" company logo on the instruments to read \"Ronald\". The pair appeared as themselves in the 1977 disaster film Rollercoaster, performing live. They also appeared in episode twenty-two of season six of the Gilmore Girls. In June 2018, Edgar Wright announced he is making a documentary on the cult pop-rock band Sparks. He had covered the band's concert in London in May at O2 Forum Kentish Town. This concert will also be a part of the documentary. ==Personal life== In 2017, a reviewer noted that while the brothers' biographies recount an LA childhood in which they surfed and were both models for mail order catalogues, their private lives are otherwise almost entirely unknown. \"Well, we're in good company with Bob Dylan\", was their reported response. \"We feel the less you do know, it keeps the mythology and the image in a better position.\" Even to the question of whether they have partners or spouses, they refused to give an indication, insisting that \"the vagueness is more interesting than the reality.\"The Independent interview ==Discography== With Sparks {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Album |- ||1971 | Halfnelson |- ||1973 | A Woofer in Tweeter's Clothing |- || 1974 | Kimono My House |- || 1974 | Propaganda |- || 1975 | Indiscreet |- || 1976 | Big Beat |- || 1977 | Introducing Sparks |- || 1979 | No. 1 in Heaven |- || 1980 | Terminal Jive |- || 1981 | Whomp That Sucker |- || 1982 | Angst in My Pants |- || 1983 | In Outer Space |- || 1984 | Pulling Rabbits Out of a Hat |- || 1986 | Music That You Can Dance To |- || 1988 | Interior Design |- || 1994 | Gratuitous Sax & Senseless Violins |- || 1997 | Plagiarism |- || 2000 | Balls |- || 2002 | Lil' Beethoven |- || 2006 | Hello Young Lovers |- || 2008 | Exotic Creatures of the Deep |- || 2009 | The Seduction of Ingmar Bergman |- || 2017 | Hippopotamus |- || 2020 | A Steady Drip, Drip, Drip |} With FFS {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Album |- ||2015 | FFS |} ==References== ==External links== *Official website * * * * *Ron Mael and Russell Mael Biography *The \"Kimono My House\" album files Category:1945 births Category:20th-century American musicians Category:21st-century American keyboardists Category:21st-century American musicians Category:American male songwriters Category:Record producers from California Category:American new wave musicians Category:American synth-pop musicians Category:American people of Austrian-Jewish descent Category:American people of Russian-Jewish descent Category:Living people Category:People from Culver City, California Category:Songwriters from California Category:Sparks (band) members Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:21st-century American male musicians Category:FFS (band) members ",
