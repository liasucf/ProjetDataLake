    "text": "In computer networking, large receive offload (LRO) is a technique for increasing inbound throughput of high-bandwidth network connections by reducing central processing unit (CPU) overhead. It works by aggregating multiple incoming packets from a single stream into a larger buffer before they are passed higher up the networking stack, thus reducing the number of packets that have to be processed. ==Large receive offload== Linux implementations generally use LRO in conjunction with the New API (NAPI) to also reduce the number of interrupts. According to benchmarks, even implementing this technique entirely in software can increase network performance significantly. , the Linux kernel supports LRO for TCP in software only. FreeBSD 8 supports LRO in hardware on adapters that support it. LRO should not operate on machines acting as routers, as it breaks the end-to-end principle and can significantly impact performance. ==Generic receive offload== Generic receive offload (GRO) implements a generalised LRO in software that isn't restricted to TCP/IPv4 or have the issues created by LRO. ==See also== * Large send offload (LSO) * TCP offload engine (TOE) ==References== Category:Networking hardware Category:Network acceleration ",
