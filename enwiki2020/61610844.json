    "text": "Matinta is a genus of South American jumping spiders (family Salticidae). The largest number of species are found in Brazil. ==Taxonomy== Matinta was first described by G. R. S. Ruiz, Wayne Paul Maddison & Mar\u00eda Elena Galiano in 2019. A re-examination of the holotype of the type species of the genus Mago showed that the genus had been misinterpreted, so that species had been included in the genus that did not fit the diagnosis. Accordingly, Ruiz et al. created a new genus, Matinta, to which most of the former Mago genera were transferred. Matinta, like Mago, was placed in the tribe Amycini, part of the Amycoida clade of the subfamily Salticinae. ===Species=== it contains nineteen species, found in Ecuador, Brazil, Guyana, Peru, and French Guiana: *Matinta acutidens (Simon, 1900) (type) \u2013 Brazil, Guyana *Matinta apophysis (Costa & Ruiz, 2017) \u2013 Brazil *Matinta balbina (Patello & Ruiz, 2014) \u2013 Brazil *Matinta chickeringi (Caporiacco, 1954) \u2013 French Guiana *Matinta delicata (Patello & Ruiz, 2014) \u2013 Brazil *Matinta fasciata (Mello-Leit\u00e3o, 1940) \u2013 Guyana *Matinta fonsecai (Soares & Camargo, 1948) \u2013 Brazil *Matinta furcata (Costa & Ruiz, 2017) \u2013 Ecuador *Matinta jurutiensis (Patello & Ruiz, 2014) \u2013 Brazil *Matinta longidens (Simon, 1900) \u2013 Brazil, French Guiana *Matinta mimica (Costa & Ruiz, 2017) \u2013 Ecuador *Matinta opiparis (Simon, 1900) \u2013 Brazil *Matinta pardo (Costa & Ruiz, 2017) \u2013 Brazil *Matinta procax (Simon, 1900) \u2013 Peru *Matinta saperda (Simon, 1900) \u2013 Brazil *Matinta silvae (Crane, 1943) \u2013 Guyana, French Guiana *Matinta similis (Patello & Ruiz, 2014) \u2013 Brazil *Matinta steindachneri (Taczanowski, 1878) \u2013 Peru, Brazil *Matinta vicana (Simon, 1900) \u2013 Brazil ==References== Category:Salticidae genera Category:Salticidae ",
