As the main MTV brand has deviated from its original purpose and increased competition from other music channels and online services, MTV launched a new music channel, MTV Music. The first version of the channel had launched in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 1 February 2011 replacing MTV Shows. The Italian version of the new channel then channel launched on 1 March 2011, replacing MTV Plus. It is expected that MTV may launch MTV Music channels in other regions under a new global strategy to simplify the branding used across territories. The main MTV station had been sold to Sky Italia on August 1, 2015 in Italy. It had no effect on MTV Music, as this TV station was not sold and continues to be a ViacomCBS property. ==Shows== ===Current programmes=== * 100% Italian Songs - music video show * 100% Music - music video show * 100% Top Songs - music video show * Euro Top 20 - the most played European songs show * Hitlist Italia - official Italian chart * MTV New Generation - teen music video show * MTV World Stage - live music show * New Zone - alternative music video show * Sexy Videos - music video show * Top 10 Dance - the most played dance songs show * Top 10 Hip Hop R&B; \\- the most played hip hop and R&B; songs show * Top 10 Hits - the most played pop songs show * Top 10 Italians - the most played Italian songs show * Top 10 Rock - the most played rock songs show * VH1 Simply the Best - music video show ===Past programmes=== * 10 of the Best - an hour-themed music show * 3x1 - videography of an artist * America's Best Dance Crew - musical reality show * Behind the Music - backstage show * Classic 2Night - music video show * Fame - the American television cult series * MTVMUSIC.COM Chart - music chart supplied by mtvmusic.com * Pop 2Night - music video show * Rock 2Night - music video show * Storytellers - live music show * Taking the Stage - musical reality show * The Official Top 20 - music chart show * Top Hits - music chart show * TRL The Battle - music chart show * Urban 2Night - music video show * Your MTV Chart - music video show ==See also== * MTV Europe * Viacom International Media Networks (Europe) ==References== ==External links== * MTV.it Category:MTV channels Category:Television channels in Italy Category:Television channels and stations established in 2011 Category:Music organisations based in Italy Category:Television channel articles with incorrect naming style ",
