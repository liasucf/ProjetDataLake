Copepods - different T. brevicornis developmental stages. Note the mating pair (third from the right). Ross Ice Shelf. Grieve worked at the J-9 location in the shelf centre in the mid-1970s. Grieve was involved in environmental impact studies of the NZ Maui Gas field. This figure shows gas production. Janet Mary Grieve , also known as Janet Bradford-Grieve and Janet Bradford, is a New Zealand biological oceanographer. She is researcher emerita at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in Wellington. She has researched extensively on marine taxonomy and biological productivity. She was president of both the New Zealand Association of Scientists (1998\u20132000)Gregory, G., 2016. A better way: New Zealand Association of Scientists 1922\u20132016. New Zealand Science Review, 73(2), pp.42\u201354. and the World Association of Copepodologists (2008\u201311).http://www.monoculus.org/officers.html == Education and early career == Her PhD, supervised by George Knox at the University of Canterbury,Grieve, J.M., 1966. The Annual Cycle of Plankton Off Kaikoura: A Thesis Presented for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology in the University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand (Doctoral dissertation, University of Canterbury). developed new observations in copepod taxonomy but also produced insights into the processes affecting zooplankton in Kaikoura submarine canyon.Bradford, J.M. (1972). Systematics and ecology of New Zealand central east coast plankton sampled at Kaikoura. N.Z. Oceanographic Institute Memoir 54: 1\u201387. Her pioneering research in this canyon provides a baseline for the biological and physical changes associated with the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake.Mills, J.A., Yarrall, J.W., Bradford-Grieve, J.M., Morrissey, M. and Mills, D.A., 2018. Major changes in the red-billed gull (Larus novaehollandiae scopu-linus) population at Kaikoura Peninsula, New Zealand; causes and consequences: a review. Notornis, 65(1), pp.14\u201326. Immediately after her PhD she joined the New Zealand Oceanographic Institute, a section within the New Zealand Department of Scientific and Industrial Research as a scientist. She broke this with a period as a visiting scholar at the Smithsonian Institution, copepod taxonomy for a time (1970\u201373).Bradford-Grieve, J.M., 2016. Is there a taxonomic crisis?. NZ Sci Rev, 73, p.83. She participated in the Ross Ice Shelf Project expedition to the central Ross Ice Shelf. The team successfully bored through the ice shelf in 1977 to retrieve data and samples in the ice shelf cavity.Bradford, J.M.; Wells, J.B.J. (1983). New calanoid and harpacticoid copepods from beneath the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica. Polar Biology 2: 1\u201315. She continued with the New Zealand Oceanographic Institute and remained when it was absorbed into National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research.Thompson R-M, The First Forty Years, New Zealand Oceanographic Institute: Lives and Times, 1954\u20131994. 40th Jubilee Committee, 1994. == Science and impact == Publishing under surnames Grieve, Bradford and Bradford-Grieve, she has made a significant contribution to the fields of biological oceanography in New Zealand and internationally.https://teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/8250/janet-grieve She is responsible for some of the very first measurements of open ocean productivity in New Zealand waters.Bradford, J.M.; Heath, R.A.; Chang, F.H.; Hay, C.H. (1982). The effects of warm-core eddies on oceanic productivity off north eastern New Zealand. Deep-Sea Research 29: 1501\u20131516. Her research has extended from the subtropics to the Antarctic/Southern Ocean. She has researched topics such as ocean food webs and ecology, and is regarded as the global expert on copepod biosystematics.Bradford-Grieve, J.M.; Boxshall, G.A.; Ahyong, S. Ohtsuka, S. (2010). Cladistic analysis of the calanoid Copepoda. Invertebrate Systematics 24: 291\u2013321. Grieve was a key researcher involved in the environmental survey work that underpinned and guided the development of the Maui oil and gas production facilities within the Taranaki Bight.Bradford\u2010Grieve, J.M., Lewis, K.B. and Stanton, B.R., 1991. Advances in New Zealand oceanography, 1967\u201391. New Zealand journal of marine and freshwater research, 25(4), pp.429\u2013441. This was one of the first marine developments to consider detailed environmental management. In addition she was also on the Task Force group responsible for reviewing the NZ Fisheries Legislation in 1991\u201392.http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1996/0088/193.0/DLM394192.html == Science leadership == She was Manager of the Marine and Freshwater Division of the NZOI, DSIR (1989\u201391). She was President of the New Zealand Association of Scientists (1998\u20132000). In addition she was President of the World Association of Copepodologists (2008\u201311). == Honours and awards == In 1990, Grieve was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 2007 Queen\u2019s Birthday Honours, she was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to marine science. In 1995, she received the New Zealand Marine Sciences Society Award (1995).http://nzmss.org/nzmss-award/ == References == Category:New Zealand marine biologists Category:Women oceanographers Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:University of Canterbury alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Officers of the New Zealand Order of Merit Category:People associated with Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (New Zealand) ",
