    "text": "Frankie Byrne (1922 \u2013 11 December 1993) was an Irish public relations consultant and broadcaster. == Early life == Byrne was born into a successful family of journalists from Dublin. Cared for by servants, from a young age Byrne felt like she wasn\u2019t loved as much as the other children in the family. She was the middle child with two brothers and two sisters. The eldest sister was named Olive, followed by Michael, Byrne, Brian, and Esther. Frankie attended boarding school in Rathfarnham. Byrne had a limited relationship with her parents. Her father was a racing journalist and broadcaster who lived in the Gresham Hotel on O\u2019Connell street where his job at Radio \u00c9ireann was located. Frankie became addicted to nicotine and alcohol. Other family members also struggled with addictions: her siblings Olive and Mick died from alcoholism, and Brian also had a drinking problem. == Career == In the late 1940s, Frankie Byrne worked at the Brazilian embassy in Dublin. She was a pioneer in Irish radio and her program the \u201cAgony Aunt\u201d led to public confessionals on the radio. She wrote an Agony Aunt column for the Evening Press during the same period. She was best known for her 22 years of the radio program \u2018Dear Frankie\u2019. On the show she gave relationship advice to listener requests. Dear Frankie sponsored by Jacobs paved the way for the contemporary radio programs such as The Gerry Ryan Show and RTE\u2019s Liveline with Joe Duffy. . Dear Frankie was broadcast from 1963 to 1985. Dear Frankie opened with the words, \u2018Welcome to a Woman\u2019s Page, a program for and about you\u2019 The program began as a 15-minute question and answer format on household issues but soon became a radio program that allowed people to share confidences and seek advice . Frankie shared household problems with her listeners ranging from jealous husband to lovelorn teenagers. Frankie claimed she knew nothing about domestic science but that she did know about love. Byrne advised on domestic relationships while living a life of turmoil. The most unique feature of Dear Frankie was that the program set people to talking, and helped begin a national conversation on the lonely struggles of generations of Irish women. == Personal life == Byrne never married but had a 30-year relationship with Frank Hall the legendary satirist and columnist for the Evening Herald. Hall was married to Aideen Kierney at the time. Byrne and Hall had met as colleagues at Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann. Their relationship has been disputed by family members and friends, who denied they had a child together and that the couple were just good friends. However, Byrne became pregnant in the 50s presumably by Frank Hall. She gave birth to her daughter Valerie on the 12th of July 1956. Byrne wanted to keep the baby but ultimately gave her up to St Clare's Orphanage in Stamullen. She frequently visited her daughter until she eventually put her up for adoption. Frank Hall left Byrne in the mid-50s at the time she endured severe post-natal depression. She was prescribed Valium and was addicted to the drug for 10 years. == Later life and death == Byrne and her daughter were reunited a decade before Byrne's death. \u201cMy mother \u2013 my real mother \u2013 was very supportive\u201d, Byrne's daughter said.\u201cShe had some information that helped, but she didn\u2019t give it to me until just before I was married, when I was 20, and I just kept that information that I had and tracked her down about seven years later.\u201d Byrne died at the age of 71 from Alzheimer's disease in St Vincent's hospital, Dublin, on 14 December 1993. Tributes were paid by colleagues and friends including the RTE assistant Director-General, Mr Bobby Gahan, who described the late Mrs Byrne's voice as \"one of the greatest sounds of radio\". Others who paid public tribute to her include fellow broadcasters Larry Gogan and Gay Byrne. == Legacy == Frankie Byrne is remembered as an influential force during the time of her radio show, and it has been said that \u2018whole generation\u2019 can \u2018hum the signature tune to Frankie Byrne\u2019s radio program\u2019. When Frankie Byrne passed away in 1993 there was an outburst of support. Gay Byrne described her as having been \u201cA national institution who had been loved by everyone\u201d. Dear Frankie, is often credited as the first 'agony aunt\u2019 radio show program format in Ireland. Frankie\u2019s talk show and life inspired numerous pieces of literature including a stage production in 2012 by the Five Lamps Theater Company, which told the story of her \u2018tragic and secretive life\u2019. She was also the subject of a book published in 1998, which compiled the advice which she gave on Dear Frankie.
