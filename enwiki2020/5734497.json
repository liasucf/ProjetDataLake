    "text": "Necrolemur (\"dead lemur\") is an extinct genus of omomyid primate from Eocene deposits in western Europe. ==Description== Necrolemur was long and probably resembled a tarsier. It was a nocturnal hunter with very large eyes and ears. Necrolemur had sharp teeth, which it probably used to bite through tough insect exoskeletons. Like modern tarsiers, it also possessed long fingers and toes, and a lengthy, balancing, tail. It was also characterised by a short face, a narrow gap between the eyes, a tubular ectotympanic and a relatively large brain.Fossil Primates from the University of Leeds ==References== ==External links== Necrolemur sp. skull * and Marc Godinot and Marian Dagosto: Astragalus of Necrolemur, Journal of Paleontology, Vol. 57, No. 6 (Nov. 1983), pp. 1321\u20131324 * Marian Dagosto: The distal tibia of primates with special reference to the omomyidae, International Journal of Primatology Vol. 6, No. 1 (Feb. 1985), pp. 45\u201375, ISSN 0164-0291, DOI 10.1007/BF02693696 * Alfred L.
