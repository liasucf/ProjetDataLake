    "text": "The Saint Andrew's Scots School (), also referred to as Saint Andrew's, is an Argentine bilingual school in Olivos, Vicente L\u00f3pez Partido, Buenos Aires Province. Established in 1838 in downtown Buenos Aires, it is the oldest school of British origin in South America. The school offers early childhood, primary and secondary education and has a university founded in 1988. The school's campus is located in San Fernando, Tigre Partido, inside the urban area known as Greater Buenos Aires. ==History== football team of the school of 1934 The school was established in Argentina on September 1, 1838, by a group of Scottish immigrants who wanted to educate their children in their native language, culture and religion. At the beginning only girls were admitted, although the school accepted boys soon after. The first location of the school was in Piedras 55, in downtown Buenos Aires. The institution was later moved to the neighbourhood of Constituci\u00f3n, where children from many nationalities attended. The chapel moved to the streets of Belgrano and Per\u00fa where it still remains. In 1882, Scotsman Alexander Watson Hutton (considered the father of Argentine football), arrived to Buenos Aires after being hired by St. Andrew's as headmaster. Hutton encouraged the teaching of sports at the school, which conflicted with the position of the authorities of not considering sports as important as he did. Due to his disagreeing with the policies of the establishment, Hutton resigned one year later. After leaving St. Andrew's, Hutton founded his own institution, the Buenos Aires English High School, where he applied his ideas on the teaching of sports in Argentina.\"Un poco de historia\" \u2013 St. Andrew's official siteHistoria del F\u00fatbol Amateur en la Argentina, by Jorge Iwanczuk.
