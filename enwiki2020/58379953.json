Pitchfork praised the album giving it a 7.7 out of 10, saying: \"the sisters wield enough magic to make Silk Canvas a success: a surefooted proclamation of sensuality, musicality, and sisterly love that can hold its own with the best of new-wave R&B.;\" The author also talked about the two singers saying: \"Their sensual, confident, and, at its smoky best, near- perfect R&B; is the clear work not only of years of practice, but a singular bond. They know how to play off one another. Ivana, with a deep, rounded voice that can cut across a song like a thunderclap, usually sings lead, while Jessica, whose lighter, scratchier voice recalls TLC\u2019s T-Boz, injects personality and flair. When they\u2019re in sync, they seamlessly share verses with a hairflip and a sultry smirk.\" ==Track listing== ==References== Category: 2018 albums ",
