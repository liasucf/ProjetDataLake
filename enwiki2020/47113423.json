She specializes in computational geometry and computer graphics, and is particularly known for her research in reconstructing surfaces from scattered data points... Amenta grew up in Pittsburgh, and majored in classical civilization at Yale University, graduating in 1979.Graduation date from Amenta's Ph.D. thesis, retrieved 2015-06-29. After working for over ten years as a computer programmer, she returned to graduate school, and earned her Ph.D. in 1994 from the University of California, Berkeley with a thesis on relations between Helly's theorem and generalized linear programming, supervised by Raimund Seidel. After postdoctoral study at The Geometry Center and Xerox PARC, she became a faculty member at the University of Texas at Austin, and moved to Davis in 2002. She became the Bucher Professor and department chair in 2013. Amenta was co-chair of the Symposium on Computational Geometry in 2006, with Otfried Cheong.Proceedings of the twenty-second annual symposium on Computational geometry, Association for Computing Machinery, retrieved 2015-06-29. ==References== ==External links== *Google scholar profile Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American women computer scientists Category:Yale College alumni Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:University of Texas at Austin faculty Category:University of California, Davis faculty Category:Researchers in geometric algorithms Category:Computer graphics researchers Category:Scientists at PARC (company) Category:American computer scientists Category:21st-century American women scientists Category:21st- century American scientists ",
