The inscription is unsigned and is classified as being carved in runestone style Pr4, which is also known as Urnes style. This runestone style is characterized by slim and stylized animals that are interwoven into tight patterns. The animal heads are typically seen in profile with slender almond-shaped eyes and upwardly curled appendages on the noses and the necks. Tolir is described as being a \"bryte,\" which is an old Swedish word for a thrall who worked as the thralls' foreman. The word \"bryte\" comes from \"to break,\" in the meaning of breaking bread, so \"bryte\" can be interpreted as the person who serves out food. Gylla was Tolir's wife. H\u00e5kon is believed to be the reigning king H\u00e5kan the Red, who is generally accepted as ruling during the 1070s. This would be consistent with the runic text, which using the word kunungi or kunungr, Old Norse for \"king.\" Because of this, the stone is known as H\u00e5kansstenen. ==Tranlisteration of runic text into Latin letters== :ra\u00fe| |\u00feu : runa\u0280 : ret : lit : rista : toli\u0280 : bry[t]i : i ro\u00fe : kunuki : toli\u0280 : a(u)k : gyla : litu : ris... ...- : \u00feaun : hion : efti\u0280 ...k : merki srni... haku(n) * (b)a\u00fe : ristaProject Samnordisk Runtextdatabas Svensk - Rundata entry for U 11. ==References== == See also == * Alsn\u00f6 hus ==External links== *U 11, Hovg\u00e5rden, Adels\u00f6 ==Additional images== File:Konungr.jpg|Detail showing the word kunungi or \"king.\" File:Uppland Rune Inscription 11 drawing.gif|Drawing of U 11.
