This gave Canada several power plays, but did not result in a goal. Nevertheless, the first goal of the match was scored by Shea Theodore for the Canadian team after getting a loose puck, which was the only goal of the period. Early in the second period, Finland earned a power play, which led to the game-tying goal from team captain Marko Anttila. In the third period, Anttila scored another goal for Finland to make it 2\u20131. With five minutes remaining, Harri Pesonen scored another goal for the Finnish team to make it a 3\u20131 lead, which stood until the end. Finland won the title for the third time ever, which was also their second win in Slovakia-the first being in 2011. ==References== ==External links== *Official website Final 2019 2019 IIHF World Championship Final ",
