Double Olympic champion Steve Williams, with whom Partridge won two world titles attended both the same school, and the same university, as did Rowley Douglas \u2013 cox of the British Rowing 8 at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. == International rowing career == Partridge first made his mark at senior level in 2001. Having won a silver medal in the four at the World U23 Championships with Christopher Martin, Henry Adams and Dan Ouseley, the crew met the standard to gain selection for the coxed four at the senior World Championships in Lucerne. Having reached the final, they proved to be particularly strong in the final 500 m, rowing through the field to snatch the bronze medal on the line. In 2002 and 2003 Alex raced in the Eight; the crew finished 6th at the World Championships, but stepped up in 2003 to win a bronze medal. In 2004, Partridge won the GB Rowing Senior Selection Trials in the pair with Andrew Triggs Hodge. This proved a headache for the selectors who had already shuffled the previous year's crews considerably, in the wake of Matthew Pinsent and James Cracknell's disappointing 4th place in the pair in Milan. Until the trials Pinsent and Cracknell had been training in a four with Steve Williams and Josh West, but following the unexpected trials result replaced West with Partridge. Hodge remained in the Eight. However, following the World Cup in Lucerne, Partridge was diagnosed with a collapsed lung and had to withdraw from the Athens Olympics; he was replaced in the coxless four by Ed Coode,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/jul/04/athensolympics2004.olympicgames and the crew went on to win the Olympic final beating the Canadian 4- by just 0.08 seconds. Patridge, however, was first across the line; the crew had named their boat after him. In 2005 Partridge returned to full fitness and regained his place in the men's four with Triggs Hodge, Pete Reed and Williams, winning gold in the World Cups at Eton, Munich and Lucerne and capping the season by taking gold in the World Championships in Japan. The 2006 World Cup brought further success with gold in all of the World Cup events in Munich, Pozna\u0144 and Lucerne and another World Championship victory in front of their home supporters at Dorney Lake, Eton. The 2007 season proved to be far more disappointing; the previously unbeaten four was hit by injury, and although the full line up raced at the World Championships, they finished 4th \u2013 in startling contrast to their dominance of the previous two years. In 2008, Partridge was replaced in the coxless four by quadruple Cambridge Blue Tom James. Instead Partridge spent the season in the Eight, winning a silver medal in the Olympic final in Beijing. He returned to the men's Four in 2009 and won gold at the World Championships in Pozna\u0144 on 29 August 2009 alongside Matt Langridge, Alex Gregory and Ric Egington. He was part of the British squad that topped the medal table at the 2011 World Rowing Championships in Bled, where he won a silver medal as part of the eight with Nathaniel Reilly-O'Donnell, Cameron Nichol, James Foad, Moe Sbihi, Greg Searle, Tom Ransley, Daniel Ritchie and Phelan Hill. At the 2012 London Summer Olympics, Partridge won bronze in the men's eight event. The race was very close, with Great Britain taking the lead at the 1000 m mark, but lost the lead to Germany and then ended up finishing in the bronze medal position due to a late charge by Canada. Partridge's bronze Olympic medal was stolen while in London at a night club in October 2012. ==Achievements== ===Olympics=== * 2008 Beijing \u2013 Silver, Eight (bow) * 2012 London \u2013 Bronze, Eight (bow) ===World Championships=== * 2011 Bled \u2013 Silver Eight (four) * 2010 Karapiro \u2013 4th Coxless Four * 2009 Pozna\u0144 \u2013 Gold, Coxless Four * 2007 Munich \u2013 4th, Coxless Four (three) * 2006 Eton \u2013 Gold, Coxless Four (three) * 2005 Gifu \u2013 Gold, Coxless Four (three) * 2003 Milan \u2013 Bronze, Eight (bow) * 2002 Seville \u2013 6th, Eight (bow) * 2001 Lucerne \u2013 Bronze, Coxed Four (three) ===World Cups=== * 2012 Munich \u2013 Bronze Eight (bow) * 2012 Lucerne \u2013 Silver Eight (bow) * 2012 Belgrade \u2013 Silver Eight (bow) * 2011 Lucerne \u2013 Silver Eight (bow) * 2011 Munich \u2013 Silver Eight (bow) * 2010 Lucerne \u2013 Gold Four (bow) * 2010Munich \u2013 Silver Four (bow) * 2009 Lucerne \u2013 Gold Four (bow) * 2009 Bled \u2013 Bronze Four (bow) * 2009 Bled \u2013 Gold Four (bow) * 2008 Pozna\u0144 \u2013 Gold, Eight (bow) * 2008 Lucerne \u2013 Bronze, Eight (bow) * 2008 Munich \u2013 Silver, Eight (bow) * 2007 Amsterdam \u2013 Gold, Eight (bow) * 2007 Linz \u2013 Gold, Coxless Four (three) * 2006 Lucerne \u2013 Gold, Coxless Four (three) * 2006 Pozna\u0144 \u2013 Gold, Coxless Four (three) * 2006 Munich \u2013 Gold, Coxless Four (three) * 2005 Lucerne \u2013 Gold, Coxless Four (three) * 2005 Munich \u2013 Gold, Coxless Four (three) * 2005 Eton \u2013 Gold, Coxless Four (three) * 2004 Lucerne \u2013 Bronze, Coxless Four (three) * 2004 Munich \u2013 5th, Coxless Four (three) * 2004 Pozna\u0144 \u2013 Gold, Coxless Four (three) * 2003 Munich \u2013 3rd, Eight (bow) * 2002 Munich \u2013 6th, Eight (three) * 2002 Lucerne \u2013 5th, Eight (three) * 2002 Hazewinkel \u2013 Gold, Eight (three) * 2001 Seville \u2013 7th, Coxless Four (three) ===World Under 23 Championships=== * 2001 Linz \u2013 Silver, Coxless Four ===World Junior Championships=== * 1999 Plovdiv Lake \u2013 Silver, Coxless Four * 1998 Linz \u2013 Bronze, Coxed Pair ==References == ==External links== * * * Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:British male rowers Category:Alumni of Oxford Brookes University Category:Rowers at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Rowers at the 2012 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic rowers of Great Britain Category:Olympic silver medallists for Great Britain Category:Olympic medalists in rowing Category:Olympic bronze medallists for Great Britain Category:Sportspeople from San Francisco Category:Medalists at the 2012 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Members of Leander Club Category:People educated at Monkton Combe School Category:American sportsmen Category:World Rowing Championships medalists for Great Britain ",
