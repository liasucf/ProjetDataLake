    "text": "Timothy Bradstreet (born February 16, 1967 in Cheverly, Maryland), is an American artist and illustrator, best known for his work on comic books, book covers, movie posters, roleplaying games and trading cards. ==Career== Bradstreet entered the comic book industry in 1990, working with Tim Truman on Dragon Chiang. Bradstreet\u2019s work on White Wolf Publishing\u2019s Vampire: The Masquerade garnered him much critical praise. This, in turn, led to the addition of many major comic book publishers to his clientele. He has since drawn for scores of comics-related projects including Dark Horse's Hard Looks and Another Chance to Get It Right (with author Andrew Vachss), Star Wars, Clive Barker\u2019s Age of Desire, Marvel's The Punisher and Blade, and Vertigo\u2019s Gangland, Unknown Soldier, Human Target, and Hellblazer. Detail from the cover to Hellblazer #214 (2005) by Bradstreet. Bradstreet's work has also extended to games of many types. His work on role-playing games has included GDW\u2019s Twilight 2000 and FASA\u2019s Shadowrun. He was involved in art design for the Activision's Vampire: Bloodlines video game. He illustrated cards in Last Unicorn Games' CCG Heresy: Kingdom Come. Bradstreet was awarded the 1996 International Horror Guild Award for Best Artist. He was also nominated for a 2005 IHG Award for his Hellblazer covers. Bradstreet has also been nominated for the 2002 Best Cover Artist Eisner Award for his Hellblazer covers. In 2000, he joined director Guillermo del Toro as a conceptual artist helping work on the visual design for the film Blade II. In 2003, Bradstreet worked on a number of movie posters for the Marvel/Lions Gate film, The Punisher as well as the cover for The Punisher: Countdown mini-comic that was packaged with the original DVD release. In 2006 Bradstreet provided artwork for a black and white stop motion animated scene set in Kuwait for the extended cut DVD. Bradstreet has also done posters for the films \u2013 Punisher: War Zone, Dark Country, Give 'Em Hell, Malone, and I Melt with You. He has done a poster for the TV Series The Expanse. Bradstreet was also the regular cover artist for two books, Marvel\u2019s The Punisher and Vertigo/DC\u2019s Hellblazer. He has created over 70 covers for both books in the past five years. In 2006, Bradstreet created the controversial album art for British heavy metal band Iron Maiden's album A Matter of Life and Death, which featured a mob of skeleton soldiers walking in front of a tank and features Eddie, the band's mascot at the top of the tank with a Thompson M1/M1A1 pointed up in the air. In 2016, he appeared on Brad Jones' Midnight Screenings to discuss the movie Why Him? ==Reception== In the May 1994 edition of Dragon (Issue #205), Rick Swan specifically mentioned Bradstreet's work in GURPS Vampire: The Masquerade, saying, \"The illustrations are among the best I\u2019ve ever seen in an RPG product, particularly those by Tim Bradstreet. His depiction of a vampire feasting on the wrist of a fellow burn-out (on page 22) evokes both the horrors of addiction and the intimacy of a shared secret. White Wolf, Steve Jackson, or Bradstreet himself ought to market it as a poster.\" ==Bibliography== ===Interiors=== *Dragon Chiang (1991) one-shot (inker) *Hawkworld (1993) #30\u201332 (inker) *Aliens: Music of the Spears (1994) #1\u20134 (inker) *Barb Wire: Ace of Spades (1996) #1\u20134 (inker) *Rune: Hearts of Darkness (1996) #1\u20133 (inker) *Evil Ernie: Destroyer (1997) #1\u20133 (inker) *John Constantine, Hellblazer (1999) #141 (penciller, inker) *Batman/Deathblow: After the Fire (2003) #1\u20133 (inker) *Bad Planet (2005\u20132008) #1\u20136 (inker) *Black Panther (2006) #16 (inker) *Clive Barker's Age of Desire (2009) OGN (penciller, inker) *Robert E.
