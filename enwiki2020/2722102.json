    "text": "That's Entertainment, Part II is a 1976 American compilation film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and a sequel to That's Entertainment! (1974).Variety film review; May 5, 1976, page 18. Like the previous film, That's Entertainment, Part II was a retrospective of famous films released by MGM from the 1930s to the 1950s. (Some posters for the film use Part 2 rather than Part II in the title.) For this second documentary, archivists featured more obscure musical numbers from MGM's vaults, and also featured tributes to some of the studio's best known comedy teams such as the Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy, romantic teams such as Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, and a montage of iconic stars such as Greta Garbo, Clark Gable, Mickey Rooney, John Barrymore, Wallace Beery, Joan Crawford, Jean Harlow, James Stewart and Lana Turner. Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire hosted the film and Kelly directed the introductory segments featuring him and Astaire, which included location footage of Kelly returning to Paris, the city featured in two of MGM's most famous productions, An American in Paris and Gigi. This was the last film Kelly directed. Several new musical numbers featured Astaire and Kelly, including a couple of routines in which they danced together for the first time since the 1946 film Ziegfeld Follies, and for only the second time in their careers. (It was the last time the 76-year-old Astaire danced in a film, though the veteran actor continued to make film and TV appearances until 1981; Kelly would last appear in the 1980 musical film Xanadu.) According to film historian Robert Osborne, in specially-filmed introductions produced for Turner Classic Movies, it was Astaire who suggested to Kelly that the two take advantage of this potentially last-in-a-lifetime opportunity to perform together, something Kelly actually wishes for out loud during his narration of the first That's Entertainment! film. The opening title sequence was designed by Saul Bass, and pays homage to the range and style of title sequences produced between the 1930s and early 1950s. The sequel received more critical acclaim, but was not as successful at the box-office as the first film. Some 18 years later it was followed by That's Entertainment! III, with Kelly once again appearing. ==Appearances== *Abbott & Costello *Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson *Louis Armstrong *Lew Ayres *John Barrymore *Lionel Barrymore *Wallace Beery *Robert Benchley *Constance Bennett *Jack Benny *Jack Buchanan *James Cagney *Sammy Cahn *Louis Calhern *Leslie Caron *Gower Champion *Marge Champion *Cyd Charisse *Maurice Chevalier *Ronald Colman *Jeanne Coyne *Joan Crawford *Bing Crosby *Dan Dailey *Doris Day *Fifi D'Orsay *Melvyn Douglas *Tom Drake *Marie Dressler *Margaret Dumont *Jimmy Durante *Nelson Eddy *Nanette Fabray *W.
