    "text": "In chromatography, endcapping refers to the replacement of accessible silanol groups in a bonded stationary phase by trimethylsilyl groups. End-capped columns have much lower residual silanol group activity compared to non- endcapped columns. Endcapping technology prevents the tailing of a polar compound's peak and shows very high durability even with an alkaline mobile phase because of the strong film covering the stationary phase surface. Endcapped columns show decreased retention for hydrogen bond acceptors, such as ionized bases, and increased retention for protonated bases. ==References== Category:Chromatography ",
