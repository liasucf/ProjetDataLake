He studied at Lund University and the University of Iceland. He has written numerous poems, stories, and novels. He has also translated several books into Icelandic, including Alice in Wonderland. In addition, he has produced a number of children's poetry books, seemingly somewhat inspired by the works of Dr. Seuss, with illustrations by his sister. His best-known work internationally is the novel Brotah\u00f6fu\u00f0 (\"The Blue Tower\"), which was nominated for an International Dublin Literary Award in 2001. Locally he is well known and respected for his short stories (most often offering humorous social satire), and his equally humorous and witty poetry, such as his \"Disney Rhymes\" (1974) - The Walt Disney Story presented as an epic tale in the r\u00edmur fashion. In 2008, the Icelandic publishing house Vaka-Helgafell, released the entire collection of his poetry which instantly became a best seller. He has five sons: \u00dalfur Eldj\u00e1rn, the comedian Ari Eldj\u00e1rn, Halld\u00f3r Eldj\u00e1rn of the band Sykur, \u00d3lafur Eldj\u00e1rn, and Kristj\u00e1n Eldj\u00e1rn (d. 2002). ==External links== *Iceland literature site on \u00de\u00f3rarinn *Sk\u00e1ld m\u00e1na\u00f0arins \"Poet of the Month\", at the Icelandic schools' site, Sk\u00f3lavefurin: short biography and some poems, with readings by the author. *Keflv\u00edkingasaga A satirical short story by \u00de\u00f3rarinn in which a real Viking arrives in present-day Iceland and tries to settle there.
