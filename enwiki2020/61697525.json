    "text": "Gitea is an open-source forge software package for hosting software development version control using Git as well as other collaborative features like bug tracking, wikis and code review. It supports self-hosting but also provides a free public first-party instance hosted on DiDi's cloud.https://gitea.com/ It is a fork of Gogs and is written in Go. Gitea can be hosted on all platforms supported by Go including Linux, macOS, and Windows. The project is funded on Open Collective. == History == Gitea was created by a group of users and contributors of the self-hosted Git service Gogs. Though Gogs was an open source project, its repository was under the sole control of a single maintainer, limiting the amount of input and speed with which the community could influence the development. Frustrated by this, the Gitea developers began Gitea as a fork of Gogs in November of 2016 and established a community-driven model for its development. It had its official 1.0 release the following month, December of 2016. == See also == * Source control * Distributed version control * Self hosting * Comparison of source code hosting facilities * Open-source software * GitHub * GitLab * Bitbucket == References == == External links == * * Official instance * Code Repository on GitHub Category:2016 software Category:Version control Category:Git (software) Category:Bug and issue tracking software Category:Free software programmed in Go Category:Project hosting websites Category:Project management software Category:Open-source software hosting facilities Category:Free project management software Category:Free and open-source software Category:Free software websites Category:Cross-platform free software Category:Software using the MIT license Category:Collaborative projects ",
