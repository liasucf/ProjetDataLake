The book was published by the Hoover Institution.http://www.hoover.org/profiles/lieutenant-colonel-joel-rayburn Chapter 5 of his book is frequently cited to support the assertion that the Faith Campaign of Saddam Hussein promoted Salafi ideology, and thus created a base for the rise in 2003 of the Islamic State of Iraq and the related insurgency.See, for example, DEAN SHUMATE, \"What's in a Name: a Strategic Analysis of the Islamic State\", in Small Wars Journal, April 12, 2016, and KYLE W. ORTON, \"Saddam Henchmen Were Fanatics Long Before They Joined the Islamic State\", in The Syrian Intifada, July 20, 2015. Chapter 6 of his book discusses the Kurdish nationalist movement and its purpose \"to annex the strategic city of Kirkuk\" and to reverse the demographic changes there which had been caused by the actions of the regime of Saddam Hussein.
