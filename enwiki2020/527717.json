    "text": "Imperial War Museum North (sometimes referred to as IWM North) is a museum in the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford in Greater Manchester, England. One of five branches of the Imperial War Museum, it explores the impact of modern conflicts on people and society. It is the first branch of the Imperial War Museum to be located in the north of England. The museum occupies a site overlooking the Manchester Ship Canal on Trafford Wharf Road, Trafford Park, an area which during the Second World War was a key industrial centre and consequently heavily bombed during the Manchester Blitz in 1940. Just across the Trafford Wharf Road from the Museum is the bulk of the Rank Hovis Flour Mill, a survivor from a former industrial age and now rather out of keeping with the surrounding architecture. The area is now home to the Lowry cultural centre and the MediaCityUK development, which stand opposite the museum at Salford Quays. The museum building was designed by architect Daniel Libeskind and opened in July 2002, receiving 470,000 visitors in its first year of opening. It was recognised with awards or prize nominations for its architecture and is a prime example of Deconstructivist architecture. The museum features a permanent exhibition of chronological and thematic displays, supported by hourly audiovisual presentations which are projected throughout the gallery space. The museum also hosts a programme of temporary exhibitions in a separate gallery. Since opening, the museum has operated a successful volunteer programme, which since January 2007 has been run in partnership with Manchester Museum. As part of a national museum, Imperial War Museum North is financed by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and by self-generated income. Admission is free. ==Planning and construction== The entrance During the 1990s, the Imperial War Museum sought to open a branch in the north of England. Seventy-one sites were offered for consideration by 36 local councils.Glancey, Jonathan (22 April 2002) The Guardian War and peace and quiet. Retrieved 14 April 2010 One such council was that of Hartlepool, in County Durham, for whom a new museum building was designed by architect Sir Norman Foster for a site on Hartlepool's dockside.Glancey, Jonathan (27 July 1994) The Independent Architecture: Renaissance in the North.

An architectural competition for the new museum was held in 1997, with the winning design being that of Berlin-based architect Daniel Libeskind. Born in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland, in 1946, Libeskind's family had suffered during the Second World War and dozens of his relatives were murdered in the Holocaust. It was his first building in the United Kingdom. At the museum's opening, Libeskind said that he sought to \"create a building ... which emotionally moved the soul of the visitor toward a sometimes unexpected realization\"'.Forrester, Jim (2004) Manchester Region History Review Vol. 17 No. 1 War & Conflict: New Perspectives in the North . (Manchester: Manchester Metropolitan University). Retrieved 14 March 2012. Libeskind envisaged a 'constellation composed of three interlocking shards' Libeskind, Daniel; Studio Daniel Libeskind Imperial War Museum North. Retrieved 7 October 2009. with each shard being a remnant of an imagined globe shattered by conflict. These shards in turn represented air, earth and water, and each formed a functionally distinct part of the museum. The 55 m high air shard, provides the museum's entranceway and a viewing balcony (now closed to the public) above the Manchester Ship Canal with views of the Manchester skyline. The construction of the tower leaves viewers exposed to the elements and one reviewer considered that it reflected \"the aerial perspective of modern warfare and the precariousness of the life below\". The earth shard houses the museum's exhibition spaces, while the water shard accommodates a cafe with views of the canal. Originally budgeted at \u00a340 million, the museum was eventually completed for \u00a328.5 million after anticipated National Lottery funding was not forthcoming. The museum was funded by local, national and European development agencies. The European Union's European Regional Development Fund contributed \u00a38.9 million, English Partnerships and the North West Development Agency \u00a32.7 million, and \u00a32.8 million was provided by Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council. Peel Holdings, a local transport and property company, contributed \u00a312.5 million; this was reportedly the largest single sum ever given to a UK cultural project by a private enterprise.Vallely, Paul (17 July 2002) The Independent It's grand up North. Retrieved 15 October 2009. The reduction in budget forced a number of changes; the substitution of metal for concrete in the construction of the shards, the removal of a planned auditorium, and a change of exhibition content. The site's external landscaping also had to be reduced; in 2009, following an architectural design competition managed by RIBA Competitions, Berlin-based company Topotek 1 were appointed to complete this landscaping.George, Sophie (12 June 2009) Architects' Journal First Look: Topotek 1 adds to Libeskind's Imperial War Museum North.

Construction of the museum, by structural engineers Arup and main contractor Sir Robert McAlpine, began on 5 January 2000 and the building was topped out in late September that year. Exhibition fitting started in November 2001, and the museum opened to the public on 5 July 2002, shortly before the 2002 Commonwealth Games which were hosted in Manchester that year. ==Exhibitions== Soviet T-34 tank on display in the museum's main exhibition space Permanent exhibitions are housed in the museum's first-floor main gallery space within the earth shard. These consist of a chronological display which runs around the gallery's perimeter and six thematic displays in \"silos\" within the space. As part of the earth shard, the 3,500 m2 floor of the gallery is curved, gradually dropping away like the curvature of the Earth from a nominal \"North Pole\" near the gallery's entrance.Architects' Journal (14 August 2003) Case study: A striking, sculptural landmark building on the waterfront....

In addition to the physical exhibits, the walls of the gallery space are used as screens for the projection of hourly audiovisual presentations called the Big Picture, which explore themes related to modern conflict. These presentations use up to 1,500 images from the Imperial War Museum's photograph archive and were originally projected from 60 synchronised slide projectors mounted throughout the space. In 2011 digital projectors were installed, allowing a greater degree of flexibility. The images are complemented by personal accounts from the museum's oral history sound archive. The Big Picture was devised after the reduction in the museum's budget forced the scrapping of the previous exhibition plan by designers DEGW and Amalgam.Architects' Journal (28 January 1999) Libeskind's war museum to go ahead \u2013 but at a cost..
