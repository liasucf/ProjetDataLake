The noble Reb\u00e9velier family appears in historic records during the 13th and 14th centuries. For most of its history, the village was owned by Bellelay Abbey under the Prince-Bishop of Basel. Until the Protestant Reformation of 1531, it was part of the parish of Sapran. However, Reb\u00e9velier remained Catholic when the surrounding communities converted. Reb\u00e9velier became part of the parish of Undervelier, while Les Cerniers joined the parish of Saulcy. After the 1797 French victory and the Treaty of Campo Formio, Reb\u00e9velier became part of the French D\u00e9partement of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the D\u00e9partement of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon's defeat and the Congress of Vienna, Reb\u00e9velier was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. By the end of the 19th century, most of the French- speaking Catholic residents had moved away and the village was now German speaking and Mennonite. In 1974-75, during the voting that led to the creation of the Canton of Jura, Reb\u00e9velier wished to remain part of the Canton of Bern.
