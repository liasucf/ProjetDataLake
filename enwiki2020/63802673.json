The township board met on February 23, 1893 and discussed the possibility of dividing Pleasant View into two Townships - Clearfield and Kingsley. There is no record of any action being taken. However, on July 9, 1894, it seemed to have been separated and Clearfield Township was in existence, so Kingsley Township must have been formed sometime after February 9, 1888Clearfield Township from the Griggs County Centennial Book digitized on the Griggs County Museum website ==Demographics== Its population during the 2010 census was 92.North Dakota 2010 Census ==Location within Griggs County== Kingsley Township is located in Township 146 Range 61 west of the Fifth principal meridian.Earth Point Tools for Google Earth {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\" |- || ! scope=\"col\" | Range 61 ! scope=\"col\" | Range 60 ! scope=\"col\" | Range 59 ! scope=\"col\" | Range 58 |- ! scope=\"col\" | Township 148 | Rosendal | Willow | Pilot Mound | Lenora |- ! scope=\"col\" | Township 147 | Bryan | Addie | Tyrol | Romness |- ! scope=\"col\" | Township 146 | style=\"background: yellow\"|Kingsley | Clearfield | Cooperstown | Washburn |- ! scope=\"col\" | Township 145 | Mabel | Helena | Ball Hill | Sverdrup |- ! scope=\"col\" | Township 144 | Dover | Bartley | Greenfield | Broadview |} ==References== :Category:Townships in Griggs County, North Dakota :Category:Townships in North Dakota :Category:Townships in Griggs County, North Dakota Category:Townships in Griggs County, North Dakota ",
