In his 1715 trial of residence Ustariz was accused of having supported Alejandro Garz\u00f3n's insubordination towards the Governor of Chilo\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00edn de Velasco in a round that derived in the 1712 Huilliche rebellion in Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago. Further Ustariz would have protected Garz\u00f3n after the latter fled from Calbuco. This done, Mar\u00edn was reconstituted as Royal Governor of Chilo\u00e9 in 1715. ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:1656 births Category:1718 deaths Category:Navarrese people Category:Royal Governors of Chile Category:Spanish generals Category:Knights of Santiago Category:Basque people ",
