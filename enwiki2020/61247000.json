It was conceptualized to hold auctions for high-priced real estate between a seller and a group of buyers. Local real estate agents receive 5-6 percent sales commission and Concierge Auctions charges 12 percent to buyers. Auctions range from $2 million to $40 million, but have an average of about $4 million. In 2012, Concierge Auctions signed NASCAR driver Joe Nemechek to sell his 139-acre horse ranch in North Carolina. The deal originally had the property go to auction with no minimum. In 2013, Concierge Auctions signed Michael Jordan as a client. Jordan hired the company to auction off his 56,000 square foot home in the Highland Park area of Chicago. The home had 9 bedrooms, 19 bathrooms, a beauty salon, indoor basketball court, gourmet kitchen, stocked fishing pond, and tennis court. The home was originally listed at $29 million. Jordan's business manager and spokesperson, Estee Portnoy, stated that Concierge Auctions \"gave great exposure to the property\".Michael Jordan's Home Heads to Auction Two days after the auction produced no bidder offering above the reserve price of $13 million, Jordan put his home back on the conventional real estate market in December 2013 asking for $16 million. As of May 2020, the home is on the market for $14,855,000, the digits of which total 23. In 2017, Concierge Auctions sold more than $340 million from 81 sales. Forbes reported that almost 90 percent of its auctions were conducted through a smart phone app that year. In 2018, the company sold $390 million in real estate from 96 separate sales. In January 2019, Concierge Auctions sold the most expensive home ever sold at an auction in the United States: an estate in Florida that sold for $42.5 million. In early 2019, the company signed with the estate of the late Wayne Huizenga for his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. == Controversies and criticism == Prior to 2013, the North Carolina Auctioneer License Board issued a warning to Concierge Auctions for false and misleading advertising. In 2013, Grand Estates Auction, which is a competitor of Concierge Auctions, sued the company along with several past Concierge Auctions clients in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for $23 million per claim, alleging multiple claims of false advertising, deceptive trade practices, tortious interference, mail fraud, wire fraud and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Practices Act (RICO Act). However, Concierge Auctions had already sued Grand Estates Auction before that, with allegations that Grand Estates created fake email accounts to publish \u201cfalse and defamatory\u201d stories about Concierge Auctions online. The case was dismissed in 2014. Since 2014, Concierge Auctions has been accused of artificially inflating the price of homes, allegedly by using fake bidders. In 2017, a home seller in the country of Fiji put his home up for auction with Concierge Auctions. In a federal court in California, two real estate investors who came to the auction as buyers sued the company for allegedly \u201cimproperly [keeping] their $285,000 deposit after the seller reneged.\u201d The two plaintiffs alleged that Concierge Auctions used fake buyers to drive up the price of the home. One of the company\u2019s African-American real estate agents sued the company, alleging discriminatory practices that resulted in her losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in commissions. A complaint was filed in the Houston Division of the Southern District of Texas in September 2017. Approximately 30 percent of houses that go on auction at Concierge Auctions result in no sale being made. Sometimes auctions also result in sales that are lower than what the seller wanted. ==References== Category:Companies based in Texas Category:Real estate companies of the United States Category:American auction houses ",
