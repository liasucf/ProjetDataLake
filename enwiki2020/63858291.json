The Baltic Sea with the Kembs Beach is about 2 km to the north. == History == The name Kembs has its origin in the Old Polabian word Kapica which means hill in the swamp, island,Michael M\u00fcller-Wille, Dietrich Meier, Henning Unverhau Slawen und Deutsche im s\u00fcdlichen Ostseeraum vom 11. bis zum 16. Jahrhundert, Neum\u00fcnster 1995 Seite 202 but the area around Kembs was already settled before the Slavs. Finds from the Globular Amphora culture on the Saaltzer Kamp proved a colonization around 3.500 bis 2.800 a. Chr. n... Finds from the urn field at Kembs by R. Klinkhamer prove a settlement in the Bronze Age.Universit\u00e4t Kiel Schriften der Universitat zu Kiel, Band 25, 1878, Seite 84 The place was occupied by the Warini until the 3rd-century who left their homeland during the Migration Period. Slavs (West Slavs) from the area north east of the Carpathian Mountains between upper Vistula, middle Dnieper and Desna River followed the and the place was named Kapica. As from the 8th- century until 12th-century Kembs or Kapica as it was called these days belonged to the settlement area of the Obotrites, more exact to the tribe called Wagri with their administrative seat in Starigard. Six Pit-houses and a grave of a Slavic girl had been found in Kembs.Dietrich Meier, Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur Mainz Between the 12th-century and the 13th- century the village became owned by a family called Schorlemer who fought side by side with the Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein during the German eastward expansion. The Knight Ludolf Scorlemer appears in the first written reference of the village Kembs on 12 May 1267 during an area swap where Gerhard I, Count of Holstein-Itzehoe exchanged his village Sulsdorf (Zoldestorpe) with 10 yards against the village of villa Kempiz (as Kembs was called these days) which belonged to the St.-Johannis-Monastery, L\u00fcbeck. .Schleswig-Holsteinische Regesten und Urkunden Band 1 (1250 \u2014 1300) Seite 285 As of 1267 the village owned by the Counts of Holstein. On the 28. October 1304 the widow of Henry I, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg, the countess Heilwig (1265\u20131324) with her children's Gerhard III, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg and Giselbert sold the villa Kempetze called village to the St.-Johannis-Monastery in L\u00fcbeck.Urkundenbuch der Stadt L\u00fcbeck: 1139\u20131470, Band 2 Seite 159 As from this date Kembs belonged under private but also under sovereign law to the St.-Johannis-Monastery which was under Imperial immediacy. The Ducatus Holsatiae Nova Tabula made by Henricus Hondius II shows Kembs 1630 as Tems. Ducatus Holsatiae Nova Tabula 1645 In 1789, Kembs was drawn as Kems on the Varendorf Map. In the course of a comparison between Denmark-Holstein and L\u00fcbeck at the beginning of 1802 and the end of the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss Kembs became part of the prussian Duchy of Holstein.Findbuch des Stadtarchivs L\u00fcbeck, Bestand 05.2-02 Johannis Jungfrauenkloster and was especially managed as a so-called L\u00fcbsches Stadtstiftsdorf. Taxes and levies were administered by the Cismar office, military affairs by the Oldenburg property district and goodwill and police business by commissioned notaries. Peasant bailiffs (Bauernv\u00f6gte) took over the internal administration and the external representation of the village. After the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 Kembs became part of the newly founded Prussian Province of Schleswig-Holstein in 1867. Kembs became a Prussian rural community (Landgemeinde) and belonged to district Putlos until 1937. It belonged to the parish Heiligenhafen.M\u00f6ller, Kr\u00f6ger: Ortschafts-Verzeichniss f\u00fcr Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel 1873 Seite 78 Kembs is part of the municipality Gremersdorf since 1. April 1937.
