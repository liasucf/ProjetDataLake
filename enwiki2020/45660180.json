Two-thirds of the Senate and all members of the Chamber of Deputies were up for election. The second round of the parliamentary elections that has been suspended in 2015 should take place in October 2016, along with the first round for a third of the Senate and the first round of the whole new presidential election. According to international observers, early rounds of voting have experienced significant fraud, including people voting more than once due to failure of indelible ink, vote buying due to lack of secrecy, poor training of election workers, poor tracking of political parties, and other problems. This has resulted in the nullification of some results and scheduling of re-runs. The United States has withdrawn funding for the October 2016 round, though it financially supported previous rounds and observation by the Organization of American States. ==Electoral system== The 99 members of the Chamber of Deputies are elected in single-member constituencies using the two-round system; a second round will be held if no candidate wins a majority of the vote in the first round.Electoral system IPU The second round will be held together with local elections and the first round of the presidential election. In March 2015 a new electoral decree stated that the new Chamber of Deputies have 118 members, and the Senate will retain the 30 members. On 13 March, President Martelly issued a decree that split the Cerca La Source in two constituencies, and therefore increasing the number of deputies up to 119. One-third of the 30-member Senate is elected every two years, also using the two-round system.Electoral system IPU However, the previous scheduled Senate elections in May 2012 were not held, meaning two-thirds of the seats are due for elections in 2015. The Haitian election calendar were made as follows: {|class=wikitable !Date !Election |- |9 August 2015 |First round of parliamentary election (cancelled in 22 constituencies) First round of Senate two-thirds election |- |25 October 2015 |Second round of parliamentary election (constituencies that hadn't cancelled the 9 August election) First round of parliamentary election (22 constituencies that cancelled the 9 August election) Second round of Senate two-thirds election |- |24 April 2016 (cancelled) |rowspan=\"3\"| Second round of presidential election Second round of parliamentary election (22 constituencies that cancelled the 9 August election and 2 that will have to repeat the October second round) First round of Senate one-third election |- |9 October 2016 (postponed due to Hurricane Matthew) |- |20 November 2016 |} ==Campaign== A total of 2,037 candidates registered to contest the elections, representing 98 different political parties.
