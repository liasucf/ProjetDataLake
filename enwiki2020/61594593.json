Monkeys that had been inoculated intratracheally with the virus developed diffuse varicella 10 to 12 days later. Monkeys that were caged with each of the intratracheally infected monkeys developed a mild rash two weeks later, hence providing evidence of airborne transmission. == References == == External links == * Category:Varicelloviruses ",
