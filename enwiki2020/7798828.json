    "text": "Bruce's Fist of Vengeance is a 1980 Bruceploitation martial arts movie from the Philippines starring notorious Bruce Lee imitator Bruce Le. ==Reception== The film has received generally negative reviews. It currently holds a 4.0 out of 10 on IMDb. Mark Pollard of KungFuCinema.com gives the film zero stars out of five and said: \"Craptastic doesn't begin to describe just how bad Bruce's Fist of Vengeance really is. Congratulations if you're reading this, because you just found a review for one of the worst kung fu movies ever filmed\" Thevideovacuum gave the film 2 stars out of 4 and said: \"No matter how many things this flick had going for it, I still had one major beef: The fight scenes. Yeah, Jack had a couple nifty comical fights early on, but the more serious battles later in the film are either sped up way too fast or filmed in the slowest slow motion in history. In one scene Bruce Le will be running around like The Monkees karate chopping people, then the next, he\u2019ll be in such Super Slow Mo that it looks like he\u2019s hardly even moving. The fast motion scenes are particularly idiotic because they occur in the section of the film when Bruce is trying to avenge his friend\u2019s death. Nothing and I mean nothing ruins the mood of a good old fashioned vendetta than silly looking fast motion that makes you look like Benny Hill.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:1980 films Category:1980 martial arts films Category:Kung fu films Category:Philippine films Category:Philippine martial arts films Category:Philippine kung fu films Category:Arnis films Category:Bruceploitation films ",
