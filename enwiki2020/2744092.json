    "text": "Hermit Island is an island nearly long, lying southeast of Bonaparte Point, off the southwest coast of Anvers Island in the Palmer Archipelago. So named by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-names Committee (UK-APC) in 1958 because a member of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) at the Arthur Harbor station spent some time on this island alone in January 1957, making survey observations. ==See also== * Composite Antarctic Gazetteer * List of Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands * List of Antarctic islands south of 60\u00b0 S * SCAR * Territorial claims in Antarctica ==References== ==External links== Category:Islands of the Palmer Archipelago ",
