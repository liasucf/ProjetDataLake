On March 2, 2010, they welcomed their first child, a son. They wed on May 21, 2011 and renewed their vows in September 2011 in Hawaii. \"My husband wanted me to have my dream wedding so he flew all of our family members here.

Her voice has been described as having a \"flexible range of R&B;, the muscular punch of soul and the hard character of hip hop\" and contains a \"smoky flavor, and a husky texture.\" Cole's musical themes and lyrics touch upon the topics of empowerment, reflection, heartache and love. Coles fifth studio album \"Woman to Woman\" (2012) was described by Ben Ratliff of The New York Times as a R&B; almanac of shaky romance, with nearly every song a first-person narrative with gnarled details, endlessly recombining data about suspicion, jealousy, pride, punishment, self-respect, the led-up, the aftermath.\" The album's lyrics revolved around \"emotionally painful romantic issues.\" ===Influences=== Cole grew up listening to her mentor Tupac Shakur. Cole cites Mary J. Blige as one of her greatest musical inspirations, along with R&B; singers Faith Evans, Toni Braxton, Monica and Brandy. In an interview, Cole spoke about artists from the 1980s that influenced her. \"Anita Baker, her voice is incredible and her lyrics are deep. Really listen to them. [...] Big Daddy Kane, the original...you can't think Brooklyn or door knockers and not think Big Daddy Kane, smooth operator: one of hip-hop's pioneers. LL Cool J, one of the first MC's to really dissect lyrics and turn them inside out; and he made it sexy! MC Lyte, the female MC that rhymes in such a way that you don't care if she was male or female...her voice tone is crazy, and her lyrical game bananas. Queen Latifah, she represented the strong female MC, she showed us and taught us about flow and lyrical dexterity. Kid 'n Play, they showed you how to take your rap game to the next level...movies!\" == Controversy == A feud between Cole and R&B; singer Lil' Mo began in August 2005 via the radio series Star and Buc Wild Morning Show. Mo was reported to have dismissed the vocal talent of a new crop of R&B; performers, saying that they relied on dancing. Cole took offense and went to Dream Hotel in New York City, where she encountered Lil' Mo's manager Phil Thornton and a stylist, allegedly stating \"You all are traitors. [Lil' Mo] is the enemy.\". Lil' Mo shrugged off the incident, saying she was told that Cole was intoxicated at the time, which Cole denied. In March 2013, Cole was criticized by urban media outlets for her Twitter critique of Beyonc\u00e9's \"Bow Down/I Been On\". This led to Mo and Cole exchanging hostile tweets over the next few days. Despite the exchanges, in May 2013, Mo said there was no beef between her and Cole, which led to the two exchanging hostile messages again via Instagram and Twitter. ==Discography== * The Way It Is (2005) * Just Like You (2007) * A Different Me (2008) * Calling All Hearts (2010) * Woman to Woman (2012) * Point of No Return (2014) * 11:11 Reset (2017) * TBA (2021) ==Tours== Headlining * A Different Me Tour (2009) * Woman to Woman Tour (2013) * Point of No Return Tour (2014) Supporting * Sweatsuit Tour (supporting Nelly) (2005) * Touch the Sky Tour (supporting Kanye West) (2005) * Double Up Tour (supporting R.
