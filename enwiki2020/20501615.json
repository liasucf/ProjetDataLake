Stanley Sadie, (2001) vol. 13 p. 458 This was caused because Anton Bruckner copied the instrumentation and form (but not the harmony) of K\u00e9ler's Mazzuchelli-Marsch (also called Apollo-Marsch) exactly for his own March in E-flat major.Preface to Band XII/8 of the Complete Works of Anton Bruckner by R\u00fcdiger Bornh\u00f6ft translated by Eugene Hartzell (1996) Vienna: Musikwissenschaflticher Verlag, unnumbered right page before score.
