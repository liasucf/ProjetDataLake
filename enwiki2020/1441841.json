    "text": "The Royal Albert Dock is one of three docks in the Royal Group of Docks of East London in the United Kingdom, now undergoing major redevelopment. ==History== Map showing the Royal Albert Dock, 1908 The dock in 1955 The dock, which was designed by Sir Alexander Rendel as an extension to the Victoria Dock, was constructed by Lucas and Aird and completed in 1880. Two dry docks and machine shops were established to the south at the western end for ship repairs by R & H Green & Silley Weir (later River Thames Shiprepairs Ltd). From the 1960s onwards, the Royal Albert Dock experienced a steady decline \u2013 as did all of London's other docks \u2013 as the shipping industry adopted containerisation, which effectively moved traffic downstream to Tilbury. It finally closed to commercial traffic along with the other Royal Docks in 1981. The dock viewed from the west in 1973. Redevelopment in the late 20th century included the construction of London City Airport which was built on the south bank of the dock with a single runway and completed in 1987. At the eastern end of the north bank the University of East London Docklands Campus opened in 1999. Redevelopment also included the London Regatta Centre which was built at the western end of the north bank and opened in 2000. In the early 20th century 'Building 1000' was built on the north bank of the dock at a cost of \u00a370 million and was completed in 2004. In May 2013, the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, announced a development of the Royal Albert Dock which would be worth \u00a36 billion to the capital\u2019s economy and would create over 20,000 jobs. With CITIC Construction assigned as main contractor, and Multiplex assigned as principal sub-contractor, construction officially began on June 2017. Phase 1 of the project was completed in the first quarter of 2018, consisting of 21 buildings with 460,000 sq ft of office space and 140,000 sq ft of retail and public realm. Phase 2 is expected to begin late 2020, which will consist of further office and retail spaces, along with residential units and membership clubs. ==Gallery== File:0809-SK-ABP-RAD-Hi-022.jpg|View from the riverside File:RAD view from waterside.jpg|A brand new waterside development and dynamic commercial district File:0809-SK-ABP-RAD-Hi-069.jpg|RAD London Altitude Lobby File:RAD London Singlo Square.jpg|RAD London Singlo Square File:RAD London \u2013 Dauphin Square 1.jpg|RAD London \u2013 Dauphin Square File:0809-SK-ABP-RAD- Hi-032.jpg|View from the riverside File:0809-SK-ABP-RAD-Hi-014.jpg|View from the riverside File:0809-SK-ABP-RAD-Hi-029.jpg File:0809-SK-ABP-RAD-Hi-078 edited.jpg File:RAD entrance from Beckton Park DLR.jpg|Entrance to the dock from Beckton Park DLR station File:0809-SK-ABP-RAD-Hi-155.jpg File:0809-SK- ABP-RAD-Hi-141.jpg File:0809-SK-ABP-RAD-Hi-142.jpg File:0809-SK-ABP-RAD- Hi-139.jpg File:Newham Dockside building (geograph 4037925).jpg|Building 1000 ==See also== * Albert Dock Seamen's Hospital ==References== Category:Transport infrastructure completed in 1880 Category:Infrastructure in London Category:Buildings and structures in the London Borough of Newham Category:Geography of the London Borough of Newham Category:London docks Category:Port of London ",
