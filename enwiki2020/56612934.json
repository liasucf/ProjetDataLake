The event brings to light notable Africans that have genuinely excelled in various spheres of life, hence contributing to the advancement of Africa from the diaspora. The Africa-Italy Excellence Awards is organized and powered by Divino Friends Organization. == Award Scheme == Africa-Italy Excellence Awards (AIEA) was initially founded as Ghana-Italy Excellence Awards in 2008 of which the maiden event was organized in 2011 in Brescia, Italy. The maiden event was preceded by a similar event of such nature by the then Ghana Ambassador to Italy, H.E. Agyei Amoama, in 2007, after which it took on the brand name, \"Ghana-Italy Excellence Awards\", prior to the event in 2011. In the third occasion of the event in 2013, the award was re-branded to \"Africa-Italy Excellence Awards\" (AIEA) in order to extended the celebratory honour to other deserving African as well. The Africa-Italy Excellence Awards (AIEA) was officially endorsed in November 2013 by the European Parliament signed by President Martin Schulz, Roma Capitale, Brescia Municipality and UNAR, National Office Against Racial Discrimination of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. It has also been endorsed by His Excellency Mamadou Kamara D\u00e8kamo, Dean of the African Diplomatic Corps in Italy. The award does not only celebrates diversity and multiculturalism and the achievements of the contemporary and historical African-Diaspora communities in Italy and Europe but also pays tribute to the success of Africans across all walks of life: emphasizing achievement and highlighting inspirational role models in the fields of: Humanitarian, Arts and Culture, Business, Sports and Entertainment. The AIEA seeks to address a broad spectrum of issues affecting the modern African. == How the Award Scheme Operates == Each year, a committee responsible for reviewing the candidates for the AIEA is established and nomination of awardees are called for about 12 month prior to AIEA ceremony. The nominations are accepted based on an internal vetting process. The AIEA committee considers the activities of prospective nominees 12 months from date of nomination acceptance which makes up the first evaluation. A ballot by the committee is cast after which, the profile of qualified nominees are made public and also reviewed by an established Legal Affairs Committee composed of renowned experts in the fields of: Immigration, Economics and Social work. The Legal committee holds 55% of the votes and 45% is left with the general public. == Winners of the AIEA == Here are some of the winners of this great initiative *H.E.
