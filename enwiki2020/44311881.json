    "text": "''''' is an apostolic constitution in the form of a papal bull promulgated by Pope Innocent X in 1653 which condemned five propositions said to have been found in Cornelius Jansen's Augustinus as heretical. The five errors of Jansen on Grace condemned in ' are: #\"Some of God's commandments are impossible to just men who wish and strive to keep them, considering the powers they actually have; the grace by which these precepts may become possible is also wanting to them.\" #\"In the state of fallen nature no one ever resists interior grace.\" #\"In order to merit or demerit, in the state of fallen nature, we must be free from all external constraint, but not from interior necessity.\" #\"The Semi-Pelagians admitted the necessity of interior preventing grace for all acts, even for the beginning of faith; but they fell into heresy in pretending that this grace is such that man may either follow or resist it.\" #\"It is Semi-Pelagian to say that Christ died or shed His blood for all men.\" Bernard Otten explained, in A manual of the history of dogmas, that the first four of these propositions are absolutely condemned as heretical; while the fifth is condemned as heretical when taken in the sense that Christ died only for the predestined. ==See also== *Formulary controversy *Ad sanctam beati Petri sedem \u2013 Defined the signification of propositions said to have been found in Augustinus *Regiminis Apostolici \u2013 Defined the Formula of Submission for the Jansenists ==Notes== ==Citations== ==References== * * Category:Apostolic constitutions Category:Documents of Pope Innocent X Category:Jansenism Category:1653 works Category:17th-century papal bulls Category:Religion in the Ancien R\u00e9gime Category:1653 in Christianity ",
