    "text": "\"Salva Mea\" (faux Latin for \"save me\") is a song recorded by British dance group Faithless. It was released in 1995 as the group's first single and became a hit on the Dance Charts, and then, following its re-release in 1996, #9 in the UK. The album version is more than ten minutes long and contains Maxi Jazz's distinctive rapping. The female vocals on all versions are by Dido (Faithless founding member Rollo is her brother). There is also a Way Out West remix which can be found on Reverence / Irreverence set and in 2015 to mark 20 Years of Faithless. British based DJ and production trio Above and Beyond left their mark on this track and gave it a massive boost for the clubs. The song topped the U.S. Hot Dance Club Play chart twice\u2014during its first chart run in 1996 and again in 1997 when the track was remixed and reissued. Part of the song is sampled in the Enrique Iglesias song \"Dirty Dancer\". == Music video == The music video of \"Salva Mea\" was directed by Lindy Heymann. ==Track listing== ===UK CD 1995=== # Salva Mea (Radio Version) - 04:11 # Salva Mea (Epic Mix) - 11:51 # Salva Mea (Tuff Mix) - 09:37 # Salva Mea (Sister Bliss Remix) - 08:43 ===US CD 1996=== # Salva Mea (Radio Version) - 04:08 # Salva Mea (Epic Radio Version) - 04:51 # Salva Mea (Epic Mix) - 11:48 # Salva Mea (Tuff Mix) - 09:35 # Salva Mea (Sister Bliss Remix) - 08:40 ===Australian CD 1996=== # Salva Mea (Tuff Edit) - 04:02 # Salva Mea (Epic Edit) - 04:51 # Salva Mea (Radio Version) - 04:08 # Salva Mea (Epic Mix) - 11:50 # Salva Mea (Tuff Mix) - 09:33 # Salva Mea (Sister Bliss Remix) - 08:42 # Salva Mea (Floating Mix) - 08:11 ===UK CD 1 - 1997=== # Salva Mea (Radio Edit) - 04:36 # Salva Mea (Epic Mix) - 11:51 # Salva Mea (Way Out West Remix) - 07:48 # Salva Mea (Slow Version) - 04:10 # Salva Mea (Floating Mix) - 08:12 ===UK CD 2 - 1997=== # Salva Mea (Radio Edit) - 04:36 # Salva Mea (Epic Mix) - 11:51 # Salva Mea (Sister Bliss Mix) - 08:43 # Salva Mea (DJ Quicksilver Remix) - 06:52 # Salva Mea (Tuff Mix) - 07:57 ===German CD 1996=== # Salva Mea (Radio Edit) - 03:47 # Salva Mea (C.E.C.
