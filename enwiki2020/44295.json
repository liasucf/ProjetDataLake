    "text": "The Vltava ( ,\"Vltava\" (US) and ; ) is the longest river within the Czech Republic, running southeast along the Bohemian Forest and then north across Bohemia, through \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov, \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice and Prague, and finally merging with the Elbe at M\u011bln\u00edk. It is commonly referred to as the \"Czech national river\". Both the Czech name ' and the German name ' are believed to originate from the old Germanic words ' (\"wild water\"; compare Latin '). In the ' (872 AD) it is called '; from 1113 AD it is attested as '. In the ' (1125 AD) it is attested for the first time in its Bohemian form, '. ==Course== Vltava from Bohnice viewing point The Vltava river is long and drains an area in size, over half of Bohemia and about a third of the Czech Republic's entire territory. As it runs through Prague, the river is crossed by 18 bridges (including the Charles Bridge) and covers within the city.Source : Avantgarde Prague The water from the river was used for drinking until 1912, when the Vinohrady Water Tower ceased pumping operations.Water Tower of Vinohrady, stovezata.praha.eu, retrieved 14 November 2013 It is, however, the source of drinking water in case of failures of or repairs to the water supply from the \u017delivka and K\u00e1ran\u00e9 sources. The Podol\u00ed water processing plant is on standby for such cases with the long section of the river upstream of the Podol\u00ed plant under the stricter, second degree of pollution prevention regulations. The height difference from source to mouth is about and the largest stream at the source is named \u010cern\u00fd Potok (Black Brook) or Tepl\u00e1 Vltava (Warm Vltava). The Vltava itself originates by a confluence of two streams, the Warm Vltava ('), which is longer, and the Cold Vltava (Studen\u00e1 Vltava), sourcing in Bavaria. Along its course, Vltava receives many tributaries, the biggest being Otava and Berounka from the left and Lu\u017enice and S\u00e1zava from the right side. ==Navigation== \"N\u00e1plavka Sm\u00edchov\" ferry dock in Prague Between the confluence with the Elbe at M\u011bln\u00edk and Prague, the river is navigable by vessels of up to displacement. Most of the river upstream of Prague as far as \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice is currently navigable by craft of up to displacement, but such vessels cannot pass the dams at Orl\u00edk and Slapy, and are also restricted by a low bridge at T\u00fdn nad Vltavou. Work is planned to complete boat lifts, planned for but never completed, at the two dams, and to rebuild the bridge, in order for them to navigate throughout. Much smaller craft, of up to displacement and under beam and air draft, can avoid these obstacles. Upstream of \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice, the river's section around \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov (specifically from Vy\u0161\u0161\u00ed Brod to Bor\u0161ov nad Vltavou) is a very popular destination for water tourism.Along the River Branna Nove Spoli - vltava- river.comAmerican in Prague (2018 webpage) ==Dams== Historic Centre of \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov near Vltava river Nine hydroelectric dams have been built on the Vltava south of Prague to regulate the water flow and generate hydroelectric power, starting in the 1950s. Beginning at the headwaters, these are: Lipno, Lipno II, Hn\u011bvkovice, Ko\u0159ensko, Orl\u00edk, Kam\u00fdk, Slapy, \u0160t\u011bchovice and Vran\u00e9. The Orl\u00edk dam supports the largest reservoir on the Vltava by volume, while the Lipno dam retains the largest reservoir by area. The \u0160t\u011bchovice Reservoir is built over the site of the St John's Rapids. The river also features numerous weirs that help mitigate its flow from in elevation at its source near the German border to at its mouth in M\u011bln\u00edk. ==Floods== The Vltava basin has flooded multiple times throughout recorded history. Markers have been created along the banks denoting the water line for notable floods in 1784, 1845, 1890, 1940, and the highest of all in 2002. In August of that year, the basin was heavily affected by the 2002 European floods when the flooded river killed several people and caused massive damage and disruption along its length, including in Prague. It left the oldest bridge in Prague, Charles Bridge, seriously weakened, requiring years of work to repair. Prague was again flooded in 2013. Many locations within the Vltava and Elbe basins were left under water, including the Prague Zoo, but metal barriers were erected along the banks of the Vltava to help protect the historic city centre. ==References in culture and science== One of the best-known works of classical music by a Czech composer is Bed\u0159ich Smetana's Vltava, sometimes called The Moldau in English. It is from the Romantic era of classical music and is a musical description of the river's course through Bohemia (listen). A minor planet 2123 Vltava discovered in 1973 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh is named after the river. Smetana's symphonic poem also inspired a song of the same name by Bertolt Brecht. An English version of it, by John Willett, features the lyrics Deep down in the Moldau the pebbles are shifting / In Prague three dead emperors moulder away. ==See also== * Moldavite ==References== ==External links == * Category:Rivers of the Central Bohemian Region Category:Rivers of the South Bohemian Region Category:Geography of Prague ",
