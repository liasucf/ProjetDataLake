He is the nephew of Boann, goddess of the river Boyne, and son of Idath of the men of Connaught and B\u00e9binn (sister of Boann of the sidhe), and is renowned for his handsomeness and exploits.T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Fra\u00edch.

He belongs to the Fir Domnann. ==Irish mythology== ===The Cattle-Raid of Fr\u00e1ech=== In \"The Cattle-Raid of Fr\u00e1ech\" Fr\u00e1ech travels to the court of Ailill and Medb in pursuit of their daughter Findabair, after it becomes known that she is in love with him. Findabair falls in love with Fr\u00e1ech because of the great stories being told about him, Fr\u00e1ech's household convince him to visit his maternal aunt Boand to obtain wondrous gifts from her. Boand gives Fr\u00e1ech fifty intricately worked mantles and tunics with animal details, fifty jeweled spears that lit the night like the sun, fifty dark horses with gold bells, fifty swords with golden hilts, seven hounds in silver chains, seven trumpeters, three jesters, and three harpists. Fr\u00e1ech is warmly welcomed into Ailill and Medb's home, where he and his company are entertained feasted for a fortnight. After biding his time Fr\u00e1ech follows Findabair and her maid to the river while they are bathing one night, and Fr\u00e1ech explains his true purpose in coming to Cruachan - to elope with Findabair. Findabair says that she cannot elope, that being below her station, but she is happy Fr\u00e1ech has come to marry her and gives him a gold ring that her mother Medb gave her. Fr\u00e1ech goes to Ailill and Medb to ask for Findabair's hand in marriage, and they request in compensation an exorbitant bride-price consisting of sixty horses with gold bits, twelve white cattle with red ears with twelve calves, and Fr\u00e1ech support in the Cattle raid of Cooley. Fr\u00e1ech refuses the dowry, saying he would not give it for Medb herself. Ailill and Medb fear that Fr\u00e1ech will elope with Findabair so they plot to murder him in such a way that they cannot be blamed. They tell Fr\u00e1ech that he has a reputation as a good swimmer and take him to a river where they will watch him bathe. When Fr\u00e1ech removes his clothes and enters the water, Ailill opens Fr\u00e1ech's purse and finds Findabair's ring; Ailill throws the ring into the water, and Fr\u00e1ech watches as a salmon leaps from the water to swallow it. Fr\u00e1ech catches the fish and brings it to shore, at which point Medb asks him to stay in the water and retrieve a branch of beautiful rowan berries on the other side of the river.Matson, Gienna: Celtic Mythology A to Z, page 56. Chelsea House, 2004. ). Fr\u00e1ech retrieves a branch of the rowan tree, so Medb asks for another branch, and when Fr\u00e1ech returns to the water he is attacked by a water monster (sometimes referred to as a dragon or serpent). Fr\u00e1ech begs for his sword from the company, but none of Ailill's men dare to help him, so Findabair strips off her clothes and dives into the water with Fr\u00e1ech's sword. Ailill attempts to spear his own daughter, but Fr\u00e1ech catches the spear and throws it back at Ailill. Findabair gives Fr\u00e1ech his sword and he beheads the water serpent but is badly wounded. Ailill and Medb take him back to their palace and prepare a bath for Fr\u00e1ech from bacon and the fresh meat of a heifer; they then place him in a bed to die, but a hundred and fifty maidens of the Sidhe, all dressed in green, hear the lamentations for Fr\u00e1ech and carry him off to the burial caverns of Cruachan. To the astonishment of all, the following morning Fr\u00e1ech returns to the court of Medb and Ailill without a single blemish, and the two companies make peace. In secret, Fr\u00e1ech immediately tells his servant to retrieve the salmon that he left on the shore the previous day, to cook it for Findabair and to remove the ring from its belly. The two parties then proceed to feast and become drunk, and Ailill demands that all of his jewells be displayed before the court. He asks Findabair what became of the ring he gave her and tells her that if it is not found, he will put her to death, but if she can produce it, she may choose her own husband. Findabair then sends her maid to retrieve the cooked fish with the ring prominently displayed on its top, and Ailill demands that Fr\u00e1ech explain how the ring was retrieved. Fr\u00e1ech tells Ailill that he found the ring when he first came to visit and heard at the water's edge that Findabair had lost the ring and was looking for it; Fr\u00e1ech then said he offered to return it to Findabair in exchange for her love for one year. Ailill and Medb then tell Fr\u00e1ech to retrieve his cattle and that when he returns to them, they shall give him Findabair in marriage. Fr\u00e1ech then departs from Ailill and Medb and finds that his cattle have been stolen along with his wife and three sons while he was away. Fr\u00e1ech joins up with Conall Cernach and the two track the cattle and his family to the Alps; they are warned that the thieves' hideout is guarded by two dangerous serpents, but when they arrive, the serpents jump into Conall's girdle and the two heroes raid and destroy the dun, regaining Fr\u00e1ech's cattle and family. Fr\u00e1ech then returns to Medb and Ailill and agrees to fight for them against the Ulstermen in the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge (Cattle Raid of Cooley). Finally Fr\u00e1ech returns to Ailill and Medb to join them for the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge. ===The Death of Fr\u00e1ech === \"The Death of Fr\u00e1ech\" is a poem from The Book of the Dean of Lismore in which Fr\u00e1ech, who is described as the bravest, friendliest, and best of knights, is sent by Medb to retrieve the berries from a rowan tree on an island in Loch Medb. The berries from the rowan tree could cure disease and prolong life for a year, but the tree itself was guarded by a dragon or monster that dwelt in the loch among its roots. Fr\u00e1ech first went to the island and found the dragon asleep and was able to retrieve its berries unperceived. However Medb was not satisfied with the berries and requested that Fr\u00e1ech retrieve a branch from the tree. Fr\u00e1ech returned to the island and attempted to uproot the tree, but this act disturbed the dragon. The dragon bites Fr\u00e1ech in the side and tears off his arm, but Findabair provides a sword, which Fr\u00e1ech uses to behead the monster. Fr\u00e1ech finally comes ashore but dies of his wounds in Findabair's lap. ===T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge=== In the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge, Medb sends for Fr\u00e1ech to fight against C\u00fa Chulainn. Fr\u00e1ech finds C\u00fa Chulainn bathing in a river and C\u00fa Chulainn warns Fr\u00e1ech that if he enters the water, he will kill him. Fr\u00e1ech removes his clothes and enters the water to wrestle with C\u00fa Chulainn. C\u00fa Chulainn partially drowns Fr\u00e1ech and asks him to yield, but Fr\u00e1ech refuses, so C\u00fa Chulainn submerges him a second time until he dies. Fr\u00e1ech's body is borne away to Sid Fraich by a troop of maidens of the Sidhe, all dressed in green.T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge.

The inside of the lintel stone has the ogham inscription The mound of Carnfree (Irish Carn Fraoich, Fr\u00e1ech's Cairn) near Tulsk in County Roscommon, which was used for the inauguration of the O'Connor kings of Connacht, preserves his name. The cave of Cruachan (Oweynagat meaning \"cave of the cats\") nearby contains an ogham inscription in primitive Irish reading VRACCI MAQI MEDVVI, (the cave) of Fr\u00e1ech son of Medb. Fraoch is also the Celtic name of heather. ==References== Category:Ulster Cycle Category:Characters in T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge Category:Demigods ",
