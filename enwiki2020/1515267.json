He was married to Zofia Odrow\u0105\u017c since 1555, but had no issue. He was educated in the worldly affairs at the court of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, at his father's great expense claimed Orzechowski. He was owner of Tarn\u00f3w, Wiewi\u00f3rka, Przeworsk, Ro\u017cn\u00f3w and Stare Sio\u0142o. Secretary of King Sigismund II Augustus since 1554, held offices of castellan of Wojnicz, starost of Sandomierz, Stryj and Dolina. Poor health disallowed Jan Krzysztof to have a substantial career in the military, Niesiecki said: King was shoving a lesser military command to him during the Muscovy war ( Northern Seven Years' War), but his health weak due to consumption prevented him from achieving knightly deeds.' Died prematurely, most likely to the ravages of tuberculosis, and was buried next to his father, Piotr Skarga presided over his funeral at Tarn\u00f3w. On his person ended the Tarn\u00f3w line of the Tarnowski family clan. Poet Jan Kochanowski dedicated his poem Chess to him. ==References== *Kasper Niesiecki,Polish Armorial - \"Korona Polska przy z\u0142otey wolnosci staro\u017cytnemi Rycerstwa Polskiego y Wielkiego Xi\u0119stwa Litewskiego kleynotami naywy\u017cszymi Honorami Heroicznym, M\u0119stwem y odwag\u0105, Wytworn\u0105 Nauk\u0105 a naypierwey Cnot\u0105, nauk\u0105 Pobo\u017cno\u015bci\u0105, y Swi\u0105tobliwo\u015bci\u0105 ozdobiona Potomnym za\u015b wiekom na zaszczyt y nie\u015bmierteln\u0105 s\u0142aw\u0119 Pami\u0119tnych w tey Oyczy\u017anie Synow podana TOM ...
