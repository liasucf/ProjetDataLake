These three priority areas aim to address the themes of environment, economic development, entrepreneurship, education, culture, civil security, children's rights and trafficking in human beings. ==History== The CBSS was established by the region's Foreign Ministers in Copenhagen in 1992 as a response to the geopolitical changes that took place in the Baltic Sea region with the end of the Cold War. The CBSS founders were Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Thorvald Stoltenberg, Lennart Meri, Janis Jurkans, Algirdas Saudargas, Henning Christophersen, Paavo V\u00e4yrynen, Andrei Kozyrev, Margaretha af Ugglas, and Krzysztof Skubiszewski. Since its founding, the CBSS has contributed to ensuring positive developments within the Baltic Sea region and has served as a driving force for multilateral cooperation. Since 1998 the CBSS has been served by a permanent international Secretariat that is located in Stockholm, Sweden and funded by the Member States. The highest institution of CBSS is the conference of foreign ministers, which convenes every two years.http://www.cbss.org/council/ ===Member states=== The CBSS has 11 member states as well as the European Union: * * * * * (1995) * * * * * * ===Observer states=== 11 other countries have observer status: * * * * * * * * * * * ===Presidencies=== The Council Presidency rotates between the eleven Member States on an annual basis.

The CSO serves as the main discussion forum and decision-making body for matters related to the work of the Council between Ministerial Sessions. The CSO monitors, facilitates and aims to coordinate the work of all CBSS structures. The period chaired by each country rotates on an annual basis and follows the Council Presidency. The CSO Chairman is a representative, usually at ambassadorial level, appointed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the country which holds the Council Presidency. A number of CBSS structures are operating under the auspices of the CSO. In accordance with the Riga Declaration on the Reform of the CBSS from June 2008 one of the former working groups has been transformed into an Expert Group and the two other working groups have been dissolved. The CSO monitors the work of the Expert Group on Nuclear and Radiation Safety, the Task Force against Trafficking in Human Beings (TF-THB), the Expert Group on Children at Risk, and coordinates the work undertaken in the agreed three long-term priorities 'Regional Identity', 'Sustainable & Prosperous Region' and 'Safe & Secure Region'. ===Expert Groups=== * CBSS Expert Group on Nuclear and Radiation Safety * CBSS Expert Group on Maritime Policy * CBSS Expert Group on Sustainable Development \u2013 manages Baltic 2030 Action Plan * CBSS Expert Group on Children at Risk * The Task Force against Trafficking in Human Beings ===Secretariat=== A Permanent International Secretariat of the CBSS was established following a decision taken at the 7th Ministerial Session of the CBSS in 1998 in Nyborg, Denmark.

In November 2010, the Secretariat moved into its new premises located in R\u00e4ntm\u00e4starhuset at Slussplan 9, Stockholm, Sweden.
