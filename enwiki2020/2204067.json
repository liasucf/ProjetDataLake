    "text": "Sir Nicholas George Winton (born Wertheim; 19 May 1909 \u2013 1 July 2015) was a British banker and humanitarian who established an organisation to rescue children at risk from Nazi Germany. Born to German-Jewish parents who had emigrated to Britain at the beginning of the 20th century, Winton supervised the rescue of 669 children, most of them Jewish, from Czechoslovakia on the eve of World War II. Winton found homes for the children and arranged for their safe passage to Britain. This operation was later known as the Czech ' (German for \"children's transport\"). His work went unnoticed by the world for nearly 50 years, until 1988 when he was invited to the BBC television programme That's Life!, where he was reunited with several of the children he had saved. The British press celebrated him and dubbed him the \"British Schindler.\" In 2003, Winton was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for \"services to humanity, in saving Jewish children from Nazi Germany occupied Czechoslovakia\". On 28 October 2014, he was awarded the highest honour of the Czech Republic, the Order of the White Lion (1st class), by Czech President Milo\u0161 Zeman. He died in 2015 at the age of 106 in his sleep. == Early life == Winton was born on 19 May 1909 in Hampstead, London to Jewish parents Rudolph Wertheim (18811937), a bank manager, and his wife Barbara ( Wertheimer, 18881978), as the middle-born of their three children. His elder sister was Charlotte (1908\u20132001) and the younger brother, Robert (1914\u20132009). See No. 78. His parents were German Jews who had moved to London two years earlier. The family name was Wertheim, but they changed it to Winton in an effort at integration. They also converted to Christianity, and Winton was baptised. In 1923, Winton entered Stowe School, which had just opened. He left without qualifications, attending night school while volunteering at the Midland Bank. He then went to Hamburg, where he worked at Behrens Bank, followed by Wasserman Bank in Berlin. In 1931, he moved to France and worked for the Banque Nationale de Cr\u00e9dit in Paris. He also earned a banking qualification in France. Returning to London, he became a broker at the London Stock Exchange. Though a stockbroker, Winton was also \"an ardent socialist who became close to Labour Party luminaries Aneurin Bevan, Jennie Lee and Tom Driberg.\" Through another socialist friend, Martin Blake, Winton became part of a left-wing circle opposed to appeasement and concerned about the dangers posed by the Nazis. At school, he had become an outstanding fencer and was selected for the British team in 1938. He had hoped to compete in the following Olympics, but the games were cancelled because of the war. == Rescue work == Jewish children leave Prague for Britain. Winton appears towards the end of the video, wearing glasses. Shortly before Christmas 1938, Winton was planning to travel to Switzerland for a skiing holiday. Following a call for help from Marie Schmolka and Doreen Warriner, he decided instead to visit Prague and help Martin Blake, who was in Prague as an associate of the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia, then in the process of being occupied by Germany, and had called Winton to ask him to assist in Jewish welfare work.Jonathan Romain \"A salute to the 'British Schindler' as he turns 104\", The Guardian, 17 May 2013. Alongside the Czechoslovak Refugee Committee, the British and Canadian volunteers such as Winton, Trevor Chadwick, and Beatrice Wellington worked in organising to aid children from Jewish families at risk from the Nazis. Many of them set up their office at a dining room table in a hotel in Wenceslas Square. Altogether, Winton spent one month in Prague and left in January 1939, six weeks before the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. Other foreign volunteers remained, such as Chadwick, Warriner and Wellington. In November 1938, following Kristallnacht in Nazi-ruled Germany, the House of Commons approved a measure to allow the entry into Britain of refugees younger than 17, provided they had a place to stay and a warranty of \u00a350 was deposited for their eventual return to their own country. === The Netherlands === An important obstacle was getting official permission to cross into the Netherlands, as the children were to embark on the ferry at Hook of Holland. After Kristallnacht in November 1938, the Dutch government officially closed its borders to any Jewish refugees. The Dutch police, the marechaussee, searched for them and returned any found to Germany, despite the horrors of Kristallnacht being well known. Winton succeeded, thanks to the guarantees he had obtained from Britain. After the first train, the process of crossing the Netherlands went smoothly. Winton ultimately found homes in Britain for 669 children, many of whose parents would perish in the Auschwitz concentration camp. His mother worked with him to place the children in homes and later hostels. Throughout the summer of 1939, he placed photographs of the children in Picture Post seeking families to accept them. By coincidence, the names of the London and North Eastern Railway steamers which operated the Harwich to Hook of Holland route included the Prague and the Vienna; the former can be seen in a 1938 Path\u00e9 newsreel.The Kinder - Jewish Refugees December 1938. YouTube. 19 December 2018. Retrieved 19 May 2020. He also wrote to US politicians such as President Franklin D. Roosevelt, asking them to take more children. He said that two thousand more might have been saved if they had helped, but only Sweden took any besides those sent to Britain. The last group of 250, scheduled to leave Prague on 1 September 1939, were unable to depart. With Hitler's invasion of Poland on the same day, the Second World War had begun. Of the children due to leave on that train, only two survived the war. Winton acknowledged the vital roles in Prague of Doreen Warriner, Trevor Chadwick, Nicholas Stopford, Beatrice Wellington (born 15 June 1907), Josephine Pike, and Bill Barazetti (1914\u20132000), who also worked to evacuate children from Europe. Winton was in Prague for only about three weeks before the Nazis occupied the country. He never set foot in Prague Station. He later wrote that \"Chadwick did the more difficult and dangerous work after the Nazis invaded... he deserves all praise\". === Notable people saved === * Leslie Baruch Brent, immunologist who did groundbreaking work on immune tolerance. * Alf Dubs, Baron Dubs (born 1932), British Labour Party politician and former Member of Parliament * Heini Halberstam (1926\u20132014), mathematician. * Renata Laxova (born 1931), paediatric geneticist * Isi Metzstein (1928\u20132012), modernist architect * Gerda Mayer (born 1927), poetEmanuel, Muriel; Gissing, V\u011bra (2002), Nicholas Winton and the rescued generation, p. 102. * Karel Reisz (1926\u20132002), filmmakerEmanuel, Muriel; Gissing, V\u011bra (2002), Nicholas Winton and the rescued generation, p. 110. * Joe Schlesinger (1928\u20132019), Canadian television journalist and authorEmanuel, Muriel; Gissing, V\u011bra (2002), Nicholas Winton and the rescued generation, p. 138 * Yitzchok Tuvia Weiss (born 1926), Chief Rabbi of the Edah HaChareidis in Jerusalem Of the 669 children saved from the Holocaust through Winton's efforts, more than 370 have never been traced. BBC News suggested in 2015 that they may not know the full story of how they survived the war. == Second World War == After the outbreak of World War II, Winton applied successfully for registration as a conscientious objector and later served with the Red Cross.Imperial War Museum Sound Archive, 17460 In 1940, he rescinded his objections and joined the Royal Air Force, Administrative and Special Duties Branch. He was an aircraftman, rising to sergeant by the time he was commissioned on 22 June 1944 as an acting pilot officer on probation. On 17 August 1944, he was promoted to pilot officer on probation. He was promoted to the rank of war substantive flying officer on 17 February 1945. He relinquished his commission on 19 May 1954, retaining the honorary rank of flight lieutenant. == Postwar == Winton visiting Prague in October 2007 === Family life === After the war, Winton worked for the International Refugee Organization and then the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in Paris, where he met Grete Gjelstrup, a Danish secretary and accountant's daughter. They married in her hometown of Vejle on 31 October 1948. The family insisted that their son Robin stay with them rather than be sent to a residential home. Robin's death from meningitis, the day before his sixth birthday, affected Winton greatly and he founded a local support organisation which became Maidenhead Mencap. Winton stood, unsuccessfully, for the town council in 1954; he later found work in the finance departments of various companies. === Recognition === It has been reported Winton suppressed his humanitarian exploits for many years; however, he mentioned them in his election material while unsuccessfully standing for election to the Maidenhead town council in 1954. His rescue achievements went unnoticed for half a century until in 1988 his wife found a detailed scrapbook in their attic, containing lists of the children, including their parents' names and the names and addresses of the families that took them in. She gave the scrapbook to Elisabeth Maxwell, a Holocaust researcher and wife of media magnate Robert Maxwell. Winton himself could not remember the reason why this was done. Letters were sent to each of these known addresses and 80 of \"Winton's children\" were found in Britain. In an interview on the BBC radio programme The Life Scientific, Simon Wessely described how his father Rudi, one of the rescued children, had a chance encounter with Winton.\"Simon Wessely on unexplained medical syndromes, The Life Scientific \u2013 BBC Radio 4\". BBC. Retrieved 16 January 2019. The wider world found out about his work in February 1988 during an episode of the BBC television programme That's Life! when he was invited as a member of the audience. At one point, Winton's scrapbook was shown and his achievements were explained. The host of the programme, Esther Rantzen, asked whether anybody in the audience owed their lives to Winton, and if so, to stand: more than two dozen people surrounding Winton rose and applauded.Sir Nicholas Winton \u2013 BBC Programme \"That's Life\" (1988) on Youtube. Retrieved 25 October 2011 Ms Rantzen then asked if anyone present was the child or grandchild of one of the children Winton saved. The rest of the audience stood.That's Life, 1988 === 100th birthday === To celebrate his 100th birthday, Winton flew over the White Waltham Airfield in a microlight piloted by Judy Leden, the daughter of one of the boys he saved. His birthday was also marked by the publication of a profile in The Jewish Chronicle. == Death == Commemorative event, in July 2015, at the Prague Main Railway Station sculpture Winton died in his sleep on the morning of 1 July 2015 at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough from cardio-respiratory failure, having been admitted a week earlier following a deterioration in his health. He was 106 years old. Winton was survived by his son, Nicholas, and his daughter, Barbara. Stephen Bates, Sir Nicholas Winton obituary The Guardian, 1 July 2015 Winton's death came 76 years to the day after 241 of the children he saved left Prague on a train. A special report from the BBC News on several of the children whom Winton rescued during the war had been published earlier that day. == Honours == In the 1983 Queen's Birthday Honours, Winton was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his work in establishing the Abbeyfield homes for the elderly in Britain, and in the 2003 New Year Honours, he was knighted for services to humanity, in recognition of his work on the Czech Kindertransport. He met the Queen again during her state visit to Bratislava, Slovakia, in October 2008. In 2003, Winton received the Pride of Britain Award for Lifetime Achievement. In 2010, Winton was named a British Hero of the Holocaust by the British Government. Winton was awarded the Order of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk, Fourth Class, by the Czech President V\u00e1clav Havel in 1998. In 2008, he was honoured by the Czech government in several ways. An elementary school in Kun\u017eak is named after him, and he was awarded the Cross of Merit of the Minister of Defence, Grade I. The Czech government nominated him for the 2008 Nobel Peace Prize. The minor planet 19384 Winton was named in his honour by Czech astronomers Jana Tich\u00e1 and Milo\u0161 Tich\u00fd. Prague main railway station, by Flor Kent, unveiled on 1 September 2009 A statue of Winton stands on Platform 1 of the Praha hlavn\u00ed n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed railway station. Created by Flor Kent, it was unveiled on 1 September 2009 as part of a larger commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the last Kindertransport train (see also Winton train, below). There are also three memorials at Liverpool Street Station in London, where the Kindertransport children arrived. In September 2010, another statue of Winton was unveiled, this time at Maidenhead railway station by Home Secretary Theresa May, MP for Maidenhead. Created by Lydia Karpinska, it depicts Winton sitting on a bench and reading a book. Winton was baptised as a Christian by his parents, but his Jewish ancestry disqualified him from being declared a Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem in Israel. As an adult, he was not active in any particular religion. In a 2015 interview, Winton told Stephen Sackur he had become disillusioned with religion during the war as he could not reconcile religious movements \"praying for victory on both sides of the same war\". Winton went on to describe his personal beliefs: \"I believe in ethics, and if everybody believed in ethics we'd have no problems at all. That's the only way out; forget the religious side.\" at 18 minutes 11 seconds Winton received the Wallenberg Medal on 27 June 2013 in London. The following year, the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation established a literary competition named after Winton. The contest is for essays by high school students about Winton's legacy.Letter in The Guardian newspaper, 24 May 2014, signed by Eduardo Eurnekian and Baruch Tenembaum, chairman and founder of the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation Winton was awarded the Freedom of the City of London on 23 February 2015.

On board were several surviving \"Winton children\" and their descendants, who were welcomed by Winton in London. The occasion marked the 70th anniversary of the final intended Kindertransport arranged by Winton, due to set off on 1 September 1939 but prevented by the outbreak of the Second World War that very day. At the train's departure, a memorial statue for Winton, designed by Flor Kent, was unveiled at the railway station. === Order of the White Lion === On 19 May 2014, Winton's 105th birthday, it was announced he was to receive the Czech Republic's highest honour, for giving Czech children \"the greatest possible gift: the chance to live and to be free\".

The award was made alongside one to Sir Winston Churchill, which was accepted by his grandson Nicholas Soames. Zeman said he regretted the highest Czech award having been awarded to the two personalities so belatedly, but added \"better late than never\". Winton was also able to meet some of the people he rescued 75 years earlier, themselves then in their 80s. He said, \"I want to thank you all for this enormous expression of thanks for something which happened to me nearly 100 years ago\u2014and a 100 years is a heck of a long time. I am delighted that so many of the children are still about and are here to thank me.\" === List of National Honours === * * * == Popular culture == Winton's work is the subject of three films by Slovak filmmaker Matej Min\u00e1\u010d: the drama All My Loved Ones (1999), in which Winton was played by Rupert Graves, the documentary The Power of Good: Nicholas Winton (S\u00edla lidskosti\u2014Nicholas Winton, 2002), which won an Emmy Award, and the documentary drama Nicky's Family (Nickyho rodina, 2011).
