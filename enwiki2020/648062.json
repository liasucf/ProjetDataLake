    "text": "In differential geometry, a G2 manifold is a seven-dimensional Riemannian manifold with holonomy group contained in G2. The group G_2 is one of the five exceptional simple Lie groups. It can be described as the automorphism group of the octonions, or equivalently, as a proper subgroup of special orthogonal group SO(7) that preserves a spinor in the eight-dimensional spinor representation or lastly as the subgroup of the general linear group GL(7) which preserves the non-degenerate 3-form \\phi, the associative form. The Hodge dual, \\psi=*\\phi is then a parallel 4-form, the coassociative form. These forms are calibrations in the sense of Reese Harvey and H. Blaine Lawson,. and thus define special classes of 3- and 4-dimensional submanifolds. == Properties == Any G_2-manifold is: * 7-dimensional, * Ricci-flat, * orientable, and * a spin manifold. In addition, any compact manifold with holonomy equal to G_2 has *finite fundamental group, *non-zero first Pontryagin class, and *non-zero third and fourth Betti numbers. == History == The fact that G_2 might possibly be the holonomy group of certain Riemannian 7-manifolds was first suggested by the 1955 classification theorem of Marcel Berger, and this remained consistent with the simplified proof later given by Jim Simons in 1962. Although not a single example of such a manifold had yet been discovered, Edmond Bonan nonetheless made a useful contribution by showing that, if such a manifold did in fact exist, it would carry both a parallel 3-form and a parallel 4-form, and that it would necessarily be Ricci- flat.. The first local examples of 7-manifolds with holonomy G_2 were finally constructed around 1984 by Robert Bryant, and his full proof of their existence appeared in the Annals in 1987.. Next, complete (but still noncompact) 7-manifolds with holonomy G_2 were constructed by Bryant and Simon Salamon in 1989.. The first compact 7-manifolds with holonomy G_2 were constructed by Dominic Joyce in 1994. Compact G_2 manifolds are therefore sometimes known as \"Joyce manifolds\", especially in the physics literature.. In 2013, it was shown by M. Firat Arikan, Hyunjoo Cho, and Sema Salur that any manifold with a spin structure, and, hence, a G_2-structure, admits a compatible almost contact metric structure, and an explicit compatible almost contact structure was constructed for manifolds with G_2-structure.. In the same paper, it was shown that certain classes of G_2-manifolds admit a contact structure. In 2015, a new construction of compact G_2 manifolds, due to Alessio Corti, Mark Haskins, Johannes Nordstr\u0151m, and Tommaso Pacini, combined a gluing idea suggested by Simon Donaldson with new algebro-geometric and analytic techniques for constructing Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds with cylindrical ends, resulting in tens of thousands of diffeomorphism types of new examples. == Connections to physics == These manifolds are important in string theory. They break the original supersymmetry to 1/8 of the original amount. For example, M-theory compactified on a G_2 manifold leads to a realistic four- dimensional (11-7=4) theory with N=1 supersymmetry. The resulting low energy effective supergravity contains a single supergravity supermultiplet, a number of chiral supermultiplets equal to the third Betti number of the G_2 manifold and a number of U(1) vector supermultiplets equal to the second Betti number. == See also == * Spin(7)-manifold * Calabi\u2013Yau manifold == References == == Further reading == * * . *.
