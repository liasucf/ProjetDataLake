A Peebles location in Alpena, Michigan in August 20, 2011 ==History== Peebles was founded in 1891 by William Smith Peebles, who opened his first store in Lawrenceville, VA. The family sold the company in 1986 for $85 million to two investment banking firms and to Peebles\u2019 senior management. It had been sold twice before Stage Stores acquired Peebles in 2003 when it was based in South Hill, VA. At the time, Peebles had more than 125 stores primarily in the Mid- Atlantic, Southeastern and Midwest states. After decades of expansion Peebles acquired the Nashville-based upscale Harveys Department Stores chain in September 1988, renaming the stores as Peebles. In 1998, Peebles purchased Watson's, a similar chain, later renaming all the Watson's stores as Peebles. Houston-based Stage Stores purchased Peebles for $167 million in cash and $46.9 million in debt in 2003. In August 2019, it was announced that all Peebles stores, along with all other stores operated by Stage Stores Inc, would be converted into Gordmans stores. On May 10, 2020, Stage announced it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and that it would liquidate all locations, Peebles and Gordmans included, unless a buyer could be found for the chain. No buyer had been found, and going out of business sales had begun at all locations. == References == == Further reading == ==External links== * Official website Category:1891 establishments in Virginia Category:2020 disestablishments in Virginia Category:Brunswick County, Virginia Category:Companies based in Houston Category:Retail companies established in 1891 Category:Companies that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020 Category:Retail companies disestablished in 2020 Category:Defunct department stores based in Texas Category:Economy of the Midwestern United States Category:Mecklenburg County, Virginia ",
