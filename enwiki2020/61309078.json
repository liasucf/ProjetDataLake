It is published by Taylor & Francis on behalf of the Constructivist Psychology Network and the International Society for Dialogical Science, the two organizations for which it is the official journal. The co- editors are Robert A. Neimeyer (University of Memphis) and Jonathan D. Raskin (SUNY New Paltz). The associate editors are Hubert J.M. Hermans, David Winter, Jelena Pavlovic, and Amberly Panepinto.
