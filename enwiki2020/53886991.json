He bought a studio in Soho Square in 1945Jean Straker and The Visual Arts Club - Pamela Green and set up a firm called the Photo Union. He liked to experiment with colour photography, but this proved expensive. He also quickly bored of having to deal with clients. This motivated him in 1951 to turn his studio into the Visual Arts Club, the aim of which was to allow him, through lectures and demonstrations, to pass on his ideas to others as well as to provide nude models for amateur photographers. Straker came up with the term \u201cappraisers\u201d for those who just wanted to watch and learn. Life drawing classes were also a major part of the club. The club would often take part in London's Soho Fair with a float of their own and an exhibition called Femina. In 1961 the name of the club changed to The Academy of Visual Arts. On 22 May 1958 the BBC Third Programme broadcast a discussion on Pin-ups and Figure Studies with Jean Straker and fellow photographers Jack Eston and Walter Bird.On the Air - Pamela Green The passing of the 1959 Obscene Publications Act in 1959 resulted in a continuous cycle of prosecutions and appeals as Straker refused to compromise his artistic integrity.
