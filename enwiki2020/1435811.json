    "text": "Fran\u00e7ois Luambo Luanzo Makiadi (6 July 1938 \u2013 12 October 1989) was a major figure in 20th-century Congolese music, and African music in general. He is referred to as Franco Luambo or simply Franco. Known for his mastery of African Rumba, he was nicknamed by fans and critics \"Sorcerer of the Guitar\" and the \"Grand Ma\u00eetre of Zairean Music\", as well as Franco de Mi Amor by female acolytes. ==Early life== Born 1938 in what was then the Belgian Congo, he played harmonica and other instruments to attract customers to his mother's market stall in Ngiri-Ngiri. ==Career== In 1955 Franco formed a band that debuted in the OK Bar. The following year the band was reborn as OK Jazz taking its name from the place it had begun. And then, another change to Tout Puissant O.K. Jazz (T.P.O.K. Jazz) (which stands in French for The Almighty O.K. Jazz) Franco played in the USA once, in 1983, appearing twice in New York's Manhattan Center. ==Musical style== Franco's played guitar playing was unlike that of bluesmen such as Muddy Waters or rock and rollers like Chuck Berry. Instead of raw, single-note lines, Franco built his band's style around crisp open chords, often of only two notes, which \"bounced around the beat.\" Major thirds and sixths and other consonant intervals are said to play the same role in Franco's style that blues notes fill in rock and roll. Franco's music often relied on huge ensembles, with as many as six vocalists and several guitarists. According to a description, \"horns might engage in an upbeat dialogue with the guitar, or set up hypnotic vamps that carried the song forward as on the crest of a wave,\" while percussion parts are \"a cushion supporting the band, rather than a prod to raise the energy level.\" ==Politics== Luambo was a vocal supporter of Zaire's ruler Mobutu Sese Seko, however, they soon became enemies. ==Death== He died in 1989 from unknown illness which resulted in four days of national mourning in Zaire. ==Selected discography== Luambo's biographer Graeme Ewens has tracked down eighty albums in all. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Album |- |1969 ||Franco & Orchestre O.K.
