    "text": "Out and About is an album by American jazz trombonist Steve Swell featuring Roswell Rudd, which was recorded in 1996 and released on CIMP. ==Reception== The Penguin Guide to Jazz notes that \"Swell's tone has a raucous, overheated timbre when he warms up, and set beside Rudd's more constricted delivery, the results are more reminiscent of a couple of old Dixieland tailgaters going at it than anything 'avant-garde'.\" ==Track listing== :All compositions by Steve Swell #\"Fruition\" - 8:36 #\"Moves\" - 7:45 #\"Out and About\" - 11:16 #\"Start Up\" - 9:01 #\"Walking the Dog\" - 12:50 #\"A Painting\" - 12:14 #\"Diesel Dots (for Ryan & Kelcey)\" - 12:09 ==Personnel== *Steve Swell - trombone *Roswell Rudd - trombone *Ken Filiano - bass *Lou Grassi - drums ==References== Category:1996 albums Category:Steve Swell albums Category:CIMP albums ",
