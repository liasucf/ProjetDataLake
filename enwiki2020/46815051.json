The nobility envies this relationship, and the favor granted by the Duchess to Fabio, and they conspire against her, together with the French Ambassador. Raoul, an armourer from Nantes, has raised an orphan girl, Marie, who was mysteriously entrusted to him as an infant, and he has fallen in love with her. She turns out to be the heiress of a wealthy Breton noble. Fabio learns of this and kills the Jew who has the papers proving Marie's parentage, but not before Raoul finds out the truth. Fabio accuses Raoul of the murder, and taunts him with a letter from Marie. The Duchess learns of Fabio's crime, and eventually he is executed. Raoul and Marie reunited. ==Reception== The reviewer in The Spectator noted that it was Balfe's most successful work among his recent operas, and predicted a successful run. He praised in particular many of its ballads as being among the best that Balfe composed, though he also stated that the subject required a \"rather more dramatic treatment than Mr. Balfe is capable of.\" Charles Lamb Kenney wrote that \"there was not the same bright freshness and marked originality in their melodic inspiration taken as a whole.\"Charles Lamb Kenney. A Memoir of Michael William Balfe, Tinsley Brothers (1875) p. 255. The opera has never been recorded. ==References== ==External links== * Libretto as e-book at the Goethe University Frankfurt Library website Category:Operas by Michael Balfe Category:1863 operas Category:English-language operas Category:Operas Category:Operas based on plays Category:Operas based on works by Victor Hugo Category:Operas set in France Category:Opera world premieres at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden ",
