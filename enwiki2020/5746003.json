He criticized a Manitoba Liquor Control Commission decision that prevented him from selling alcohol during World Cup of Soccer matches 2002. The games took place in Japan and South Korea, and were broadcast during early morning hours in local time.\"A Winnipeg hotel owner believes not being allowed to sell liquor during live World Cup of Soccer [...]\", Broadcast News, 30 May 2002, 12:12. Magnifico was an opponent of Winnipeg's anti-smoking bylaw, and sought to provide his bar patrons with a loophole to the law in 2003. Although he enforced the ban in the bar itself, he also purchased an old yellow school bus that he parked outside his hotel as a \"smoking section\". Provincial inspectors later argued that the bus constituted a public indoor space and was therefore in violation of the bylaw, and issued a $1,500 fine.Lindor Reynolds, \"Magnifico butt bus idea busted\", Winnipeg Free Press, 14 November 2003, B1; Mary Agnes Welch, \"Hotel's 'butt bus' busted\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 December 2003, A6.

He was 49 years old at the time of the election. In his victory speech, Magnifico said the results marked the end of the Old St. Boniface Residents Association's dominance over local politics. Magnifico quickly emerged as a vocal ally of newly elected Mayor Sam Katz. He supported the mayor's decision to shelve a rapid transit plan in September 2004, arguing that the money would be better spent on other priorities.Mary Agnes Welch, \"Katz stalls rapid transit\", Winnipeg Free Press, 15 September 2004, B1.
