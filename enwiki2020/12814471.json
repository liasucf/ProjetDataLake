    "text": "Protohippus is an extinct three-toed genus of horse. It was roughly the size of a modern donkey. Fossil evidence suggests that it lived during the Late Miocene (Clarendonian to Hemphillian), from about 13.6 Ma to 5.3 Ma. Analysis of Protohippus' skull and teeth suggests that it is most closely related to the genus Calippus. Species include: * P. vetus * P. perditus * P. supremus (also P. simus) * P. gidleyi == See also == * Eohippus * Mesohippus == References == Category:Miocene horses Category:Prehistoric mammal genera Category:Miocene mammals of North America Category:Clarendonian Category:Hemphillian Category:Fossil taxa described in 1858 Category:Taxa named by Joseph Leidy ",
