    "text": "Bella Vista, Italian for \"beautiful sight\", is a neighborhood in the South Philadelphia section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is bounded by 6th Street, 11th Street, South Street, and Washington Avenue.\"Philadelphia Neighborhoods and Place Names, A-K.\" City of Philadelphia. Retrieved on October 4, 2011. \"Between 6th and 11th Streets, South Street to Washington Avenue.\" It currently has a population of 5,898. ==History== Prior to the Act of Consolidation of 1854, Bella Vista was part of the Moyamensing Township. It was sparsely settled until the 1840s and 1850s when it became an impoverished area on the outskirts of the industrializing city. The New York Tribune noted in 1848 that the districts of Moyamensing and nearby Southwark were composed of \"the most graceless vagabonds and unmitigated ruffians\" as well as \"loafers\" who were members of various gangs.South Philadelphia.\" Philadelphia Encyclopedia. Retrieved November 8, 2014 In addition to Irish immigrants, it was also once home to a large portion of the city's population of African descent, many of whom were former slaves from the South. In 1852, the Institute for Colored Youth, a school (and later college) for people of African descent, was established at 10th and Bainbridge. During the late 1800s, Italian immigrants began settling the area in large numbers, which reshaped the neighborhood's character. One of the earliest immigrants, Antonio Palumbo, opened a boardinghouse (Palumbo's) on the corner of 9th and Catharine in 1884 that became the social center of the neighborhood's growing Italian community. The planned construction of the South Street Expressway in the 1960s led to a drop in property values in the neighborhood. Many of the neighborhood's residents subsequently fled to the suburbs. As they did in adjacent Queen Village, developers and city planners attempted to rebrand the neighborhood and began referring to it as \"Bella Vista\" in the early 1970s. The city eventually scrapped plans for the second cross-town expressway. In the late 1970s, the neighborhood began to gentrify due to its proximity to Center City. In 1982, it was featured as a case study in Michael Lang's Gentrification Amid Urban Decline: Strategies for America's Older Cities. During the same era, the neighborhood also experienced an influx of Vietnamese and Mexican immigrants, especially near Washington Ave. While much of the Italian-American community has moved deeper into South Philadelphia, i.e. further south of Bella Vista into neighborhoods such as Marconi Plaza, many Italian shops and restaurants still remain clustered along the market on 9th Street. The Samuel S. Fleisher Art Memorial, Institute for Colored Youth, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper House, George W. Nebinger School, and Washington Avenue Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ===Historical Markers Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission=== Bronze plaques installed in Bella Vista by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission that commemorate individuals, events, and landmarks.
