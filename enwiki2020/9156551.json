    "text": "Bellefonte is a ghost town in Jackson County, Alabama, United States, near the site of the Bellefonte Nuclear Generating Station. It is located roughly two miles southeast of Hollywood, Alabama. ==Demographics== Bellefonte was listed on the 1860 and 1870 U.S. Census rolls. In 1860, it was the most populous (and only) incorporated community in Jackson County with 181 persons (of whom 173 were White, and 8 were \"Free Colored\"; no slaves were recorded.) ==History== Bellefonte was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated on December 15, 1821,A Digest of the Laws of the State of Alabama: Containing The Statutes and Resolutions in Force at the end of the General Assembly in January, 1823. Published by Ginn & Curtis, J. & J. Harper, Printers, New-York, 1828. Title 62. Chapter LXIII. Page 839. \"An Act to Incorporate the Town of Belle-Fonte, in the County of Jackson.\u2014Passed December 15, 1821.\" (Google Books) when it had nearly 200 residents. Its name was a subjective description consisting of the French words \"belle\", meaning \"beautiful,\" and \"fonte\", meaning \"fount.\" It was the Jackson County seat from 1821 to 1868, when it was relocated to Scottsboro. During the 1820s, a courthouse and church were constructed. A post office was established in 1830. By 1844, the population had grown to 400. The town suffered severe damage during the Civil War. The post office was closed in 1859. The relocation of the county seat in 1868 drew off business from town. This town rapidly lost population, dropping off the census rolls by 1880. The town was abandoned by the 1920s. All that remains of Bellefonte today are the cemetery, the chimney of the local inn, and piles of scattered bricks.Foscue, Virginia. Place Names in Alabama.
