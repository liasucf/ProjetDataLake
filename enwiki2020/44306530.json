The San Diego Sockers, a Pacific Division team in the Major Arena Soccer League, played their home games in the Valley View Casino Center in San Diego, California. The team was led by general manager John Kentera and head coach Phil Salvagio with assistant coach Ray Taila. Amassing a 16\u20134 regular season record, the Sockers qualified for the playoffs as the top seed in the Pacific Division but lost to the Las Vegas Legends in the Pacific Division Final. ==Season summary== The Sockers started the season with a four-game winning streak before a road loss to the Las Vegas Legends. The team won the next two at home then lost back to back games in Missouri. Unlike in recent seasons, a substantial portion of the Sockers roster was born outside the United States. As of January 2015, the team included 7 international players, including 3 from Brazil, 2 from Spain, and 1 each from Mexico and Argentina. The Sockers then won their next 9 games, home and road, before losing on the road at Las Vegas for the second time this season. The Sockers closed out the season with a home win against the Ontario Fury, finishing with a 16\u20134 record and the top seed in the Pacific Division for the playoffs. They lost 6\u20137 to the Las Vegas Legends in the Pacific Division Final. ==History== This is the third professional soccer franchise to use the \"San Diego Sockers\" name. The original Sockers were founded in 1978 and played in the NASL, original MISL, and the CISL before ceasing operations in 1996. The second Sockers were briefly revived for the WISL in 2001 and transitioned to the second MISL in 2002 before folding in 2004. The current Sockers were founded in 2009 and played their first three PASL seasons at the Chevrolet Del Mar Arena in Del Mar, California, before moving to Valley View Casino Center before the 2012\u201313 season. After early struggles, the team dominated the PASL for several years with long winning streaks and consecutive championships. The Sockers finished the 2013\u201314 regular season 2nd in the Pacific Division with a 13\u20133 record, qualifying for the post-season but losing to the Las Vegas Legends in the Division Final. ==Off-field moves== In May 2014, the Professional Arena Soccer League added six teams from the failed third incarnation of the Major Indoor Soccer League and reorganized as the Major Arena Soccer League. With the league expansion and reorganization, the other Pacific teams for 2014\u201315 are California-based Ontario Fury, Sacramento Surge, and Turlock Express plus the Las Vegas Legends and the expansion Seattle Impact. The Impact's assets were purchased mid-season and the team replaced on the schedule by the Tacoma Stars. ==Schedule== ===Pre-season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40\" | Game ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Day ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"110\" | Date ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Kickoff ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Opponent ! colspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Results ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"240\" | Location ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" | Attendance |- ! width=\"120\" | Score ! width=\"60\" | Record |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 1 | Saturday | October 18 | 6:05pm | Toros Mexico | L 5\u20137 | 0\u20131 | Valley View Casino Center | |} ===Regular season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40\" | Game ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Day ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"110\" | Date ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Kickoff ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Opponent ! colspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Results ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"240\" | Location ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" | Attendance |- ! width=\"120\" | Score ! width=\"60\" | Record |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 1 | Saturday | November 1 | 7:05pm | Las Vegas Legends | W 5\u20134 (OT) | 1\u20130 | Valley View Casino Center | 3,816 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 2 | Saturday | November 8 | 7:30pm | at Seattle Impact | W 14\u20134 | 2\u20130 | ShoWare Center | 1,348 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 3 | Sunday | November 16 | 5:05pm | Ontario Fury | W 7\u20132 | 3\u20130 | Valley View Casino Center | 2,913 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 4 | Thursday | November 20 | 7:35pm | Las Vegas Legends | W 7\u20132 | 4\u20130 | Valley View Casino Center | 1,922 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 5 | Sunday | November 23 | 3:00pm | at Las Vegas Legends | L 7\u20139 | 4\u20131 | Orleans Arena | 1,377 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 6 | Saturday | December 6 | 7:05pm | Turlock Express | W 5\u20134 | 5\u20131 | Valley View Casino Center | 2,570 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 7 | Saturday | December 13 | 7:05pm | Seattle Impact | W 17\u201310 | 6\u20131 | Valley View Casino Center | 2,837 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 8 | Saturday | December 27 | 7:05pm | at Missouri Comets | L 7\u201310 | 6\u20132 | Independence Events Center | 4,218 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 9 | Sunday | December 28 | 6:35pm | at St. Louis Ambush | L 3\u20138 | 6\u20133 | Family Arena | 6,574 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 10 | Saturday | January 3 | 7:05pm | Sacramento Surge | W 18\u20135 | 7\u20133 | Valley View Casino Center | 3,254 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 11 | Saturday | January 10 | 7:05pm | Harrisburg Heat | W 11\u20134 | 8\u20133 | Valley View Casino Center | 4,177 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 12 | Friday | January 16 | 7:30pm | at Tacoma Stars | W 8\u20133 | 9\u20133 | ShoWare Center | 885 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 13 | Friday | January 23 | 7:35pm | at Turlock Express | W 10\u20133 | 10\u20133 | Turlock Indoor Soccer | 570 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 14 | Saturday | January 24 | 7:05pm | at Sacramento Surge | W 13\u20136 | 11\u20133 | McClellan Park | 545 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 15 | Sunday | January 25 | 3:05pm | at Sacramento Surge | W 10\u20135 | 12\u20133 | McClellan Park | 358 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 16 | Saturday | January 31 | 7:05pm | Tacoma Stars | W 13\u20134 | 13\u20133 | Valley View Casino Center | 7,311 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 17 | Saturday | February 7 | 7:05pm | Baltimore Blast | W 7\u20132 | 14\u20133 | Valley View Casino Center | 6,247 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 18 | Thursday | February 12 | 7:05pm | at Ontario Fury | W 9\u20135 | 15\u20133 | Citizens Business Bank Arena | 4,253 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 19 | Friday | February 13 | 7:35pm | at Las Vegas Legends | L 5\u20138 | 15\u20134 | Orleans Arena | 2,311 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 20 | Saturday | February 21 | 7:05pm | Ontario Fury | W 3\u20131 | 16\u20134 | Valley View Casino Center | 4,094 |} Seattle Impact shut down mid-season; franchise purchased by Tacoma Stars Originally scheduled for February 15; rescheduled to avoid an arena conflict. ===Post-season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"140\" | Game ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"70\" | Day ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"70\" | Date ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Kickoff ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Opponent ! colspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Results ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"240\" | Location ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" | Attendance |- ! width=\"120\" | Score ! width=\"60\" | Record |- style=\"text-align:center; background:#ffcccc;\" !
