    "text": "Dance India Dance (also called by the acronym DID; tagline:Dance Ka Asli ID D.I.D.) is an Indian dance competition reality television series that airs on Zee TV, created and produced by Essel Vision Productions. It premiered on 30 January 2009. Here the judges are called Masters and Mithun Chakraborty was called Grand Master (till season 6). Season 7 premiered with a different concept. The show features a format where dancers from a variety of styles enter open auditions held in Indian metropolitan cities to showcase their unique style and talents and, if allowed to move forward, are then put through mega-audition rounds of auditions to test their ability to adapt to different styles. At the end of mega audition, the top 18 dancers are chosen as finalists who move on to compete in the competition's main phase where they will perform solo, duet and group dance numbers in a variety of styles in competition for the votes of the broadcast viewing audience which, combined with the input of a panel of judges, determine which dancers will advance to the next stage from week to week. The show features a variety of Indian cultural and international dance styles ranging across a broad spectrum of classical, Contemporary, Bollywood, Hip-hop, Jazz, Kalaripayattu, Salsa, and Musical theatre styles, among others, with many sub-genres within these categories represented. Competitors attempt to master these styles in an attempt to survive successive weeks of elimination and win a cash prize and often other awards, as well as the title of India's Best Dancer. The show is choreographed by Indian choreographers, such as Mudassar Khan, Marzi Pestonji, Tanuj Jaggi and Mini Pradhan. The show has won several television awards for Most Popular Dance Reality Show. == Format == === Selection process === The selection process can be further broken down into two distinct stages: the Open Auditions and the second phase referred to as the Mega Auditions. The Open Auditions take place in 5\u20136 major Indian cities and are typically open to anyone aged 15\u201330 at the time of their audition. The cities in which auditions are held vary from season to season but some, such as New Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata have featured in almost every season. During this stage, dancers perform a brief routine (typically individually) before three masters. The masters will then make an on-the-spot decision as to whether the dancer demonstrated enough ability. If the dancer impressed the masters with his/her dancing abilities, masters will award a Hat called Taqdeer Ki Topi (Hat of Destiny), moving them instantly one step forward in the competition. The second stage of the selection process, the Mega Auditions, is a several-day- long process in which the 100 hopefuls are tested for overall well-rounded dance, stamina, and their ability to perform under pressure. The dancers are put through a battery of rounds which test their ability to pick up various dance styles (typically some of the more well-represented genres that will later be prominent in the competition phase, such as Hip hop, Bollywood, Jazz, Bharat Natyam, Kathak, Mohiniyattam, Odissi and Contemporary). At the end of this process, only the top 36 competitors will be chosen. The top 36 are then again asked to give solo performances, after which 18 are chosen in the final auditions. Then, those top 18 get divided into 3 teams which are named according to the 3 masters of the show such as, Mudassar Ki Mandali, Marzi Ke Mastane and Mini Ke Masterblasters. Each team containing 6 dancers then competes in the show, learning new skills throughout the journey. === Judges === Grand Master Mithun Chakraborty has been being the head judge of the series. When any contestant performs an extra-ordinary performance, Grand Master gives him/her a salute. It's called Grand Salute and it is the highest respect for any contestant here. Every season, 3 Indian choreographers (who are called Coaches) choreograph the contestants and judge them too with Grand Master. The first three seasons were judged by 3 regular judges Master Geeta Kapoor, Master Terence Lewis & Master Remo D'Souza with Grand Master. Then the judges were changed season by season from season 4. When any contestant performs a perfect act, the judges give him/her a special speech which is as respect for the contestant.
