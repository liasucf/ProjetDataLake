    "text": "Sabinene is a natural bicyclic monoterpene with the molecular formula C10H16. It is isolated from the essential oils of a variety of plants including holm oak (Quercus ilex) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). It has a strained ring system with a cyclopentane ring fused to a cyclopropane ring. Sabinene is one of the chemical compounds that contributes to the spiciness of black pepper and is a major constituent of carrot seed oil. It also occurs in tea tree oil at a low concentration. It is also present in the essential oil obtained from nutmeg, Laurus nobilis, and Clausena anisata. ==See also== * Thujene, a double bond isomer of sabinene ==References== Category:Hydrocarbons Category:Alkene derivatives Category:Monoterpenes Category:Cyclopropanes Category:Cyclopentanes Category:Isopropyl compounds ",
