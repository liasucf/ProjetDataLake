    "text": "Hans Vonthron (* unknown; \u2020 1989) was a Swiss footballer who played in the late 1930s and the 1940s. He played as midfielder. Vonthron first played for FC Concordia Basel. He joined Basel's first team during their 1940\u201341 season as they played in the 1. Liga und player-manager Eugen Rupf. He played his domestic league debut for his new club in the home game at the Landhof on 15 September 1940 as Basel won 3\u20131 against FC Birsfelden. He scored his first goal for his club on 4 May 1941 in the away game against exactly the same opponents in the last game of that season. Basel won the game 3\u20131 and this victory assured the team the qualification to the promotion play-offs. But in these play-offs Basel were defeated by Cantonal Neuchatel and drew the game with Z\u00fcrich. Their two play-off opponents were thus promoted and Basel remained for another season in the 1 Liga. The following year Basel started the 1941\u201342 league season well. Basel finished their season as winners of group East. The promotion play-offs were then against group West winners FC Bern. The 1st leg was the away tie, this ended with a goalless draw. Basel won the 2nd leg at home at the Landhof 3\u20131 to achieve Promotion. Vonthron played in nearly all of the league games and in all ten cup matches. Again FC Birsfelden turned out to be one of Vonthron's favourate opponents. In both the league match on 9 November as well as in the cup game on 7 December Vonthron was able to score a valuable goal. In the cup Basel advanced to the final, which ended goalless after extra time and a replay was required. This was held on 25 May 1942, in the Wankdorf Stadion, against the new Nationalliga champions Grasshoppers. Basel led by half time through two goals by Fritz Schmidlin, but two goals from Grubenmann a third from Neukom gave the Grasshoppers a 3\u20132 victory. Between the years 1940 and 1948 Vonthron played a total of 206 games for Basel scoring a total of 19 goals. 147 of these games were in the 1. Liga and Nationalliga, 35 in the Swiss Cup and 24 were friendly games. He scored 12 goals in the domestic league, five in the cup and the other two were scored during the test games. As was customary at that time, the players were amateurs and pursued a civil profession. Vonthron was a heating oil and coal merchant. ==References== ==Sources== * Rotblau: Jahrbuch Saison 2017/2018.
