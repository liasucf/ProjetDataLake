Overhead view of yum cha at Dim Sum City in Hong Kong == Etymology == Yum cha in the Cantonese language, both literary and vernacular, literally means \"drink tea\". \"\u98f2\" means \"to drink\", and \"\u8336\" means \"tea\". In Cantonese, yum cha refers to having a meal with dim sum dishes. Dim sum is the English word based on a Cantonese pronunciation of \u9ede\u5fc3. In colloquial Mandarin dialects and Standard Vernacular Chinese based on one form of colloquial Mandarin, this character () is often used to mean \u98f2 for the verb \"drink\". In the Chinese language, \u9ede\u5fc3 refers to a variety of foods, including European-style cakes and pastries, and has no equivalent in English. In the English language, dim sum refers to the small-dish appetizers and desserts. In Australia, the term \"yum cha\" is specifically used to describe Cantonese restaurants serving dim sum from pushable carts, rather than \u00e0 la carte. alt= ==Service== An introductory video on yum cha and dim sum Traditionally, yum cha is practiced in the morning or early afternoon, hence the terms chow cha (, \"morning tea\") or ha ng cha (, \"afternoon tea\") when appropriate. The former is also known as yum zou cha (), which literally means \"drinking morning tea\". Some restaurants now offer dim sum during dinner hours and even late at night, though most venues still generally reserve the serving of dim sum for breakfast and lunch periods. The combination of morning tea, afternoon tea, evening tea, lunch and dinner is known as sam cha leung fan (, \"three tea, two meal\"). The history of the tradition can be traced back to the period of Xianfeng Emperor, who first referred to establishments serving tea as yi li guan (, \"1 cent house\"). These offered a place for people to gossip, which became known as cha waa (, \"tea talk\"). These tea houses grew to become their own type of restaurant and the visits became known as yum cha. alt= The traditional methods of serving dim sum include using trays strung around servers' necks or using push carts. The teoi ce (, \"push-cart\") method of serving dim sum, dates back to the early 1960s and includes dim sum items cooked in advance, placed into steamer baskets, and brought out on push carts into the dining area. Employees call out the items they are serving, customers notify the server about the items they would like to order, and the server places the desired items on the table. The general yum cha atmosphere is a loud, festive one due to the servers calling out the dishes and the groups of diners having conversations. Many dim sum restaurants now use a paper-based \u00e0 la carte ordering system. This method provides fresh, cooked-to-order dim sum while managing the real estate and resource constraints involved with push cart service. Tea cup, tea pot, and bill card. The cost of a meal was traditionally calculated by the number, size and type of dishes left on the patron's table at the end. In modern yum cha restaurants, servers mark orders by stamping a card or marking a bill card on the table. Servers in some restaurants use distinctive stamps to track sales statistics for each server. ==Customs and etiquette== alt= The customs associated with the tea served at yum cha include: * Selecting the type of tea to be served immediately after being seated by the server. * Pouring tea for others before filling one's own tea cup as a sign of politeness. * Filling tea cups to about 80% because of the Chinese proverb \u300c\u300d, which is translated literally as \"it is fraud for the guest if the tea cup is full, but it is a sign of respect when it is alcohol.\" * Tapping the table with two (occasionally one) fingers of the same hand in a gesture known is as 'finger kowtow' that is a gesture of gratitude after receiving tea. This gesture can be traced to the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty, who used to travel incognito. While visiting the Jiangnan region, he once went into a teahouse with his companions. In order to maintain his anonymity, he took his turn at pouring tea. His companions wanted to kowtow, but to do so would have revealed the identity of the emperor. Finally, one of them tapped three fingers on the table (one finger representing their bowed head and the other two representing their prostrate arms). * Flipping open the lid (of hinged metal tea pots) or offset the tea pot cover (on ceramic tea pots) to signal an empty tea pot. Servers will then refill the pot. * Following a traditional practice of washing the utensils with the first round of tea. A basin is available for disposing of the rinse tea. The taste of the first round of tea is considered not the finest yet, and will be richer afterwards.China Times(15 December 2014). \"\u9999\u6e2f\u300c\u98f2\u8336\u79ae\u5100\u300d \u5148\u71b1\u8336\u5148\u6d17\u7897\u6d17\u7b77\u5b50\" [Video file].

Lazy susan at yum cha lunch in Hong Kong with dim sum and lunch dishes While eating, some of the manners include: * Spinning the lazy susan such that the oldest person at the table has the opportunity to have the first serving when the meal starts or when an additional dish is served, as a show of respect. The lazy susan should not be spun when someone is taking food from a dish. * Refraining from standing chopsticks straight up vertically, such as in rice or buns, due to the resemblance of incense offerings for the deceased. * Offering dining companions the final serving when there is one last piece or final serving remaining on a dish. * Insisting on paying the bill as it is common to treat one another to meals . Lin Heung Teahouse == Status and future == Yum cha continues in both traditional and modern forms, including restaurants serving both traditional and modern fusion dim sum.
