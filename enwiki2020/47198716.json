    "text": "The Skipton Academy (formerly Aireville School) is a small rural 11\u201316 coeducational secondary school located in Skipton, North Yorkshire, England. Previously a community school administered by North Yorkshire County Council, Aireville School converted to academy status in September 2014 and was renamed The Skipton Academy. ==Description== The school has a comprehensive admissions policy, but the other two secondary schools in Skipton (Ermysted's Grammar School and Skipton Girls' High School) are both academically selective grammar schools. The school provides a curriculum that covers what pupils will need once they are in the world of work. It offers a wide range of extra-curricular and cultural activities, while enrichment activities include everything from a pantomime rewards trip to a Learn2Earn activity day. The curriculum focuses on the core subjects of English, maths, RE and PE. All students must also choose to study French, geography or history. Other subjects are available, such as computer science, engineering, health and social care, drama and business studies. ==Site== Aireville Hall was the home of the Dewhurst family (silk and cotton manufacturers)and strong non-conformists. It dates from 1836. ==History== The first school was financed by Dewhurst and built next to the Congregational Church. It was one of the British Schools, as distinct from the Tory, established church National Schools. By 1909, the school had expanded and land was bought to by move the school, it became The Brougham Street Council School. With the 1944 Education Act, secondary schools were needed for all children. Brougham Street Secondary Modern School was born, and much expanded in numbers, they used buildings all over the town. In 1958 it moved to the current site. The school now became Aireville Secondary Modern School and later Aireville County Secondary School. The election of the Thatcher government halted the planned reorganisation of the three Skipton School into 11\u201316 comprehensive on the Aireville site and a sixth form college. Over the next three decades the school didn't have many successes, and in 2014, it became a academy, and others from outside the town tried to improve it. In an Ofsted inspection in 2017, it was declared to be inadequate. Ofsted explained that over time,senior leaders have not leadership. Plans and strategies though made have been poorly implemented as have the review procedures. The governors have been complacent and not fulfilled their duties. \"The quality of teaching is inadequate.
