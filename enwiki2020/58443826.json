Tampere 44th International Short Film Festival. Programme catalogue. Tampere, 2014, p. 155. He has been characterised as \u201da wide- ranging, yet uncompromising artist\u201d.Short documentary films by Emilia Ukkonen, Pekka Sassi and Jonna Kina at Kassel Dokfest. AV-arkki 7.11.2017. Accessed 9.9.2018. His working method involves traits of collage or bricolage.Anttila, Hanna Maria: Found Meaning in Found Footage. AV-arkki 2007, p. 12.Kantokorpi, Otso: Mit\u00e4 n\u00e4in? [What did I see?] Taide, kritiikit, 6/2009. Accessed 9.9.2018. He constantly produces music and collects all kinds of images and sounds, integrating self-produced material and found footage to create sound pieces and audio installations or videos that combine sound with moving image. For him, \u201csound is half of the film/video or maybe even more.\u201d He limits the amount of image material and tries to use just the basic effects: cut, dissolve, brightness, contrast.Interview with Pekka Sassi. impakt.nl Accessed 9.9.2018. Structurally, Sassi's works are \u201csimple and vibrant\u201d. > \u201cWhen examined separately, the structure of the video track and sound is > often very simple. But glued together by Sassi, these elements generate a > magic, cathartic experience in the viewer \u2013 as if rock lyrics found just the > right melody.\u201d === Scripted stories === Some of Pekka Sassi's works take the form of scripted stories that range from dystopian horror films to small comic impressions of the everyday.A focus on Finnish media art at the 16th Seoul International New Media Festival (NEMAF). AV-arkki 22.6.2016. Accessed 9.9.2018. > \u201dSassi does not actually describe the world but reconstitutes fragmented > images into basic narratives accompanied by his commentary \u2013 serious and > sometimes even fervent, however, often laced with irony.\u201d > \u201cPekka Sassi\u2019s films show viewers ordinary surroundings that open up into > self-contained universes which exist within and parallel to the real world. > His subtly humorous stories often deal with the relationship between an > individual and his surroundings.\u201d For example, the \u201cKolya saga\u201d, screened at the AAVE festival (Alternative AudioVisual Event) of 2016 in Helsinki, Finland, consists of loosely connected experimental films that address deep themes with a surreal twist.Pekka Sassi's Kolja saga. AAVE Festival 17.4.2016. Accessed 9.9.2018. \u201cKolya and I\u201d (2006) is a black comedy about the relationship between human and God. In \u201cBad News from Heaven\u201d (2007), the \u201cmetaphysical hooligans\u201d Kolya and Yuri are faced with the concept of heaven. \u201cThe Suburb Within\u201d (2009) is, according to the filmmaker, about \u201ccommunication, narration and presence\u201d. It is also a horror film where escalating anguish is created through the soundtrack while the abstract image has a supporting role.Schwierin, Marcel: Die lange Nacht der \u00c4ngste. Werkleitz Festival 2010. Accessed 9.9.2018. The fourth film of the series, \u201cAfter Everything\u201d (2014) emphasises visual narrative and is exceptionally long (28 minutes) compared with Sassi's usually very short videos. The film was produced with support from the Finnish Film Foundation\u201cAfter everything\u201d. Released short films, The Finnish Film Foundation. Accessed 9.9.2018. and premiered at the Tampere film festival of 2014. \u201cAfter Everything\u201d shows a dystopian world where brutality and inhumanity are part of everyday routine. The atmosphere of doom is emphasised by the combination of black and white footage, harsh settings and industrial noise music.\u201cAfter everything.\u201c Tampere 44th International Short Film Festival. Programme catalogue. Tampere, 2014, p. 68. Sassi taps into the conventions and phenomena of contemporary media culture and moves beyond. \u201cSassi\u2019s moving images work like modern poetry or jazz; flirting with existing, recognizable structures and genres \u2013 and simultaneously constructing something new in an intuitive way.\u201d The approach is explicit in \u201dThe Dead House\u201d (2003), a horror film constructed following the clich\u00e9s of the genre but shot in a dollhouse. According to Sassi, \u201cThe Dead House\u201d is a \u201cmake- believe movie.\u201dAvantoscope. Avanto festival 2004. Accessed 9.9.2018. In another piece of work, \u201dIt\u2019s All Around Us Now, Frank\u201d (2006), a Western created in the spirit of Twin Peaks and emphasising narrative through sound, two male characters are forced to face the unknown and their own fears. === Abstract moving image === A parallel strand in Sassi's work combines optical, kinetic and constructivist art with the tradition of abstract experimental film. For example, in \u201cA Friend\u201d (2016) characterised as kinetic and constructivist by Sassi, the moving image is composed of black and white lines and grids. Another recent work, \u201cColours\u201d (2016), characterised as minimalist/constructivist, is a video installation where large colour surfaces are projected in succession on three walls in a 20-minute loop. The immersive work can be seen both as a painting and as moving image.Valjakka, Timo: Viikonlopun n\u00e4yttelykierros. [Weekend tour of exhibitions.] Helsingin Sanomat, 28.1.2017. Sassi explains: \u201cI explored what happens when the element of time is integrated into the examination of an abstract painting by cropping and synchronising images by means of moving image.\u201dSassi, Pekka: Colours \u2013 video installation. www.galleriaheino.fi, 2017.

In a certain manner, he is a formalist whose > roots go back to the early days of experimental film in the beginning of the > last century, but at the same time he is a filmmaker who reacts to the > present and its themes and who puts together his material out of the > congestion on offer.\u201d Sassi's works are characterised by creative integration of simple, and sometimes random, audial and visual elements detected in the surrounding world. In a series of experimental films called \u201cDomestic Studies in Cosmology\u201d a new planet is discovered at the bottom of a paper coffee cup (\u201cVoid\u201d, 2004), a seagull circling around a pier creates a new galaxy (\u201cBird\u201d, 2004) and a black hole is found pulsating in a kitchen sink (\u201cSchwarzschild Radius\u201d, 2004). == Festivals and exhibitions == Works by Pekka Sassi have been recently screened for example at the Stuttgarter Filmwinter (2017)Azar Saiyar, Pekka Sassi, Maarit Suomi-V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen and Pilvi Takala at Stuttgarter Filmwinter.
