    "text": "Steps to an Ecology of Mind is a collection of Gregory Bateson's short works over his long and varied career. Subject matter includes essays on anthropology, cybernetics, psychiatry, and epistemology. It was originally published by Chandler Publishing Company in 1972 (republished 2000 with foreword by Mary Catherine Bateson). The book begins with a series of metalogues, which take the form of conversations with his daughter Mary Catherine Bateson. The metalogues are mostly thought exercises with titles such as \"What is an Instinct\" and \"How Much Do You Know.\" In the metalogues, the playful dialectic structure itself is closely related to the subject matter of the piece. == Part I: Metalogues == > DEFINITION: A metalogue is a conversation about some problematic subject. > This conversation should be such that not only do the participants discuss > the problem but the structure of the conversation as a whole is also > relevant to the same subject. Only some of the conversations here presented > achieve this double format. > > Notably, the history of evolutionary theory is inevitably a metalogue > between man and nature, in which the creation and interaction of ideas must > necessarily exemplify evolutionary process.Steps To an Ecology of Mind *Why Do Things Get in a Muddle?
