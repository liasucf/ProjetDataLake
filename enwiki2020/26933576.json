    "text": "Azerbaijan Airlines Flight 217 was a scheduled passenger flight between Baku and Aktau, Kazakhstan that crashed into the Caspian Sea at ca. 22:40 on 23 December 2005. The flight was operated by an Antonov An-140. ==Crash== Around five minutes after a night-time departure from Baku Airport the crew reported a systems failure. Heading over the Caspian Sea at night without flight instruments made it difficult for the crew to judge their flight parameters. Whilst attempting to return to Baku, the aircraft crashed shortly afterwards on the shore of the Caspian Sea, killing all passengers and crew. ==Aftermath== Investigations from the Kharkov State Aircraft Manufacturing Company have discovered that three independent gyroscopes were not providing stabilised heading and altitude performance information to the crew early in the flight.Kaminski-Morrow, David. \"Crashed An-140 had gyro failure.\" Flight International. 10 January 2006. Retrieved on 14 June 2012. Following the accident, Azerbaijan Airlines grounded the remaining Antonov An-140's and cancelled any future plans of acquiring more of the Ukrainian-built aircraft. ==References== ==External links== *Aviation-Safety.net Category:2005 in Azerbaijan Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2005 Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Antonov An-140 Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving controlled flight into terrain Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Azerbaijan Category:December 2005 events in Asia ",
