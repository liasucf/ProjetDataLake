    "text": "Roy Lancaster Curthoys (4 October 1892 \u2013 24 September 1971) was an Australian journalist and newspaper editor. Curthoys was born in Ballarat and educated in Perth. He began his journalistic career on the Daily News in 1910, later transferring to the West Australian (1916), The Herald (1919), and The Argus (1920). He was a \"leading member\" of the Australian Journalists Association (AJA) and helped establish journalism courses at the University of Western Australia and University of Melbourne. In 1922 he travelled through Europe and North America as a \"special representative\" of the AJA, learning about journalism education. Curthoys was made assistant editor of The Argus in 1925 and editor in 1929. He resigned in 1935 due to a disagreement with the paper's management. For decades Curthoys also served as the Australian correspondent for overseas newspapers, including The Times (1927\u20131958) and The New York Times (1935\u20131957). He maintained a good relationship with Keith Murdoch, who gave him a free office and employed him as a leader writer on occasion. Curthoys was appointed CMG in 1958, after declining an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1951. He died in Melbourne in 1971, aged 78. ==References== Category:1892 births Category:1971 deaths Category:People from Ballarat Category:Australian journalists Category:Australian newspaper editors Category:The New York Times writers Category:The Times journalists Category:Australian Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George Category:20th-century journalists ",
