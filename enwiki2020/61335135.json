    "text": "\"Taking It On\" is a song written by Lynsey de Paul and Ron Roker, and originally published by ATV Music. Although de Paul recorded her own demo version of the song in 1972, her version of the song was not released until 2013 on her Anthology CD album Sugar and Beyond. De Paul also arranged and produced this recording. The song was first released by the dancing ensemble The Young Generation, together with another De Paul/Roker composition \"It's Been a Long Time\", on their album Give Me Love, named after the George Harrison song \"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\" that the Young Generation also cover on the album. It was released in 1973 on the RCA Victor label. The song was also a track on the 1974 German release of a double album of the same name, but which included their other 1973 album \"They Sold A Million\" and had a gatefold sleeve. The Young Generation were a dancing and singing group, created specifically for BBC Television in the late 1960s. \"Taking It On\" was also performed and recorded as a duet by French vocalist and songwriter Sacha Distel and Petula Clark in October 1973, produced by Wayne Bickerton and mastered by Denis Blackham. It was released on the flip side of the duo's single \"(Let The Love Light In Your Eyes) Lead Me On\" on the Polydor label. As well as being a single release, these two tracks, together with the song \"Pretty Cherries\", were destined for an album featuring a series of duets by Clark and Distel for the Polydor label that has yet to be released. ==References== Category:1973 singles Category:Songs written by Lynsey de Paul Category:1972 songs Category:Songs written by Ron Roker Category:Petula Clark songs Category:Musicians from Paris Category:French male singers ",
