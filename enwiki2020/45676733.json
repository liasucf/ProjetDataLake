    "text": "\"To Sleep\" is a poem by William Wordsworth. The speaker is affected by \"insomnia\". He is sleepless all the night, lying on his bed thinking of flocks of sheep that pass near by, the sound of the imaginary rain, murmuring of bees, clear fields and so on. He is reviving all of his thoughts to unlock the treasure of \"SLEEP\". Lying sleepless for three days he is trying by all means of hook and crook to acquire Sleep.\" ==References== Category:Poetry by William Wordsworth ",
