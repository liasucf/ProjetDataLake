After the Prussian invasion of Holland in September 1787 and the following Orange Restoration, the paper initially tried to placate the stadtholder William V, Prince of Orange by welcoming his return, but shortly thereafter the publication was discontinued, and 't Hoen fled abroad (probably France or the Southern Netherlands). In March 1795, after Revolutionary France's successful Flanders campaign and the proclamation of the Batavian Republic, he returned and resumed the publication of what was now called De nieuwe post van den Neder-Rhyn (\"The New Post of the Nether Rhine\") until December 1799. A separate editorial staff without 't Hoen published a few more issues in 1797 en 1798 using the magazine's old title. == References == Category:1781 establishments in the Dutch Republic Category:1787 disestablishments in the Dutch Republic Category:1795 establishments in the Batavian Republic Category:1799 disestablishments in the Batavian Republic Category:Defunct magazines published in the Netherlands Category:Dutch- language magazines Category:Political magazines published in the Netherlands Category:Weekly magazines published in the Netherlands Category:Magazines established in 1781 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1787 Category:Magazines reestablished in 1795 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1799 Category:Mass media in Utrecht (city) Category:Patriottentijd Category:Republicanism in the Netherlands ",
