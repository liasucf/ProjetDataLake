    "text": "Bojong Gede (also can be spelled as Bojonggede) is a district (Indonesian: Kecamatan) in the Bogor Regency, West Java, Indonesia. It is a suburb to Jakarta, and can also be considered as part of its metropolitan region, Greater Jakarta. Thanks to its location being a suburb, Bojong Gede is a rather urbanized district, which also makes it densely populated. Like its other neighbouring districts, it is one of the districts in the regency, that lies in between the city of Depok, and Bogor, both also part of Jakarta Raya. This attracts a rather large residential population for the people who would commute to the cities. ==External links== * * Berita tentang Desa Susukan Kecamatan Bojonggede Category:Districts of Bogor Regency ",
