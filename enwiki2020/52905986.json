On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the season has an approval rating of 90% based on 41 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Smartly unpredictable and led by powerful performances from a talented cast, the darkly compelling The Sinner sinks its hooks in fast and doesn't let go.\" Metacritic, which assigns a rating to reviews, gave the series an average weighted score of 71 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". It was the no. 1 new cable series of 2017, according to Nielsen delayed viewing data. ====Season 2==== A 97% approval rating for the second season was reported by Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7.54/10 based on 33 reviews, and a critical consensus reading, \"In its second season, The Sinner establishes itself as an engrossing why-dunnit thriller series with staying power.\" Metacritic assigned a score of 75 out of 100 based on 16 critics for the second season, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Once again praising the writing and performances, several critics noting that the follow-up series surpassed expectations for season two, as star Jessica Biel's character did not return from the first season. That series had used up the source material from the original book. Alex McLevy of The A.V. Club wrote a rave review of the first few episodes, in particular the performance of Carrie Coon as the mysterious Vera Walker. McLevy wrote that the second season could be even better than the first, noting, > \"Two things keep it from feeling like a rehash of season one: the excellent > choices in new narrative twists made by writer-creator Derek Simonds, and > the caliber of talent involved in bringing it to life. Chief among the > latter group is Carrie Coon, who... brings a wonderful fusion of frazzled > humanism and sinister duplicity to the part, another magnetic performance by > the actor that elevates the material and lends gravitas to some of the more > daffily implausible turns.\" Ben Travers of indieWire wrote, > \"Derek Simonds assembled a helluva team for an intriguing follow-up season. > The first three episodes of Season 2 match the tone and intensity of the > writer's gripping debut, while new cast members Tracy Letts, Natalie Paul, > and Carrie Coon more than make up for any holes left by the original cast. > ... Season 2 has enough going on it could spin off the rails, but the mere > fact it has so much working for it thus far is a big win for everyone > involved. The Sinner is no one-hit wonder.\" ====Season 3==== In Rotten Tomatoes, the season has an approval rating of 85% with an average rating of 7.28/10 based on 13 reviews. Metacritic has assigned a score of 81 out of 100 based on five critics for the third season, indicating \"universal acclaim\". === Ratings === ====Season 1==== ====Season 2==== ====Season 3==== ==Notes== ===Awards and nominations=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:99%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Ceremony ! scope=\"col\" | Category ! scope=\"col\" | Nominee(s) ! scope=\"col\" | Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | |- | rowspan=7| 2018 | rowspan=2| Critics' Choice Television Awards | Best Actor in a Movie/Miniseries | Bill Pullman | | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | |- | Best Actress in a Movie/Miniseries | Jessica Biel | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Golden Globe Awards | Best Actress \u2013 Miniseries or Television Film | Jessica Biel | | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | |- | Best Miniseries or Television Film | The Sinner | |- |People's Choice Awards |The Bingeworthy Show of 2018 |The Sinner | |style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- |Primetime Emmy Award |Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie | Jessica Biel | | style=\"text-align: center;\"| |- | Saturn Awards | Best Television Presentation | The Sinner | | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | rowspan=3|2019 | | Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie | Bill Pullman | | align=\"center\" | |- | rowspan=2|Saturn Awards | Best Action-Thriller Television Series | The Sinner | | align=\"center\" rowspan=2| |- | Best Actor on Television | Bill Pullman | |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2010s American drama television series Category:2010s American LGBT-related drama television series Category:2010s American mystery television series Category:2010s crime drama television series Category:2017 American television series debuts Category:American thriller television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Incest in television Category:Lesbian-related television Category:Serial drama television series Category:Television series by Universal Television Category:Television shows set in New York (state) ",
