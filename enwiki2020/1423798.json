    "text": "Never Take Friendship Personal is the second studio album by alternative rock band Anberlin, released on February 1, 2005 on Tooth & Nail Records. This album was chosen as one of Amazon.com's Top 100 Editor's Picks of 2005. Its singles were \"A Day Late\" and \"Paperthin Hymn\" and music videos have been made of each. \"(The Symphony of) Blas\u00e9\" is sometimes referred to as \"Amsterdam\". The album's name is inspired by when the band chose to remove guitarist Joey Bruce. The song \"Dance, Dance Christa P\u00e4ffgen\" was inspired by multi-talented artist Nico, whose given name was Christa P\u00e4ffgen. The song references her struggle with drugs and unrelated death. ==Critical reception== Never Take Friendship Personal garnered exceedingly positive reception from Music critics. Johan Wippsson of Melodic rated the album four stars, remarking how this \"is a fantastic album and a great follow up, even better than their great debut.\" At Christianity Today, Andy Argyrakis rated the album four stars, highlighting how the album is \"for those seeking an artfully made and engagingly played project, just not ideal for those looking for faith based edification\" on which the music has \"sophisticated alternative sonics, ample hooks and sweeping melodies.\" Rick Anderson of Allmusic rated the album four stars, affirming that it is \"Very highly recommended overall.\" At Cross Rhythms, Tony Cummings rated the album eight squares out of ten, proclaiming that \"Seldom has art rock worn such an accessible sheen.\" Scott Weber of AbsolutePunk rated the album an eighty-eight-percent, stating that the band has the \"ability to construct such beautiful songs with euphoric vocals.\" At Jesus Freak Hideout, John DiBiase rated the album four stars, calling it a \"solid sophomore effort from these experts of catchy, hooky alternative rock.\" Punknews.org's Anchors rated the album four stars, noting the album as \"one hell of a guilty pleasure.\" At CCM Magazine, Louis R. Carlozo graded the album a B-, cautioning that \"while its individual songs (and sing-along hooks) often satisfy, fails to transcend a formulaic plateau.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Anberlin *Stephen Christian \u2013 lead vocals, keyboards *Joseph Milligan \u2013 lead guitar *Nathan Strayer \u2013 rhythm guitar, vocals *Deon Rexroat \u2013 bass guitar *Nathan Young \u2013 drums, percussion Production *Aaron Sprinkle \u2013 producer, engineer *JR McNeely \u2013 mixing *Troy Glessner \u2013 mastering *Brandon Ebel \u2013 executive producer Additional musicians *Phil Sneed \u2013 additional vocals (\"The Runaways\") *Seth Roberts \u2013 additional vocals (\"Stationary Stationery\") *Ryan Clark \u2013 unclean vocals (\"Never Take Friendship Personal\") *Mike Weiss \u2013 guitars (\"Dance, Dance, Christa P\u00e4ffgen\") Artwork *Jeff Gros \u2013 photography *John Deeb \u2013 band photography *Asterik Studio \u2013 art direction & design *Kris McCaddon \u2013 Anberlin logo 'Management *Kyle Griner \u2013 Management for Arson Media Group, Inc *Melody King \u2013 Booking Agent for The Agency Group, Ltd *Chad Johnson \u2013 A&R; *Mike McKoy \u2013 Legal for Serling Rooks & Ferrara, LLP ==References== ==External links== * Category:Anberlin albums Category:2005 albums Category:Tooth & Nail Records albums Category:Albums produced by Aaron Sprinkle ",
