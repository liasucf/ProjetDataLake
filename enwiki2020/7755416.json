The Bet Bet Creek (which separates the two Shires) runs towards the north through the middle of the township and then into the Loddon River. Bung Bong is located on the Pyrenees Highway. It is reported that the name 'Bung Bong' derives from the aboriginal words for 'swamp' or for 'swamp grass'. Bung Bong is also a region, which has a large range of native flora and fauna, South-East of the township is the Bung Bong Nature Conservation Reserve which is used by bush walkers and bird watchers. ==Activities== In 1878 the Bung Bong Farmers' Club held their first \"ploughing match\". There were 18 entries in the competition to plough, \"virgin soil, of a rich chocolate colour\". It was reported, \"that although the ploughmen were new to competitive trials, they showed by the excellence of their work their fitness for their calling.\" For the 1886 (and ninth) ploughing match there were 22 entries. It was held on the Abbott property, half a mile from the Bung Bong railway station and \"the attendance was large\". This time, 10 entrants used double furrow ploughs with one entrant, \"exhibiting Gilsman's patent rotary harrows, which attracted great attention, and were pronounced excellent implements\". At the Wareek Hall there is an Honour Roll, of those from the Bung Bong district, who fought in World War 1. It contains 19 names, including 5 names of those who did not return. Local volunteers have fought major bushfires in the region in December 1880, January 1881, January 1985 and the Black Saturday bushfires in 2009.
