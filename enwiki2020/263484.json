    "text": "James Matthew Dillon (26 September 1902 \u2013 10 February 1986) was an Irish Fine Gael politician who served as Leader of the Opposition and Leader of Fine Gael from 1959 to 1965 and Minister for Agriculture from 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to 1957. He served as a Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) from 1932 to 1969. He was the son of John Dillon, the last leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party (1918), which had been swept away by Sinn F\u00e9in at the 1918 general election, and Elizabeth Mathew. ==Early life== Dillon was born in Dublin. He was educated at Mount St Benedict's, in Gorey, County Wexford, University College Galway and King's Inns. He qualified as a barrister and was called to the Bar in 1931. Dillon studied business methods at Selfridges in London. After some time at Marshall Field's in Chicago he returned to Ireland where he became manager of the family business known as Monica Duff's in Ballaghaderreen, County Roscommon. ==Political career== Between 1932 and 1937 Dillon served as Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) for the Donegal constituency for the National Centre Party and after its merger with Cumann na nGaedheal, for the new party of Fine Gael. Dillon played a key role in instigating the creation of Fine Gael and would become a key member of the party in later years. He remained as TD for Monaghan from 1937 to 1969. Dillon became deputy leader of Fine Gael under W. T. Cosgrave. He resigned from Fine Gael in 1942 over its stance on Irish neutrality during World War II. While Fine Gael supported the government's decision to stay out of the war, Dillon urged the government to side with the Allies. A passionate anti-Nazi, Dillon described the Nazi creed as \"the devil himself with twentieth-century efficiency\". His zeal against Hitler drew him the ire of the German minister to Ireland Eduard Hempel, who denounced him as a \"Jew\" and \"German-hater\". Even Eamonn De Valera, then Taoiseach, was not spared the fierceness of Dillon's rhetoric; when the Taoiseach ridiculed Dillon's stark support for the Allies, noting this meant he had to adopt a Pro-British stance, Dillon defiantly retorted Dillon had a personally eventful 1942: While holidaying in Carna, County Galway he met one Maura Phelan of Clonmel on a Friday. By that Monday the two were engaged and six weeks after that the pair were married. James was 40, Maura 22 years of age.https://www.irishtimes.com/news/dillon-s-wedding-vow-1.234157 Dillon was one of the independents who supported the first inter-party government (1948\u20131951), and was appointed Minister for Agriculture. As Minister, Dillon was responsible for huge improvements in Irish agriculture. Money was spent on land reclamation projects in the areas of less fertile land while the overall quality of Irish agricultural produce increased. Dillon rejoined Fine Gael in 1953. He became Minister for Agriculture again in the second inter-party government (1954\u20131957). In 1959 Dillon became leader of Fine Gael, succeeding Richard Mulcahy. He became president of the party in 1960. In 1965 Fine Gael lost the general election to Se\u00e1n Lemass and Fianna F\u00e1il. The non-Fianna F\u00e1il parties won 69 seats to Fianna F\u00e1il's 72. Had the other parties won four more seats between them, they would have been able to form a government. Having narrowly failed to become Taoiseach, Dillon stood down as Fine Gael leader after the election. On Northern Ireland, while Dillon stood against Partition, he equally opposed any \"armed solution\" or militant nationalist policy, stating: Dillon was a colourful contributor to D\u00e1il proceedings and was noted for his high standard of oratory. He remained a TD until 1969, when he retired from politics. He died in Dublin in 1986 at the age of 83. ==References== ==Further reading== *Maurice Manning, James Dillon: A Biography (Wolfhound Press, 2000) Category:1902 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Alumni of NUI Galway Category:Irish barristers Category:Irish farmers Category:Leaders of Fine Gael Category:Members of the 7th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 8th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 9th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 10th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 11th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 12th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 13th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 14th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 15th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 16th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 17th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 18th D\u00e1il Category:Ministers for Agriculture (Ireland) Category:National Centre Party (Ireland) TDs Category:Politicians from County Dublin Category:Presidential appointees to the Council of State (Ireland) Category:20th-century Irish lawyers Category:Independent TDs Category:Fine Gael TDs Category:Alumni of King's Inns Category:People from Malahide ",
