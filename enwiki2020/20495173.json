    "text": "Adoptive immunity acts in a host after their immunological components are withdrawn, their immunological activity is modified extracorporeally, and then reinfused into the same host.Nagata K, Miyasaka M, Miyasaka N, Yamamoto K, eds. (2003). \"Adoptive transfer.\" [Dictionary for Keywords in Molecular Biology and Immunology], 2nd ed. Tokyo: Igakushoin, Ltd., p. 839\u2013840. Y9800 (in Japanese). This process in its former part is analogous to adoption: a child is once adopted out from their home, grown up, and then returned to their home of birth. Transferred immunological components include immune cells such as T lymphocytes or tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, NK cells, macrophages, or B cells.R\u00e9dei GP (2003). \"adoptive cellular therapy.\" Encyclopedic dictionary of genetics, genomics, and proteomics, 2nd ed. New York: Wiley-Liss, p. 23. . There seems to be some variation in usage of this term. #Transferred components are immune cells and autologous as above. #Transfer of immune cells is made between different individuals of monozygotic twins in human or of the same pure line in experimental animals from immunologically sensitized to naive host, where transferred cells are engrafted without rejection or GVHD in the new host.Tada T, Taniguchi M, Okumura Y, Miyasaka M, eds. (1993). \"Adoptive immunity.\" [Dictionary of Terms in Immunoglogy], 3rd ed. Osaka: Saishin-Igakusha, Ltd., p. 510. C3547 (in Japanese). #Transfer of cells are made between allogeneic hosts but the new host is irradiated for preventing rejection or GVHD.Janeway CA, Travers P, Walport M, Capra JD (1999). Immunobiology : The Immune System in Health and Disease, 4th ed. New York: Garland Pub., .Janeway CA, Travers P, Walport M, Shlomchik M (2001). Immunobiology 5 : The Immune System in Health and Disease, 5th ed. New York: Garland Pub., . #Transfer of cells are made between allogeneic hosts. #Transferred components include cells as well as immune molecules such as immunoglobulins between allogeneic hosts.Abbas AK, Lichtman AH (2003). Cellular and Molecular Immunology, 5th ed. Philadelphia: Saunders, The term is used almost synonymously for \"passive immunity\" in some situations, however, passive immunity acts among xenogeneic hosts; for example, in snake venom immunotherapy, antivenom IgG is obtained from sensitized horse and inoculated to humans.Anderson DM, ed. (2003). \"antivenin (Crotalidae) polyvalent.\" Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary, 30th ed.
