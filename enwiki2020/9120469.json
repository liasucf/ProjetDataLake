    "text": "Pr (\ud80c\ude50 Gardiner sign listed no. O1) is the hieroglyph for 'house', the floor- plan of a walled building with an open doorway. While its original pronunciation is not known with certainty, modern Egyptology assigns it the value of per, but purely on the basis of a convention specific to the discipline. However, the Ancient Greek rendering of the title pr-`3 as suggests the reconstruction of the historical (Late Egyptian) pronunciation as *par, see Pharaoh#History of the Pharaoh title. Pr combined with an associated \"personal name\", god, or location becomes the \"house of .... .\" An example for pharaoh Setnakhte is the city of: Pr-Atum, (city of Pithom). Pr and ankh-(life) is a \"combination hieroglyph\" and is the \"word\" for house of life. The \"house of life\" is a library for papyrus books-(scrolls), as well as a possible scriptorium. The shape of pr in beginning dynasties had variations in the shape of a square, with the opening. See Garrett Reference for tomb of Official Ti. Pr is one of hieroglyphs adopted into the Proto-Sinaitic script, the earliest known alphabetic writing system. It was used to represent the phoneme /b/ as in bayt, the Canaanite word for \"house\", after the hieroglyph's original meaning. The Latin letter B is a distant descendant of this letter. ==See also== *List of Egyptian hieroglyphs *Pr-Bast *Pr-Medjed *Pr-Nemty *Pr- Wadjet *Pi-Ramesses *Pi-Sekhemkheperre * Per-Sopdu ==Notes== The Per Ankh was also known as \"The House of Life.\"It was made by Thoth, the egyptian god. ==References== *Garrett, Kenneth.
