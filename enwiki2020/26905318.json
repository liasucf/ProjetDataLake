    "text": "Joshua Ben Karha (, Yehoshua ben Karcha (or ben Korcha), was a Jewish Tanna sage of the fourth generation. ==Biography== He was a colleague of Rabbi Meir and Shimon ben Gamliel II, and a disciple of Rabbi Akiva. Some believe that he was the son of Rabbi Akiva, who is referred to in the Talmud as the \"kere'ah,\" the \"bald-headed one.\"Rashi on Bekhorot 58a; Rashbam on Pesachim 112a However, others disagree.Compare Tosafot Pesachim 112a He never mentions Akiva in his teachings, and would have done so had Akiva been his father.Jewish Encyclopedia, JOSHUA B. \u1e32AR\u1e24A Joshua was bald; and once in a dispute with a heretic who taunted him on this score, he refuted his opponent with remarkable readiness of wit.Shabbat 152a His affection for his people is shown by the indignation with which he rebuked Eleazar b. Simeon (who had delivered the Jewish criminals over to the Romans): \"You vinegar son of wine [= \"degenerate scion of a noble father\"], how long will you give the people of our God unto death?\".Bava Metziah 83b He lived to a great age; and when he blessed Judah haNasi he added the wish that Judah might live half as long as himself.Megillah 28b ==Teachings== The Mishnah cites few of Ben Karha's halakhic commentaries in his name, and the few ones that are recorded, are either in context with him or in conjunction with another Tannaitic sage. Thus, in another reference, the Talmud cites Karha's practice as performed on the authority of Eleazar ben Azariah,\"Similarly, R' Yehoshua ben Karcha would declare pure due to [the authority of] R' Eleazar ben Azariah.\" (Tosefta, Tractate Negaim, 7:3) and in an additional reference, on the authority of R. Yochanan ben Nuri.Talmud Yerushalmi, Tractate Kil'ayim, 4:2 Similarly, he gave his halakhic ruling along with R. Jose ben Halafta, in the matter of the construction of Jericho.Talmud Yerushalmi, Tractate Sanhedrin, 14:2 In comparison with the few halachic commentaries, many aggadah commentaries are recorded in his name. ==References== Category:Mishnah rabbis ",
