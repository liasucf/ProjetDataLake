Thus far, the group has released four full-length records, Winter Hours, Path of Totality, Savage Gold, and The Grand Annihilation. ==History== The group was founded by guitarist/vocalist Mike Hill, bassist Domic Seita and drummer Justin Ennis in 2007. In 2009, the group released their first full-length album, Winter Hours through Relapse Records, and in 2011, released their second full-length album and most recent release, Path of Totality. The album was met with critical acclaim. A song titled \"Ashes\" was featured in the Decibel Magazine October 2012 issue as a part of its Flexi-Series. On August 29, 2012, another song titled \"Heroes\", originally by David Bowie, was made available for streaming on Ghettoblaster. According to Mike Hill, the band has half an albums worth of material already written, with the hopes of entering the studio early 2013 to record their next release. Tracking for their third record, Savage Gold, began on November 11, 2013 with producer Erik Rutan at Mana Recording Studios in Florida. On March 27, 2014, the track listing, album artwork and release date for Savage Gold were revealed. ==Musical style and influences== The band's sound has been described as a combination of multiple metal styles, styles which include black metal, hardcore, doom metal, and sludge metal. Frontman Mike Hill does not regard their sound to be sludge metal. Rather, he has likened the group's sound to being more black metal inspired. Citing influences, Hill has named bands such as Neurosis, Swans, Joy Division, Darkthrone, Black Flag, Deathspell Omega, Leviathan and Bauhaus, among others, as being influential to the group's sound. ==Band members== Currenthttp://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Tombs/3540372249 * Mike Hill \u2013 lead vocals, guitars (2007\u2013present) * Ben Brand \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals (2013\u2013present) * Evan Void \u2013 guitars, backing vocals (2014\u2013present) * Fade Kainer \u2013 synthesizers, backing vocals (2014\u2013present) * Charlie Schmid \u2013 drums (2014\u2013present) Former * Andrew Hernandez \u2013 drums (2009\u20132014) * Dan Howard \u2013 guitars (2012) * Carson Daniel James \u2013 bass (2009\u20132012) * Justin Ennis \u2013 drums (2007\u20132009) * Domenic Seita \u2013 bass (2007\u20132008) * Garett Bussanick \u2013 guitars (2013) ===Timeline=== ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== *2009: Winter Hours (Relapse Records) *2011: Path of Totality (Relapse Records) *2014: Savage Gold (Relapse Records) *2017: The Grand Annihilation (Metal Blade Records) *2020: Under Sullen Skies (Season of Mist) ===Compilations=== *2010: Fear Is the Weapon ===Extended plays=== *2007: Tombs *2008: Tombs/ Planks (split EP with Planks) *2016: All Empires Fall *2020: Monarchy of Shadows ==References== ==External links== * * * *Interview with Mike Hill of Tombs at The Bone Reader Category:2007 establishments in New York City Category:American black metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 2007 Category:Musical groups from Brooklyn Category:Heavy metal musical groups from New York (state) Category:American avant-garde metal musical groups Category:American post- metal musical groups Category:Relapse Records artists ",
