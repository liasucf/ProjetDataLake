A Global History of Architecture by Francis D. K. Ching, Mark M. Jarzombek, Vikramaditya Prakash The building was severely damaged during the Lebanon's civil war. In recent years towering buildings and marina development have gained supremacy over it. The blast that killed Rafik Hariri in 2005 seriously damaged the building and a bronze statue of him is nearby. The building was being restored at the time of the assassination.
