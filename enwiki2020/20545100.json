Two \"rival\" schemes to provide the stadium have emerged in previous months. The first is a \"sports village\" at Island Farm by local company HD Limited. It will provide a 15000-seater stadium for Crusaders, and smaller stadia for Bridgend Ravens and Bridgend Town. In addition to this, parkland, an extension to Bridgend Science Park, an indoor sports/training centre, a specialist tennis centre and facilities for other sports such as boxing will be provided. An outline application was lodged with Bridgend County Borough Council in September 2009 . The second scheme is at a brownfield site to the north east of the town centre at Brackla. It is being developed by Wigan-based developers Greenbank Partnerships, who developed Leigh Sports Village and Olympian Homes. Their scheme includes a stadium, hotel, leisure facilities and retail outlets. They hope to regenerate areas of the town centre also. . ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Bridgend Category:Proposed stadiums in the United Kingdom Category:Stadiums in Wales Category:Rugby union stadiums in Wales Category:Rugby league stadiums in Wales Category:Proposed buildings and structures in Wales ",
