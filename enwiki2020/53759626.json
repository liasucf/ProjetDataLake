    "text": "Engineering Drawing by Thomas Ewing French (1871-1944), Mech. Eng., OSU 1895, also known as A Manual of Engineering Drawing for Students and Draftsman, was first published in 1911 by McGraw-Hill Book Company. It appeared in fourteen editions and was last published in 1993. The title and author remained the same through the first six editions. French died during the publication years of the Sixth Edition, so the Seventh Edition was revised by his colleague at Ohio State University, Charles J. Vierck. The Eighth through Tenth editions had the same title and were also authored by Charles J. Vierck. For the Eleventh and Twelfth editions, the book title changed to Engineering Drawing and Graphic Technology. Following the death of Vierck in 1980, the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Editions were additionally authored by Robert J. Foster, Penn State University. In North America, this textbook was widely used for education of drafters, engineers, and architects. == History == It was during the year 1910 that Martin M. Foss, a traveling representative of the newly organized McGraw-Hill Book Company, in calling on the Department of Engineering Drawing, recognized in the group headed by Professor Thomas E. French one of the most successful and talented groups in its field in the United States. He said to Professor French: \"We want a new mechanical drawing text. \" \"There are already fifty drawing books on the market\" protested French. \"But which is standard?\" countered Foss. \"We want a text that will be widely accepted as the standard work on the subject.\" Professor French accepted the challenge. Discarding the time-worn name \"Mechanical Drawing\" he coined a new title and wrote a text, \"A Manual of Engineering Drawing for Students and Draftsmen\", which was published in 1911. He was ably assisted by Assistant Professor Robert Meiklejohn, Instructors Owen E. Williams, Arthur C. Harper, Cree Sheets, Frederick W. Ives, William D. Turnbull and William J. Norris, which were the entire teaching staff of the department. The staff contributed immeasurably in the preparation of drawings, problem material as well as advice and suggestions in the text. This pioneering book (now in its 10th edition) made publishing history. It was a truly monumental classic, and for many years was a perennial leader in its field and held the American publishers record as the best selling of all college textbooks. This text is attributed to giving great impetus to the McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, as well as helping Martin Foss, who later became President of the company. As an author of textbooks, Professor French is perhaps unequalled by anyone else in his field in the world. The following quotation is taken from the Ohio State University Monthly, February 1935, p. 148: \"Not only is he famous as the 'father of the Stadium' idea, but his textbook, A Manual of Engineering Drawing, has taken the name of Professor Thomas E. French, Mech. E., '95 into 400 colleges and universities throughout the world. It is the most widely used text on engineering extant.\" The fifth edition of this book is now used by engineering students in schools throughout the world, and has been translated into several different languages. This book became a best seller for the McGraw Hill publishing company, and reportedly its sales kept the company from bankruptcy during the depression. == Films == Starting with the Seventh Edition in 1947, 16mm sound motion picture films were created to complement the instruction found in the textbook. This practice continued through the Eleventh Edition.
