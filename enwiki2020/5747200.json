    "text": "\"C Moon\" is a pop song with a reggae beat, written by Paul and Linda McCartney and performed by Wings. It was released as a double A-side with \"Hi, Hi, Hi\" in 1972. The single reached No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart and since \"Hi Hi Hi\" was banned by the BBC, \"C Moon\" received much airplay in the United Kingdom. In the United States, \"C Moon\" did not appear on any of the major record charts. ==Lyrics and structure== The name \"C Moon\" was inspired by lyrics in the song \"Wooly Bully\" by Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs. McCartney said, \"There's a line in [Wooly Bully] that says, 'Let's not be L7.' Well, L7, it was explained at the time, means a square\u2014put L and 7 together and you get a square... So I thought of the idea of putting a C and a moon together (a half- moon) to get the opposite of a square. So 'C Moon' means cool, in other words.\" The recording includes a missed-cue intro that was kept in the released version.Luca Perasi, Paul McCartney: Recording Sessions (1969-2013), L.I.L.Y. Publishing, 2013, , p.92 The song is in the key of C and is in 4/4 time. The performers change instruments from their usual places. Guitarist Henry McCullough plays drums, guitarist Denny Laine plays bass, and drummer Denny Seiwell plays xylophone. The song was recorded around the same time as \"Hi, Hi, Hi\", in November 1972. ==Releases== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Country !align=\"left\"|UK !align=\"left\"|USA !align=\"left\"|Germany !align=\"left\"|France !align=\"left\"|Japan |- |align=\"left\"|Label | style=\"text- align:center;\"|Apple | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Apple | style=\"text- align:center;\"|EMI Electrola/Apple | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Apple | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Apple |- |align=\"left\"|Catalogue number | style=\"text-align:center;\"|R 5973 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1857 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1C006-05208 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|2C006-05208 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|EAR-10241 |- |align=\"left\"|Release date | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 December 1972 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|4 December 1972 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|December, 1972 | style=\"text-align:center;\"| | style=\"text- align:center;\"|20 January 1973 |- |align=\"left\"|Chart ratings | style=\"text- align:center;\"|5 (16 January 1973) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|\u2014 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|N/A | style=\"text-align:center;\"|N/A | style=\"text- align:center;\"|26 (February, 1973) |} The song was included on the Paul McCartney compilation albums All the Best!
