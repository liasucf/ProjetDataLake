    "text": "Ebenezer John Collett (22 May 1755 - 31 October 1833) was an English hop merchant who served as Tory MP for the rotten borough of Grampound from 1814 to 1818, then MP for Cashel from 1819 to 1830. Collett unsuccessfully contested the Great Grimsby parliamentary seat in 1812, but was returned on a vacancy for Grampound two years later on the interest of Sir Christopher Hawkins. He voted against Catholic relief in 1816 and 1817, and also against education of the poor in 1818. Defeated at Grampound in 1818, he was found a seat at Cashel by Sir Robert Peel, as he had given \u2018a never failing support\u2019 and was \u2018a Protestant\u2019. He duly voted against Catholic relief again in 1819. Although representing an Irish constituency, he never went to Ireland, but held his seat until 1830. Collett was the fourth son of Joseph Collett of Hemel Hempstead and Sarah n\u00e9e Smith. He married Margaret Alsager (died 7 March 1826), daughter of cloth merchant Thomas Alsager, on 17 November 1795. ==References== Category:1755 births Category:UK MPs 1812\u20131818 Category:UK MPs 1818\u20131820 Category:UK MPs 1820\u20131826 Category:UK MPs 1826\u20131830 Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for constituencies in Cornwall Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for County Tipperary constituencies (1801\u20131922) Category:Tory MPs (pre-1834) Category:1833 deaths ",
