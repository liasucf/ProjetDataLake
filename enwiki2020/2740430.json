    "text": "Jean-Louis Duport (4 October 17497 September 1819), sometimes known as Duport the Younger to distinguish him from his older brother (and teacher) Jean- Pierre (1741-1818), was a cellist, pedagogue, and composer. He is perhaps best known today for his 21 \u00e9tudes for solo cello that constitute the final part of the \"Essai sur le doigt\u00e9 du violoncelle et sur la conduite de l'archet\" (\"Essay on the fingering of the violoncello and on the conduct of the bow\") (1806), a seminal work of cello technique. He also wrote six cello concertos and his \u00c9tudes pour violoncello. In 1812, Jean-Louis returned to Paris, where he encountered Napoleon, who insisted on trying out Duport's Stradivarius cello, exclaiming, \"How the devil do you hold this thing, Monsieur Duport?\" Duport was so obviously afraid that Napoleon would damage it, that Napoleon laughingly returned it to the cellist's more careful hands. Actually, Napoleon had made a small dent in the ribs of the cello, which may still be seen in the instrument. It was later owned by Auguste Franchomme and also Mstislav Rostropovich. ==\"Essay on the fingering of the violoncello and on the conduct of the bow\"== \"Essai sur le doigt\u00e9 du violoncelle et sur la conduite de l'archet\" (\"Essay on the fingering of the violoncello and on the conduct of the bow\") is a seminal work of cello technique, by Duport, published by Imbault in Paris in 1806. The French text of 175 pages discusses in detail a wide range of aspects of cello technique, and is followed by 21 Etudes for two cellos, of various difficulty levels. The work has been translated into English and German, and is widely accepted as the most influential pedagogical work for the instrument. ==References== ==External links== * Jean-Pierre and Jean-Louis Duport A biography of the Duport brothers at the Internet Cello Society * Category:French classical cellists Category:French composers Category:French male composers Category:1749 births Category:1819 deaths Category:Burials at P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery ",
