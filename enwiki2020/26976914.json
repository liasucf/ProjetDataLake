Prior to the 1901\u201302 season, Lancaster was a rugby union club. ==Background== John Pinch was born in Lancaster, Lancashire, and he died aged 75 in Lancaster, Lancashire. ==Playing career== ===International honours=== John Pinch won caps for England while at Lancaster in 1896 against Wales, and Ireland, in 1897 against Scotland. ===Change of Code=== When Lancaster converted from the rugby union code to the rugby league code for the 1901\u201302 season, John Pinch would have been approximately 31 years of age. Consequently, he may have been both a rugby union and rugby league footballer for Lancaster. ==References== ==External links== *Search for \"Pinch\" at rugbyleagueproject.org *Search for \"John Pinch\" at britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk Category:1870 births Category:1946 deaths Category:England international rugby union players Category:English rugby union players Category:Lancaster RFC players Category:Sportspeople from Lancaster, Lancashire Category:Rugby union forwards ",
