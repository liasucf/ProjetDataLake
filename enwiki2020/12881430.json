So make sure!\" Growing up in London, McGrath and her mother used to go makeup shopping when she was six years old. Fashion became a huge inspiration for McGrath, stimulating her creative approach. McGrath also looks to models that bring her personal inspiration. McGrath says, \"They are their own women, representing a mix of ethnicities, sizes, and backgrounds, they allow me to experiment and create the looks I dream of in my head.\" She considers models Naomi Campbell, Hailey Baldwin, Paloma Elsesser, Jasmine Sanders, Mallory Merk and Ruby Aldridge as her muses.

There is no one like Naomi.\" McGrath calls Paloma Elsesser's face \"the ultimate canvas\", for her hypnotic complexion that \"guides a makeup artist's touch.\" Much of McGrath's inspiration derives from making the natural skin salient.Jade Taylor, \"Makeup Artist Pat McGrath Talks Beauty Icons And Her Highlighter Kit,\" Nylon Magazine (2016).

For years I've been using a custom mix of products to achieve different levels of luminosity from fresh baby skin to a supercharged power-glow.\" The sequin packaging of her makeup line also derives from McGrath's inspiration of sequins, a reoccurring element in many of her looks. The most important element of McGrath's inspiration stems from unique individuality and beauty, breaking away from traditional standards. McGrath values beauty beyond superficiality, looking at the story behind the person she sees. On the definition of beauty, she believes that \"real and true beauty comes from within. It's like an energy, because the task of bringing out beauty\u2014and at times creating it\u2014really is like a puzzle. Often in my work, the approach to beauty is to seek perfection, yet sometimes beauty is imperfect or quite raw.\" ==References== ==External links== Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:British make-up artists Category:English people of Jamaican descent Category:People from Northampton Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:British cosmetics businesspeople ",
