    "text": "In organic chemistry, a nucleophilic addition reaction is an addition reaction where a chemical compound with an electrophilic double or triple bond reacts with a nucleophile, such that the double or triple bond is broken. Nucleophilic additions differ from electrophilic additions in that the former reactions involve the group to which atoms are added accepting electron pairs, whereas the latter reactions involve the group donating electron pairs. == Addition to carbon\u2013heteroatom double bonds == Nucleophilic addition reactions of nucleophiles with electrophilic double or triple bond (\u03c0 bonds) create a new carbon center with two additional single, or \u03c3, bonds.March Jerry; (1985). Advanced Organic Chemistry reactions, mechanisms and structure (3rd ed.). New York: John Wiley & Sons, inc. Addition of a nucleophile to carbon\u2013heteroatom double or triple bonds such as >C=O or -C\u2261N show great variety. These types of bonds are polar (have a large difference in electronegativity between the two atoms); consequently, their carbon atoms carries a partial positive charge. This makes the molecule an electrophile, and the carbon atom the electrophilic center; this atom is the primary target for the nucleophile. Chemists have developed a geometric system to describe the approach of the nucleophile to the electrophilic center, using two angles, the B\u00fcrgi\u2013Dunitz and the Flippin\u2013Lodge angles after scientists that first studied and described them. :Nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl This type of reaction is also called a 1,2 nucleophilic addition. The stereochemistry of this type of nucleophilic attack is not an issue, when both alkyl substituents are dissimilar and there are not any other controlling issues such as chelation with a Lewis acid, the reaction product is a racemate. Addition reactions of this type are numerous. When the addition reaction is accompanied by an elimination the reaction type is nucleophilic acyl substitution or an addition-elimination reaction. ===Addition to Carbonyl groups=== With a carbonyl compound as an electrophile, the nucleophile can be: * water in hydration to a geminal diol (hydrate) * an alcohol in acetalisation to an acetal * a hydride in reduction to an alcohol * an amine with formaldehyde and a carbonyl compound in the Mannich reaction * an enolate ion in an aldol reaction or Baylis\u2013Hillman reaction * an organometallic nucleophile in the Grignard reaction or the related Barbier reaction or a Reformatskii reaction * ylides such as a Wittig reagent or the Corey\u2013Chaykovsky reagent or \u03b1-silyl carbanions in the Peterson olefination * a phosphonate carbanion in the Horner\u2013Wadsworth\u2013Emmons reaction * a pyridine zwitterion in the Hammick reaction * an acetylide in alkynylation reactions. * a cyanide ion in cyanohydrin reactions In many nucleophilic reactions, addition to the carbonyl group is very important. In some cases, the C=O double bond is reduced to a C-O single bond when the nucleophile bonds with carbon. For example, in the cyanohydrin reaction a cyanide ion forms a C-C bond by breaking the carbonyl's double bond to form a cyanohydrin. ===Addition to Nitriles=== With nitrile electrophiles, nucleophilic addition take place by: * hydrolysis of a nitrile to form an amide or a carboxylic acid * organozinc nucleophiles in the Blaise reaction * alcohols in the Pinner reaction. * the (same) nitrile \u03b1-carbon in the Thorpe reaction. The intramolecular version is called the Thorpe\u2013Ziegler reaction. * Grignard reagents to form imines. The route affords ketones following hydrolysis or primary amines following imine reduction. == Addition to carbon\u2013carbon double bonds == The driving force for the addition to alkenes is the formation of a nucleophile X\u2212 that forms a covalent bond with an electron-poor unsaturated system -C=C- (step 1). The negative charge on X is transferred to the carbon \u2013 carbon bond. :Nucleophilic addition to an alkene In step 2 the negatively charged carbanion combines with (Y) that is electron-poor to form the second covalent bond. Ordinary alkenes are not susceptible to a nucleophilic attack (apolar bond). Styrene reacts in toluene with sodium to 1,3-diphenylpropane Sodium-catalyzed Side Chain Aralkylation of Alkylbenzenes with Styrene Herman Pines, Dieter Wunderlich J. Am. Chem. Soc.; 1958; 80(22)6001\u20136004. through the intermediate carbanion: :Reaction of styrene with sodium in toluene Another exception to the rule is found in the Varrentrapp reaction. Fullerenes have unusual double bond reactivity and additions such has the Bingel reaction are more frequent. When X is a carbonyl group like C=O or COOR or a cyanide group (CN), the reaction type is a conjugate addition reaction. The substituent X helps to stabilize the negative charge on the carbon atom by its inductive effect. In addition when Y-Z is an active hydrogen compound the reaction is known as a Michael reaction. Perfluorinated alkenes (alkenes that have all hydrogens replaced by fluorine) are highly prone to nucleophilic addition, for example by fluoride ion from caesium fluoride or silver(I) fluoride to give a perfluoroalkyl anion. == References == Category:Addition reactions Category:Reaction mechanisms ",
