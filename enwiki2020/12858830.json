    "text": "Take a Chance was a Canadian quiz show by Roy Ward Dickson adapted from radio. It was one of the first series on CTV when the network began in 1961. The program was produced in Toronto at CFTO-TV and was broadcast Mondays at 9:30 PM (EST). Sheila Billing, the Miss Toronto pageant winner of 1955, was a co- host of the program. On its premiere, Toronto Star television critic Jeremy Brown deemed the show to be \"painful to watch\" and \"dreary\", complaining that the programme lacked structure, suspense and substantial prize monies. At one point, 438,000 viewers participated in the contests by submitting chewing gum wrappers as Chiclets was the programme's key sponsor. Take a Chance aired until 1965. ==References== ==External links== * TVArchive.ca article Category:1961 Canadian television series debuts Category:1965 Canadian television series endings Category:1960s Canadian game shows Category:CTV Television Network original programming Category:Quiz shows Category:Television series produced in Toronto ",
