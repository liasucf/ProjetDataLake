It had jurisdiction over regions of Slovakia () and Subcarpathian Rusynia (), at that time parts of former Czechoslovakia. Its seat was in Mukachevo. ==Earlier history of Eastern Orthodoxy in the region== Eastern Orthodox Church in Kom\u00e1rno (Slovakia), built in the middle of 18th century under jurisdiction of the Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Buda The early history of Eastern Orthodox Christianity in the regions of Mukachevo (southwestern part of modern Ukraine) and Pre\u0161ov (eastern Slovakia) was marked by missions of two famous saints, Cyril and Methodius and their disciples in Great Moravia and neighbouring Slavic lands during 9th and 10 century. After the Hungarian conquest of the region and the acceptance of Roman Catholicism as official form of Christianity in the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, Eastern Orthodoxy was gradually suppressed. Ecclesiastical order of Eastern Orthodox Church in the region was later revived under the influence of Metropolitanate of Kiev in Kievan Rus. During the late Middle Ages an Eastern Orthodox Eparchy of Mukachevo existed under the jurisdiction of Metropolitanate of Kiev.Encyclopedia of Ukraine, vol. 3 (1993): Mukachevo Saint Nicholas's Monastery Eastern Orthodoxy was especially strong among the population of Rusyns, until the middle of 17th century when the Union of Uzhhorod (1646) was brought about in the Kingdom of Hungary. As a result of the Union, a separate Greek Catholic Eparchy of Mukachevo was created. During the times of suppression, remaining Eastern Orthodox Christians from the region established ties with neighboring Eastern Orthodox Eparchy of Buda of the Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107 and later with the Metropolitanate of Karlovci. One of the most northern parishes of the Serbian Orthodox Church existed in the city of Kom\u00e1rom (Kom\u00e1rno) with local church built in 18th century still standing today.The Changing World Religion Map: Sacred Places, Identities, Practices and Politics (2015), p. 430. During 18th and 19th century, authorities of Austria-Hungary were suppressing Eastern Orthodoxy in the region, and even at the beginning of 20th century Christians who wanted to reestablish Eastern Orthodox structure in the region of Mukachevo were judicially persecuted in the \"Marmaro\u0161 trials\" (first in 1904,\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0446 (2009): \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0417\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c\u044f \u0432 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448-\u0421\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0435 second in 1913),\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0446 (2009): \u0412\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0439 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448-\u0421\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441\u0441 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0432 \u0417\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435 just because in 1902\u20131903 they approached Serbian Orthodox Bishop Lukijan Bogdanovi\u0107 of Buda and Serbian Patriarch Georgije Brankovi\u0107 of Karlovci, asking them to create new parishes in the region.

In the new state, Eastern Orthodox communities were mainly located in the eastern parts of the country, including Carpathian Rusynia that was incorporated into Czechoslovakia in 1919. In that region, the city of Mukachevo was located with its traditions going back to the old Eastern Orthodox Eparchy of Mukachevo, that existed until the Union of U\u017egorod. In the spirit of Eastern Orthodox revival, many people in the region left the jurisdiction of Greek Catholic Church. Since there were no Eastern Orthodox bishops in Czechoslovakia, local leaders looked to the Serbian Orthodox Church because Serbs were historically and ethnically close to Czechs, Slovaks and Rusyns. That view was also supported by state authorities of Czechoslovakia (1920). In order to regulate the ecclesiastical order, Bishop Dositej Vasi\u0107 of Ni\u0161 (Serbia) arrived in Czechoslovakia and met with leaders of Eastern Orthodox community, receiving them into full communion (1921).The Czechoslovak Heresy and Schism: The Emergence of a National Czechoslovak Church (1975), p. 43. Among those wanting to restore ties with Eastern Orthodoxy was a Catholic priest Mat\u011bj Pavl\u00edk, who had been interested in Eastern Orthodoxy. The Serbian Orthodox Church thus consented to receive him in full communion and he became Archimandrite with the name Gorazd, in honor of Saint Gorazd of Moravia disciple and successor of Saint Methodius, Archbishop of Moravia. On 25 September 1921, Archimandrite Gorazd was consecrated Bishop of Moravia and Silesia at the Cathedral of the Holy Archangel Michael in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, by Serbian Patriarch Dimitrije. Bishop Gorazd received jurisdiction over Czech Lands.Martyr Gorazd of Prague Since jurisdiction of Bishop Gorazd was confined to Czech lands,Historie na\u0161\u00ed pravoslavn\u00e9 c\u00edrkve Eastern Orthodox Christians in Slovakia and Carpathian Rusynia were placed under administration of visiting bishops of Serbian Orthodox Church who were gradually preparing the creation of a new eparchy. Final preparations were made during the visit of Serbian Bishop Josif Cvijovi\u0107 in 1930. By the end of 1931, Eastern Orthodox renewal in eastern Slovakia and Carpathian Rusynia was progressing well, allowing the creation of a new Diocese that was named: Eparchy of Mukachevo and Pre\u0161ov.Eastern Churches Journal: A Journal of Eastern Christendom, vol. 4 (1997), p. 61 The Diocese was created under the auspices of Serbian Orthodox Church. First bishop of Mukachevo and Pre\u0161ov was Damaskin Grdani\u010dki, who established administrative structures of new eparchy and created a well-organized diocesan center in Mukachevo.Bishop Damaskin (Grdani\u010dki) In 1938, he was succeeded by Bishop Vladimir Raji\u0107. In 1938, after First Vienna Award, southern parts of Slovakia and Carpathian Rusynia were annexed by Hungary. Since the city of Mukachevo was taken by Hungary, bishop Vladimir had to move to the city of Khust. In 1939, the Nazi Germany annexed the remainder of the Czech lands into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and installed a pro-Nazi regime in the Slovak State. In the same time, Hungary occupied the rest of Carpathian Rusynia and in 1941 Hungarian authorities deported bishop Vladimir Raji\u0107 to Serbia. Years of Nazi occupation (1938/9-1944/5) were marked by renewed restrictions and persecutions of Eastern Orthodoxy.Four fighting years (1943), p. 69. In 1945, after the integration of Zakarpattia Oblast into USSR, eastern parts of the Eparchy of Mukachevo and Pre\u0161ov were transferred from the supreme jurisdiction of Serbian Orthodox Church to the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church, and on that territory new Eparchy of Mukachevo and U\u017egorod was formed, while the western part of the diocese remained in Czechoslovakia and was reorganized as Eparchy of Pre\u0161ov.\u042e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043b\u0435\u0446 (2008): \u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0426\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c \u0432 \u0417\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0440\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435: \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043e\u0447\u0435\u0440\u043a ==Eastern Orthodox bishops of Mukachevo and Pre\u0161ov== * Damaskin Grdani\u010dki (1931\u20131938) * Vladimir Raji\u0107 (1938\u20131945) ==See also== * Serbian Orthodox Church * Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church * Saint Nicholas Monastery (Mukachevo) * Eparchy of Mukachevo and Uzhhorod ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * ==External links== * Official web page of the Eastern Orthodox Church in Slovakia * Serbian Orthodox Church Category:Orthodox Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia Category:Defunct religious sees of the Serbian Orthodox Church Category:Eastern Orthodoxy in Ukraine Category:Eastern Orthodoxy in Slovakia ",
