It is part of Tsing Kwai Highway of Route 3. Its east end connects to Rambler Channel Bridge and west Cheung Tsing Highway. The tunnel was opened on 22 May 1997 and is the second toll-free tunnel in Hong Kong. Its length is about 1.6 kilometres. ==Construction== The tunnel was given the name \"Cheung Ching\" (\u9577\u9752) because it is beneath Cheung Ching Estate, the first public housing estate on the island. Construction through the granite of Tsing Yi Peak required explosives to get through the hardness of the hill. To prevent dislodging of rocks and buildings on the surface slopes the rocks were reinforced by concrete and steel. Although the tunnel used explosives in its construction, boring was more used as the primary digging procedure. ==Management== The tunnel was managed by Tsing Ma Management Limited under Tsing Ma Control Area, along with Tsing Ma Bridge, Kap Shui Mun Bridge, Ting Kau Bridge, Rambler Channel Bridge, North Lantau Highway and Tsing Kwai Highway. The traffic of the tunnel is monitored in the buildings at both end, namely East Portal and West Portal Buildings. ==External links== *A brief introduction by Tsing Ma Management Limited Category:Tsing Yi Category:Road tunnels in Hong Kong Category:Tunnels completed in 1997 Category:1997 establishments in Hong Kong ",
