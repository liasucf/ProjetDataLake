    "text": "Art Pictures Studio is a major Russian film-making company that operates both in the domestic and international market. Founded in 1992 by Fedor Bondarchuk and Dmitry Rudovsky, the studio is part of the Art Pictures Group. Until 2005 the company specialized primarily in the filming of commercials and music videos, and then filmmaking was chosen as the key goal of the studio\u2019s activities. The group collaborated with the company Non-Stop Production (films The 9th Company, Dark Planet, Stalingrad etc.). In 2006 the movie The 9th Company was proposed by Russia for the American Academy Awards. In 2006 Art Pictures acquired the status of a film company and was named Art Pictures Studio. The first independent film experience in the industry was the film Heat, the most profitable film of the year. In 2009 Art Pictures Studio released Dark Planet. The movie became the top ten highest-grossing films in the history of Russian distribution and won a number of film awards. ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year !!
