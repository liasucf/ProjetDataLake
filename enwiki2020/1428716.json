At first, due to his physical style, Mofrad played some good football and became a regular stater for his club. He was a member of the 2004\u201305 Foolad team that won the Iran's Premier League football championship. The season after though his performances significantly dropped in quality and he got less playing time. When Mayeli Kohan became the team's manager Mofrad, along with a number of the other well known Foolad players, left the club. In August 2006 he signed with Foolad's rival, Esteghlal Ahvaz but only stayed for one season. He then moved back to Foolad and played on the 2007\u201308 and 2008\u201309 seasons for them. ===Club career statistics=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! colspan=3 | Club performance ! colspan=2 | League ! colspan=2 | Cup ! colspan=2 | Continental ! colspan=2 | Total |- !

He had received his first cap for the national team, a number of weeks before that tournament on September 1, 2002 versus Jordan. He was a constant call up to the national team until 2005, but his poor form in the 2005\u201306 season cost him his spot in the national team. Having been a couple of years away from Team Melli, in June 2007 he was once again called up to the national team and appeared in a friendly match against Mexico. ==Honurs== ===Club=== Persian Gulf Cup 2003\u201304 with Foolad ===National=== WAFF 2004 ==External links== * Jalal Kameli Mofrad at TeamMelli.com Category:1981 births Mofrad, Jalal, Kameli Category:Iranian footballers Category:Foolad FC players Category:Esteghlal Ahvaz players Category:Persian Gulf Pro League players Category:Azadegan League players Category:Iran international footballers Category:2004 AFC Asian Cup players Category:Iranian Arab people Category:Asian Games gold medalists for Iran Category:Asian Games medalists in football Category:Footballers at the 2002 Asian Games Category:Association football defenders Category:Medalists at the 2002 Asian Games Category:People from Shadegan ",
