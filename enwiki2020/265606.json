Notable among that firm's salesmen was Alger Hiss, the former Assistant Secretary of State, who was brought down in a spy scandal in the 1950s. The Serra family bought the building in 1978 and allowed the building to empty out as tenants left over the years as their leases expired. A proposed 1981 conversion of the building eliminated the inclusion of residential space based on the economics of paying displaced commercial tenants a fee of $9 per square foot.Oser, Alan S. \"Real Estate; SoHo Loft For Use as Galleries\", The New York Times, November 25, 1981.
