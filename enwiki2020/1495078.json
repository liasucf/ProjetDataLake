Joseph Unterman, November 1938, both in the signature and also in the seal was the first Chief Rabbi of Ireland, his term lasting from 1921 to 1936. From 1936 until his death in 1959, he was Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of the British Mandate of Palestine and of Israel after its independence in 1948. ==Biography== Isaac Halevi Herzog was born in \u0141om\u017ca, Poland, the son of Liba Miriam (Cyrowicz) and Joel Leib Herzog. He moved to the United Kingdom with his family in 1898, where they settled in Leeds. His initial schooling was largely at the instruction of his father who was a rabbi in Leeds and then later in Paris. After mastering Talmudic studies at a young age, Yitzhak went on to attend the Sorbonne and then later the University of London, where he received his doctorate. His thesis, which made him famous in the Jewish world, concerned his claim of re-discovering Tekhelet, the type of blue dye once used for the making of Tzitzit. Rabbi Herzog's descendants have continued to be active in Israel's political life. His son Chaim Herzog was a general in the Israel Defense Forces and later became ambassador of Israel to the UN and President of Israel. His son Yaakov Herzog served as Israel's ambassador to Canada and later as Director General of the Prime Minister's Office. He also accepted an offer to become Chief Rabbi of the British Commonwealth but due to ill health never took up that role. His grandson Isaac Herzog was a member of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, and head of the opposition. He previously served as housing and tourism minister and minister of welfare. ==Rabbinic career== Rabbi Herzog served as rabbi of Belfast from 1916 to 1919 and was appointed rabbi of Dublin in 1919. A fluent speaker of the Irish language, he supported the First D\u00e1il and the Irish republican cause during the Irish War of Independence, and became known as \"the Sinn F\u00e9in Rabbi\". He went on to serve as Chief Rabbi of Ireland between 1922 and 1936, when he immigrated to Palestine to succeed Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook as Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi upon his death. He became a supporter of both the Irish Republican Army and the Irgun.Calder Walton, 'British Intelligence and Threats to British National Security After the Second World War,' in Matthew Grant (ed) The British Way in Cold Warfare: Intelligence, Diplomacy and the Bomb 1945-1975, A&C; Black, 2011 pp.141-158 p.151. In May 1939, shortly before the Second World War, the British put out the White Paper of 1939 restricting Jewish immigration to Palestine. After leading a procession through the streets of Jerusalem, with an unusually united Jewish following from all sects, on the steps of the Hurva Synagogue he turned and said: \"We cannot agree to the White Paper. Just as the prophets did before me, I hereby rip it in two.\" Some 40 years later, on 10 November 1975 Ambassador Herzog repeated his father's gesture with the UN resolution that Zionism is equal to racism. During the Second World War, Rabbi Herzog travelled with great risk to the US, and back, not before he was able to secure a meeting with Roosevelt. Roosevelt smiled and did not reply to the Rabbi's pleadings for a promise to help the Jews of Europe. His biographer records that several people noticed that his hair turned white when he left the meeting, which he perceived as a failure. Following this, he immediately returned home, missing the ride on a ship that was sunk by a U-boat, and taking what was said to be the last civilian ship to cross the Atlantic during the war. After the war, Rabbi Herzog dedicated himself to saving Jewish children especially babies and bringing them back from their places of hiding throughout all of Europe, to their families or to Jewish orphanages. Many of these were hidden in Christian monasteries or by Christian families, and refused to return them. In his biography, he tells of the difficulties he had of meeting the Pope who avoided him, but did receive in the end assistance from the Vatican. In later years it was found that Karol Wojty\u0142a, future Pope John Paul II, was the contact who helped the rabbi out.On Popes and Jews, Akiba Zimmerman, Hazofe newspaper archive (Hebrew). It is said as an urban legend, that one tactic he had for proving which children were Jewish, although still in denial or mostly afraid of the monastery staff, would be to call out the Shema Yisroel and Jewish children would instinctively cover their eyes along with him. However, defenders of Pope Pius XII have asserted that Herzog had maintained friendly relations with the pontiff during and after the World War II. In 1945, he stated: \u201cThe people of Israel will never forget what His Holiness and his illustrious delegates are doing for our unfortunate brothers and sisters in the most tragic hour of our history, which is living proof of Divine Providence in this world.\u201d ==Published works== Rabbi Herzog was recognised as a great rabbinical authority, and he wrote many books and articles dealing with halachic problems surrounding the Torah and the State of Israel. Indeed, his writings helped shaped the attitude of the Religious Zionist Movement toward the State of Israel. Rabbi Herzog authored: *Main Institutions of Jewish Law *Heichal Yitzchak *Techukah leYisrael al pi haTorah *Pesachim uKetavim *The Royal Purple and the Biblical Blue == Awards and recognition== * In 1958, Rabbi Herzog was awarded the Israel Prize, in Rabbinical literature. ==See also== *History of the Jews in Ireland *History of the Jews in Northern Ireland *Herzog (disambiguation) *Shmuel Wosner *List of Israel Prize recipients ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1888 births Category:1959 deaths Category:People from \u0141om\u017ca Category:People from \u0141om\u017ca Governorate Category:Polish Jews Category:Levites Category:20th-century rabbis Category:Chief rabbis of Ireland Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:British people of Polish-Jewish descent Category:British Jews Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to Ireland Category:Irish people of Polish-Jewish descent Category:Irish people of Polish descent Category:Irish Jews Category:Irish nationalists Category:British emigrants to Mandatory Palestine Category:Jews in Mandatory Palestine Category:Israeli people of Polish-Jewish descent Category:University of Paris alumni Category:Alumni of the University of London Category:Rabbis in Mandatory Palestine Category:Chief rabbis of Israel Category:Israel Prize Rabbi recipients Category:Israel Prize in Rabbinical literature recipients Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog Category:Burials at Sanhedria Cemetery Category:Irish Zionists ",
