    "text": "Janne Myrdal is a Republican member of the North Dakota Senate, representing the 10th district. Myrdal was first elected in 2016, defeating Democrat Quentin Wenzel. Myrdal is a homemaker from rural Edinburg. In January 2017, Myrdal cosponsored House Bill 1185, which would have classified all internet- connected devices as \"pornographic vending machines\" that must make unavailable any \"obscene material and obscene performances\" unless the end user of such a device requests an opt-out in writing and pays the state a $20 opt-out fee. Facing international ridicule, the cosponsors dropped the bill from further consideration. Also in January 2017, Myrdal posted to her personal Facebook page a rainbow flag that had been defaced with a swastika. The post linked to an article that criticized LGBT opposition to then- president-elect Donald Trump. In January 2019, Myrdal cosponsored a bill to require physicians to tell women that it is possible to reverse a drug-induced abortion. Myrdal said the bill was about providing options to pregnant women, but the head of the state\u2019s sole abortion clinic said the claim was not backed by science. The bill did become law, but was blocked by a federal judge on the grounds that it required doctors to lie to their patients. ==References== ==External links== *Official legislative website Category:North Dakota state senators Category:North Dakota Republicans Category:Women state legislators in North Dakota Category:Living people Category:21st-century American politicians Category:21st-century American women politicians Category:People from Skien Category:American people of Norwegian descent Category:Norwegian emigrants to the United States Category:People from Walsh County, North Dakota Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
