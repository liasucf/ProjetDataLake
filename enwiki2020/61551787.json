    "text": "Moffatt eddies are sequence of eddies that develop in corner bounded by plane walls (or sometimes between a wall and a free surface) due to arbitrary disturbance exerting on asymptotically large distances from the corner. Although the source of motion is the arbitrary disturbance at large distances, the eddies develop quite independently and thus solution of these eddies emerges from an eigenvalue problem, a Self-similar solution of the second kind. The eddies are named after Keith Moffatt, who discovered these eddies in 1964Moffatt, H. K. (1964). Viscous and resistive eddies near a sharp corner.

Describing the two-dimensional planar problem by the cylindrical coordinates (r,\\theta) with velocity components (u_r,u_\\theta) defined by a stream function such that :u_r = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial\\theta}, \\quad u_\\theta=-\\frac{\\partial\\psi}{\\partial r} the governing equation can be shown to be simply the biharmonic equation abla^4\\psi=0. The equation has to be solved with homogeneous boundary conditions (conditions taken for two walls separated by angle 2\\alpha) : \\begin{align} r>0,\\ \\theta =-\\alpha: &\\quad u_r = 0, \\ u_\\theta= 0\\\\\\ r>0,\\ \\theta =\\alpha: &\\quad u_r = 0, \\ u_\\theta= 0. \\end{align} The Taylor scraping flow is similar to this problem but driven inhomogeneous boundary condition. The solution is obtained by the eigenfunction expansionShankar, P. N. (2007). Slow Viscous Flows: Qualitative Features and Quantitative Analysis Using Complex Eigenfunction Expansions (With CD-ROM). World Scientific., :\\psi = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty A_n r^{\\lambda_n} f_{\\lambda_n}(\\theta) where A_n are constants and the real part of the eigenvalues are always greater than unity. The eigenvalues \\lambda_n will be function of the angle \\alpha, but regardless eigenfunctions can be written down for any \\lambda, : \\begin{align} f_0 &= A + B\\theta + C\\theta^2 + D\\theta^3,\\\\\\ f_1 &= A\\cos\\theta + B \\sin\\theta + C\\theta\\cos\\theta + D\\theta\\sin\\theta,\\\\\\ f_2 &= A\\cos 2\\theta + B \\sin 2\\theta + C\\theta + D,\\\\\\ f_\\lambda &= A\\cos\\lambda\\theta + B\\sin\\lambda\\theta + C\\cos(\\lambda-2)\\theta + D\\sin(\\lambda-2)\\theta, \\quad \\lambda\\geq 2. \\end{align} For antisymmetrical solution, the eigenfunction is even and hence B=D=0 and the boundary conditions demand \\sin 2(\\lambda-1)\\alpha = -(\\lambda-1) \\sin 2\\alpha. The equations admits no real root when 2\\alpha<146\u00b0. These complex eigenvalues indeed correspond to the moffatt eddies. The complex eigenvalue if given by \\lambda_n = 1+(2\\alpha)^{-1}(\\xi_n+i\\eta_n) where : \\begin{align} \\sin\\xi \\cosh\\eta &= - k\\xi,\\\\\\ \\cos\\xi \\sinh \\xi &= - k\\eta. \\end{align} Here k=\\sin 2\\alpha/2\\alpha. ==See also== *Taylor scraping flow ==References== Category:Fluid dynamics Category:Flow regimes ",
