    "text": "William Charles Schuster (August 4, 1912 in Buffalo, New York \u2013 June 28, 1987 in El Monte, California) was a professional baseball player who played shortstop in the Major Leagues from 1937 to 1945. He would play for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Boston Bees, and Chicago Cubs. Schuster scored the winning run in the Chicago Cubs' last victory in a World Series game, prior to 2016. He was a pinch-runner in the 11th inning of Game 6 at Wrigley Field in the 1945 World Series and scored from first base on Stan Hack's walk-off double for an 8-7 Cub win over Detroit. It turned out to be Schuster's last appearance in a Major League game. After retiring as a player, Schuster managed the Vancouver Capilanos of the Western International League in 1950 and 1951, served as a third base coach for the Seattle Rainiers, worked in the press room of the Los Angeles Times and worked at a gas station in Woodland Hills, California before dying of a heart attack at age 75. For his long career in the minor leagues, which included 2,168 hits over 16 seasons, Schuster is a member of the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1912 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Major League Baseball shortstops Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:Boston Bees players Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Baseball players from New York (state) Category:Sportspeople from Buffalo, New York Category:Buffalo Bulls baseball players ",
