    "text": "{| |} The Suffren class anti-air frigates were first-rank destroyers of the French Navy, designed to protect a fleet against air threats, surface ships, submarines, and, to a lesser extent, provide firepower against land objectives. They were the first French ships to be built specifically as guided missile frigates. ==Design== The two ships were designed as escorts for the s and are similar in concept to the British Type 82 destroyer. The French class designation is FLE 60. The primary weapon is the Masurca surface to air missiles which are launched from a twin launcher on the quarter deck. 48 missiles were carried. Fire control was via the DRBI 23 3D radar housed in a massive radome. Anti-submarine weapons include a Malafon anti-submarine missile system (13 missiles carried) and torpedo catapults. Exocet missiles were fitted in 1977-79 replacing the Malafon. Both ships were modernised with the fitting of new electronics in the early 1990s, with Suffren the first to undergo the process between in 1989-90, followed by Duquesne between 1990-91. == Ships == The two ships of the class were both named after French admirals. Three ships were initially planned with more in a follow-on group, but budgetary constraints caused by building the nuclear deterrent submarines caused the programme to be terminated at two ships. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
