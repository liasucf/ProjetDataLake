The route crosses four of the Bay State's 13 interstates, as well as U.S. Route 1 (US 1), US 3, Route 2 and Route 128 as it heads from the northern hills of Worcester County through the northern portions of Greater Boston, ending in the North Shore city of Beverly at Route 127. ==Route description== Route 62 begins in Barre, in the north central hills of Worcester County, at Routes 32 and 122, at that town's commons. It heads northeastward into the town of Hubbardston, crossing Route 68 before heading into Princeton. In Princeton, Route 62 has a short concurrency with Route 31. It then crosses into Sterling, intersecting with Route 140 and passing underneath Interstate 190 without junction, before passing through that town's center concurrently with Route 12. Eastbound with Route 70 in Clinton Eastbound in Maynard Wood Square, Hudson, at the junction of Routes 62 & 85 From Sterling, Route 62 passes through the southern end of the town of Lancaster before entering Clinton. In Clinton, it is concurrent with Route 70 for most of the town, with a short section being triply concurrent, with Route 110. Routes 62 and 70 pass through the center of town and pass the dam on the Nashua River which creates the Wachusett Reservoir before Route 62 heads eastward again, splitting with Route 70 just north of the Boylston town line. After crossing through the town of Berlin, it crosses Interstate 495 at Exit 26 before crossing into Middlesex County and the town of Hudson. In Hudson, Route 62 has a short concurrency with Route 85 as it heads eastward, crossing the Assabet River before entering northward into the town of Stow. At the center of Stow, Route 62 turns eastward again, becoming concurrent with Route 117 for two miles into the town of Maynard. In Maynard, the route crosses the Assabet twice more, the second time concurrently with Route 27. Following the path of the Assabet, it then passes through the far southern corner of Acton before heading into Concord. In Concord, Route 62 joins that town's Main Street, passing the West Concord Depot, a commuter rail stop along the Fitchburg Line. As Main Street, Route 62 intersects Routes 2/2A and crosses the Sudbury River before leaving that road at Concord's town common, just south of the site of the Battle of Concord. Route 62 continues northeastward into Bedford, where it shares a concurrency with Routes 4 and 225, passing the historic Fitch Tavern before splitting from those roads. It then splits from that route, crossing U. S. Route 3 at Exit 26 before entering Burlington. It crosses the old Middlesex Turnpike before arcing northward to meet Route 3A just south of the Billerica town line. It becomes concurrent with Route 3A southward for half a mile before turning northward, heading into the town of Wilmington. In Wilmington it crosses Routes 38 and 129 just south of the Wilmington Station along the Lowell Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail line. It then crosses Interstate 93 at Exit 40 just east of Route 62's junction with the southern end of Route 125. After crossing I-93, Route 62 heads eastward into North Reading. It shares a quarter-mile long concurrency with Route 28 before continuing eastward through the town into Essex County and the town of Middleton. In Middleton, Route 62 heads north one final time, sharing a short wrong-way concurrency with Route 114 before turning eastward, crossing the Ipswich River before finally turning southeastward into the town of Danvers. In Danvers, the route has consecutive interchanges with U.S. Route 1 (along the Newburyport Turnpike) and I-95, just north of the former Danvers State Hospital site. It continues eastward, crossing Route 35 and Route 128 (at Exit 22) before entering Beverly. In Beverly, Route 62 crosses Routes 1A and 22 before finally ending at Route 127, just a tenth of a mile north of Mackerel Cove, Beverly Harbor and Massachusetts Bay. ==Major intersections== ==References== *\"Massachusetts Atlas and Gazetteer.\" Yarmouth, Maine: DeLorme.
