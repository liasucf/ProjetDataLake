The trio also hosted The CBS Children's Film Festival, introducing international children's films, from 1967 to 1977. ==Biography== ===Early years=== Frances Helen Allison was born to Jesse Louis (1871\u20131941) Allison and Anna M \"Nan\" (n\u00e9e Halpin; 1876\u20131957) Allison in La Porte City, Iowa, where her father worked as a clerk in a grocery store until his stroke in 1913. They then moved in with her paternal grandparents, David Allison, a Civil War veteran, and Susan (n\u00e9e Booth) Allison. Their house still stands on Sycamore Street in LaPorte City, IA. She was a 1927 graduate of Coe College, where she was a member of Alpha Gamma Delta. She was a fourth-grade teacher for four years in Schleswig and Pocahontas, Iowa, before beginning her broadcasting career at WMT in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. (Another source describes WMT as \"Waterloo radio station WMT.\") In 1934, Allison was among \"14 sectional winners in the Hollywood Hotel radio contest.\" ===Radio=== Allison as Aunt Fanny She moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1937, where she was hired as a staff singer and personality on NBC Radio.

Her Aunt Fanny character also appeared on the ABC-TV series, Ozark Jubilee, during the late 1950s. While in Chicago, she was also heard on Those Websters. ===Kukla, Fran and Ollie=== In 1947, the director of WBKB-TV in Chicago asked Burr Tillstrom if he could put together a puppet show for children, and he asked Allison, whom he had met during a World War II war bond tour, to join the show. She was the only human to appear on the live series, filling the role of big sister and cheery voice of reason as the puppets, known as the Kuklapolitan Players, engaged each other. ===Other television work=== Her television career continued after the initial run of Kukla, Fran and Ollie: in the late 1950s, she hosted The Fran Allison Show, a panel discussion TV program in Chicago; and appeared in television musical specials including Many Moons (1954), Pinocchio with Mickey Rooney (1957), Damn Yankees (1967) and Miss Pickerell (1972). She had her own program, The Fran Allison Show on WGN-TV (1958-1960).

In 1950 her recording of \"Peter Cottontail\" charted at #26 around Easter of 1950. The next year her recording of \"Too Young\" achieved position #20. In both recordings she is backed by Jack Fascinato, who was the orchestra leader of Kukla, Fran and Ollie. ===Recognition=== In 1950, Allison was nominated for an Emmy Award as Most Outstanding Kinescoped Personality. In 1959, she won two Chicago Emmy awards. In 2002, she was a Silver Circle honoree of the Chicago/Midwest Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. In 1967, Iowa Wesleyan University awarded her an honorary doctorate of letters. ===Personal life=== Allison was married to music publisher Archie Levington.
