The main mission of this type of ship is the escort and protection of a carrier strike group formed around an aircraft carrier, usually the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle or one of the aircraft carriers of the US Navy, or an amphibious operation carried out by amphibious helicopter carriers. The ships specialty is air traffic control in a war zone, but it can be employed in a wide variety of missions, such as intelligence- gathering, special forces operations, or in protecting less well-armed vessels. Horizon frigates such as the Chevalier Paul are the most powerful surface combatants that France has ever built. In service since the end of 2011, it bears the visual code D621. Its namesake is Jean-Paul de Saumeur, better known as Chevalier Paul, a French naval officer born in Marseille in 1598. Nantes is the godmother city of the FDA Chevalier Paul since 17 March 2012.Source: Association of Military Cities of the Armed Forces ==Service history== French destroyer at Valparaiso. Chevalier Paul was launched by DCN at Lorient on 12 July 2006. She is a sister-ship to . This ship was approved by the French Navy in December 2008 and is based in the military port of Toulon. He made the first launch of an MM40 Block 3 missile by a French navy ship on 17 March 2010. It made its first long-term crossing from 18 March 2010, which should end in mid-July, and admitted to active service on 10 June 2011, when the ship was engaged three days later in Operation Harmattan, the French contribution to the 2011 military intervention in Libya. On 29 August 2013, Chevalier Paul left the port city of Toulon. Some reports claimed she had been deployed to the eastern Mediterranean in response to the Syrian Civil War, but the navy authorities declined to confirm she was heading for Syria. From 13 to 26 October 2014, the frigate took part in the large international operational exercise Catamaran 2014 that practiced an amphibious assault. In November 2015, a French Navy press release stated that Chevalier Paul was to be part of the task force launching strikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. the ship is a component of the Charles de Gaulle Carrier Strike Group, which left Toulon on 13 January for a mission of approximately five months and must be engaged for eight weeks in the gulf. On 18 November 2015, Charles de Gaulle set sail and joined its carrier strike group, of which Chevalier Paul is a member. It also consisted of the , the , the British destroyer , the supply ship Marne and a nuclear attack submarine. In May 2017, it completed its intermediate technical stop which saw the replacement of the two 76 mm turrets named \"Hercule\" and \"Licorne\". == Weapon systems == ===Aster missile=== Chevalier Paul with an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean Sea Aster missiles are the main weapon system of Chevalier Paul. The ship is equipped with 32 Aster 30 missiles and 16 Aster 15 missiles, housed in vertical silos of the Sylver A50 type, located on the foredeck. A main anti- air missile system (PAAMS), combined with an EMPAR multifunction radar operating in C-band, controls launch and target tracking. The first launch of an Aster 30 against a target from sister ship Forbin took place in November 2008 at Toulon. It was the first fire of this machine since a frigate. The previous Aster 30 launches from the sea were carried out from a British barge and the Italian test ship Carabiniere. The missile was fired at an aerial target from the evolving building off the DGA's Le Levant test and launch center . The Aster 30 missiles of the air defense frigate are the second bulwark of protection of the carrier strike group, after the Rafale fighters, and provide 360\u00b0 protection at a distance of 100 kilometers against aircraft and 30 kilometers against grazing and maneuvering anti-ship anti-ship missiles in service or in development. The French Navy has shown with the frigate Forbin its capacity to destroy a supersonic missile ( 3,000 km / h ) maneuvering ( SS-N-22, AS-17, BrahMos ) and at an altitude of less than 5 meters above water by shooting down a GQM-163 Coyote. ===Exocet MM40 Block 3C=== Chevalier Paul embarks eight sea-sea Exocet missiles installed on the upper deck amidships. The most recent version MM40 Block 3C of the Exocet missile was selected. It can operate at a distance of more than 180 kilometers from its objective. ===Others=== Two turrets with OTO-Melara 76 mm cannon fully automated, implemented from the Central Operation, and have a rate of fire of 60 to 120 rounds per minute. Each turret, weighing 5.5 tonnes, is gyrostabilized, in order to be able to maintain its position despite the movements of the building. It has a barrel containing 60 shells which can be refueled in real time by servants recovering the ammunition arriving from the ammunition compartment via an elevator. More than 1,000 shells of different types (land, surface or anti-aircraft fire) are stored, with a maximum range of 13 kilometers against surface targets, and 2 manual guns of 20 mm mod. replaced in 2018 by 3 Narwhal 20 mm automatic cannons. == Test and development campaigns == Chevalier Paul with a Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk in the Mediterranean Sea ===November 2007: long crossing=== Chevalier Pauls first trip to the sea took place in November 2007. Two years later, the Navy received ship. ===5 May 2009: Horizon class meeting and naval review=== On 5 May 2009, the four Horizon-class frigates of the French and Italian navies met off La Spezia, Italy. Chevalier Paul remained moored there until 7 May in the evening. On 8 May 2009, on the occasion of the 64th anniversary of the Victory of 8 May 1945, the Forbin participated in the naval review which was held off Sainte- Maxime, in the Var. Sixteen buildings are present, including the most recent such as the French ship Mistral (L9013) Nicolas Sarkozy takes place, and also the French ship Tonnerre (L9014). ===18 March 2010: long crossing=== After the icy waters, Chevalier Paul descends to the North Sea and briefly participates in the NATO exercise Brillant Mariner ( 12 to 22 April 2011), which also involves the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle and the BPC Mistral. Then the frigate crosses the Atlantic to reach the United States and Canada, before descending south to the Caribbean, stopping over in Mexico and crossing the Panama Canal. She then begins a tour of South America and normally arrives in Rio de Janeiro in June 2011. The Chevalier Paul then crosses the Atlantic to reach Morocco, then finds, in mid-July, the naval base of Toulon. == Awards == On 6 July 2016, following Operation Arromanches 2 in the eastern Mediterranean, the frigate received the Belgian military cross. == Coronavirus pandemic == During the COVID-19 pandemic, on 15 April 2020, the Ministry of Armed Forces reported that, out of the 1,767 tests conducted on the members of the carrier battle group led by , 668 returned positive. The vast majority of these cases were aboard Charles de Gaulle, and the remainder of the cases were aboard Chevalier Paul. On 12 April the French Navy reported that Charles de Gaulle and accompanying air-defense frigate Chevalier Paul had returned to Toulon, while command and replenishment tanker and anti-submarine frigate had returned to Brest. The 200 sailors of Chevalier Paul were subsequently quarantined for two weeks. On 15 April, the Ministry of Armed Forces reported that, out of the 1,767 tests that had been conducted on the members of the carrier battle group so far, 668 had returned positive. The vast majority of these cases were aboard Charles de Gaulle, and the remainder of the cases were reported to be aboard Chevalier Paul. On 17 April, , Central Director of the Military Health Service, reported to the that all 2,300 sailors of the carrier battle group had been tested upon their return to Toulon, and so far, 940 had tested positive while 645 had tested negative. On the same day, Florence Parly, Minister of the Armed Forces, reported to the National Assembly's that 2,010 sailors of the carrier battle group had been tested, with 1,081 tests returning positive so far. In total, 545 sailors had shown symptoms and 24 had been hospitalized at the Saint Anne Army Teaching Hospital, including one admitted to an ICU. On 29 April 2020, the Navy stated that 19 sailors aboard Chevalier Paul had tested positive upon arrival at Toulon. On 11 May 2020, Florence Parly reported to the National Assembly the conclusions of two investigations into the outbreak on board the carrier, stating that the virus had first arrived before a stopover made in Brest, and that although the command and medical team aboard the carrier had \"excessive confidence\" in their ability to deal with the virus, the investigations did not consider them at fault. Parly further explained that the introduction of the virus on board the carrier happened sometime between when it left Limassol, Cyprus, on 26 February 2020, and when it arrived at Brest on 13 March. During this time, personnel had been brought on board via air from either Cyprus, Sicily, the Balearic Islands, Spain, or Portugal. The spread of the virus, however, was exacerbated by the stopover at Brest. Social distancing and other measures were taken after the stopover, but they weighed heavily on crew morale, so after enforcing the strict measures for a fortnight, they were relaxed, and a concert on board was authorized for 30 March. Parly also noted that all soldiers aboard Charles de Gaulle have since recovered from the disease except for one sailor, who was still hospitalized after leaving the ICU. == Notes == ==References== ==External links== * Chevalier Paul Anti Air Warfare Destroyer Chevalier Paul on Alabordache Category:Horizon-class frigates of the French Navy Category:Active frigates of France Category:2006 ships Category:Ships built in France Category:Naval ships involved in the COVID-19 pandemic ",
