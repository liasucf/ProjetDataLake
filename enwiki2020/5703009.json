The Jaseni\u010dka reka originates on the eastern slopes of the meridionally elongated Deli Jovan mountain in the Carpathian region of the eastern Serbia. The river springs out under the mountain's highest peak, Crni vrh (Black peak) and flows to the east, originally under the name of Vrelska reka. The area is sparsely populated (villages of Popovica and Trnjane). The river enters the Negotin Valley region, between the villages of Karbulovo and Jasenica, the river turns north, and from this point it is generally known as the Jaseni\u010dka reka. The river forms an arc to the north, begins to flow to the south at the village of Milo\u0161evo and after few kilometers reaches to town of Negotin, the regional center of the Negotin Valley. The Jaseni\u010dka reka then turns east, passes next to the dual village of Kobi\u0161nica-Bukov\u010de and empties into the Danube just some 1.5 km north of the mouth of the river Timok. == See also == * List of rivers of Serbia * Jasenica Category:Rivers of Serbia Category:Tributaries of the Danube Category:Timok Valley ",
