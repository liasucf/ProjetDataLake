    "text": "State of Emergency is the fourth studio album by Australian punk rock band The Living End, released in Australia and New Zealand on 4 February 2006 and internationally on 11 July 2006. It debuted in the number one position of the Australian ARIA charts. The album's first single was \"What's on Your Radio\", released in November 2005. The follow-up single, \"Wake Up\" was released on 18 February 2006, and debuted at number 5 on the ARIA charts, making it the highest single debut position of the band (not including the EP Second Solution / Prisoner of Society). At the J Award of 2006, the album was nominated for Australian Album of the Year. The limited edition comes with a DVD, documenting the stages of the album's production and shows footage of the band's concerts, including performances as The Longnecks and at Splendour in the Grass. They also released a live DVD of the State of Emergency tour, Live at Festival Hall. A limited edition vinyl of the album, limited to 500 copies worldwide, was also released. ARIA publicized that State of Emergency had officially achieved 2x platinum status in Australia in November 2007. The album is the band's second highest selling, behind the efforts of their record-breaking debut album. == Background == In December 2005, The Living End, as The Longnecks, played gigs in Sydney featuring tracks from the album. This was to test out audience reactions to new songs in order to ready themselves for the Big Day Out music festival. Tracks were also given a live airing in festivals of late 2005 and early 2006, such as the 2005 Homebake festival at The Domain, Sydney. The Living End played at Splendour in the Grass, a music festival in Byron Bay, the day before they were due to start recording State of Emergency. Band members decided that if they got positive reactions during their performance, they'd do well producing the record and be in the right frame of mind to do so. == Track listing == === How to Make an Album and Influence People === How to Make an Album and Influence People is a documentary DVD covering the making of State of Emergency, showing live and behind the scenes footage of the band. Starting from laying down the basic tracks in a practice studio, to the re-introduction of Nick Launay (producer of the band's seconds studio album, Roll On) and playing a gig at Splendour in the Grass in 2005, before heading to the studio to record and mix the album. The DVD came as a bonus with the limited edition album. == Personnel == The Living End * Chris Cheney \u2013 vocals, guitar * Scott Owen \u2013 double bass, backing vocals * Andy Strachan \u2013 drums, backing vocals Backing vocals on \"Wake Up\" * Christina Bell * Michael Bell * John Boneventura * Ruby Bryant * Olivia Bunting * Eva Conner * Scarlett Conner * Jessica Dredge * Alan Gibson * Mila Grant * India Murphy * D'arcy Noonan * Mia Quinsee-Jarvis * Rebecca Schwarz * Nicholas Schwarz Visuals and imagery * Alison Smith \u2013 art direction * Chris Cheney \u2013 art direction * James Pipino \u2013 cover photography, studio photography * Martin Philby \u2013 booklet photography * Scott Ebsary \u2013 disc photography Instruments * Justine Jones \u2013 horns * Jack Howard \u2013 horns * Jeremy Smith \u2013 horns * Michael Waters \u2013 horns Technical and production * Nick Launay \u2013 production, mixing, engineering * Jimmi Maroudas \u2013 mixing of \"Into the Red\" * Steve Smart \u2013 mastering * Matt Handley \u2013 guitar tech * Ant Milne \u2013 drum tech, bass tech Managerial * Rae Harvey \u2013 management * Josh O'Donnell \u2013 A&R; * Stephen Zagami \u2013 tour management * Jim Scott \u2013 FOH * Owen Orford \u2013 bookings * Darryl Eaton \u2013 bookings * Mike Dewdney \u2013 bookings ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2006) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2006) ! scope=\"col\"| Rank |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums Chart | 66 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Artist Albums Chart | 21 |} ==Certifications== == Release history == {|class=\"wikitable\" !
