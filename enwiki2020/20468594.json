    "text": "The Cori (Chori) language is a minor Plateau language spoken in a single village in Kaduna State in Nigeria. ==Tone== Cori is known for having six distinct levels of tone, too many to transcribe using the International Phonetic Alphabet, which allows five. However, there are only three underlying tones: 1 (), 4 (), and 6 (), which are all that need to be written for literacy. Most cases of Tone 2 () are a result of tone sandhi, with 4 becoming 2 before 1. Tones 3 () and 5 () can be analysed as contour tones, with underlying realised as and realised as . In order to transcribe the surface tones without numerals (which are ambiguous), an extra diacritic is needed, as is common for four-level languages in Central America: :1 () :2 () :3 () :4 () :5 () :6 () ==References== *Dihoff, Ivan (1976).
