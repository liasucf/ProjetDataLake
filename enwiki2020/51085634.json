Out of the estimated 1,700 Romanians whose mission under the regime was torturing political prisoners, \u021aand\u0103r\u0103 was the only one who felt a need to confess. The film has been described as \"a story on the banality of evil and the inhumane atrocity of man\". It is based on the 1999 book The Road to Damascus: Confession of a former torturer by Doina Jela, the inspiration for the journalist in the movie. == Cast == * Gheorghe Dinic\u0103 \u2014 Fran\u021b \u021aand\u0103r\u0103 * Radu Beligan \u2014 The professor * Ioana Ana Macaria \u2014 The journalist * Coca Bloos \u2014 Fran\u021b's wife == References == == External links == * Category:2000s biographical films Category:Romanian films Category:Films directed by Lucian Pintilie Category:Romanian political films ",
