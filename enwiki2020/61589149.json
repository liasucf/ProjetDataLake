    "text": "Lieutenant General Bo Ivar Boustedt (22 August 1868 \u2013 24 October 1939) was a Swedish Army officer. Boustedt's senior commands include regimental commander of V\u00e4sternorrland Regiment and Uppland Infantry Regiment, head of the Military Office of the Land Defence, commanding officer of the Eastern Army Division, Commandant General of Stockholm's Garrison and chief of the General Staff. ==Career== Axel Rappe. Boustedt was born on 22 August 1868 in Fuxerna Parish, \u00c4lvsborg County, Sweden, to captain Axel Boustedt and his wife Amanda Bergius. Boustedt was commissioned as an officer in Bohusl\u00e4n Regiment in 1891 with the rank of underl\u00f6jtnant. He was then teacher at Billstr\u00f6mska folkh\u00f6gskolan in Tj\u00f6rn from 1892 to 1898. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1895 and served as lieutenant of the General Staff in 1903 and as captain there in 1904. Boustedt served as teacher at the Swedish Infantry Gunnery School in 1904, and as teacher at the Royal Swedish Army Staff College from 1904 to 1911. Boustedt served as captain in \u00c4lvsborg Regiment in 1910 and was promoted to major and appointed head of the Communications Department of the General Staff in 1912. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel there in 1915 and then served in V\u00e4sternorrland Regiment in 1916. Boustedt was promoted to colonel in the army in 1917 and was appointed regimental commander of V\u00e4sternorrland Regiment in 1918. Five years later, Boustedt was appointed regimental commander of Uppland Infantry Regiment. He was at the same time commander of the 9th Infantry Brigade. In 1926, Boustedt was appointed head of the Military Office of the Land Defence (Lantf\u00f6rsvarets kommandoexpedition) two years later, in 1928, he was promoted to major general and appointed brigade commander in the Western Army Division (V\u00e4stra arm\u00e9f\u00f6rdelningen). Boustedt then served as commanding officer of the Eastern Army Division (\u00d6stra arm\u00e9f\u00f6rdelningen) and as Commandant General of Stockholm's Garrison for a year before taking up the position as chief of the General Staff in 1930. Boustedt was a strong supporter of the idea of intimate cooperation between the Nordic countries for joint protection, wanted the commanders to have intimate contact with other professional groups and wished to broaden their understanding of social life in its various forms. He also drafted instructions for field service training. In Sweden during the 1930s, ideas were born about Swedish- Finnish military cooperation for Finland's (and thus also Sweden's) defense with, among other things, the Swedish field army (plus the air force's 100 fighter aircraft) under a League of Nations flag on the Karelian Isthmus, protect Finland against an expected Soviet attack. A driving force on the Swedish side was chief of the General Staff Boustedt, who led reconnaissance on the isthmus and was one of the forces behind the opposition group Antingen \u2013 eller (\"Either...or\") within the Swedish Army. As chief of the General Staff, Boustedt, also disapproved of plans to make propaganda films intended to boost patriotic motivation among the conscripts. In a letter to the Arm\u00e9- och Marinfilm (\"Army and Navy Film\", AMF), written in 1931, Boustedt claimed that due to their individualistic national character, Swedish conscripts were suspicious of any manipulative efforts from the authorities. Only films that had no obvious intention of guiding the viewers\u2019 thinking in a certain direction could have a genuine influence on Swedish audiences, he argued. Boustedt was promoted to lieutenant general in 1933 and retired from the military the same year. After his retirement, he created respect through a series of investigations and extensive attempts to create conditions for the partial modernization of the army, which was decided in 1936. Boustedt was also secretary of the Military Literature Association (Milit\u00e4rlitteraturf\u00f6reningen) from 1909 to 1917, member of the Infantry Commission (Infanterikommissionen) from 1920 to 1921, military member of the King's Supreme Court from 1930 until 18 May 1934, as well as chairman of the 1933 Flight Commission (1933 \u00e5rs flygkommission). ==Personal life== In 1917, he married Stina H\u00e5kansson (born 1881), the daughter of captain Axel H\u00e5kansson and Emma Tottie. They were parents of Bo Boustedt (1919\u20132001), an architect. Boustedt died on 24 October 1939 at R\u00f6da Korsets sjukhem in Stockholm. ==Dates of rank== *1891 \u2013 Underl\u00f6jtnant *1895 \u2013 Lieutenant *1904 \u2013 Captain *1912 \u2013 Major *1915 \u2013 Lieutenant Colonel *1917 \u2013 Colonel *1928 \u2013 Major General *1933 \u2013 Lieutenant General ==Awards and decorations== *Commander First Class of the Order of the Sword *Commander Second Class of the Order of the Sword (1921) *Knight of the Order of the Sword (1912) *Knight of the Order of Vasa (1913) *Knight of the Order of the Polar Star (1916) *Officer of the Legion of Honour ==Honours== *Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences (1913) ==Bibliography== *Statsbanornas anv\u00e4ndning f\u00f6r milit\u00e4ra \u00e4ndam\u00e5l (1906) * ==References== ==External links== *Article at Svenskt biografiskt lexikon Category:1868 births Category:1939 deaths Category:Swedish Army lieutenant generals Category:People from Lilla Edet Municipality Category:Members of the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences Category:Commanders First Class of the Order of the Sword Category:Knights of the Order of Vasa Category:Knights of the Order of the Polar Star ",
