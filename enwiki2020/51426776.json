Since the early 1980s he has been living and working in Latin America. He did his bachelorate (1956\u20131963) at the Colegio La Salle of Zaragoza.

He began studying Clinical Psychology at the School of Psychology at the University of Salamanca terminating his degree at the University of Central America in Managua (1992). He has received a PhD in Education with a specialization in pedagogical mediation from the \"La Salle University\" of San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica in 2008, with a personal emphasis on New Paradigms.

Since 1992, together with Pedro Casald\u00e1liga, he has published annually the Agenda LatinoAmericana in 18 countries and 5 languages on average. He has directed the anthology series: \u00abOf the many ways of God\u00bb (Abya Yala, Quito, Ecuador), with the participation of more than 70 theologians. For its broad comprehension of contents and authors this is the prime Latin American work on the subject. The five-volume series was published simultaneously in four languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and English. He has been \"theologically active\" on the internet heading-up the team of Koinonia Services, which he founded in April 1993. It is the oldest website on the network to offer on-line a Spanish biblical service and a theological journal. Since 2006 he coordinates the Latino-American Theological Commission of EATWOT, \"The Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians\" (also known in Latin America as ASETT) ; this Latin American Theological Commission also is serving during the last two periods as International Theological Commission of EATWOT. He is general editor of \"VOICES of the Third World\" \u2013 the digital theological magazine EATWOT makes available to the general public. With the same publisher \u2013 Editorial Abyayala, Quito (Ecuador) \u2013 directs the \"Axial-Time Collection\" which publishes \"avant garde\" themes e.g. new paradigms: the modern paradigm, the \u201creligious-pluralist vision\u201d; the baffling perspectives opened by quantum physics, \u201cmulti-culturalism\u201d, process-philosophy, pos- theistic and pos-religious paradigms, the new epistemology, the new paradigm of biblical archaeology, etc. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda has been the Invited Professor to courses, conferences and symposia in various Latin American universities, such as the Xaveriana in Bogota Colombia, the UNISINOS of S\u00e3o Leopoldo in Brazil, the Catholic University of Belo Horizonte in Brazil, the National University of Costa Rica, ITESO of Guadalajara in Mexico and the system of Jesuit universities in Mexico, the Methodist University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, and the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico, among others. He has also been the invited speaker giving the lecture at many courses or international events, such as \"Courses for empowering\" organized by the CONFER of Peru (2011\u20132015) and that of Mexico (2015); the Multicultural Dialogue in Guadalajara, Mexico (2015); Regional Meetings of CEB's in Latin America, and the Congress of the Popular Christian Communities of Spain, the National Christian Forum d'Avui (Valencia, Spain, 2013), the International Buddhist-Christian Conference (New York, Theological Seminary, 2013), the Religious Forum in Vitoria Spain 2014, among others. For two consecutive terms (1998\u20132005) he has been the Secretary General of CICLA, the Latin American International Confederation of the Claretian Congregation, now called MICLA.9 During that time he coordinated the creation and dissemination10 of the Diario B\u00edblico in all Latin American countries. == Intellectual theological itinerary == Entering into an adult theological life with the enthusiasm of the Second Vatican Council (1975) and its refurbishing theology, to which had dedicated the early years of his ministry, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda soon discovered the emerging Latin American \"Liberation Theology\" of the 1975's. This enthralled him and led to his being transplanted to Latin America, where he has since lived and been employed. From the privileged vantage point of \"The Revolutionary Nicaragua\" he accompanied the avant-gande militant Liberation Theology, the grassroots communities and the Church of the poor, working closely with his friend and claretian companion Pedro Casald\u00e1liga. With the arrival of so-called globalization in the 1990s, and in the third stage of his intellectual journey, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda also entered the theological field of \"religious pluralism\", a new branch of theology in which he has been one of the outstanding Latin Americans authors. Maintaining himself within the theology and the paradigm of liberation, he went on to adopt the well-known \"Latin American methodology\" (see > judge > act) that appears in many of his writings. His book \"Theology of Religious Pluralism\"\u2014A systematic course in popular theology\u2014has been hailed by Paul Knitter as the most representative Latin American book on \"The Theology of Religious Pluralism\", and has been published in Spanish, Portuguese, English, Italian and German. The book is written not only vis \u00e1 vis the academy but also exhibits a strong pedagogical substance making it suitable to be used in the formation of Christian communities. The book advocates a \"pluralistic re- reading of Christianity.\" This of course earned for him a doctrinal indictment by two Spanish bishops, and being taken before the Commission for the Doctrine of the Faith of the Spanish Episcopal Conference. The up-shot of it all ultimately led to the imposition on Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda of three years public silence (time now served-out) by the Vatican Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. In recent years, after having participated in the General Congress of the CLAR (Bogot\u00e1 2009), and traversing a fourth stage in his intellectual itinerary, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda has again broadened his horizon of thought into the expanding world of the \"sciences of religion\", paying particular attention to the epistemological changes occurring in the culture: so-called \"new paradigms\" being un-covered by the sciences of religion that are currently confronting religions and spirituality, and which many consider to be a \"new axial time\" into which we as humanity are shifting. And to this he has devoted his recent years. == Books == * \u00bfQu\u00e9 queda de la opci\u00f3n por los pobres?, en: Christus 58 (1993) 6 [667], 7\u201319 y en: RELaT 6 * La opci\u00f3n por los pobres.
