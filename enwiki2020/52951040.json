    "text": "Doctor Dolittle is a stage musical with book, music and lyrics by Leslie Bricusse, based on the 1967 movie of the same name and the children's stories by Hugh Lofting about the adventures of a doctor who learns to speak the language of various animals and treats them as patients. The musical features the same songs as the film (which starred Rex Harrison, Samantha Eggar, Anthony Newley and Richard Attenborough), including the Academy Award-winning \"Talk To The Animals\". The musical made its world premiere in London at the Hammersmith Apollo in 1998, followed by tours of the UK and US. == Productions == === Original London production (199899) and UK tour (2000-2001) === The world premiere production opened at the Hammersmith Apollo in London on 14 July 1998 starring TV presenter and personality Phillip Schofield in the title role. The role played by Anthony Newley in the film was played by Irish television presenter and actor Bryan Smyth . The production was directed by Steven Pimlott, designed by Mark Thompson, lighting designed by Hugh Vanstone, choreographed by Aletta Collins and featured animal puppets provided by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. The production also featured the pre-recorded voice of Julie Andrews as Polynesia the parrot. Following his run as Joseph in Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat at the London Palladium (after replacing Jason Donovan), Doctor Dolittle was Schofield's second stage musical he starred in. Leslie Bricusse stated that the title role would be played by someone younger than Rex Harrison was in the original movie; > \"Rex Harrison [who originated the role in the 1968 film] was fabulous, but > he was a generation and half older than the leading lady Samantha Eggar. > With a younger Dr. Dolittle, the potential of that relationship is much > greater.\" The production's budget cost \u00a34 million, at the time one of the most expensive musicals ever staged. The production closed on 26 June 1999, having run for almost a year. It was followed by a UK tour in 2000 and 2001 which also starred Schofield sharing the title role with Paul Nicholas and Russ Abbott. === US National Tour (200506) === The show made its American debut on a national tour which began at the Benedum Center in Pittsburg from August 2, 2005. The production starred Tom Hewitt in the title role and was directed by Glenn Casale, scenic designed by Kenneth Foy, costumes designed by Ann Hould- Ward, puppets and magic designed by Michael Curry, and choreography by Rob Ashford. After just 9 weeks of touring, the producers announced that the production would close due to the lack of ticket sales. Following the early closure of the production, it was announced that nine-time Tony Award Winner, Tommy Tune would direct and star in a revamped version of the tour from January 2006. The rest of the creative team remained the same as the start of the tour. The production was produced by Pittsburgh CLO, Nederlander Presentations, Inc., Independent Presenters Network and Columbia Artists Theatricals. === Further UK tours === ==== 200708 UK tour ==== In 2007, Bill Kenwright produced a brand new production of the musical starring Tommy Steele in the title role which toured the UK until 2008. The production was directed by Bob Tomson, designed by Paul Farnsworth and choreographed by Karen Bruce. This production was a revised version with many changes to the book and musical numbers. ==== 201819 UK tour ==== A new UK tour presented by Music & Lyrics opened at the Churchill Theatre, Bromley on 9 November 2018. Mark Williams played the title role alongside Brian Capron as Blossom / Straight Arrow, Vicky Entwistle as Polynesia, Mollie Melia-Redgrave as Emma Fairfax and Patric Sullivan as Matthew Muggins. The production was directed by Christopher Renshaw, designed by Tom Piper, choreographed by Josh Rhodes with musical supervision by Mike Dixon. On 11 January 2019, Music & Lyrics Productions announced that the tour would close at the end of its run at the New Theatre, Oxford on Saturday 26 January 2019 despite initially announced dates until November 2019. The company has cited lower than anticipated advance ticket sales for the reason to cancel the tour. == Cast and characters == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Character !Original London Cast !2000/1 UK tour !2007/8 UK tour !2018/19 UK tour |- !Doctor Dolittle |Phillip Schofield |Phillip Schofield Paul Nicholas Russ Abbot |Tommy Steele |Mark Williams |- !Emma Fairfax |Sarah Jane Hassell |Liza Pulman Kathleen Shueppert |Abigail Jaye |Mollie Melia-Redgrave |- !Matthew Muggins |Bryan Smyth |David Ganly Jimmy Johnston |Conor Michael-Sheridan |Patrick Sullivan |- !Tommy Stubbins |James Paul Bradley |Steven Fitton Joshua Ellis-Barnard Jamie Finch |Joanna Forest |Harry Cross Elliot Morris Quillan O\u2019Meara McDonald Louis Parker Elliott Rose Thomas Ryan |- !General Bellowes |Peter Cellier |George Little |Halcro Johnston |Ad\u00e8le Anderson |- !Albert Blossom | colspan=\"2\" |John Rawnsley |David Anthony | rowspan=\"2\" |Brian Capron |- !Straight Arrow |Peter Gallagher |Sam Mancuso |Ako Mitchell |- !Polynesia |Julie Andrews (voice) |Julie Andrews (voice) Ronnie Le Drew (puppet) |Debden Clarke Rebecca Hyland |Vicky Entwistle |} == Musical numbers == === Original London production === ; Act I * \"Overture\" - Orchestra * \"My Friend the Doctor\" - Matthew, Tommy, Company * \"The Vegetarian\" - Doctor Dolittle * \"Talk to the Animals\" - Doctor Dolittle, Polynesia * \"Doctor Dolittle\" - Matthew, Tommy, Company * \"You're Impossible\" - Emma, Doctor Dolittle * \"I've Never Seen Anything Like It\" - Blossom, Doctor Dolittle, Company * \"Beautiful Things\" - Emma * \"When I Look in Your Eyes\" - Doctor Dolittle * \"Like Animals\" - Doctor Dolittle * \"After Today\" - Matthew ; Act II * \"Fabulous Places\" - Doctor Dolittle, Emma, Matthew, Tommy * \"Where are the Words?\" - Doctor Dolittle, Matthew * \"The Storm\" - Orchestra * \"I Think I Like You\" - Emma, Doctor Dolittle * \"Save The Animals\" - Straight Arrow, Company * \"Entrance of Jean-Claude\" - Orchestra * \"Something in Your Smile\" - Doctor Dolittle * \"My Friend the Doctor\" (reprise) - Straight Arrow * \"The Voice of Protest\" - Emma, Matthew, Bellows * Finale: \"I've Never Seen Anything Like It\" (reprise) / \"My Friend The Doctor\" - Company * Bows: \"Talk To The Animals\" (reprise) - Company === 2007/8 UK touring production === ; Act I * \"Overture\" - Orchestra * \"Puddleby-By-The-Sea\" - Company, Matthew * \"My Friend the Doctor\" - Matthew, Doctor Dolittle, Company * \"Talk to the Animals\" - Doctor Dolittle * \"He's Impossible\" - Emma, Matthew * \"The Time of Our Lives\" - Doctor Dolittle, Matthew, Polynesia, Tommy * \"I've Never Seen Anything Like It\" * \"My Friend The Doctor\" (reprise) - Emma, Matthew * \"When I Look in Your Eyes\" - Doctor Dolittle * \"After Today\" - Doctor Dolittle ; Act II * \"Entr'acte\" - Orchestra * \"Fabulous Places\" - Doctor Dolittle, Emma, Matthew, Tommy * \"Where are the Words?\" - Doctor Dolittle * \"Save The Animals\" - Doctor Dolittle, Straight Arrow, Company * \"Something in Your Smile\" - Emma * \"After Today\" (reprise) - Doctor Dolittle * \"The Voice of Protest\" - Emma, Matthew, Bellows, Company * \"I've Never Seen Anything Like It\" (reprise) - Blossom, Gertie, Company * \"My Friend The Doctor\" (reprise) - Company * \"Doctor Dolittle\" - Doctor Dolittle, Company === Cast recording === The original London cast recording starring Phillip Schofield was released on 1 October 1998 by Exalshallow Ltd, featuring 22 tracks. == References == Category:Musicals based on films Category:1998 musicals Category:Musicals based on books Category:Doctor Dolittle Category:Compositions by Leslie Bricusse Category:British musicals Category:Musicals based on novels ",
