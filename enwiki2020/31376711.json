Many domestic cricket events take place each year including: local provincial, regional and national tournaments, school Cricket tournaments, disability tournaments, and player training camps. The ACB outdoor cricket academy operates its sessions daily at the stadium and the National Offices of the ACB operate within the stadium. A key development for the stadium over the coming 12 months will be the construction and development of the Afghanistan National Cricket Academy which has recently been funded by the International Cricket Council. The first match was between Nangarhar and AWCC.
