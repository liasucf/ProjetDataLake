    "text": "KLTV, virtual and VHF digital channel 7, is a dual ABC/Telemundo-affiliated television station licensed to Tyler, Texas, United States and also serving Longview. The station is owned by Gray Television. KLTV's studios are located on West Ferguson Street in downtown Tyler (between the Smith County and United States courthouses), and its transmitter is located in rural northern Smith County (near the Wood County line). KTRE (channel 9) in Lufkin operates as a semi-satellite of KLTV. As such, it simulcasts all network and syndicated programming as provided through KLTV but airs separate commercial inserts, legal identifications, weeknight newscasts and Sunday morning religious programs, and has its own website. KLTV serves the northern half of the Tyler\u2013Longview\u2013Lufkin\u2013Nacogdoches market while KTRE serves the southern portion. The two stations are counted as a single unit for ratings purposes. Although KTRE maintains its own studios on TV Road (near US 69) in the unincorporated community of Pollok, master control and some internal operations are based at KLTV's facilities. ==History== Original site of KLTV's studios and offices in east Tyler. There is nothing tangible remaining of the old building or property now. In recent years, a fast food/convenience store/gas station has been built there.The station first signed on the air on October 14, 1954;KLTV 7 News Tyler, Longview, Jacksonville |KLTV Celebrates 50th Anniversary it was founded by the locally-based company Buford Television, which was owned by Lucille Buford. KLTV has been an ABC affiliate since its debut; however, it initially carried the network as a shared primary affiliation with CBS and NBC; the station also aired programming from the DuMont Television Network on a secondary basis until 1955. The station originally operated from studio facilities on Texas Loop 323 on the east side of Tyler. In 1964, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) collapsed Lufkin and Nacogdoches into the Tyler market. Soon afterward, the Buford family bought KTRE and converted it into a semi-satellite of KLTV. KLTV's studios on West Ferguson Street in Downtown Tyler. KLTV lost the CBS affiliation in September 1984, when Longview-based KLMG-TV (channel 51, now Fox affiliate KFXK-TV) signed on. It retained a secondary affiliation with NBC until KETK-TV (channel 56) signed on in March 1987, resulting in channel 7 becoming an exclusive ABC affiliate. Buford Television owned KLTV and KTRE until 1989, when it sold the stations to Jackson, Mississippi-based Civic Communications. In 1996, KLTV relocated its operations from its longtime studios on Texas Loop 323 in eastern Tyler to a new facility downtown, located in a former savings & loan branch and office complex near the Smith County courthouse; the former studio facility was demolished in November 2007. Civic merged with Cosmos Broadcasting, a division of the Liberty Corporation in 2000. That same year, Liberty sold its insurance businesses to the Royal Bank of Canada, resulting in the retirement of the \"Cosmos Broadcasting\" banner. Liberty sold itself to Raycom Media in 2006. In October 2004, KLTV celebrated its 50th anniversary.\"KLTV Celebrates 50th Anniversary\", KLTV.com. Retrieved 2018-09-07.\"KLTV Celebrates 50 Years!\", KLTV.com. Retrieved 2018-09-07. At approximately 7:30 a.m. on February 3, 2006 (one day after Raycom officially took ownership of the station), KLTV's broadcast transmitter in Red Springs collapsed taking both its over-the-air analog and digital signals as well as radio station KVNE (89.5 FM) off the air; no one was reported injured as a result. Cox Communications (which sold its East Texas systems to Suddenlink Communications in 2007) continued to carry KLTV's standard and high definition feeds via a fiber optic connection; however, DirecTV and Dish Network customers were not able to receive the station. KLTV re-established an analog signal at reduced power from its former studio and transmitter location in eastern Tyler within 13 hours of the collapse. No cause for the collapse has been disclosed to date. A new Harris transmitter\u2014on a tower slightly less than half the height of the one that collapsed\u2014was installed the following day, allowing resumption of full-power broadcasts from the Tyler site, allowing over-the-air viewers to watch ABC's broadcast of Super Bowl XL over its analog signal; the digital signal was restored several days later. KLTV restored its analog over-the-air signal from its original tower while also being restored on DirecTV, Dish Network and other area cable providers. Its analog transmitter equipment was not damaged and was supplemented at the original tower site with a newer transmitter. However, its over-the-air high definition and digital television transmission equipment was a total loss. In March and April 2007, KLTV ran a \"Flip the Switch\" promotion to promote the completion of the new Red Springs tower. Viewers were urged to submit 30-second videos to show why they should be selected to turn on the tower, with the winner being selected by popular vote on the station's website. On April 17, 2007 at approximately 6:58 p.m., contest winner Jeff Heimer officially flipped the switch to turn on the new transmitter and tower. In January 2011, KLTV started \"KLTV in Your Community,\" a section of its website serving as a branch for citizen journalism, or community blogging; the blog sites are separated into fifteen East Texas communities with Tyler divided into four quadrants by city section. On June 25, 2018, Gray Television announced that it was merging with Raycom, under the Gray name. When the merger was approved by the FCC and the Justice Department, it made KLTV (and KTRE) a sister station to adjacent market stations KXII in Sherman, KBTX in Bryan and KWTX in Waco in addition to the current Raycom sister stations, while separating it from KXXV. The sale was approved on December 20\"FCC OK with Gray/Raycom Merger\", Broadcasting & Cable, 20 December 2018, Retrieved 20 December 2018. and was completed on January 2, 2019.\"Gray Completes Acquisition of Raycom Media and Related Transactions\", Gray Television, 2 January 2019, Retrieved 2 January 2019. ==Digital television== ===Digital channels=== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
