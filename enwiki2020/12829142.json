She reached Australia in mid-January 1944 and, by 6 February, was operating between Australian ports and various locations on the eastern coast of New Guinea. === Invasion of Aitape === During her operations between Australia and the coast of eastern New Guinea, Bootes took part in her only amphibious assault of the war. On 23 April, the day after the initial landings at Aitape, on the northeastern coast of New Guinea, she arrived off the invasion beaches there. The ship carried cargo and equipment for reinforcements belonging to the Army's 127th Regiment, 32d Infantry Division.

About a month later, she returned to the New Guinea coast to begin service as an ammunition issue ship at various locations on the island. Early in September, Bootes moved to Seeadler Harbor, Manus, where she resumed duty issuing ammunition to ships of the 7th Fleet. The cargo ship served at Seeadler Harbor from 7 September until 20 October, at which time she set sail for Australia.

She made stops on the New Guinea coast and, during the transit from New Guinea to Leyte, saw action against several Japanese air attacks. The cargo ship claimed two kills during those attacks while suffering no damage herself. She arrived safely at Leyte on 6 December, and began a six-month tour of duty as an ammunition issue ship. === End-of-war operations === Bootes concluded her assignment at Leyte on 12 June 1945, when she put to sea for Manus. She stopped at Seeadler Harbor from 22 June to 16 July, before continuing on to Australia. The cargo ship arrived in Brisbane on 22 July, and remained there for a month. On 23 August, she got underway for the Philippines. Bootes entered Leyte Gulf on 3 September, and stayed there until late November.
