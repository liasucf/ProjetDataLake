    "text": "Edison is an epic poem by Czech poet V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval. It was written in 1927.Milan Blahynka, Edi\u010dn\u00ed pozn\u00e1mka, [in:] V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, B\u00e1sn\u011b noci, Odeon, Praha 1966, p. 160. (in Czech) Later it was included in the poetic book B\u00e1sn\u011b noci (Poems of the Night) which was published in 1930.Alfred Thomas, The Bohemian Body: Gender and Sexuality in Modern Czech Culture, The University of Wisconsin Press, Madison 2007, p. 126. The main hero of the poem is American inventor Thomas Alva Edison, considered by the author to be a modern genius. Nezval's work is a praise of human activity, technology, and science, but also an expression of anxiety about civilisation. Nezval compares the inventor's work to writing poetry. He points out that every creative work demands much toil and courage. After Edison's death in 1931 Nezval wrote Sign\u00e1l \u010dasu (Signal of time) which is an elegy. Both poems are written in the same measure, trochaic hexameter. Nezval uses long enumerations, building sophisticated poetical imagery.Barbara Mytko, Apollinaire i czeska awangarda poetycka, Studia Rossica Posnaniensia 17, 1982/1983, pp. 67-75 (in Polish). Nezval's Edison was probably influenced by Guillaume Apollinaire's work, especially the poem Zone, which was translated into Czech by Karel \u010capek.Deborah Garfinkle, Karel \u010capek's P\u00e1smo and the construction of literary modernity through the art of translation, The Slavic and east European Journal, Vol. 47, No. 3 (Autumn 2003), pp. 345-366. == Translations == The poem was translated into English by Ewald Osers. Fran\u00e7ois K\u00e9rel, helped by Nezval himself, translated the poem into French. It was also twice translated into Polish, by Kazimierz Andrzej Jaworski and J\u00f3zef Waczk\u00f3w. ==Notes== == Bibliography == * V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Edison.
