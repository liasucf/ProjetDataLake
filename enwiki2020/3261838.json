    "text": "In international relations, a concession is a \"synallagmatic act by which a State transfers the exercise of rights or functions proper to itself to a foreign private person which, in turn, participates in the performance of public functions and thus gains a privileged position vis-a-vis other private law subjects within the jurisdiction of the State concerned.\"John P. Grant and J. Craig Barker (eds.), \"Concession, concessionary contract\", in Encyclopaedic Dictionary of International Law, 3rd ed. (Oxford University Press, 2009). Accessed 23 February 2019. The definition is that of Peter Fischer, Die Internationale Konzession. International concessions are not defined in international law and do not generally fall under it. Rather, they are governed by the municipal law of the conceding state. There may, however, be a law of succession for such concessions, whereby the concession is continued even when the conceding state ceases to exist. In international law, a lease is \"an arrangement whereby territory is leased or pledged by the owner-State to another State. In such cases, sovereignty is, for the term of the lease, transferred to the lessee State.\"John P. Grant and J. Craig Barker (eds.), \"Lease, international\", in Encyclopaedic Dictionary of International Law, 3rd ed. (Oxford University Press, 2009). Accessed 23 February 2019. The term \"international lease\" is sometimes also used to describe any leasing of property by one state to another or to a foreign national, but the normal leasing of property, as in diplomatic premises, is governed by municipal, not international, law. Sometimes the term \"quasi-international lease\" is used for leases between states when less than full sovereignty over a territory is involved. A true international lease, or \"political\" lease, involves the transfer of sovereignty for a specified period of time. Although they may have the same character as cessions, the terminability of such leases is now fully accepted. ==Austro-Hungarian concession holders== *One of the concessions in Tianjin (Tientsin), in China (1901\u20131917). Officially surrendered by Austria in 1919 (Treaty of Saint-Germain) and Hungary in 1920 respectively (Treaty of Trianon). ==Belgian concession holders== *The Guatemalan parliament issued a decree on 4 May 1843 by virtue of which the district of Santo Tomas was given \"in perpetuity\" to the Compagnie belge de colonisation, a private Belgian company under the protection of King Leopold I.

During World War II, the primary Italian vessels based at Tianjin were the minelayer Lepanto and the gunboat Carlotto. * On 10 September 1943, the Italian concession at Tianjin was occupied by Japan. In 1943, Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini's (however virtually powerless) Italian Social Republic relinquished the concession to the Japanese-sponsored 'Chinese National Government', a Japanese puppet state led by Wang Jingwei; it was never recognized by the Kingdom of Italy, the Republic of China, or most world governments.
