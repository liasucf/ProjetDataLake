    "text": "On June 3, 2015, an explosion and a fire occurred at a petrol station in Ghana's capital city Accra, killing over 250 people. ==Explosion== The GOIL station, near Kwame Nkrumah Interchange in the city's downtown area, was being used as a shelter from heavy rains and flooding from several days of flooding in the city, and was packed with people, cars and buses, waiting to leave to their various destinations when the explosion occurred. The source of the explosion is unknown though believed to have occurred in the station's fuel tanks. One survivor stated that the power had gone out before the explosion, but after the power was restored, they heard a \"pop\" and then the fire erupted. About 96 people taking shelter at the station were killed by the fire. Due to the flooding, water had mixed in with the fuel, and when the tanks exploded, the water exacerbated the spread of the fire to nearby buildings, killing additional citizens. The ongoing rainfall and flooding made rescue efforts difficult. So many bodies were taken to the 37 Military Hospital, the largest specialist hospital in Ghana, that the morgue was overwhelmed. ==Reactions== * Ghana's president John Dramani Mahama visited the site, and called for three days of mourning over the losses starting on 8 June 2015. He also authorized a GH\u20b5 60 million ($14.5 million) recovery fund. President Mahama stated that he would start to push for legislation to prevent building on waterways in order to prevent such accidents from happening again. The incident was a worse disaster for the country than the 2001 Accra Sports Stadium disaster where 127 people were crushed in a stampede during a football match at Accra Sports Stadium. * The Cardinal Secretary of State, Pietro Cardinal Parolin, in the name of Pope Francis, sent a telegram of condolence for the victims of the explosion to the Right Reverend Joseph Osei-Bonsu, President of the Ghana Bishops' Conference: > Deeply saddened to learn of the tragic incident at a petrol station in Accra > in which so many people died or were seriously injured, the Holy Father > sends heartfelt condolences to the relatives of the deceased and injured, to > the authorities and to the entire Nation. His Holiness commends the souls of > the departed to Almighty God and willingly invokes the divine gifts of > consolation and strength upon those who mourn and upon all who have been > affected by this tragedy. ==References== Accra explosion Category:Man-made disasters in Ghana Accra explosion Category:21st century in Accra Category:2015 fires ",
