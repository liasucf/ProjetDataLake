    "text": "Iron Soldier 3 is an open world first-person mecha simulation video game developed by Eclipse Software Design and originally published by Vatical Entertainment for the PlayStation on 20 June 2000 and was ported to the Nuon in 2001. It is the third and last installment of the Iron Soldier series. Set after the events of the second game, players assume the role of an elite defense pilot taking control of the titular mech in order to complete tasks and protect areas that conforms the United Republic from attacks of the returning PENTA corporation. Iron Soldier 3 was conceived after release of the second entry and originally intended to be an exclusive first-party title by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation before the deal was cancelled, leading to both Vatical Entertainment and Telegames handling publishing duties instead while VM Labs published the Nuon port, with the two versions featuring various differences. Versions for PlayStation 2 and Xbox were in development but not released. Iron Soldier 3 garnered mixed reception from critics and reviewers since its initial release on the PlayStation and later on Nuon, with many feeling divided in regards to several aspects such as the visuals, audio, presentation and gameplay, which was deemed by some as sluggish and comparing with other titles in the same genre such as Armored Core and Gungriffon. == Gameplay == PlayStation version screenshot. Iron Soldier 3 is a mech simulation game with free-roaming elements that is primarily played in a first-person perspective like its predecessors, where the player controls a robot to defend the United Republic, one of the last free countries left in a futuristic world from PENTA Industries, a large corporation that became powerful with the rapid industrialization of the world. There are several weapons to be found through the game such as machine guns, missiles, grenades and a flamethrower, among others to be collected and use. In addition to the standard titular robot, the player can pilot new mechs such as a smaller but faster chicken-walker type robot and a slower but more heavily armed walker. New gameplay modes have been added since Iron Soldier 2; although a single player campaign mode with 25 missions to complete was still included, there is also an arcade mode where the objective is to level every building in the area in the fastest time possible, in addition of a two-player mode. == Development == After Iron Soldier 2 was launched for the Atari Jaguar and Atari Jaguar CD, Eclipse Software Design founder Marc Rosocha began conversations with Sony Computer Entertainment in regards of developing for the PlayStation while former Atari Corporation vice president in third-party development Bill Rehbock, who was now part of Sony, managed to send development kits to Eclipse Software. Rosocha stated that Eclipse was very close in obtaining a deal to publish Iron Soldier 3 as a first-party title but said deal was cancelled at the last minute, leading to the company signing another deal with both Vatical Entertainment and Telegames instead to handle publishing duties on PlayStation while a conversion for the Nuon was developed for VM Labs as well, which was overseen by former Atari Corp. employee Joe Sousa as its producer. When developing Iron Soldier 3, Rosocha and his team wanted to retain the series' established core gameplay and mechanics from the Jaguar that led criticism from reviewers for being slow. The title made use of a proprietary game engine that featured several advanced special effects not commonly seen on the system. The CGI cutscenes were created by Johannes Graf, who would later go on to develop Sturmwind for Dreamcast. == Release == Iron Soldier 3 was launched for the PlayStation in North America by Vatical Entertainment on 20 June 2000, and later in Europe by Telegames during the same year. The game was published for the Nuon by VM Labs in 2001 as one of the eight games for the platform, but it was recalled at one point due to incompatibility with some DVD players, leading to the publisher releasing an estimated low run of demo discs being sent to the userbase of the system. This version of the game features improved visuals and audio compared to the original PlayStation version, as well as other changes and additions. Once the game was published in western regions, Eclipse was approached by a Japanese publisher to localize the game in the region, however, Rosocha declined the offer due to the proposed decision of making it play faster and enable mechs to fly. A new version of the game titled Iron Soldier 3+ was in development for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox but it was cancelled. == Reception == Iron Soldier 3 received mixed reception since its release. == References == == External links == * * Iron Soldier 3 at MobyGames * Iron Soldier 3 at Telegames Category:2000 video games Category:Cancelled PlayStation 2 games Category:Cancelled Xbox games Category:Cooperative video games Category:DVD interactive technology Category:Eclipse Software Design games Category:Vatical Entertainment games Category:First-person shooters Category:Video games about mecha Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:Video games developed in Germany Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games set in the future ",
