Founding members included Dr. Erlinda P. Barcelo, ex-Vice President of the University of Cebu, and also Miss Helen P. Bulibuli who herself has the distinct recognition of being the person who opened up the San Carlos Montessori System in Cebu City, Philippines. On the seventh year of operations, the school achieved recognition for the Elementary and High School Divisions from the Department of Education. The unprecedented expansion into the higher levels of education was done with God\u2019s grace, teacher contributions and parental /student support in the belief that all good and great things start out small. The 6th year of operations saw the birth of a sister school Santo Ni\u00f1o Montessori located in Lapu-lapu City. Both schools have made tremendous leaps and bounds in their operations. SAMLCI has consistently been in the top ten schools for NAT performance since NAT began, with a ranking of Number 2 overall in Elementary and Number 4 High School Clusters in the City of Cebu. Santo Ni\u00f1o Montessori in its first time of taking the NAT in 2013 ranked 4th. In, April 2015 only six schools in Cebu were approved for K-12 recognition, and we being one of them. SAMLCI takes pride in their achievements, in the teachers and the parents and students which make up this small but great institution that always does its best in serving the public trust. SAMLCI as noted by many not only use the Montessori name, but also give you authentic Montessori education. Category:Educational institutions established in 2002 Category:Schools in Cebu City ",
