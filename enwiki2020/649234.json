    "text": "Come to Daddy is an EP/mini-album by British electronic music artist Richard D. James, released under his main pseudonym Aphex Twin. The EP's lead single, and the first track on the EP, \"Come to Daddy [Pappy Mix]\"\u2014often simply called \"Come to Daddy\"\u2014is one of Aphex Twin's best-known songs; it peaked at number 36 on the UK Singles Chart. ==Composition== Come to Daddy has been described as featuring drum and bass beats throughout. Not all the tracks featured on this album are the industrial style of the first track. \"IZ-US\" features mellow synth tones with drum and bass style drums. Each mix of \"Come to Daddy\" is completely different, with the \"Little Lord Faulteroy\" and \"Mummy\" mixes bearing no noticeable resemblance whatsoever to the original \"Pappy\" mix. \"To Cure A Weakling Child (Contour Regard)\" is a remix of the song \"To Cure a Weakling Child\" from Richard D. James Album. The other tracks also have their own style, most notably \"Flim\", possessing a melodic sound and Aphex Twin's signature complex polyrhythms. The song \"Funny Little Man\" features, at the end, a PlainTalk voice stating \"I would like to fuck you up the bumhole, and then I will sneak into your room and cut your cock off, and stuff it in my mouth, and chew them up with my little pearlies.\" The end of \"Come to Daddy (Pappy Mix)\" features samples from one of his earliest works, \"Isoprophlex\". Though Aphex Twin rarely uses vocals in his work, six of Come to Daddy eight tracks feature vocals. According to Sean Booth of Autechre, James' track \"Bucephalus Bouncing Ball\" is a reaction to their track \"Drane\", to which they then replied with the track \"Drane2\". ==Packaging== Come to Daddy packaging features stark black letters against a white background. All the information, track listings and lyrics are printed the same way, and only two images are present, both photographed by Stefan DeBatselier and digitally altered by Chris Cunningham, using James' face on children. James has used his likeness as the artwork on five of his releases: The ...I Care Because You Do and Richard D. James Album albums, Donkey Rhubarb, Come to Daddy and the \"Windowlicker\" single. The cover of the out-of-print second CD, with its white lettering against an orange background, makes reference to the fact that \"To Cure a Weakling Child\" had been used in a television advertisement for Orange. However, the advertisement used an edit of the album version, whilst the version that appears on the EP is the radically different \"Contour Regard\" mix. ==Track listing== All tracks written, produced and engineered by Richard D. James. All vinyl editions of Come to Daddy (excluding a promotional double LP limited to 500 copies) exclude tracks 5\u20138. The tracks were originally released on two separate CDs, WAP94CD and WAP94CDR, with the first four tracks on the former and the rest on the latter. These have since been deleted and replaced by one EP containing all eight tracks (WAP94CDX). ==Personnel== *Aphex Twin \u2013 vocals, keyboards, synthesizers, piano, drum machine, percussion *Chris Cunningham \u2013 images *Stefan de Batselier \u2013 photography ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !
