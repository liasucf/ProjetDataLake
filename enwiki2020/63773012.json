BAR International Series 693, Oxford. 175 pp. It is dated 41,000 to 37,000 years before the present (BP), and is named after Szeleta Cave in the B\u00fckk Mountains, part of the North Hungarian Mountains. It was preceded by the Bohunician (48,000\u201340,000 BP), and is roughly contemporary with the Aurignacian (43,000\u201326,000 BP) in France, and the Uluzzian (45,000\u201337,000 BP) in Italy. It was succeeded by the Gravettian (33,000\u201321,000 BP). The initial excavation of the Szeletian cave was carried out from 1906 to 1913 by Ottocar Kadi\u0107.Kadic, Ottocar. Ergebnisse der Erforschung der Szeletah\u00f6hle. na, 1916. The idea of a distinctive Szeletian culture was advocated by the Czechoslovak archaeologist Franti\u0161ek Pro\u0161ek (1922\u20131958). Range of the Szeletian culture ==Neanderthals or modern humans== It has been called the most original and also the most aboriginal Upper Palaeolithic culture in Central Europe.Oliva, Martin. \"The Szeletian in Czechoslovakia.\" Antiquity 65, no. 247 (1991): 318-325. The findings are often interpreted in terms of the contemporaneity of Neandertal and modern man, \"as the product of acculturation at the boundary of Middle and Upper Paleolithic.\"Allsworth- Jones, Philip, 2004. The Szeletian revisited. Anthropologie (1962-), 42(3), page 292. However, the absence of human remains makes it impossible to attribute the culture to Neanderthals or modern humans. ==Lithic industry== The lithic industry is characterized by: * Bifacial foliated points and sidescrapers * Prismatic and discoid debitage * Presence of Micoquien hand axes Later assemblages contain endscrapers and retouched blades. ==Sites== In addition to the Szeletian cave in Hungary, assemblages have been found in Dzierzyslaw and Luboty\u0144 (Poland), at \u010certova Pec in Slovakia, and at Pod Hradem (Moravia). ==References== ==External links== Category:Industries (lithics) Category:Upper Paleolithic cultures of Europe Category:Archaeological cultures in Hungary Category:Archaeology of Central Europe Category:Peopling of Europe Category:Archaeology of the Czech Republic Category:Archaeology of Eastern Europe ",
