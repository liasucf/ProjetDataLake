Its main base was Leonardo da Vinci-Fiumicino International Airport, Rome. == History == An ItAli Airlines Fairchild Metroliner at Abruzzo Airport, Pescara, Italy. (2009) The airline started operations in October 2003 and was wholly owned by Giuseppe Spadaccini. ItAli Airlines was the new name for the former TAI \u2013 Transporti Aerei Italiani and the former Air Columbia and was operating two Fairchild Metro aircraft from Pescara to Milan and Rome in April 2004 (replaced by a Dornier 328Jet in January 2005 and a second one in August 2005). In July 2004 a Pescara to Olbia route was opened with a Dornier 328-110 wet-leased from Air Alps. ItAli Airlines connected Pescara airport with the main Italian airports to feed national and international flights and some international destinations, particularly the daily service to Milan-Linate Airport is still operated with Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner. Line activity, operated with Dornier 328Jet dwindled in favor of charter/ACMI flights, operated with McDonnell Douglas MD-82, mainly from bases at Leonardo da Vinci- Fiumicino Airport and Milan-Malpensa Airport. At the beginning of the Summer 2009 was created the Air Taxi sector of the company on Rome Ciampino Airport with secondary base on Milan-Linate Airport in order to increase Cessna fleet operations. The flights were sold under the brand of MustFly, a subsidiary of ItAli Airlines. MustFly aircraft operated as General aviation under ItAli Airlines Air Operator's Certificate, including two Dornier 328Jet specially reconfigured to 19 seats. On 21 October 2010, Mr Giuseppe Spadaccini, ItAli Airlines owner, and other 12 people were arrested by Pescara's Guardia di Finanza on suspicion of international tax evasion (around 90 million euros globally).Avionews Spadaccini's case.
