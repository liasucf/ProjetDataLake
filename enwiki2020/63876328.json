She then traded with what is now Peru, and was probably condemned in what is now Chile in 1828. ==Career== Acteon first appeared in Lloyd's Register (LR) in 1816.LR (1816), Supple. pages \"A\", Seq.\u2116A34. {| class=\" wikitable\" |- !

She sailed from there on 24 June and arrived back at Deal on 17 November. On 1 June 1825 Actaeon, Briggs, master, sailed from Gravesend for Lima. That same day she arrived at Deal, preparing to sail for Valparaiso. On 31 August she arrived at Rio de Janeiro. On 17 September she sailed for Valparaiso, and she arrived there on 18 November.

She was last listed in LR in 1829 with data stale since 1826. The Register of Shipping last listed her in 1832, also with data unchanged since 1826. However, Lloyd's List reported on 2 December 1828 that Actaeon, Gaymer, master, had been condemned at Telcahuano. Actaeon is an unusual name (there were only two in the registers at this time with the other Actaeon being a coaster), so it is most probable, but absent original research not certain, that this account is correct. ==Citations and references== Citations References * Category:1815 ships Category:Ships built in England Category:Age of Sail merchant ships of England ",
