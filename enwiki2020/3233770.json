    "text": "Henry Kreisel, OC (June 5, 1922 - April 22, 1991) was a Canadian writer of novels and essays. Kreisel was born in Vienna, Austria to a Polish-born mother and a Romanian-born father.source The family, which was Jewish, managed to reach Britain just before the Second World War, but, like many other German- speaking refugees, they were declared enemy aliens after the war began. In 1940 Kreisel was relocated to Canada. He lived on a farm in New Brunswick until 1941. It was there that he began his career as a writer, deciding to write in English and modelling himself on the bilingual author Joseph Conrad. After Canada decided to release the refugees from the camps they had been assigned to, Kreisel decided to pursue his dream of writing and was educated at the University of Toronto. He than denied any connection with or use of the German language, being the language of his persecutors.Annette Puckhaber: Ein Privileg f\u00fcr wenige. Die deutschsprachige Migration nach Kanada im Schatten des Nationalsozialismus. Lit, M\u00fcnster 2002 , p. 253, ref. 1042. In German Kreisel became one of the first Jewish writers to write about Jewish-Canadian issues. Later he spent time in Western Canada, and his essay \"The Prairie: A State of Mind\" is a frequently anthologized discussion of Western Canadian regionalism. He was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1987. In order to honour him, the \"Canadian Literature Centre\" in Edmonton organizes an annual \"Henry Kreisel Memorial Lecture\". An inventory of his papers is existing at the University of Manitoba Archives & Special Collections.UoM ==Bibliography== * The Rich Man, 1948; reed. 1961, 2006 * The Betrayal, 1964 ** The Betrayal, play, 1965 Canadian Broadcasting Corporation TV production * The Prairie.
