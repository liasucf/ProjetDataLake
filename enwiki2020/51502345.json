The company has 1,122 outlets and collection centers across India and parts of Nepal, Bangladesh and the Middle East. == History == Thyrocare was started in 1996, by A. Velumani, ex- scientist at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai, Maharashtra. The first laboratory was set up in Byculla, Mumbai, with an initial focus on thyroid testing considering a huge potential for thyroid testing in India. The laboratory was later shifted to a larger set-up, its main headquarters and central processing laboratory at Navi Mumbai. The company introduced a franchisee model for procuring samples to be sent for testing at their central laboratory in Mumbai. Thyrocare mainly deals with thyroid testing along with more than 200 tests and 50-odd profiles comprising different tests for preventive care and wellness under its brand, Aarogyam. In 2010, Thyrocare raised its first private equity funding with INR 188 crore from New Delhi- based CX Partners for a 30% stake. It set up a subsidiary, Nuclear Healthcare Limited, which uses PET-CT to detect and locate cancerous cells. In 2014, Siemens Healthcare's Diagnostic Division installed its world's largest laboratory automation track \u2013 Aptio Automation \u2013 at its laboratory in Mumbai. Thyrocare became the first laboratory in India to install this automation by Siemens. ==Certifications== *Grade A by CRISIL for Very Good Quality of delivered service. *ISO 9001:2008 certification. *National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL). ==Finances== In April 2016, Thyrocare made its initial public offering (IPO).
