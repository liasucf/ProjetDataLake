    "text": "Schreckensteinia festaliella, the blackberry skeletonizer, is a moth of the family Schreckensteiniidae first described by Jacob H\u00fcbner in 1819. It is found in Asia and Europe and has been introduced to North America ==Description== The wingspan is 10\u201312 mm. There are two or three generations and adults are on wing from March to September. The imago is active by day and rests on its forelegs and mid-legs only, with the hindlegs raised over the abdomen. It is occasionally attracted to light. Eggs are laid singly on either side of a leaf, near the margin, or on a petiole of bramble (Rubus fruticosus) and raspberry (Rubus idaeus). When hatching the larva are colourless and chew through the top of the egg, leaving the rest uneaten. They soon become green matching the colour of their foodplant and live on the upper side of a leaf under a slight web, occasionally moving to a fresh leaf. The pupa ia initially green and darkens with successive colour changes before becoming iridescent. It is in an open network cocoon which is attached to a stem; often low down. ==Distribution== It is native to Eurasia, but was introduced to North America and is now widespread from California and Alberta to Quebec and the north- eastern United States. ==References== ==External links== *Bug Guide *Pupa Category:Schreckensteinioidea Category:Lepidoptera used as pest control agents Category:Moths described in 1819 Category:Moths of Asia Category:Moths of Europe Category:Moths of North America Category:Taxa named by Jacob H\u00fcbner ",
