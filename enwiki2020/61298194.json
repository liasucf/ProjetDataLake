The train was jointly designed and produced by six companies under CRRC. ==Reputation== ===Reliability issues=== From the beginning of operations, some CR200J EMUs have a high rate of failure and breakdown. In particular, trainsets produced by CRRC Dalian are especially unreliable, with 21 out of the 23 EMUs produced by 1 June 2019 having broken down - a rate of 91%. In response, CRRC Dalian cut salaries by 20 percent. ==See Also== * Fuxing (train) * China Railway DJJ1 * China Star * China Railway DDJ1 ==References== Category:CRRC multiple units ",
