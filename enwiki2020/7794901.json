    "text": "{| |} The Learjet 23 (originally Lear Jet 23) is an American built six-to- eight-seat (two crew and four to six passengers) twinjet, high-speed business jet manufactured by Lear Jet. Introduced in 1964, it was Learjet's first model and created a new market for fast and efficient small business aircraft. Production ended in 1966 after 101 aircraft had been delivered. ==Development== Recognizing the potential of the Swiss-designed single-engine ground-attack FFA P-16 fighter jet, William (Bill) Powell Lear, Sr. established Swiss American Aviation Corporation (SAAC) to produce a two- engined passenger version: the SAAC-23 Execujet. The company moved to Wichita, Kansas and was renamed Lear Jet Corporation. Production began on the first Model 23 Lear Jet on February 7, 1962. The first flight took place on 7 October 1963 with test pilots Hank Beaird and Bob Hagen. On 4 June 1964, the prototype crashed soon after takeoff, when the pilot inadvertently deployed the wing spoilers while demonstrating an engine failure on takeoff. Eventually determined to be pilot error, this mishap did not deter the Federal Aviation Agency (later the Federal Aviation Administration) from awarding the Lear Jet 23 its type certificate on 31 July 1964. On October 13, 1964, the first production aircraft was delivered. Production ended in 1966 after one hundred and one aircraft had been delivered. In 1998, thirty nine Model 23s were estimated to remain in use. Twenty seven are known to have been lost or damaged beyond repair through accidents, the most recent being in 2008.Aviation Safety Network: Learjet 23 ===Noise compliance=== In 2013, the FAA modified the FAR Part 91 rules to prohibit the operation of jets weighing 75,000 pounds or less that are not Stage 3 noise compliant beyond December 31, 2015, with the Lear Jet 23 listed in the Federal Register 78 FR 39576. This meant that any Lear Jet 23's without modified Stage 3 noise-compliant engines - or an approved hushkit - were no longer permitted to fly in the contiguous 48 states after that date. The ruling noted that appropriate hushkits were not currently available for the Lear Jet 23. ==Aircraft on display== NASA Learjet 23 chase aircraft * N802L \u2013 Model 23 on static display at the Udvar-Hazy Center of the National Air and Space Museum in Chantilly, Virginia. * N505PF \u2013 Model 23 on static display at the Kansas Aviation Museum in Wichita, Kansas. * N20EP \u2013 on display outside White Industries, Bates City, Missouri. * N23BY \u2013 Model 23 on display at the Arkansas Air & Military Museum in Fayetteville, Arkansas.
