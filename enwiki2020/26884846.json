He completed Sombor gymnasium and studied at the Faculty of Political Sciences in Belgrade, where he received MA and PhD degrees. After graduation, he worked at Radio Belgrade, which he left in protest in 1992, as a sign of solidarity with colleagues who got sacked for political reasons. \u010cupi\u0107 participated in opposition groups against policy of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, and he was particularly active in the Belgrade student protests 1996\u201397.

At these positions, he often encountered clashes: In 2002, \u010cupi\u0107 criticized media mogul \u017deljko Mitrovi\u0107 for the way he made money under Milo\u0161evi\u0107's rule, and advocated razing illegally constructed building of his RTV Pink. Later, \u010cupi\u0107 won the lawsuit against Mitrovi\u0107 for an insult. In 2013, tabloid Kurir accused \u010cupi\u0107 for sexual harassment of his female students; several NGOs and media said the accusation was an attempt of a \"media lynch\". \u010cupi\u0107 won this lawsuit as well.
