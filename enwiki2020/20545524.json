The falls is up in the middle of forested hills (the hills of the Western Ghats), which is accessible only on foot from the base of the hills. The hour's trek from the base of the hills is through rocky, forested area, which is thrilling in itself. On a clear day, one can view the waterfalls from the base of the hills through naked eye, or even better through binoculars/zoom lens. There are two falls - the lower falls, which is a good picnic spot, and the higher falls, which is further uphill. The water is basically spring water, coming in as a stream up from the hills nearby. ==Lower falls== The lower portion of the waterfall is a good picnic spot. The view from this spot of the greenery below the hills is exhilarating. Good to have bath and relax for an hour. The water here is cool even during the hot months, though the waterflow is less during the summer months. ==Higher falls== To reach the Higher falls, one needs to climb about uphill (recommended only for healthy people who can climb and swim). == External links == * A Place to Visit Category:Nagercoil Category:Waterfalls of Tamil Nadu ",
