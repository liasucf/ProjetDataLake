Her name was changed to Lillian Cornell by studio executives when she began to act in films. ==Radio== In 1936, Cornell (billed as Lillian Michuda) had her own radio program on WCFL in her hometown of Chicago, Illinois. Three years later, she had moved to NBC, where she had the self-titled Lillian Cornell program.Sies, Luther F. (2014). Encyclopedia of American Radio, 1920-1960, 2nd Edition. McFarland & Company, Inc. . P. 161.

Radio Varieties magazine reported that because radio commitments kept Cornell in Chicago, \"her managers arranged a cocktail party in the movie mecca, at which an audition of Lillian's voice was heard by special wire from the Windy City.\" She signed a contract with Paramount Pictures and soon appeared in Buck Benny Rides Again. ==Television== In 1946, Cornell was part of the cast of The Window Shade Revue, a 45-minute musical broadcast on WNBT in New York City.

They were married until he died in 1984. ==Death== Cornell died May 25, 2015, in Miami, Florida.
