    "text": "thumb The United Kingdom School Certificate was an educational attainment standard qualification, established in 1918 by the Secondary Schools Examinations Council (SSEC). The School Certificate Examination was usually taken at age 16. Performance in each subject was graded as: Fail, Pass, Credit or Distinction. Students had to gain six passes including English and mathematics to obtain a certificate. To obtain a \"matriculation exemption\" one had to obtain at least a Credit in five subjects including English, mathematics, science and a language. Those who failed could retake the examination. Some students who passed then stayed on at school to take the Higher School Certificate at age 18. thumb The School Certificate was abolished after the GCE O-Level was introduced in 1951.School Certificate at History Learning Site.
