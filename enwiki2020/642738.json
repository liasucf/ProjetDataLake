    "text": "Calgary Southwest was a federal electoral district in Alberta, Canada, that was represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1988 to 2015. The district was in the southwest part of the City of Calgary, south of Glenmore Trail and west of the Canadian Pacific Railway line. Former Prime Minister Stephen Harper represented the riding during his premiership. ==History== The electoral district was created in 1987 from parts of the Bow River, Calgary West, Calgary East, and Calgary South ridings. The riding was abolished during the Canadian federal electoral redistribution, 2012, 80% into Calgary Heritage and 20% into Calgary Midnapore. ==Members of Parliament== This riding has elected the following members of the House of Commons of Canada: ===Members of Parliament=== All three of the riding's MPs were prominent: Bobbie Sparrow served in the cabinet led by Kim Campbell, while Preston Manning was the leader of the Reform Party of Canada from 1987 and Leader of the Opposition from 1997 to 2000. Its final MP in the Southwest configuration was Prime Minister Stephen Harper, an economist and a lecturer outside politics. He was elected to Calgary Southwest, shortly after becoming leader of the Canadian Alliance and thus leader of the Opposition, in a 2002 by-election occasioned by Manning's retirement. From 2003, Harper was the leader of the re-formed Conservative Party of Canada, and from 2006, prime minister; he ceased to be both after the 2015 Canadian federal election. ==Election results== Note: Conservative vote is compared to the Alliance vote in 2002. Note: Alliance vote is compared to the Reform vote in 1997. ==See also== * List of Canadian federal electoral districts * Alberta federal electoral districts * Past Canadian electoral districts ==References== * ===Notes=== ==External links== * * Expenditures - 2008 * Expenditures - 2004 * Expenditures - 2000 * Expenditures - 1997 * Elections Canada * Website of the Parliament of Canada Category:Defunct Alberta federal electoral districts Category:Politics of Calgary ",
