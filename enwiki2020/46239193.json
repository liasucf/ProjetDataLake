Still, taken independently of context, Relativity is another fine recording and one of the better pieces of Dickerson's underappreciated legacy\".Huey, S., Allmusic Review, accessed March 27, 2015 Down Beat reviewer Don DeMichael wrote \"This third Dickerson album, like the first two, offers excitement, emotional experience, and music of high quality. ...this is a very good album and is heartily recommended for the sometime electrifying emotion Dickerson is able to generate.\"DeMichael, D., Walt Dickerson Reviews , accessed March 27, 2015 == Track listing == All compositions by Walt Dickerson except where noted # \"Relativity\" - 5:20 # \"It Ain't Necessarily So\" (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin) - 4:25 # \"I Can't Get Started\" (Vernon Duke, I.
