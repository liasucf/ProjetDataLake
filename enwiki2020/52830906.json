Father Thomas Nahimana and other young Rwandan activists and scholars. ==History== The Ishema party was founded in Paris, France on 28 January 2013.Rwanda: Le parti Ishema d\u00e9voile son programme \u00e0 Bruxelles, Jambo News, May 16, 2013 The vision set by the founders is \"promoting Democracy through the truth, intrepidness and social justice\". From the beginning they proposed non-violence and peace, based on dialogue and consensus upon the constructive initiatives to be implemented in a manner evenly beneficial to all the citizens. This mean that every Umutaripfana should stand for the Truth, Intrepidness and Social Justice. On 8 February 2014 the Ishema Party convened its first Congress and decided that the time had come to go back home and realise their political program as resumed in their main society project named \"Together to Modernise Rwanda\". It was in this Congress that Rev. Father Thomas Nahimana was nominated as the presidential candidate in the elections of 2017. However, the Ishema Party leaders were not able to realise their project after attempting twice to go back to their home country; they were denied their right by the Government of Rwanda which is currently led by Paul Kagame and the Rwandan Patriotic Front. After consultation with other members of Rwanda opposition in exile, members of Civil Society, and some personal individuals, they decided to found a Government of Rwanda in Exile and the idea was realised on 20 February 2017. Rev Father Thomas Nahimana became President of the Republic and Mr Abdullah Akishuri became Prime Minister. There were also 12 other Ministers of the Cabinet. Members of the Ishema Party are called \"Abataripfana\" meaning \"Brave people who can never stop saying the truth no matter what\". ==leproph\u00e8te.fr== Nahima and others created a party online newspaper, leproph\u00e8te.fr, to present their political views. The Rwandan government condemned the paper as dangerous. == Father Thomas Nahimana == Father Thomas Nahimana was a priest in Cyangugu diocese, in southwestern Rwanda.
