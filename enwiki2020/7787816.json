    "text": "1884 was the 98th season of cricket in England since the foundation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Australia toured England to compete for the Ashes. It was the seventh test series between the two sides. Fred Spofforth, an overseas bowler, took the most wickets, but England avenged its loss to the touring Australians in 1882 winning 1 test to 0. == Ashes tour== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! width=\"150\" | Cumulative record - Test wins ! width=\"50\" | 1876-1884 |- |style=\"text- align:left;\"|England |5 |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Australia |7 |- |style=\"text-align:left;\"|Drawn |4 |} ==Champion County== * Nottinghamshire ===Playing record (by county)=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !

Although there are ante-dated claims prior to 1873, when residence qualifications were introduced, it is only since that ruling that any quasi-official status can be ascribed. The match between Lancashire and Gloucestershire scheduled for 24 to 26 July was abandoned on the announcement of the death of Mrs Grace, mother of WG and EM Grace. It is shown as a draw. ==References== ==Annual reviews== * John Lillywhite\u2019s Cricketer\u2019s Companion (Green Lilly), Lillywhite, 1885 * James Lillywhite\u2019s Cricketers\u2019 Annual (Red Lilly), Lillywhite, 1885 * John Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack 1885 ==External links== * CricketArchive - season summaries Category:1884 in English cricket Category:English cricket seasons from 1864 to 1889 ",
