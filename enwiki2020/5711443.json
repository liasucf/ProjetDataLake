    "text": "\"A rolling stone gathers no moss\" A rolling stone gathers no moss is an old proverb, credited to Publilius Syrus, who in his Sententiae states, People who are always moving, with no roots in one place or another, avoid responsibilities and cares. Inversely, a common modern meaning is that a person must stay active to avoid stagnation. ==In English== The conventional English translation appeared in John Heywood's collection of Proverbs in 1546. Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable also credits Erasmus, and relates it to other Latin proverbs, Planta quae saepius transfertus non coalescit or Saepius plantata arbor fructum profert exiguum, which mean that a frequently replanted plant or tree (respectively) yields little fruit.Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable , sub. title \"Rolling Stone\". It appears that the original intent of the proverb saw the growth of moss as desirable, and that the intent was to condemn mobility as unprofitable. The contemporary interpretation of equating moss to undesirable stagnation has turned the traditional understanding on its head. Erasmus's proverb gave the name \"rolling stone\" to people who are agile (mobile) and never get rusty due to constant motion. \"A day in the moss\" refers to cutting peat in bogs or mosses. Metaphorically, this refers to the hard work in preparation for winter. An itinerant \"rolling stone\" will not likely feel the timely need to apply for access to a community's peat bog.Dictionary of the Scots Language Sc. 1825 J. Mitchell Scotsman's Library 118: \"Any gentleman, whether possessing property or not, who was popular, and ready to assist the poor in their difficulties, might expect a day in the moss, as they were wont to term it, and could have them longer for payment.\" http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/moss ==Accuracy== The saying may not be authentic to Syrus; the Latin form usually given, Saxum volutum non obducitur musco, does not appear in the edited texts of Publilius Syrus. It does, however, appear with similar wording in Erasmus' Adagia, which was first published around 1500.Adagia, Erasmus, at Bibliotheca Augustana. It is also given as \"Musco lapis volutus haud obducitur\", and in some cases as \"Musco lapis volutus haud obvolvitur\".Jer\u00f3nimo Mart\u00edn Caro y Cejudo, Refranes, y modos de hablar castellanos (1792), p. 288 The literal meaning of the statement itself is true. The television show MythBusters showed that after six months of constantly rolling a stone does not grow moss. Annotated MythBusters ==In psychiatry== Because it is so well known, this saying is one of the most common proverbs used in psychological tests for mental illness, particularly schizophrenia, to look for difficulty with abstraction. American researchClinical Manual for Proverbs Test, 1956, Dr Gorham, Missoula MT., Psychological Test Specialists conducted in the 1950s between Air Force basic airmen and hospitalized Veterans Administration patients with schizophrenia found that the way a person interprets proverbs can be used to determine abstraction ability. The lack of abstraction ability in these studies was statistically significantly higher in the VA patients and it has thus been construed as indicating pathology. As persons with mental illness are generally believed to demonstrate \"concrete\" thinking (a tendency to interpret abstract concepts literally) the research results have, in practice, often been improperly generalized to suggest proverbs alone can be a sufficient indicator of mental illness. A \"concrete\" interpretation of the proverb \"a rolling stone gathers no moss\" would simply restate the proverb in different words, rather than delivering any metaphorical meaning.\"Proverb interpretation in forensic evaluations\", William H.

The theft of the manuscript of the fictional book is a major theme of the real book. * In The Rolling Stones, a 1952 novel by science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein, a family travels throughout the Solar System looking for adventure and money. Hazel Stone, the grandmother, says \"this city life is getting us covered with moss\" when buying their ship. The theme carries throughout the book. * In The Return of the King, the third book by fantasy author J.R.R. Tolkien in his Lord of the Rings trilogy, Gandalf speaks of Tom Bombadil to the hobbits, referring to him by saying \u201cHe is a moss-gatherer, and I have been a stone doomed to rolling. But my rolling days are ending, and now we shall have much to say to one another.\u201d Though the two are both ancient figures, Gandalf has remained involved throughout history, until here where his story is beginning to recede from the realms of men. ===In music=== *The union activist Joe Hill's last will, written in the form of a song in 1915, states: \"My kin don't need to fuss and moan / Moss does not cling to rolling stone.\" * Hank Williams's \"Lost Highway\" opens with the line \"I'm a rolling stone/All alone and lost\", inspiring later songs to use the rolling stone metaphor. *Don McLean's \"American Pie\" contains the line \"Now for ten years we've been on our own / And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone\". * \"Rollin' Stone\" is a 1950 song recorded by blues legend Muddy Waters. The single went on to inspire both the band The Rolling Stones and the magazine Rolling Stone. *\"Like a Rolling Stone\" is a song by Bob Dylan from his album 1965 Highway 61 Revisited. * The Temptations released the song \"Papa Was a Rollin' Stone\" in 1971. ===In film=== *In the 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, a psychologist asks McMurphy what he thinks the proverb means. After an initial smart-aleck response, McMurphy says he guesses it means, \"It's hard for something to grow on something that's moving.\" ==See also== *Chien de Jean de Nivelle *Fortune favours the bold *It ain't over 'til the fat lady sings ==References== Category:Latin proverbs ",
