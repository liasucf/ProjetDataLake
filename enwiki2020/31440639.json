    "text": "In network theory, the Braunstein-Ghosh-Severini entropy (BGS entropy) of a network is the von Neumann entropy of a density matrix given by a normalized Laplacian matrix of the network. This definition of entropy does not have a clear thermodynamical interpretation. The BGS entropy has been used in the context of quantum gravity. ==Notes and references== Category:Quantum mechanical entropy ",
