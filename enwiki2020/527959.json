It lies immediately south of Reykjav\u00edk and is part of the Capital Region. The name literally means seal pup inlet. The town seal contains the profile of the church K\u00f3pavogskirkja with a seal pup underneath. K\u00f3pavogur is largely made up of residential areas, but has commercial areas and much industrial activity as well. The tallest building in Iceland, the Sm\u00e1ratorg Tower, is located in central K\u00f3pavogur. ==History== K\u00f3pavogur is historically significant as the site of the 1662 K\u00f3pavogur meeting. This event marked the total incorporation of Iceland into Denmark-Norway when, on behalf of the Icelandic people, Bishop Brynj\u00f3lfur Sveinsson and \u00c1rni Oddsson, a lawyer, signed a document confirming that the introduction of absolute monarchy by the King also applied to Iceland.

An independent township, K\u00f3pavogur is adjacent to Reykjav\u00edk. ==Sports== K\u00f3pavogur's main sports clubs are Gerpla, Brei\u00f0ablik UBK and HK.
