    "text": "Optica is an optical design program used for the design and analysis of both imaging and illumination systems.\"Software Packages Simplify Complex Optical System Design\" ESCO optics, Wickersham It works by ray tracing the propagation of rays through an optical system. It performs polarization ray-tracing, non- sequential ray-tracing, energy calculations, and optimization of optical systems in three-dimensional space. It also performs symbolic modeling of optical systems, diffraction, interference, wave-front, and Gaussian beam propagation calculations. In addition to conducting simulations of optical designs, Optica is used by scientists to create illustrations of the simulated results in publications. Some examples of Optica being used in simulations and illustrations include holography,\"New software tools facilitate the development of better holographic systems\" Holography, The International Society for Optical Engineering, June 2005, Vol. 16, No.1 x-ray optics, spectrometers,Christoph Braig et al., \"Design and optimization of a parallel spectrometer for ultra-fast X-ray science\", Optics Express, Vol. 22, Issue 10, pp. 12583-12602 (2014) Cerenkov radiation,\"Experimental Testing of Dynamically Optimized Photoelectron Beams, p12-15\" Proceedings of the 46th Workshop of the INFN ELOISATRON Project, Erice, Italy, 9 \u2013 14 October 2005 microwave optics, nonlinear optics, scattering,\"Quantitative image contrast enhancement in time-gated transillumination of scattering media\" Optics Express, Vol. 19, Issue 3, pp. 1866-1883, 2011 camera design,\"Measurement of oxygen saturation in the retina with a spectroscopic sensitive multi aperture camera\" Optics Express, Vol16, No9, 2008, p 6173extreme ultraviolet lithography simulations,\"Partially coherent extreme ultraviolet interference lithography for 16 nm patterning research\" Applied Physics Letters Volume 93, 083110, 2008M.

Wolfram Research first sold the original version as a Mathematica application.\"ScientificWeb\" From 2005 to 2009, Optica Software was sold by iCyt Mission Technology Inc, Champaign, Illinois. (renamed Sony Biotechnology Inc in 2010) At iCyt, Optica2 was renamed as Rayica, and Wavica and LensLab were also developed. Later Rayica-Wavica was combined and named back to Optica3. Since 2009, Optica Software has been a subsidiary of Barnhart Optical Research LLC. == References == == External links == * Optica Software Website * Wolfram Research Optics Page * Wolfram Research Optica3 * Additive - German reseller Category:Optical software Category:Physics software ",
