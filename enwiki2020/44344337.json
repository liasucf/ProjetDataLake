    "text": "Cinderella or the Glass Slipper () is a 1913 French silent film directed by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, based on the fairy tale by Charles Perrault. ==Production== M\u00e9li\u00e8s had previously adapted Cinderella thirteen years earlier, in an 1899 film which had been his first big success. The 1912 Cinderella can be considered a remake of the earlier film; both are derived directly from the original Perrault tale. The film was made in the summer and autumn of 1912. Louise Lagrange, who would later appear in many French and Hollywood films, plays one of Cinderella's sisters. In a conversation with the writers of a Centre national du cin\u00e9ma publication, Essai de reconstitution du catalogue fran\u00e7ais de la Star-Film, she recalled M\u00e9li\u00e8s's kindness and courtesy, as well as his meticulous diligence during the filming of special effects sequences. Prince Charming is also played by an actress. M\u00e9li\u00e8s himself makes an appearance in the film as the Prince's messenger who searches for the owner of the glass slipper. The film features extensive use of outdoor location filming, a practice common in M\u00e9li\u00e8s's later films. Special effects in the film were created using stage machinery, dissolves, and substitution splices. Like all of the other films M\u00e9li\u00e8s made in 1911 and 1912, Cinderella was made under the supervision of Charles Path\u00e9 for his studio Path\u00e9 Fr\u00e8res. After receiving M\u00e9li\u00e8s's work, Path\u00e9 authorized the filmmaker Ferdinand Zecca to edit it. Zecca cut the film down to half the length M\u00e9li\u00e8s intended, and is also probably responsible for adding the cross-cutting effects and medium shots seen in the film, as these devices are highly unusual in M\u00e9li\u00e8s's style. In 1944, M\u00e9li\u00e8s's widow Jehanne d'Alcy claimed to the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que fran\u00e7aise that Zecca had \"massacred\" the film, cutting out the best scenes, including one in which pumpkins race each other across a garden. D'Alcy asserted that the editing was deliberate sabotage, intended to ruin M\u00e9li\u00e8s's career. This charge against Zecca was never proven, though the abrupt linear edits do suggest that Zecca's work extended to a reedit of the entire film. ==Release and reception== According to December 1912 advertisements, the film scheduled for release on 3 January 1913. It was advertised as a f\u00e9erie en 2 parties et 30 tableaux, d'apr\u00e8s le chef-d'\u0153uvre de Charles Perrault.. Literal English translation: \"f\u00e9erie in two parts and thirty scenes, based on Charles Perrault's masterpiece.\" It was not a success, partially because of the directorial conflict between M\u00e9li\u00e8s, Zecca, and Path\u00e9, and partially because M\u00e9li\u00e8s's theatrical style had fallen out of fashion by 1912. ==References== ===Works cited=== * ==External links== * Category:Films directed by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s Category:French films Category:French silent short films Category:Films based on Charles Perrault's Cinderella Category:French black-and-white films ",
