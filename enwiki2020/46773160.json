    "text": "Relatives of Flavus Flavus (Latin: the blond) was a son of a Cheruscan chief called Segimerus and a younger brother to the German leader Arminius. Flavus' real Germanic name is unknown, Flavus in Latin means \"the blonde\" certainly relating to the colour of his hair. Like his elder brother, Arminius, Flavus was given Roman citizenship and served as an auxiliary specifically in the Equites. He lost one of his eyes while fighting in the Illyrian Revolt at the siege of Andetrium in 9 AD. Unlike his brother Arminius, who was the leading figure of the uprising against the Romans in Germania who also orchestrated Rome's devastating defeat at the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, Flavus remained loyal to Rome and served as an officer in the army. Flavus was a soldier under Tiberius in the Roman army and opposed the Germans. Flavus clashed with his brother Arminius, winning the Battle of the Weser River, whose spark was in part due to Arminius learning of the Roman capture of his wife and child. Rome had avenged its humiliating defeat at the hands of Arminius and then withdrew behind the Rhine. Flavus had a son called Italicus who in 47 AD became chieftain of the Cherusci. The tribe had applied to Rome for the only member of the royal house still alive to lead their tribe, the son of Flavus. == Bibliography == * Tacitus. The Annals.
