They were originally named Sower. After a while Bigelow left and was replaced by Stephen Peck. They recorded their split album, Psalms of Ariana with Pensive. Their song, \"Eternity\" on the compilation album Blessed be the Killing from Deadself Records. In 1998, Seasons in the Field disbanded, and Weyandt and Cogdell joined Zao.

They recorded their Zao debut, and Solid State Records debut, Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest. In 1998, Zao recorded the Training for Utopia / Zao split EP with Training for Utopia. After recording the EP, Detar left, and was replaced by Scott Mellinger (formerly of Creation Is Crucifixion). Bassist Rob Horner joined soon after and they recorded Liberate Te Ex Inferis. In 2000, Cogdell left for a time and the band recorded Self-Titled. Zao \"broke-up\" in 2001, but later in 2002 they re-formed and recorded Parade of Chaos. In 2004, Cogdell re-joined and they started to write new music, when Jesse Smith and Rob Horner left. Former Seasons in the Field member, Stephen Peck, along with bassist Shawn Koschick joined Zao and the band recorded The Funeral of God. After this Peck and Koschick left the band and were replaced by Ex-Pensive member Martin Lunn and Jeff Gretz of From Autumn to Ashes. On the \"Under the Gun Tour\" in 2006, Weyandt broke four bones in his left hand. The band had to drop off the tour, due to his injuries. This line-up recorded The Fear Is What Keeps Us Here and Awake?. After Awake? the band went on five-year unofficial hiatus. They have recently resurfaced and have two releases coming soon. The bands' debut (That's not a Split) EP, Xenophobe was released on July 10, 2015. The band released their 11th album, The Well Intentioned Virus on December 9, 2016.

They have released a single titled \"Stand in the Fire\" and a Split EP with Feral King. ==Influences== Weyandt stated the bands that got him into heavy metal and hardcore punk were Passover, a local band that gained popularity, and Overcome. ==Lyrics== Weyandt is the primary lyrical composer of Zao. The Blood & Fire songs \"Lies of Serpents\" and \"Ravage Ritual\" deal with hypocrisy in the Christian Church, while songs like \"To Think of You Is to Treasure an Absent Memory\" deal with the death of family and friends. Songs from Liberate such as \"Savannah\" deals with the suicide of a woman who got in a car accident. The song \"Scars that Don't Speak\" deals with an ex-girlfriend of Weyandt's being assaulted by a youth pastor. Songs off the upcoming album, The Well Intentioned Virus, deal with the miscarriage of Weyandt's child, fever dreams of Weyandt's personal experience, and a broken suicide pact. ==Religion== Weyandt was an outspoken Christian, but in a later interview it was stated that the only Zao member with Christian beliefs was bassist Martin Lunn. It is unknown what he believes or does not believe currently. ==Bands== Current * Zao (1997\u2013present) * Lonely//Ghost//Parade (2010\u2013present) Former * Seasons in the Field (1996\u20131998) ==Discography== Sower * Level Ground on Which to Stand (1996) Seasons in the Field * Psalms of Ariana (1997, w/ Pensive) Zao * Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest (1998) * Liberate Te Ex Inferis (1999) * Self-Titled (2000) * Parade of Chaos (2002) * All Else Failed (2003) * The Funeral of God (2004) * The Fear Is What Keeps Us Here (2006) * Awake?
