    "text": "Rebecca Abergel grew up near Paris, France where she received her undergraduate degree from \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in 2002. While an undergraduate, she received a scholarship to work under Professor John Arnold, an inorganic chemist from the University of California, Berkeley. She eventually pursued her graduate degree in bio-inorganic chemistry from the University of California Berkeley in 2006 working in the group of Ken Raymond. Abergel currently holds joint positions as a staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California and Assistant Professor of Nuclear Engineering at University of California, Berkeley. ==Research interests== Abergel's BioActinide Research group conducts a variety of different experiments in the field of coordination chemistry, analytical chemistry, photophysics, biological chemistry, health physics, pharmacology, molecular biology, and cell biology. More specifically, her recent interests have focused on the coordination behavior of lanthanides and actinides. Her group is especially active in developing therapeutics to treat people who have been exposed to radionuclides or atoms that contain excess nuclear charge. These radionuclides can include plutonium, americium, curium, uranium, plutonium, and neptunium. Recent work by the BioActinide Research group has involved synthesis of different actinide chelating agents that could be used to selectively bind radionuclides in the human body in order to safely remove them. 267x267px Currently, the only drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat radionuclide contamination is diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) (Figure 1). DTPA has shown some promise is treating plutonium poisoning, but this treatment is specific only to plutonium. Furthermore, DTPA must be administered intravenously, which is an issue due to the extremely time-sensitive nature of radiation poisoning. In the quest of finding a more versatile and easily administered treatment for radiation poisoning, Abergel sees potential in developing new classes of therapeutics. The agent under investigation is an octadentate ligand consisting of four cross-linked dipicolinic acid moieties (Figure 2). This molecule is unique in having the potential for oral consumption in humans. It would function by coordinating as a chelating ligand with toxic actinides in the body before they can cause significant damage. In theory, once the chelating ligands have bound to the actinides, the heavy metal complexes can exit the body naturally by urination. 360x360px The chelator of interest exhibits higher affinity for lanthanides in vivo than DTPA due to its octadentate structure, and thus it has shown greater efficacy in radionuclide decorporation in living systems. The ligand has shown favorable selectivity for plutonium, americium, uranium, and neptunium decorporation (with no observed toxicity in either in vitro tests on human tissue or in vivo experiments on rodent models), which is also an improvement over the currently accepted DTPA. Finally, in a separate study, Abergel evaluated the purity of this molecule for potential drug applications, ultimately bringing this effort closer to the development of a deployable treatment solution. 240x240px An additional research project by Abergel's group involved testing the effectiveness of other analogs containing dipicolinic acid in eliminating plutonium (Figure 3). Results showed that both of the compounds were successful in removing plutonium over a seven-day period in mice. Overall, this work, along with further studies focusing on lanthanide and actinide chelation, has important implications for medicinal and environmental chemistry. ==Awards and fellowships== * Directors Award for Exceptional Scientific Achievement (2013), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, USA * Junior Faculty NCRP Award (2013), Radiation Research Society, USA * Young Investor Research Fellowship (2009-2010), Cooley's Anemia Foundation, New York, NY, USA * European Commission Marie Curie Actions Scholarship (2004), European School of Haematology, France * Universit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie Annual Fellowship (2002), French Conseil R\u00e9gional d\u2019Ile de France, France ==References== Category:21st-century French scientists Category:French women scientists Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure alumni Category:UC Berkeley College of Engineering faculty Category:Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory people Category:French women chemists Category:Inorganic chemists ",
