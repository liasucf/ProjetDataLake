    "text": "Martin Helme (born 24 April 1976) is an Estonian politician and the Minister of Finance since 2019. Since 2020, he has server as the leader of Conservative People's Party, nominally a national conservative party, but often referred to in the media as far-right. He is the son of the founder and former leader of the party, Mart Helme. After EKRE joined the governing coalition after the 2019 election, Helme was appointed to J\u00fcri Ratas' second cabinet as Estonia's finance minister. ==Political views== Helme's views have been described as eurosceptic and populist. As one of the key figures in EKRE, Martin Helme advocates for national conservatism. He has been an opponent of Estonia's membership of the European Union and the use of the Euro as its currency. He has claimed that immigration is endangering the sovereignty of European states, including Estonia. Helme has been a vocal critic of the UN's Migration Pact. In the area of civil rights, Helme has campaigned against the passing of the Cohabitation Act in Estonia, which entitled same-sex couples to register as civil partners. He later campaigned to repeal the act. He has been a vocal critic of the rights of the Russian-speaking minority to speak Russian in the Estonian educational system, and opposed the addition of a Russian-language song to the Estonian Song Festival. Helme, then a board member of EKRE, caused controversy in 2013 for his views on immigration. During a TV interview about riots in socially segregated suburbs in Sweden, he said that \"Estonia shouldn't allow things to go as far as in England, France and Sweden. Our immigration policy should have one simple rule: if (they're) black, show the door. As simple as that. We shouldn't allow this problem to emerge in the first place\". The Estonian expression, \"Kui on must, n\u00e4ita ust\" rhymed, gaining widespread notoriety and becoming one of the main slogans connected to EKRE. In March 2019, Helme defended himself by saying that he had made the comments in 2013 before he was a politician, but nonetheless refused to condemn or retract them, stating that he would always stand against mass immigration. ==References== ==External links== *Riigikogu profile Category:Living people Category:1976 births Category:Finance ministers of Estonia Category:Anti-immigration politics in Europe Category:Conservative People's Party of Estonia politicians Category:European white nationalists Category:Critics of multiculturalism Category:Members of the Riigikogu Category:Leaders of political parties in Estonia Category:Critics of Islam Category:Politicians from Tallinn Category:Government ministers of Estonia Category:21st-century Estonian politicians ",
