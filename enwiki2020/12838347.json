Because Kent served in the Navy's Egyptian campaign (8 March to 8 September 1801), her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \"Egypt\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty authorised in 1850 for all surviving claimants. On 13 December 1809 350 sailors and 250 marines from Kent,and two other 74-gun third rates, and , attacked Palam\u00f3s. (The sloops and covered the landing.) The landing party destroyed six of eight merchant vessels with supplies for the French army at Barcelona, as well as their escorts, a national ketch of 14 guns and 60 men and two xebecs of three guns and thirty men each. The vessels were lying inside the mole under the protection of 250 French troops, a battery of two 24-pounders, and a 13\" mortar in a battery on a commanding height. Although the attack was successful, the withdrawal was not. The British lost 33 men killed, 89 wounded, and 86 taken prisoner, plus one seaman who took the opportunity to desert.James (1837), Vol. 5, pp.259-60. ==Fate== Kent became a sheer hulk in 1856, and was broken up in 1881. ==Notes and citations== Notes Citations ==References== * * * Lavery, Brian (2003) The Ship of the Line - Volume 1: The development of the battlefleet 1650-1850.
