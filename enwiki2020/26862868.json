The company was founded in 1958 and was bought by Great Britain\u2019s Vitec Group plc. in 1995. ==History== Wendelin Sachtler was a cinematographer, actor and inventor, living in South-Germany. In 1958 he designed the first tripod head. This so-called gyroscopic head provided not only pans and tilt motion, but also added gyroscopic damping to smooth out camera moves. The new tripod head proved so popular with fellow camera operators that it led to the foundation of a new company, Sachtler, to meet demand. He worked out of a small workshop in Munich-Schwabing, Germany. After a pair of moves, since 2004 Sachtler GmbH has been located in Eching near Munich. Sachtler has 150 employees worldwide and is represented by retailers in more than 140 countries. The company has production facilities in Germany, Costa Rica and Great Britain.Hermann Simon mentioned this company in his correspondent Book as an example of a \"Hidden Champion\" (Simon, Hermann: Hidden Champions of the 21st Century : Success Strategies of unknown World Market Leaders. London: Springer, 2009.- .) In 1992 the company was awarded the \"Scientific and Engineering Award\", an award set up by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In 1995 Sachtler was acquired by the Vitec Group PLC. https://web.archive.org/web/20090204194339/http://vitecgroup.com/group/group_history.aspx In 2001 Sachtler and Curt O. Schaller launched the artemis camera stabilizer system at the NAB Show in Las Vegas. The artemis systems were the first modular camera stabilizer systems in the world.
