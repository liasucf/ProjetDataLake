    "text": "Yellowikis was a MediaWiki website collecting basic information, about businesses. This information included basic contact details, such as company name, address, websites, and telephone numbers, as well as internal Yellowiki wikilinks to competitors. Yellowikis was launched in January 2005. As of , the main page of Yellowikis had been translated into more than twenty five different languages. Some users also entered a number of codes, including the two letter country code, as well as an International Standard Industrial Classification, North American Industry Classification or US Standard Industrial Classification. Some users are also adding geocodes, and Skype IDs. == Legal Issues == A commercial business listing company, Yell Limited, requested that the founders of Yellowikis, Paul Youlten and Rosa Blaus, amend their site, claiming that Yellowikis was \u201cpassing itself off\u201d as being associated with Yell.com and that people would confuse the two organisations. This was in July 2006. This might be considered to be anti competitive behaviour/anti competitive in the eyes of certain commentators, however, such claim is unlikely to carry water, from any legal perspective. Yell\u2019s claim is given considerable weight by the slogan on Yellowiki\u2019s front page that they are \u201cYellow Pages for the 21st Century\u201d although in their public protestations, Yellowikis claim that they are not trying to create association between themselves, and Yellow Pages. Yellow Pages is the registered trade mark, in many countries, including the United Kingdom. In some territories, however, the mark has lost its distinctiveness as a source of origin of goods and services. From 9 to 14 October 2006, the domain address redirected, to the new Owikis website, which stated \u201cThe trademark dispute between Yell Limited and Paul Youlten, concerning the Yellowikis website, has been satisfactorily resolved\u201d. The website of Yellowikis website reappeared on 15 October 2006, with the explanation that United Kingdom users would have to use Owikis, with the word Yell from the domain name, and the colour yellow from the logo, international users could continue to use Yellowikis. As of , the Owikis site is not yet available. As of , the main page is dead. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * Emily Chang * * * * * Yell threatens to shut down Yellowikis from Wikinews, 2006-07-05 ==External links== * Yellowikis on Wikia Category:Directories Category:MediaWiki websites Category:Internet properties established in 2005 Category:Yellow pages ",
