    "text": "Ivan Vladimirovich Provorov (; born 13 January 1997) is a Russian professional ice hockey defenceman currently playing for the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League (NHL). ==Playing career== ===Early career=== Provorov played with the Cedar Rapids RoughRiders in the United States Hockey League (USHL) before he was selected in the CHL Import Draft, 30th overall, by the Brandon Wheat Kings of the Western Hockey League (WHL). He opted to report to the Wheat Kings for the 2014\u201315 season on 14 August 2014. Provorov won the WHL championship with the Brandon Wheat Kings in the 2015\u201316 season and was named WHL defenceman of the year. However, in the following 2016 Memorial Cup tournament, the team failed to win a game. Provorov was also named the CHL Defenceman of the Year for the 2015\u201316 season. ===Professional=== ====Philadelphia Flyers==== After being rated as a top prospect, Provorov was selected seventh overall in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft by the Philadelphia Flyers. On 3 July 2015, he signed an entry-level contract with the Flyers. After a strong showing at the Flyers' training camp, he was added to the team and made his NHL debut on 14 October 2016 away against the Los Angeles Kings. He recorded his first NHL point, an assist, in the same game. Provorov scored his first NHL goal on 23 November 2016 against Andrei Vasilevskiy of the Tampa Bay Lightning. At the end of the 2016\u201317 season, the Flyers awarded Provorov with the Barry Ashbee Trophy, which is given to the team's \"outstanding defenseman\" from the season. Provorov became only the third rookie defensemen to win the award for the Flyers, after Norm Barnes and teammate Shayne Gostisbehere (who had become the second just the year before). Overall, he finished the season with 30 points in 82 games. Provorov improved his scoring in the 2017\u201318 season, recording a career-high 17 goals and 41 points in 82 games. The Flyers qualified for the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs. However, the team lost in six games to the Pittsburgh Penguins during the first round. Provorov skated in all six games, scoring three assists. It was revealed he played Game 6 with a Grade 3 AC sprain. He did not require surgery, but was sidelined for eight weeks. On 12 September 2019, the Flyers re-signed Provorov to a six-year, $40.5 million contract extension. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"98\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"98\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
