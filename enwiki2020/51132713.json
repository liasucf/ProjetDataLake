    "text": "The 1971\u201372 Pittsburgh Condors season was the 2nd and final season of the Pittsburgh Condors along with the 4th and final season of Pittsburgh involvement in the American Basketball Association. General manager Mark Binstein took over as coach after a 4\u20136 start. By the time the season was half over, the team was 17\u201325. From that point, the team went 8\u201334, with a losing streak of 12 near the end of the season sealing any hope of getting out of the cellar of the Division. One factor was despite being 1st in points scored at 119.2 per game, they were dead last in points allowed, at 126.4 per game.https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/PTC/1972_games.html Attendance had simply dried up, with games being moved (with one being moved to Uniontown, 46 miles from Pittsburgh) away from the Arena, with the team unofficially becoming the \"United States Condors\", with one game being played in Birmingham, Alabama. Fittingly, their penultimate game was played in Tucson, Arizona versus the Kentucky Colonels. On March 29, they played (and lost) their final game, 113\u2013128 to the Indiana Pacers. Attempts to move the team failed after the season failed, and the league soon cancelled the franchise, ending pro basketball in Pittsburgh. Since then, no pro basketball team has played in Pittsburgh. The players were dispersed to other teams, with George Thompson going to the Memphis Tams, Mike Lewis to the Carolina Cougars, Skeeter Swift to the Dallas Chaparrals, and Walt Szczerbiak to the Kentucky Colonels. ==Roster== * 13 Nate Bowman - Center * 40 John Brisker - Small forward * 35 George Carter - Small forward * 30 Mickey Davis - Small forward * 10 Mike Grosso - Center * 13 Stew Johnson - Point forward * 14/22 Arvesta Kelly - Guard * 33 Dave Lattin - Point forward * 24 Mike Lewis - Center * 12 Jim Ligon - Point forward * 44 Jim O'Brien - Point guard * 15 Paul Ruffner - Center * 23 Skeeter Swift - Shooting guard * 12 Walt Szczerbiak - Small forward * 22 Ron Taylor - Center * 25 George Thompson - Shooting guard * 20 Bob Verga - Point guard ==Final standings== ===Eastern Division=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |+ !
