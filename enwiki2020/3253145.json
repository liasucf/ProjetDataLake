On September 10, 2001, it became Moore's first video to reach the number-one spot on MTV's countdown show Total Request Live. In the video, Moore sits in her crush's room and tries to wake him up. She performs with her band in another room. The video ends with Moore wearing a replica of the jacket Michael Jackson wears in the \"Thriller\" music video. When she walks down the hall, she sees her crush and smiles. ==Track listings== Promotional US single (sent to mainstream radio) # \"Crush\" (Ric Wake Mix) \u2013 3:49 Australian CD single # \"Crush\" (remix) \u2013 3:58 # \"Crush\" (album version) \u2013 3:43 # \"In My Pocket\" (Brandnew remix) \u2013 3:29 # Album Mix Tape \u2013 2:57 Dutch/Swiss/Swedish/German CD single (scarce release) # \"Crush\" (album version) \u2013 3:43 # \"Crush\" (Ric Wake Mix) \u2013 3:49 # \"In My Pocket\" (Soul Solution club mix) ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" !Chart (2001) !Peak position |- !scope=\"row\" |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2001 singles Category:Mandy Moore songs Category:Music videos directed by Chris Applebaum Category:Songs written by Shep Goodman Category:Songs written by Kenny Gioia Category:2001 songs Category:Epic Records singles ",
