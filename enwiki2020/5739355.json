P. Morgan, as the American Woman's Association clubhouse and residence for young women in New York. It was completed in 1929. The building contained 1,250 rooms, along with a swimming pool, restaurant, gymnasium and music rooms along with a multitude of specialized meeting rooms.Christopher Gray, The New York Times, From Women's Clubhouse to WNET to $75 a Night. 4 January 1998 The American Woman's Association went bankrupt in 1941 and the clubhouse building was converted into The Henry Hudson Hotel, open to both men and women. During World War II the building housed Dutch soldiers. More recently, until 1997 the second through ninth floors served as the headquarters for public television station WNET; the MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour was broadcast from the building. WNET has since relocated to Lincoln Center. In 1997, the building was purchased by Morgans Hotel Group and underwent a three-year renovation at the cost of $125 million. The hotel's name was changed from The Henry Hudson Hotel to simply The Hudson.
