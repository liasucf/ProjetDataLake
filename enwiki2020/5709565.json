    "text": "The marbled whiptail (Aspidoscelis marmoratus) is a species of lizard found in the United States, in southern New Mexico and Texas, and in northern Mexico, in Coahuila, Chihuahua and Durango. == Description == The marbled whiptail grows from 8 to 12 inches in length. It is grey or black overall in color with 4 to 8 yellow or white stripes, often with dark mottling, giving it a marbled appearance. Their underside is white or pale yellow, with a peach coloration on the throat. They are slender bodied, with long tails. == Behavior == Like most other species of whiptail lizards, the marbled whiptail is diurnal and insectivorous. It is wary, energetic, and fast moving, darting for cover if approached. Its preferred habitat is semiarid, sandy areas with sparse vegetation, or the open edges of wooded areas. Breeding takes place in the spring, with up to four eggs laid sometime in the month of May. The eggs hatch in six to eight weeks. A second clutch of eggs is occasionally laid in mid summer. Hatchlings look much like the adults, except they have bright blue colored tails. == Subspecies == There are two recognized subspecies of A. marmoratus: *Aspidoscelis marmoratus marmoratus (Baird & Girard, 1852) *Aspidoscelis marmoratus reticuloriens (Vance, 1978) == References == * *Herps of Texas: Cnemidophorus marmoratus Category:Aspidoscelis Whiptail, Marbled Whiptail, Marbled Whiptail, Marbled Category:Reptiles described in 1852 Category:Taxa named by Spencer Fullerton Baird Category:Taxa named by Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Girard ",
