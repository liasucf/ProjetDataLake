The population of the district was 111,008 at the 2011 Census. The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 (along with the abolition of the county of West Suffolk) by the merger of the Borough of Bury St Edmunds, Haverhill Urban District, Clare Rural District and Thingoe Rural District. Until March 2009, its main offices were in Bury St Edmunds (Angel Hill and Western Way). Thereafter, a purpose-built complex, West Suffolk House housed both St Edmundsbury and Suffolk County Council staff.St Edmundsbury website In 2008, the Council submitted a proposal to the Boundary Commission which would see it as central to a new West Suffolk unitary council.St Edmundsbury websiteThey work for you.com However, the proposal was rejected and no unitary scheme for Suffolk was adopted.
