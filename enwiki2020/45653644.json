    "text": "The Ipoh North\u2013Ipoh South Local Express Lane, or Jalan Jelapang\u2013Ampang (based on Waze social GPS-map applications), Federal Route 239 (northbound) and 240 (southbounds), are toll-free local-express lanes in the North\u2013South Expressway Northern Route E1 in Ipoh, Perak, Malaysia. There are five interchange along the local express lane, Jelapang, Meru Raya, Ipoh North, Ipoh South and Tambun. ==History== The Jelapang and Ipoh South toll plazas were demolished in 2009 to make a non-stop route across Ipoh. This is achieved through the construction of two local-express lanes for each side, which are only accessible via Exit 138 Ipoh South Exit (for northbound traffic) and Exit 141 Ipoh North Exit (for southbound traffic). The toll plazas in Ipoh were relocated to each end of the local-express lanes. The decision to demolish both toll plazas was made as a result of accidents which happened at Jelapang toll plaza. Since the toll plaza was opened on 28 September 1987, there were many accident cases which involved brake failure in heavy vehicles due to hard braking when proceeding downhill to the toll plaza. On 7 June 2008, the new Ipoh North toll plaza (South bound) replacing old Jelapang toll plaza opened to traffic, followed by northbound on 15 August 2008. Since 14 July 2009, the Johor Bahru-Kuala Lumpur\u2013Penang through traffic has been open to traffic. With the opening of the between Ipoh North (Jelapang) and Ipoh South stretch, highway users are no longer required to stop for toll transactions at the Ipoh North and Ipoh South Toll Plazas. In 2014, the Ipoh North\u2013Ipoh South Local Express Lane were gazetted as Federal Route 239 for northbound and Federal Route 240 for southbound. ==Features== At most sections, the Federal Route 239 and 240 was built under the JKR R5 road standard, allowing maximum speed limit of up to 90 km/h. ==List of interchanges== === Jalan Ampang\u2013Jelapang=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !km||Exit||Interchange||To||Remarks |- | || || || North\u2013South Expressway Northern Route||From south only |- |style=\"width:600px\" colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center; background:green;\"|Ipoh South Toll Plaza (North bound) Closed toll systems Touch out card only for exit |- | || || Ipoh South Toll Plaza || ||North bound only |- |style=\"width:600px\" colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center; background:green;\"| North\u2013South Expressway Northern Route End of expressway PLUS Expressway border limit |- |style=\"width:600px\" colspan=\"6\" style=\"text- align:center; background:blue;\"| Ipoh North\u2013Ipoh South Local Express Lane (Jalan Ampang\u2013Jelapang) JKR border limit |- | || ||Sungai Pinji bridge|| || |- | || ||Tambun Interchange|| Jalan Tambun West Ipoh City Centre East Tambun Tanjung Rambutan Hospital Bahagia Ulu Kinta ||Interchange |- | || ||Ipoh South Interchange||Jalan Sultan Azlan Shah Utara North Bercham Tanjung Rambutan Hospital Bahagia Ulu Kinta South Ipoh City Centre||Diamond interchange with T-junctions |- | || ||Sungai Kinta bridge|| || |- | || ||Railway crossing bridge|| || |- | || ||Ipoh North Interchange|| Jalan Kuala Kangsar North Kuala Kangsar Sungai Siput South Ipoh City Centre||Diamond interchange |- | || ||Sungai Pari bridge|| || |- | || ||Meru Raya Interchange||Persiaran Meru Raya North Bandar Meru Raya (North) Chemor South Bandar Meru Raya (South) Jelapang||Diamond interchange |- |style=\"width:600px\" colspan=\"6\" style=\"text- align:center; background:blue;\"| Ipoh North\u2013Ipoh South Local Express Lane (Jalan Ampang\u2013Jelapang) JKR border limit |- |style=\"width:600px\" colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center; background:green;\"| [North\u2013South Expressway Northern Route Start/End of expressway PLUS Expressway border limit |- | || ||Jelapang Interchange|| Jalan Jelapang North Chemor South Jelapang Bandar Seri Iskandar Lumut Pangkor Island||Northbound only |- |- |style=\"width:600px\" colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center; background:green;\"|Ipoh North Toll Plaza (North bound) Closed toll system Touch in card only for entry |- | || || ||Northwest North\u2013South Expressway Northern Route Alor Setar Penang Kuala Kangsar|| |} === Jalan Jelapang\u2013Ampang=== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !km||Exit||Interchange||To||Remarks |- | || || || North\u2013South Expressway Northern Route||From north only |- | || ||Runaway truck ramp|| ||Southbound only |- |style=\"width:600px\" colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center; background:green;\"|Ipoh North Toll Plaza (South bound) Closed toll systems Touch out card only for exit |- | || || Ipoh North Toll Plaza || || |- |style=\"width:600px\" colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center; background:green;\"| North\u2013South Expressway Northern Route Start/End of expressway PLUS Expressway border limit |- |style=\"width:600px\" colspan=\"6\" style=\"text- align:center; background:blue;\"| Ipoh North\u2013Ipoh South Local Express Lane (Jalan Jelapang\u2013Ampang) JKR border limit |- | || ||Meru Raya Interchange||Persiaran Meru Raya North Bandar Meru Raya (North) Chemor South Bandar Meru Raya (South) Jelapang||Diamond interchange |- | || ||Sungai Pari bridge|| || |- | || ||Ipoh North Interchange|| Jalan Kuala Kangsar North Kuala Kangsar Sungai Siput South Ipoh City Centre||Diamond interchange |- | || ||Railway crossing bridge|| || |- | || ||Sungai Kinta bridge|| || |- | || ||Ipoh South Interchange||Jalan Sultan Azlan Shah Utara North Bercham Tanjung Rambutan Hospital Bahagia Ulu Kinta South Ipoh City Centre||Diamond interchange with T-junctions |- | || ||Tambun Interchange|| Jalan Tambun WEST Ipoh City Centre East Tambun Tanjung Rambutan Hospital Bahagia Ulu Kinta ||Interchange |- | || ||Sungai Pinji bridge|| || |- |style=\"width:600px\" colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center; background:blue;\"| Ipoh North\u2013Ipoh South Local Express Lane (Jalan Jelapang\u2013Ampang) JKR border limit |- |style=\"width:600px\" colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center; background:green;\"| North\u2013South Expressway Northern Route Start/End of expressway PLUS Expressway border limit |- | || || || || |- |style=\"width:600px\" colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center; background:green;\"|Ipoh South Toll Plaza (South bound) Closed toll systems Touch in card only for entry |- | || || ||South North\u2013South Expressway Northern Route Kuala Lumpur Gopeng Simpang Pulai|| |} ==References== Category:Highways in Malaysia Category:Malaysian Federal Roads ",
