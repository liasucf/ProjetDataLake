    "text": "Event-driven investing is a hedge fund investment strategy that seeks to exploit pricing inefficiencies that may occur before or after a corporate event, such as an earnings call, bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, or spinoff. In more recent times market practitioners have expanded this definition to include additional events such as natural disasters and actions initiated by shareholder activists.

New event-driven hedge funds were launched for example, New-York- based Kellner had launched event-driven hedge fund, Capital with Chris Pultz and California-based Omni Partners launched event-driven investing funds such as Omni Event Fund with John Melsom as chief investment officer. Melsom noted that by 2015 there was a lot of consolidation in the healthcare sector especially in pharmaceuticals which gave \"exceptionally wide spreads.\" President Obama's US healthcare reforms led to regulatory uncertainty in healthcare. James Elliot's Event Fund returned 34.9% from January through June 2017, ==References== Category:Hedge funds Category:Stock market ",
