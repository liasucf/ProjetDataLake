    "text": "Government in Queensland is delivered by a number of agencies, grouped under areas of portfolio responsibility. Each portfolio is led by a government minister who is a member of the Parliament of Queensland, appointed by the Governor as the representative of the Crown. The agencies are principally grouped as eight departments, each led by a secretary or director-general and comprising a number of portfolios covering specific policy areas across the department and allocated statutory authorities, trading enterprises, boards, councils and other public bodies. Agencies have varying levels of operational autonomy, and deliver one or more of frontline public services, administrative functions and law enforcement. Some are structured as for-profit corporations. Where there are multiple portfolios within a department, directors-general may be accountable to a number of ministers. In addition to the list below, a range of other agencies support the functions of the departments. The government is responsible for a number of corporations, of which the responsible minister typically holds a 100% ownership stake in. In 2006, Premier Peter Beattie privatised a number of government owned electricity retailers. On 2 June 2009 the government announced the 'Renewing Queensland Plan' that would sell state-owned railway, port and forestry assets to raise $15 billion, and avoid a further $12 billion required in future capital investment. On 18 May 2010, Queensland Forestry Plantations was the first commercial business to be sold. All agencies are identifiable by their corporate logo, which features in agency advertising, publications and correspondence, pictured right. A list of articles on Queensland government agencies sorted alphabetically is available at Government agencies of Queensland. The Queensland Government maintains a list of agencies and their contact details at its website. ==Department of the Premier and Cabinet== * Department of the Premier and Cabinet ** Queensland State Archives ==Department of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships== * Department of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Partnerships ==Department of Agriculture and Fisheries== * Department of Agriculture and Fisheries ==Department of Communities, Child Safety and Disability Services== * Department of Communities, Child Safety and Disability Services ==Department of Education== * Department of Education ==Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy== * Department of Natural Resources, Mines and Energy ** CS Energy ** Energex ** Ergon ** LinkWater ** Powerlink Queensland ** Queensland Urban Utilities ** Queensland Water Commission ** SEQ Water Grid Manager ** Seqwater ** SunWater ** Tarong Energy ** WaterSecure ==Department of Environment and Science== *Department of Environment and Science **Department of Environment and Heritage Protection **Environmental Protection Agency (Queensland) **Queensland Heritage Council ==Queensland Health== * Queensland Health **Forensic and Scientific Services **Psychologists Board of Queensland **Queensland Ambulance Service ==Department of Housing and Public Works== * Department of Housing and Public Works **Queensland Housing Commission **Residential Tenancies Authority ==Department of Local Government, Racing and Multicultural Affairs == * Department of Local Government, Racing and Multicultural Affairs ==Department of Justice and Attorney-General== * Department of Justice and Attorney-General **Anti-Discrimination Commission Queensland **Crime and Corruption Commission **Electoral Commission of Queensland **Legal Aid Queensland **Legal Services Commissioner **Office of Liquor and Gaming Regulation **Queensland Law Reform Commissioner **Queensland Ombudsman's Office **Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions **Office of the Information Commissioner **Office of the Public Guardian **Parole Boards **The Public Advocate **The Public Trustee **Prostitution Licensing Authority ==Department of National Parks, Sport and Racing== * Department of National Parks, Sport and Racing **Office of Liquor and Gaming Regulation **Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service ==Department of Employment, Small Business and Training== *Department of Employment, Small Business and Training ==Queensland Police Service and Queensland Fire and Emergency Services== * Queensland Police Service and Queensland Fire and Emergency Services ** Queensland Fire and Emergency Services ** Queensland Police Service ==Department of Science, Information Technology and Innovation== * Department of Science, Information Technology and Innovation ==Department of State Development, Manufacturing, Infrastructure and Planning== * Department of State Development, Manufacturing, Infrastructure and Planning ** State Government Insurance Office (Queensland) ==Department of Transport and Main Roads== * Department of Transport and Main Roads ** Cairns Port Authority ** Mackay Port Authority ** Maritime Safety Queensland ** Port of Brisbane ** Port of Townsville ** Ports Corporation of Queensland ** QConnect ** Queensland Rail ==Queensland Treasury== * Queensland Treasury **Motor Accident Insurance Commission and Nominal Defendant **Office of Government Owned Corporations **Office of Industrial Relations **Office of State Revenue **Queensland Competition Authority **Queensland Investment Corporation **Queensland Treasury Corporation **South Bank Corporation **Stanwell Corporation ==Department of Innovation and Tourism Industry Development== * Department of Innovation and Tourism Industry Development **Tourism and Events Queensland ==See also== *Government of Queensland *Defunct government agencies of Queensland ==References== * Category:Lists of Australian government agencies Government agencies ",
