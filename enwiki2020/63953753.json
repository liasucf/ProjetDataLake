They put out a call for German woman to apply and received over 400 applications, including Thiele-Eich. By March 2017 Thiele-Eich was included in the group of six finalists for the project. Within a month Die Astronautin officially announced that Thiele-Eich was one of the two women selected, alongside fighter pilot Nicola Baumann (who later pulled out of the program and was replaced by Dr Suzanna Randall, another one of the original six finalists), the two began training in Star City, Russia in August 2017. She took time off from training for the project in 2018 for maternity leave and returned to training in early 2019. Currently, the flight plan calls for the flight to happen sometime in the early 2020s, one of the two women will be selected to fly the mission with the other serving as her backup, which one will take which seat is not clear yet. ==References== Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:German meteorologists Category:People from Heidelberg Category:University of Bonn alumni Category:University of Bonn faculty ",
