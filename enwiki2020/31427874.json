    "text": "The Heritage Party of Alberta was a right-wing political party active in Politics of Canada during the 1980s. Throughout its existence, it was led by Mike Pawlus. The party was founded in 1984 (and officially recognized in January 1985), and in that same year it began negotiations with other small right-wing parties in Alberta. The next year, they joined with Western Canada Concept and Alberta Social Credit Party to create the Alberta Political Alliance (later called Alberta Party), but left the coalition a year later to run independently once more, in a local 1986 election. The party ceased to exist in 1987. ==Elections contested== *Spirit River-Fairview by-election, February 21, 1985.
