    "text": "Susan M. Kauzlarich is an American chemist who is a distinguished professor of the department of chemistry at the University of California, Davis (UC Davis). At UC Davis, Kauzlarich leads a research group focused on the synthesis of novel materials for magnetic resonance imaging, and nanomaterials for applications in the energy and biomedical sciences, such as opto-electronic nanomaterials and nanomaterials for drug-delivery. Kauzlarich also works on Zintl phases, nanoclusters and thermoelectrics materials. Kauzlarich has published over 250 peer-reviewed publications and has been awarded several patents.. In 2009, Kauzlarich received the annual Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring, which is administered by the National Science Foundation to acknowledge faculty members who raise the membership of minorities, women and disabled students in the science and engineering fields. == Education, career, and service == Kauzlarich received a Bachelor of Science in chemistry from the College of William & Mary in 1980. Although originally planning to become a high school chemistry teacher, mentors she met in college encouraged her to pursue graduate studies in chemistry. She would go on to perform graduate work with Bruce A. Averill at Michigan State University where she received a chemistry PhD in 1985. During her graduate studies, Kauzlarich worked on several systems, in particular the development and study of low-dimensional conducting materials. During this time, she used x-ray absorption spectroscopy and neutron diffraction and submitted a proposal for intercalation chemistry to enable the synthesis of low-dimensional conducting materials. From 1985 to 1987, Kauzlarich was a postdoctoral fellow with John Corbett at Iowa State University where she explored synthesis and bonding in novel extended metal chain compounds. Kauzlarich joined the department of Chemistry at the University of California, Davis in 1987, where she became an associate professor in 1992, in 1996, a full professor, and in 2014, a distinguished professor. She was a visiting scholar at Argonne National Laboratory from 1997-1998, Faculty Assistant to the Dean of Mathematical and Physical Sciences from 2010-2013, chair of the Chemistry department from 2013- 2016. Kauzlarich serves as an Associate Editor for the journal Chemistry of Materials since 2006. She has been a member of the Editorial Advisory Board for the handbook on the Physics and Chemistry of the Rare Earths since 2002. She served as an associate editor for the Journal of Solid State Chemistry from 2000-2005, and as a member of the Advisory Review Board of the Research Corporation for Science Advancement from 2004 to 2010. Kauzlarich is the editor of the book \"Chemistry, structure, and bonding of Zintl phases and ions\". Kauzlarich is an advocate for diversity in the chemistry community and is well known for her personal commitment to mentorship. Throughout her career she has built and continues to support a pipeline of women and underrepresented students in the field of chemistry from high school through graduate study as evidenced by her awards in mentorship, including the Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring, as well as other mentoring awards at UC Davis. During her career, Kauzlarich's mentorship strategies have expanded to help support a culture shift in her community through discussions, workshops, and development of new initiatives. One of her initiatives has been the development of the American Chemical Society Summer Educational Experience for the Economically Disadvantaged Program (SEED) program which she established at UC Davis in 1988. For her mentorship of students, Kauzlarich was recognized by Barack Obama with the 2009 Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring. At UC Davis, she serves as committee member for the Center for the Advancement of Multicultural Perspectives on Science, part of the UC Davis \"ADVANCE\" initiative. She is also an active member of the steering committees at UC Davis including the Women's Research and Resource Center and Women in Science and Engineering. == Research and notable publications == Kauzlarich's research focuses on synthesis and characterization of novel solid state materials. Some of Kauzlarich's publications from her independent research career are listed below: * * * * * * * * * * * Kauzlarich has also been a longstanding global expert on the preparation of colloidal nanoclusters and most particularly the preparation of challenging to access Group IV derivatives. These materials hold promise in the areas of biomedicine alongside, importantly, next- generation devices with novel optical and transport properties. Listed below are some of her research team's publications in this research area to-date: * * * * * * * * * * == Awards == Kauzlarich has received numerous awards including: *AAAS Chair-Elect of the Section on Chemistry (2017) *UC Davis Chancellor's Award for Excellence in Mentoring in Undergraduate Research (2017) *Distinguished Professor, UC Davis (2014) *Francis P.
