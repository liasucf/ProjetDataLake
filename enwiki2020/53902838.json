Initially released on April 27, 2017 on their YouTube channel as a part of their new EP (III), the song is featured as the second track on the band's third studio album Sacred Hearts Club and was released as the record's first single by Columbia Records. ==Music video== The official video for \"Doing It for the Money\" was released August 11, 2017 and was directed by Daniel Henry and produced by Molly Oritz. The video utilizes Google's DeepDream Technology that \"manipulates reality to create a sensory overload.\" On the topic of the video, Henry stated that \"In researching more about the DeepDream world, I loved the idea of letting the collective unconscious of the internet play a part in the forming the music video. At any moment you can freeze frame and start to see a cryptic narrative that unfolds in infinite degrees. You might see a dog, or a dinosaur, or a dead president in these hallucinations, or it could just be projections of our inner turmoil.\" ==Personnel== Foster the People * Mark Foster \u2013 vocals, piano, bass synthesizer, tubular bells * Isom Innis \u2013 drums, percussion, synthesizers Additional personnel * Manny Marroquin \u2013 mixing * Ryan Tedder \u2013 backing vocals ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !
