    "text": "The Secretary for Food and Health () is a ministerial position in the Hong Kong Government, who heads the Food and Health Bureau (FHB). The current office holder is Sophia Chan. The position was created on July 1, 2007, following the reshuffle of the principal officials and reorganisation of the policy bureaux of the Hong Kong Government. It replaced the previous Secretary for Health, Welfare and Food, and the portfolio with welfare transferred to the Secretary for Labour and Welfare. The SFH is a politically appointed position. In other words, its term expires when the Chief Executive leaves office. The secretary is also a member of the Executive Council (ExCo). ==Centre for Health Protection== The CHP was created in 2003 in response to the SARS outbreak and copies the function of the CDC in the United States.
