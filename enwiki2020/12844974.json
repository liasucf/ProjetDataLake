    "text": "\"Glad to Be Unhappy\" is a popular song composed by Richard Rodgers, with lyrics by Lorenz Hart.Jacobs, Dick & Harriet Jacobs \u2013 \u2018\u2019Who Wrote That Song?\u2019\u2019 published by Writer\u2019s Digest Books, 1993, It was introduced in their 1936 musical On Your Toes, sung by Doris Carson and David Morris, although it was not popular at the time, as there was only one recording of the song. In the 1937 London production, it was sung by Gina Malo and Eddie Pola. The song was performed in the 1954 Broadway revival by Kay Coulter and Joshua Shelley. ==The Mamas and the Papas== Originally recorded for an appearance on \"Rodgers and Hart Today\", an episode of ABC Stage 67, the Mamas and the Papas' version of the song was released as a single at the end of 1967, reaching #26 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It was issued to keep the group in the charts while awaiting the completion of the group's fourth album, The Papas & The Mamas. However, the song does not appear on that album; it was instead used to promote the group's second greatest-hits package, entitled Golden Era Vol. 2. It is the last of the Mamas & the Papas' singles produced in a professional studio; subsequent singles were recorded in John and Michelle Phillips' home studio. The mono single differs slightly from the stereo album mix, as was common for the group's singles, in that a few additional words are sung during the first chorus in the stereo mix. The B-side of the single is \"Hey Girl\", a track from the group's first album. ==Other notable recordings== * Bea Wain (1939) * Lee Wiley (February 1940) * Lena Horne (October 1946) * Helen Merrill (February 1954) * Sammy Davis Jr., on Starring Sammy Davis Jr. (1955) * Frank Sinatra, on In the Wee Small Hours (recorded February 8, 1955) * Billie Holiday, on Lady in Satin (recorded February 21, 1958) * Chris Connor on Sings Ballads of the Sad Cafe (recorded January 29, 1959) * Eric Dolphy, on Outward Bound (1960) * Clare Fischer, on Easy Livin' (recorded August 8, 1963; released in limited edition 1966; reissued 1968) * Paul Desmond, on Glad to Be Unhappy (1965) * Nancy Wilson, on But Beautiful (1969) * Barbra Streisand, on Barbra Streisand...And Other Musical Instruments (1973) * The Great Jazz Trio, on Love For Sale (1976) * Carmen McRae, on The Carmen McRae-Betty Carter Duets (1987) * Wynton Marsalis, on Standard Time, Vol. 5: the Midnight Blues (1998) * Etienne Daho (2007) * Todd Gordon, on Ballads from the Midnight Hotel (2007) * Chris Botti (featuring John Mayer on lead vocals), on Chris Botti in Boston (2008) * Nels Cline, on Lovers (2016) ==References== Category:Songs with music by Richard Rodgers Category:Songs with lyrics by Lorenz Hart Category:Frank Sinatra songs Category:1936 songs Category:Torch songs Category:Nancy Wilson (jazz singer) songs Category:Barbra Streisand songs Category:1967 singles Category:The Mamas & the Papas songs Category:Dunhill Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Lou Adler Category:Songs from Rodgers and Hart musicals ",
