    "text": "The Naas River, a perennial stream of the Murrumbidgee catchment within the Murray-Darling basin, is located in the Australian Capital Territory, Australia. ==Course== The river rises in the southern ranges of Namadgi National Park, south of Canberra, with flow generated by runoff and melting snow during spring from the Snowy Mountains. The river flows generally north, joined by four minor tributaries, before reaching its confluence with the Gudgenby River, south of Tharwa; descending over its course. The watershed boundary of the Naas River defines the southern and south-eastern border of the Australian Capital Territory with New South Wales. ==See also== *List of rivers of the Australian Capital Territory *Australian Alps Walking Track ==References== Category:Rivers of the Australian Capital Territory Category:Murray-Darling basin ",
