One writer claims \"Auburn had a lot of great football teams, but there may not have been one greater than the 1913-1914 team.\" One story of the origin of the school's \"War Eagle\" started with Hairston, the starting quarterback during the Carlisle-Auburn game in 1914. In the 1916 game against ,Auburn and Alabama Flirt With Renewed Relationship, The Miami News, December 25, 1928. Moon Ducote kicked a 40-yard field goal off of Hairston's football helmet in the fourth quarter and in the mud, which proved the only points in the 3-0 Auburn victory. The maneuver prompted a rule that stated the ball must be kicked directly off the ground.Loyola Director, Dick Ducote, Dies, The Milwaukee Journal, March 26, 1937. ==References== Category:1892 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Date of death missing Category:Players of American football from Mississippi Category:Auburn Tigers football players Category:American football quarterbacks Category:American football ends Category:People from Crawford, Mississippi ",
