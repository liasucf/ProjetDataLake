    "text": "Jay Edwards is a State Representative of the Ohio House of Representatives for the 94th District. He is a Republican. The 94th district consists of Meigs County, as well as portions of Athens, Vinton, and Washington counties. Edwards additionally serves as the Majority Whip of the Ohio House. ==Life and career== Edwards was born and raised in Nelsonville, Ohio, where he graduated from Nelsonville-York High School and still resides today. After high school he attended nearby Ohio University on a football scholarship, where he studied mathematics. In an interview Edwards disclosed during senior year of college, a medical condition led to an illness that didn\u2019t allow him to finish his coursework at OU, and so he never earned his degree. Edwards is a licensed realtor, and recently begun work in medical sales within the drug treatment market. The Edwards family has long roots in Nelsonville, where his uncle recently served as city manager. ==Ohio House of Representatives== In 2016, Representative Debbie Phillips was term-limited and ineligible to run for a fifth term. A Democrat, Phillips had only faced one serious election in her four terms, in 2014, where she won by just over 100 votes. However, despite Athens County, the largest in the district, being considered reliably Democratic, Republicans had historically seen success in winning the district prior to Phillips' taking the seat. Democrats nonetheless fielded Sarah Grace, a small-business owner from Athens who was a newcomer to politics and a liberal. Despite being considered the favorite, Edwards raised considerable money, albeit not without controversy. In the end, in what was a very good year for Republicans, Edwards defeated Grace by a 58% to 42% margin, taking the seat. Edwards is the first Republican to hold the seat since Jimmy Stewart held the seat from 2003 to 2008. In 2018, Edwards defeated Democrat Taylor Sappington to retain the seat. In the 2020 general election, Edwards faces Democrat Katie O'Neill. ===Ties to Indicted House Speaker and FirstEnergy Scandal=== In 2018, Edwards aligned with Larry Householder in his bid to be elected Speaker of the Ohio House in a direct challenge to then-speaker Ryan Smith. In the GOP primary, Edwards made contributions from his own reelection campaign account to GOP candidates believed to be loyal to Householder, giving $97,500 in all to 12 Householder-aligned primary candidates whose success would be vital to Householder's attempt to take on Smith in the January 2019 vote. Upon his reelection to the House and the ascendance of Householder as Speaker, in February of 2019, Edwards was chosen to serve on Householder's leadership team as Majority Whip in the Ohio House. Also in 2019, Edwards was one of 51 members of the Ohio House to vote for final passage of House Bill 6, controversial legislation to bail out failing nuclear and coal power plants passed as part of a $61 million pay-to-play scheme, designed and executed by Householder and financed by the FirstEnergy Corporation and its allies in the coal industry. The scheme is currently the subject of an FBI investigation that has already resulted in the arrest of Householder and 4 co-conspirators. Edwards took $8,708 in campaign contributions from FirstEnergy's political action committee prior to the passage of HB6. In 2020, after the FBI arrested Larry Householder and his colleagues voted to replace him as Speaker, Edwards was asked by newly-elected Speaker Bob Cupp to step down as Majority Whip to make way for a new leadership team unconnected to Householder, but refused. ==Electoral history== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- ! colspan=\"9\" | Election results |- !Year !Office !Election !Votes for Edwards !% !Opponent !Party !Votes !% |- |2016 |rowspan=4|Ohio House of Representatives |General | |28,649 | |57.80% | |Sarah Grace | |Democrat | |20,897 | |42.20% |-|- |2018 |General | |23,562 | |58.29% | |Taylor Sappington | |Democrat | |16,855 | |41.71% |} == References == ==External links== *Ohio State Representative Jay Edwards official site Category:Living people Category:Ohio University alumni Category:Members of the Ohio House of Representatives Category:Ohio Republicans Category:People from Nelsonville, Ohio Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
