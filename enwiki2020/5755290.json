However, over the past few years, it has consistently shown academic growth spurts, largely due to its faculty and administration. As of 2018, the administration is headed by principal Dr. Pamela Brown, and associate principals Grace Yang, Jose Varela, and Dr. Karma Nicolis.https://www.leuzinger.org/ ==Olympic mascot== As Leuzinger's first senior class graduated while the 1932 Summer Olympics were hosted in and around nearby Los Angeles, the school's nickname became the \"Olympians\". Leuzinger was granted authorization for the school to use the Olympic name and Olympic rings trademark. In turn, the campus of the \"Olympians\" also provided staging for aspects of the 1932 Olympics; facilities for the use of competitors, including a shooting range, and a bowling alley, were constructed under the main building. On September 8, 1936, construction on a women's gym with an Olympic-size swimming pool was begun. However eventual earthquake damage, combined with tougher safety codes and remodeling opportunities, required the pool's removal. == Notable alumni == *Tiran Porter, class of 1966, The Doobie Brothers bass guitar *George Foster, class of 1967, Cincinnati Reds outfielder, two-time World Series champion and 1977 National League Most Valuable Player \"Shouting Over A Quiet Man,\" Sports Illustrated, July 19, 1976 *Mike Gin, mayor of Redondo Beach, California *Ross Jeffries, author, \"speed seduction\" guru \"The Rap Trap,\" Metro, Aug. 13-19, 1998 *Kei Kamara, New England Revolution striker \"Kamara gives back to Leuzinger,\" Pure Preps, Jan. 15, 2009 *Kurupt Attended Leuzinger in the late 1980's before dropping out. *Marvcus Patton, linebacker for UCLA and Buffalo Bills; played in four Super Bowls \"This General Patton Plays Linebacker for the UCLA Bruins and Hits Like a Tank,\" L.A.
