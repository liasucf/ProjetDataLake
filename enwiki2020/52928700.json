In 2018 another left-wing Russian party, New Communist Movement, merged with the UCP. ==Criticism== Political analysist Sean Guillory wrote about the radical Left in Russia on the eve of the Russian presidential election in May 2018. In this section of Russian politics he included a range of organisations, which included the United Communist Party. Guillory stated that he sees the radical Left in Russia (including the United Communist Party) as limited by a number of factors. These include state repression, ideological differences (particularly the Ukrainian question), a generational divide and a lack of money. Despite their aspiration to develop a parallel media that is representative of \u201cthe majority of the Russian population\u201d the Russian left Guillory argues are \u201cresource poor.\u201d There is, according to Guillory a clear generational divide within the Russian Left that has a detrimental effect on the United Communist Party. Older parties such as the UCP identify with the Soviet Union with a membership and support base that \u201ctends to be older, even elderly\u201d. Newer groups don\u2019t employ as much Soviet Union symbolism and have members and supporters who are younger. Young Russians who start to develop a class consciousness and interest in political affairs are attracted to the newer groups. Failure to attract younger members and supporters has a terminal effect. This further accelerates the decline of the older Russian left organisations. == References == ==External links== *Official website Category:2014 establishments in Russia Category:Communist parties in Russia Category:Far-left politics in Russia Category:Political parties established in 2014 ",
