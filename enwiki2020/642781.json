As the town increased in size the council was moved to Bank Hall the former home of Lord Winmarleigh for \u00a39,700; this still serves as the Town Hall, and its \"golden gates\" are one of the town's attractions. ==References== Category:Local government in Warrington Warrington Category:Mayors of Warrington ",
