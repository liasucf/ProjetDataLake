    "text": "\"Dream, Dream\" is the second single by the Dutch girl group Luv', released in November 1977 by Philips/Phonogram Records. It appears on the group's first album With Luv' (1978). ==Background== The previous single (\"My Man\") was the group's first record in 1977. It was an honorable hit single in the Benelux countries. The follow-up single was entitled \"Dream, Dream\". The musical arrangements were inspired by the sound of ABBA. The famous Swedish pop quartet indeed inspired their songwriters and producers (Hans van Hemert and Piet Souer). The girl trio expected to have another hit but the single flopped and the group seemed to be a one-hit wonder. The real breakthrough came in 1978 with the success of \"U.O.Me (Theme from Waldolala)\" and \"You're the Greatest Lover\". ==Track listing and release== 7\" vinylRelease information on Discogs.com website Accessed: February 11, 2011 * a. \"Dream, Dream\" * b. \"Hang On\" {|class=\"wikitable\" !
