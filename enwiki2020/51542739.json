    "text": "The Evangelical Methodist Church of America (or Evangelical Methodist Conference) is a Conservative Holiness, Christian denomination based in the United States. Ardently Fundamentalist, the denomination has its roots in a movement of churches that broke away from Mainline Methodism in the 1940s and 50s. The small denomination comprised sixteen churches as of July 2018. It operates Breckbill Bible College in Virginia. Dr. James B. Fields is the general superintendent of this group, which claims mission work in Suriname, Jamaica, Chile, Nigeria, France, Kenya and Malawi. It is headquartered in Kingsport, Tennessee. Principal strength of the denomination is centered in the Northeastern and Southern United States. The denomination publishes The Evangelical Methodist in conjunction with the likeminded Fundamental Methodist Church.

A gathering of disaffected Methodist preachers and laymen in 1946 in Memphis, Tennessee, gave rise to the Evangelical Methodist Church (EMC) denomination. This first gathering was inspired by the withdrawal of the pastor of some of Methodism's largest churches of that era, Dr. J. H. Hamblen. Hamblen's exit from a large church in Texas generated significant press coverage, leading to this coalition of conservative preachers and laymen from various pockets of the Holiness movement and Fundamental Methodism. After some prayer and deliberation they began work forming a new denomination to rival what they saw as a liberal trend in the Methodist Church. Among the founders of this movement was W. W. Breckbill (1907-1974). By 1952 differences regarding key doctrines came to the forefront, especially in regard to the Wesleyan tenet of entire sanctification, the eternal security of the believer, and Congregationalism. According to Hamblen, about 20 clergy and laymen led by Breckbill walked out of the 1952 conference in Altoona, Pennsylvania when they could not agree on Wesleyan doctrine of Holiness.J. H. Hamblen, \"A Look into Life: An Autobiography,\" pg. 162, (Abliene, Tex.: J.H. Hamblen, 1969) A formal conference was established by Breckbill's allies in 1953. The conference has gone by several names since organization: the Evangelical (Independent) Methodist Churches, the Fellowship of Evangelical Methodist Churches, the Evangelical Methodist Conference, the Evangelical Methodist Church of America, \"the Fundamental EMC,\" or simply the Evangelical Methodist Church . The larger EMC pursued legal action against Breckbill's group regarding the name and other intellectual property.J. H. Hamblen, \"A Look into Life: An Autobiography,\" pg. 162, (Abliene, Tex.: J.H. Hamblen, 1969) This Fundamental EMC formed Breckbill Bible College in 1957 in Williamsburg, Pennsylvania, named for its preferred founding figure. It is a charter member of the American Council of Christian Churches, a Fundamentalist answer to ecumenical bodies such as the World Council of Churches. According to an observer, the development of a separate, fundamental EMC summarized the tensions between Holiness and non-Holiness conservatives present in many denominations in the wake of the Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy. > \"The history of the Evangelical Methodist Church illustrates the tensions > inherent in a Fundamentalist-Holiness relationship.

M. D. Opara, of Nigeria, West Africa, was received into the original EMC's General Conference along with about 10,000 members.http://www.cap-press.com/pdf/2096.pdf Ekechi, Felix K., \"Pioneer, Patriot, and Nigerian Nationalist : a Biography of the Reverend M.D. Opara, 1915\u20131965,\" Carolina Academic Press, 2010. This body aligned with W.W. Breckbill's faction after 1952. A merger with the Southern Methodist Church failed in 1958 when Breckbill's EMC would not accept a condition that the name of the combined church be The Southern Methodist Church.Interview with W.W. Breckbill, June 24, 1961: Bucke, Emory Stevens, \"The History of American Methodism, Volume III,\" Abingdon Press, 1964 ==Beliefs== This wing of the Evangelical Methodist movement is more into cultural separatism than the larger EMC body, preferring modesty in clothing and refraining from \"worldly amusements.\" It does not teach the doctrine of Entire Sanctification as a second, crisis experience as do many Methodist offshoots but prefers a progressivist view. It is congregationalist in polity. The denomination has more beliefs in common with the distinctly Fundamentalist Conservative Holiness Movement than what is often called the Holiness-Evangelical movement. As recently as 2011, a resolution stated: A prior resolution by the body from the 1990s decried the men's parachurch organization Promise Keepers as \"an admixture of New Evangelicals, Cultists, Roman Catholics and others forming an unbiblical amalgamation that is anti-Scriptural.\" ==Relation to other Evangelical Methodist groups== There are many denominations internationally that are unrelated to the U.S. EMCs, including Evangelical Methodist Church in Bolivia, Evangelical Methodist Church in the Philippine Islands, and others. ==References== ==External links== *Breckbill Bible College *Evangelical Methodist Church of America website Category:Christian organizations established in 1953 Category:Methodist denominations in North America Category:Methodist denominations established in the 20th century Category:Fundamentalist denominations Category:Holiness denominations Category:Evangelical denominations in North America ",
