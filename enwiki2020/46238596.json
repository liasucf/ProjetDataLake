It is one of the three churches for the Husnes og Holmedal parish which is part of the Sunnhordland prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1882 using designs by the architect F. \u00d8vrevik. The church seats about 215 people. ==History== View of the church The church has been around since the Middle Ages. The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1360, but it was not new at that time. That church was a stave church with a tower that was located at Holmedal. In both the 1600s and 1700s, major repairs were undertaken, including removing the tower. The nave measured approximately with a choir that measured about . In 1724, the church was purchased from the Crown by Henrik H. Formann, the manager of the Lyse Abbey. The church was sold along with hundreds of other churches to raise money to pay down the debt from the Great Northern War. In 1814, the old church was torn down and the owner at that time, Haktor Amundsen Tveit, paid to build a new church on the same site. The new church was a small rectangular church without a separate choir and no tower. In 1866, the parish purchased the church back from private owners at a cost of 325 Norwegian speciedalers. After the church was constructed the local parish priest, P. B\u00f8ckmann complained that it \"looks like a barn building and not like a church, it is a cramped house, has no chancel building, no tower, not even a marking that indicates it is God's house\" (). On 11 December 1880, a royal resolution was passed that approved the moving of the Holmedal Church from its historic location to one that was more centrally located in the parish, about to the southwest in the village of Ut\u00e5ker. In 1882, the church was taken down, moved, and rebuilt using a new design by the local lensmann F. \u00d8vrevik from Sk\u00e5nevik. The new church has a choir that is approximately and the nave is about . The church was renovated for the 100th anniversary in 1982 under the direction of architect Magne Ivars\u00f8y. ==See also== *List of churches in Bj\u00f8rgvin ==References== Category:Kvinnherad Category:Churches in Vestland Category:Wooden churches in Norway Category:19th-century Church of Norway church buildings Category:Churches completed in 1882 Category:13th-century establishments in Norway ",
