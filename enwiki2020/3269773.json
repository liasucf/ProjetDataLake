    "text": "Aluminium monofluoride is the chemical compound with the formula AlF. This elusive species is formed by the reaction between aluminium trifluoride and metallic aluminium at elevated temperatures but quickly reverts to the reactants when cooled. Clusters derived from related aluminium(I) halides can be stabilized using specialized ligands. This molecule has been detected in the interstellar medium, where molecules are so dilute that intermolecular collisions are unimportant. ==See also== *Aluminium monobromide *Aluminium monochloride *Aluminium monoiodide ==References== Category:Aluminium compounds Category:Fluorides Category:Metal halides ",
