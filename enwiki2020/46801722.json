On December 20, 2016 he signed ACB contract. == Mixed martial arts career == Silva began training in Muay Thai at the age of 20, transitioning to mixed martial arts a couple of years later. He compiled a professional record of 11-1-1 before signing with the UFC in May 2013. === Ultimate Fighting Championship === Silva made his promotional debut as a short notice replacement against Ildemar Alc\u00e2ntara on June 8, 2013 at UFC on Fuel TV 10. Silva lost the fight via unanimous decision. After a string of victories on the regional circuit, Silva returned to the UFC against Francisco Trinaldo on September 13, 2014 at UFC Fight Night 51. Silva lost the fight via unanimous decision. Silva next faced Charlie Brenneman on November 8, 2014 at UFC Fight Night 56. Silva defeated Brenneman via submission in the first round. Silva faced Drew Dober on March 21, 2015 at UFC Fight Night 62. Silva won the fight via technical submission in the second round. Silva was attempting to secure a guillotine choke after dropping to the mat with Dober's neck secured in his arm. Dober defended and moved his body to the side to stave off being caught in the choke. Silva appeared to be losing his grip on the submission as Dober continued to work free. However, the referee stepped in and touched the fighters as if to motion that he was standing them up. In reality, he was stopping the fight due to submission despite the fact that Dober never tapped and was in no significant danger of being choked out from the hold. The fight was later overturned to a no contest by the Brazilian MMA Athletic Commission (CABMMA) after the referee Eduardo Herdy admitted his mistake. Silva faced promotional newcomer Lewis Gonzalez on June 27, 2015 at UFC Fight Night 70. Silva won the fight via unanimous decision.
