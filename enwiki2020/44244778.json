Edgar Lungu beat Hakainde Hichilema of the United Party for National Development by just 27,757 votes and the opposition has yet to accept the credibility of the election. ==Electoral system== Although previously the President had been elected in a single round of voting by the first-past-the- post system, in 2015 the National Assembly approved the change in the constitution to change to a two-round system.Closely fought 2016 election would increase localised violence risks and put pressure on Zambia's austerity plans IHS Jane's 360, 9 December 2015 The constitutional change also introduced the concept of running mates; previously the vice president was appointed after the elections.

In response, the UPND accused the Patriotic Front of politicising state entities against them. Violent outbreaks occurred in Lusaka after the government made the decision to suspend the operations of The Post newspaper (one of the several independent newspapers in the country) on 10 June. As a result of the violence, the Election Commission suspended campaigning in Lusaka and Namwala for ten days, and the ban on the newspaper was lifted on 18 July. However, on 23 June the government started taking action against The Post for unpaid taxes of around $6 million; the newspaper denied the claim saying the issue was still being discussed in court. The opposition accused the government of silencing the media. ===Arrests of opposition members=== On 20 July Geoffrey Bwalya Mwamba, the vice president of the UPND, was arrested along with several party officials with the accusation that they were trying to start a private militia. The police raided his house and found petrol bombs, machetes and spears. The opposition denied the claims, saying that the weapons were planted there after the arrest. The police raided the house following alleged political poster vandals hiding in the house. A total of 28 people were arrested in the raid. ===Ballot papers=== There was a lot of controversy in the printing of the ballot papers; previously all ballot papers had been printed in South Africa, but the Electoral commission of Zambia awarded the contract for the 2016 elections to a firm in Dubai. The contract was significantly more expensive and many opposition parties criticised the move. Parties opposed the move as printing the ballot papers outside Africa was expensive to verify and increased the chance of electoral fraud. To counter the suspicion of rigging, the Electoral Commission allowed party officials to travel to Dubai to witness the printing of the ballots; all ballot papers were to be only released if all party officials approved of the process. The printing was completed on 20 July 2016 and the ballots were transported to Zambia on 28 July 2016. However, concerns with respect to the transport and distribution of the ballot papers then arose. The Zambian Air Force were responsible for distributing the ballots across the country. ==Results== Results announced by the Electoral Commission on 15 August showed Edgar Lungu winning the presidential election with slightly more than 50% of the vote, ahead of his only major competitor, Hakainde Hichilema, who received almost 48%. Lungu finished a few thousand votes over the threshold for an outright victory.Chris Mfula and Stella Mapenzauswa, \"Zambian president Lungu re-elected in disputed vote\", Reuters, 15 August 2016. ===President=== ===National Assembly=== ==Reactions== ===Domestic=== * The main opposition accused the electoral commission of participating in fraud as it significantly delayed the announcement of the results. ===International=== *: EU observers commended the Zambian people for conducting peaceful elections and deemed the election process free and transparent despite some delays. However, the EU commission accused state media of being unbalanced in its report. *: The US- based Carter Center said that the election was conducted in a highly tense atmosphere and that there was a lot of polarization due to inter-party politics. The Center was also concerned by the delay in the announcement of the results by the electoral commission. *African Union: Goodluck Jonathan, the head of the AU observer mission in Zambia, also deemed election day to have been peaceful. However, like the EU, he noted that state media had been biased towards the ruling party. He also said that holding the referendum at the same time as the elections caused confusion to many voters and added complexity to the election process. *Southern African Development Community: The SADC observer mission along with COMESA, Commonwealth, and the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region all concluded that the election was conducted in a free and fair environment. Jakaya Kikwete, leader of the Commonwealth observer mission in Zambia, said that pockets of violence in the country and the way the police handled the situation were unfortunate. ==Aftermath== PF members took to the street to celebrate Lungu's victory, whilst riots took place in most parts of the country. The UPND rejected the results, saying that the electoral commission had colluded to rig the result in favour of Lungu. The UPND filled a petition to the constitutional court over the recount of votes in Lusaka as major irregularities were reported from the city. Lungu, who could only be inaugurated seven days after being proclaimed the victor, held a celebratory rally on 16 August for his re- election that secured him another five-year term. He was sworn in on 13 September 2016. ==See also== *List of members of the National Assembly of Zambia (2016\u201321) ==References== Zambia Category:2016 in Zambia Category:August 2016 events in Africa Category:Elections in Zambia Category:Presidential elections in Zambia ",
