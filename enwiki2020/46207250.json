    "text": "1 Timothy 2 is the second chapter of the First Epistle to Timothy in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. The author has been traditionally identified as Paul the Apostle since as early as AD 180,See the arguments on composition of the epistle.Halley, Henry H. Halley's Bible Handbook: an abbreviated Bible commentary. 24th edition. Zondervan Publishing House. 1965. p. 631Holman Illustrated Bible Handbook. Holman Bible Publishers, Nashville, Tennessee. 2012. although most modern scholars consider the letter pseudepigraphical,David E. Aune, ed., The Blackwell Companion to The New Testament (Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), 9: \"While seven of the letters attributed to Paul are almost universally accepted as authentic (Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians, Philemon), four are just as widely judged to be pseudepigraphical, i.e. written by unknown authors under Paul's name: Ephesians and the Pastorals (1 and 2 Timothy and Titus).\" perhaps written as late as the first half of the second century AD.Stephen L. Harris, The New Testament: A Student's Introduction, 4th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2001), 366. ==Text== The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 15 verses. ===Textual witnesses=== Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Codex Sinaiticus (AD 330\u2013360) *Codex Alexandrinus (400\u2013440) *Codex Freerianus (c. 450; extant verses 1, 9\u201313) *Codex Claromontanus (c. 550) *Codex Coislinianus (c. 550) ==Instruction on Prayer (2:1\u20137)== ===Verses 3\u20134=== :For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. NKJV *\"Savior\" (Greek: , '): The second of three times in this letter (others: 1:1; 4:10) that God is called \"Savior\", recalling the 'well-known appellation of Yahweh in the Greek Old Testament' (for examples, LXX ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ). ==Men and Women at Prayer (2:8\u201315; 3:1)== ===Verse 12=== :And I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, but to be in silence. NKJV * \"I do not permit a woman to teach\" (KJV: \"But I suffer not a woman to teach\"): John Gill interprets this in the sense of women may teach only in private, that is, in their own houses and families, to bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, not to forsake the law or doctrine of a mother, any more than the instruction of a father (see ; ), and they are to be teachers of good things (cf. ). Timothy surely received a lot of advantage from the private teachings and instructions of his mother Eunice, and grandmother Lois, but then women were not to teach in the church. * \"To have authority over a man\" (KJV: \"to usurp authority over the man\"): Gill sees this as not to be done in civil and political things, or in things relating to civil government; and in things domestic, or the affairs of the family, therefore also not in ecclesiastical things, nor what relate to the church, for one part of rule is to feed the church with knowledge and understanding; and for a woman to do this, can be seen as to usurp an authority over the man. * \"To be in silence\": according to Gill is \"to sit and hear quietly\", learning, not teaching, as in . ===Verse 13=== :For Adam was formed first, then Eve. NKJV *\"Was formed\" (Greek: ): having the same root as the word used in the LXX in , , \"The Lord God formed man...;\" and in of the beasts of the field, wherease in man is called , \"the thing made;\" and God is , \"he that made it;\" the words \"plaster\", \"plastic\", or \"protoplasm\" are also from the same root.Exell, Joseph S.; Spence-Jones, Henry Donald Maurice (Editors).
