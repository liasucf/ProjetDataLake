The area is served by the Saskatoon John G. Diefenbaker International Airport, the 22nd busiest airport in the country. Unlike many major North American urbanized areas, yet similarly to other prairie centres in Canada, Saskatoon has absorbed numerous of its neighbouring communities in its history. In the past, when the city limits reached the borders of neighbouring municipalities, such as Sutherland and Nutana, they were simply annexed into Saskatoon's jurisdiction. The vast majority of the region's inhabitants reside within the City of Saskatoon, which now has a population in excess of 270,000. ==Saskatoon CMA== Census metropolitan area (CMA) is the term Statistics Canada uses to determine the demographics of greater Saskatoon (as well as other large Canadian cities). The Saskatoon CMA includes the City of Saskatoon, Rural Municipality of Corman Park No. 344, the cities of Martensville and Warman, and other smaller communities within the region. According to Canada's 2016 census, the Saskatoon CMA has surpassed a quarter of a million people and is the 17th largest metropolitan area in the country with an estimated population of 295,095. It is also the largest CMA in Saskatchewan and has a land area of . ==Demographics== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=2 | Ethnic groups in Metro Saskatoon (2016) !!
