Photograph. May 27, 2020 Both Deepak Rajawat of smartprix and Sanket Vijayasarathy of India Today praised the Galaxy A30's display, software and battery life, but criticized the phone's chipset due to performance issues and the \"average\" quality camera. Tom Bedford and Matt Swider of TechRadar also complimented the vibrant screen of the A30. However, the reviewers found the phone difficult to handle due to its large size. Writing a review for 91mobiles, Shekhar Thakhan praised the phone's AMOLED display, One UI interface and battery life as well. In contrast, the back of the phone was noted by the reviewer as a \"fingerprint magnet\". ==See also== *Samsung Galaxy *Samsung Galaxy A series ==References== ==External links== * Category:Samsung Galaxy Category:Mobile phones introduced in 2019 Category:Android (operating system) devices Category:Samsung mobile phones Category:Phones with multiple rear cameras ",
