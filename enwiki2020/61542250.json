He was then hired as a taxonomist at the Utrecht University Botanic Gardens. He spent much of his time identifying botanical collections at the original garden in Baarn, as well as identifying at documenting species at the Von Gimborn Arboretum. He remained at the gardens until his retirement in 1984.Zijlstra, G. (1998). Erik A. Mennega (1923-1998). Taxon, 47(4), 974-975.

After Cowan left the project, Stafleu began collaborating with Mennega on a supplement series. The two wrote and published six volumes between 1992 and 2000, the last two posthumously.Dorr, Laurence J., Nicolson, Dan H (2008). TL-2 Speaks Volumes. Plant Press, 11(4).
