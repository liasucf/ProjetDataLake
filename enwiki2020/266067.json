    "text": "War Grave from Jimmy Hall-Les Ormes (Yonne, France) Who Dares Wins (Latin: Qui audet adipiscitur; , O tolm\u00f3n nik\u00e1; ; ; Portuguese: Quem ousa vence; German: Wer wagt gewinnt) is a motto made popular by the British Special Air Service. It is normally credited to the founder of the SAS, Sir David Stirling. Among the SAS themselves, it is sometimes humorously corrupted to \"Who cares [who] wins?\". The expression appears in a medieval Arabic book of fairy tales translated and published in 2014. The catchphrase \"He Who Dares Wins\" was commonly used by Del Boy in British sitcom Only Fools and Horses. The shortened form \"Qui Audet\" is also heard on the second episode of Pennyworth. The motto has been used by twelve elite special forces units around the world that in some way have historical ties to the British SAS. The phrase is the motto of Baron Alvingham of Woodfold in the County Palatine of Lancaster, a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. An early statement of the idea is Ancient Greek \"\u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bc\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u1f21 \u03c4\u03cd\u03c7\u03b7 \u03be\u03cd\u03bc\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\" (to\u00ees tolm\u00f4sin h\u0113 t\u00fakh\u0113 x\u00famphoros, \"luck favours the daring\") from the Athenian soldier and historian Thucydides. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
