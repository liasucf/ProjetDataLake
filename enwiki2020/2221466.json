However, in June 2016, CMT picked up the series for a fifth season. In February 2017, Britton left Nashville during the fifth season, but returned for the series finale in July 2018 as a guest star.

She later endorsed Gillibrand in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries and appeared with her at campaign events. In a 2012 interview on NPR, Britton said of the experience: \"I always wanted to be an actor. But when I went to college, I had to fulfill a language requirement and so I thought it would be really cool to do it speaking Chinese. My Chinese these days is real, real shaky. Let's put it this way: these days, my singing is better than my Chinese.\" Britton moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 2012 when she signed to star in the ABC/CMT musical drama Nashville. On April 2, 2014, Britton became the 10th Goodwill Ambassador of the United Nations Development Programme, the anti-poverty agency of the UN.
