    "text": "President Hugo Quaderer The Liechtenstein Football Association (LFV) () is the governing body of football in Liechtenstein. It was established on 28 April 1934, and became affiliated to UEFA on 22 May 1974. The association organizes the Liechtenstein national football team and the Liechtenstein Football Cup. Because Liechtenstein has fewer than 8 (only 7 not counting reserves) active teams, it is the only UEFA member without its own national league. This means the Liechtensteiner teams play in the Swiss Football League system. The LFV is based in Schaan. ==See also== *Liechtenstein national football team *Liechtenstein Football Cup *Liechtenstein football clubs in European competitions *Football in Liechtenstein ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Liechtenstein at FIFA site *Liechtenstein at UEFA site Liechtenstein Category:Football in Liechtenstein Football Category:Sports organizations established in 1934 Category:1934 establishments in Liechtenstein ",
