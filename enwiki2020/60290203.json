When Baldwin rebelled against King Stephen of England, during The Anarchy, Baldwin was banished to Anjou, where Baldwin entered the services of Empress Matilda.

He was with Henry FitzEmpress in 1149, when Henry stayed at Devizes, while travelling to be knighted by his uncle King David I of Scotland. He obtained lands and the lordship of Gilsland on the border of Northumberland and Cumbria, as well as Corby and Catterlen in Cumbria.
