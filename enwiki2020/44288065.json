    "text": "The boardwalk at Kealia Pond National Wildlife Refuge in Maui, Hawaii This is a list of boardwalks in the United States by state. Boardwalks can be found around the world, but they are especially common along the East Coast of the United States. One of the earliest boardwalks was designed in New Jersey and opened June 26, 1870, in Atlantic City. Some pedestrian paths called \"boardwalks\" are made of concrete. ==List== ===Alaska=== In the Eskimo villages of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, Alaska, wide heavy-duty boardwalks are common in villages throughout this part of Bush Alaska. Tuntutuliak was the first village to receive boardwalks in the mid-1990s. Its boardwalks were funded by a government program intended to determine whether building boardwalks would be a worthwhile investment elsewhere. Before these boardwalks existed, there was a much narrower, lower, and less extensive system of boards and boardwalks that served delta villages. ===California=== ====Newport Beach==== Newport Beach's boardwalk is a concrete path running from 36th Street to between E and F streets on the Balboa Peninsula. It passes McFadden Square and Newport Pier, and Balboa Pier. The speed limit along the path is in order to prevent conflicts among bicyclists, pedestrians, skateboarders and rollerbladers. ====Santa Cruz==== The Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk The Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, opened in 1907, is the oldest amusement park in California and the home to two national historic landmarks: the Looff Carousel and the Giant Dipper roller coaster. The Santa Cruz boardwalk no longer actually has any wooden boardwalks. ====Venice Beach==== This 2.5 kilometer boardwalk has a pedestrian walk, bike path, rollerskater and skateboard ramps, and restaurants. Venice Beach is famous for Muscle Beach, where bodybuilders work out. Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger worked out on Muscle Beach and made Gold's Gym famous in the 1980s. ===Delaware=== ====Bethany Beach==== Bethany Beach's boardwalk, while not as long as Rehoboth Beach's, connects the summer seaside resort's broad, sandy beach to motels, restaurants, and vacation homes. In 2011, Bethany Beach banned smoking on the beach and boardwalk. ====Rehoboth Beach==== The Rehoboth Beach boardwalk Rehoboth Beach's long boardwalk connects summer tourists with Rehoboth Beach's main attractions during the summer months, including high-end resorts, numerous shops, arcades, eating establishments and family amusement center.

This boardwalk has been rated a top boardwalk in the United States by National Geographic and CNN. ===Massachusetts=== ====Sandwich==== The Sandwich, Massachusetts boardwalk does not, strictly speaking, lead along the beach. Instead, it begins in a parking lot and leads through the salt marshes and out to the beach. It was destroyed in 1991 by Hurricane Bob and was then rebuilt through donations made by the townspeople.
