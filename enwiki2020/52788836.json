    "text": "Ludwig Schopen (17 October 1799, in D\u00fcsseldorf - 22 November 1867, in Bonn) was a German classical philologist and Byzantinist. As a gymnasium student in his hometown of D\u00fcsseldorf, he was encouraged by Karl Wilhelm Kort\u00fcm and Friedrich Kohlrausch to study history and philology. He studied at the University of Heidelberg as a pupil of Friedrich Creuzer, and in 1818 transferred to the newly-founded University of Bonn. Subsequently, he became a disciple of philologist Karl Friedrich Heinrich at Bonn, where in 1821 he received the first doctorate awarded by the faculty of philosophy.ADB:Schopen, Ludwig In: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie (ADB).

After graduation, he worked as a gymnasium teacher in Bonn, and in the meantime, pursued philological and historical research. He worked closely with Bonn professor Barthold Georg Niebuhr, and focused his attention on Byzantine studies, publishing critical editions on the writings of John Kantakouzenos (3 volumes, 1828\u201332) and Nicephorus Gregoras (2 volumes, 1829\u201330) as a result. With support from Friedrich Ritschl, he was named an associate professor at the university in 1840, attaining a full professorship of philology in 1844. In 1847 he was appointed director of the Bonn gymnasium. == Selected works == * De Terentio et Donato eius interprete dissertatio critica (dissertation, 1821). * Ioannis Cantacuzeni eximperatoris historiarum libri IV.
