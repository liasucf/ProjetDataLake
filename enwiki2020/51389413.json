    "text": "The AACTA Award for Best Direction in a Television Light Entertainment or Reality Series is an accolade given by the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts (AACTA), a non-profit organisation whose aim is to \"identify, award, promote and celebrate Australia's greatest achievements in film and television.\" The award is handed out at the annual AACTA Awards, which rewards achievements in feature film, television, documentaries and short films. Previously, direction for light entertainment and reality series were recognised in the Best Direction in Television category. However, when AACTA introduced craft awards for television programs in 2013, the Best Direction in Television award was split into two: Best Direction in a Drama or Comedy and Best Direction in a Television Light Entertainment or Reality Series. ==Nominees and winners== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" width=\"100%\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" align=\"centre\" |- bgcolor=\"#bebebe\" ! width=\"5%\" | Year ! width=\"25%\" | Director(s) ! width=\"25%\" | Program ! width=\"30%\" | Episode ! width=\"10%\" | Network |- |rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" | 2013 (3rd) |- style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | Tim Bartley and Jo Siddiqui | Hamish & Andy's Gap Year Asia | Episode 1: \"Week 1\" | Nine Network |- | Mark Adamson | Big Brother 10 | Episode 1: \"Launch\" | Nine Network |- | Michael Venables | MasterChef Australia: The Professionals | Episode 13: \"Mansfield Offsite\" | Network Ten |- | Ken Connor | Studio at the Memo | Episode 3: \"Anna Lumb/Briefs/Don Walker/Sheridan Harbridge/Kaki King\" | Studio |- |rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" | 2014 (4th) |- style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | Beck Cole and Craig Anderson | Black Comedy | \"Episode 3\" | ABC |- | Tim Bartley | Hamish & Andy's Gap Year: South America | Episode 1: \"Week 1\" | Nine Network |- | Michael Venables | MasterChef Australia | Episode 60: \"Grand Finale\" | Network Ten |- | Peter Ots | The Voice | Episode 1: \"Blind Audition #1\" | Nine Network |- |rowspan=\"5\" align=\"center\" | 2015 (5th) |- style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | Seth Larney | Hipsters | \"Episode 1\" | SBS2 |- | Anna Bateman | Judith Lucy Is All Woman | \"Episode 2\" | ABC |- | Damian Davis | Julia Zemiro's Home Delivery | \"Episode 7\" | ABC |- | Stamatia Maroupas | Kitchen Cabinet | \"Episode 7\" | ABC |- |} ==References== Category:AACTA Awards ",
