Francis Boyle stated in his correspondence to the public that Sulejman Tihi\u0107 and Sakib Softi\u0107 had ordered the restitution request from his original lawsuit in the Bosnian Genocide Case to be voided, thereby returning a favor to his coalition partners Alliance of Independent Social Democrats in Republika Srpska. ==Bosnian War== When the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina started in April 1992, Tihi\u0107 was captured by Serb soldiers and was tortured in three concentration camps in Bosnia (in Bosanski \u0160amac, Br\u010dko, and the Batkovi\u0107 camp in Bijeljina) before being taken by helicopter to the Batajnica neighborhood of Belgrade in Serbia. He was also later tortured in a prison in Sremska Mitrovica. ==Illness and death== Tihi\u0107 had a tumor on his colon removed in January 2008 in Ljubljana, Slovenia.
