    "text": "The Audi R8 (Type 42) is the first generation of the R8 sports car developed and manufactured by German automobile manufacturer Audi. Conceived in 2003 in concept form, the R8 was put into production in June 2006. The Type 42 is based on the Lamborghini Gallardo and shares its chassis and engine. Audi's parent company Volkswagen Group owns Lamborghini as well and components of both of the cars were shared mainly to save development costs. Production of the Type 42 ended in August 2015, following the introduction of the Type 4S at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show which was based on an entirely new platform. == Conception and development == alt= The Audi R8 was first conceived as the Audi LeMans Quattro concept car which was presented to the public at the 2003 Frankfurt Motor Show, followed by the 2003 Geneva Motor Show. Designed by Frank Lamberty, the car featured many unique features such as a Jet Blue exterior colour, the front curve of the front wings shared with the TT along with Nuvolari quattro GT, 20-inch wheels, a twin-turbocharged FSI V10 engine with a rated power output of and , a single-frame radiator grille, aluminium sports suspension with magnetic ride shock absorbers and dark interior colours. The body of the car was made of aluminium and carbon fibre in order to keep the weight low. Another unique feature of the car were its full LED headlamps. The R8 development program began in 2004 with Frank Lamberty's design being approved and frozen for production. In 2005, Audi announced that the name of the successful Audi R8 race car would be used for a new road car in 2007. Production body prototypes began field testing in January 2006 and the car was introduced to the public at the 2006 Paris Motor Show. == Road models == ===R8 Coup\u00e9 4.2 FSI quattro (2006\u20132012)=== left The Audi R8 was initially equipped with a V8 engine. Specifically, it is an all-aluminium alloy 32-valve (four valves per cylinder) petrol engine, utilising Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI), and has a displacement of . It develops a motive power output of (Directive 80/1269/EEC), and generates of torque, on 98 RON 'Super Unleaded' petrol. It is basically the same engine used in the B7 RS4, but is modified to use a dry sump lubrication system. It uses two chain-driven double overhead camshafts (DOHC) per cylinder bank, and utilises variable valve timing for both inlet and exhaust camshafts. The 4 wheel drive system is biased towards the rear; it sends 30% of its power to the front wheels and 70% to the rear. ===R8 Coup\u00e9 5.2 FSI quattro (2009\u20132012)=== left Audi AG unveiled the Audi R8 V10 on December 8, 2008. It uses a FSI V10 engine, based on the unit in the Lamborghini Gallardo LP560-4 (which in turn was based on the 5.2 FSI V10 as used in the C6 S6 and D3 S8), but is re-tuned to have a power output of , and of torque. Compared to the V8 variant, the R8 V10's performance numbers are enhanced. Audi states the new acceleration time as 3.9 seconds, in 8.1 seconds, and a top speed of . Other changes to the V10 version of the R8 include some aesthetic differences: such as all-LED headlights (a world-first), \"V10\" badging on the front fenders, interior enhancements such as Bang & Olufsen 465 watt sound system, a more aggressive body styling, larger rear brakes, a dual outlet exhaust system and different wheels. ===R8 Spyder 5.2 FSI quattro (2010\u20132012)=== alt= Although it was rumoured by the automotive press since the announcement of the production variant of the R8 in 2006, it was only in August 2008 that spy shots of a convertible R8 \"Spyder\" from filming scenes of the movie Iron Man 2 were published online. The photos showed a clearly visible soft-top roof and the absence of the distinctive \"sideblades\" found on the V10 FSI coup\u00e9. The R8 Spyder was formally unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show. Compared with the coup\u00e9 model, the convertible had extra chassis support, a pair of roll-over safety bars, as well as minor changes such as the location of the fuel filler cap. It was powered by the same uneven firing 5.2-litre V10 engine as the coup\u00e9. ===R8 Spyder 4.2 FSI quattro (2011\u20132012)=== 200x200px On April 11, 2011 automotive magazine Autocar reported that Audi has made the 4.2-litre FSI V8 engine available on the R8 Spyder, alongside the 5.2-litre V10 engine initially fitted.. The (an increase of 14 PS as compared to the coup\u00e9), unit now completed the R8 Spyder range alongside the V10 Spyder offered. The V8 Spyder has a 0\u2013100 km/h (0\u201362 mph) acceleration time of 4.3 seconds and could attain a top speed of 300 km/h (186 mph). Like the V10 model, the V8 Spyder features an aluminium spaceframe with carbon composite construction and an automatic retractable folding cloth roof. ===R8 GT (2011\u20132013)=== Audi R8 GT at the 2010 Paris Motor Show Introduced at the 2010 W\u00f6rthersee Tour, the Audi R8 GT is a high-performance variant of the R8 V10. The GT utilises a V10 with the quattro four-wheel drive system. Changes from the R8 5.2 FSI quattro include reduction in the curb weight by to and increased engine power to at 8,000 rpm ( per ton) and at 6,500 rpm of torque. Because of these changes, the R8 GT has an increased top speed of and accelerates from 0\u2013 in 3.6 seconds, 0.3 faster than the R8 V10. The car also features some visual changes including red brake calipers, a fixed rear wing, front bumper mounted winglets and GT badging in place of the standard V10 badging. The car was introduced for the 2012 model year and with a limited production of 333 cars worldwide with 35 destined for the UK market and 90 for the US market. ===R8 GT Spyder=== left Unveiled at the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans, the R8 GT Spyder is the convertible version of the R8 GT. Limited to 333 units worldwide, the R8 GT Spyder combines the aggressiveness of the R8 GT with an open top driving experience. Aside from the roof, the only performance related change is the change in weight which has increased to (dry weight). The engine frame is made of ultra-light magnesium; the soft top cover and the large side panels at the rear are made of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP). CFRP is also used for the modified front spoiler, the fixed rear spoiler and the new rear bumper; even the seats used are made of carbon fibre which result in a weight saving of alone. Together, these components provide a weight saving of over the standard V10 Spyder. Visual changes include add-on parts in contrasting titanium gray, a front splitter with a dual lip, flics at the sides of the front bumper, red GT badges, round exhaust tailpipes, an enlarged rear diffuser and tinted LED tail lights in a clear-glass design. A CFRP windshield frame is also available as an option. US model went on sale as a 2012 Model Year car, with delivery beginning in February 2012. Only 50 units were sold in the US. == Race models == ===R8 LMS (2009\u20132012)=== Two Audi R8 LMS' competing in the FIA GT3 European Championship For 2009, Audi announced the production of an R8 LMS racing car, designed for the GT3 rules in the FIA GT3 European Championship and various national racing series. Known within Audi Sport as the 'R16', the R8 LMS features a V10 engine. Because the GT3 regulations prohibit the use of four- wheel drive, Audi had to drop its 'trademark' quattro four-wheel drive system, and the R8 LMS was thus only available with the typical rear-wheel drive setup. The torque is transmitted via a newly developed six-speed sequential race oriented gearbox. The car was jointly manufactured by Audi Sport, quattro GmbH, and Audi Hungaria Motor Kft. (Gy\u0151r). The first test races in various European racing series was scheduled for the 2009 season. Delivery to the customers was planned from the Autumn of 2010. ===R8 LMS Evolution (2010)=== Changes to the 2010 R8 LMS include the improvement of the engine cooling system capacity, suspension revisions, a race-optimised electronics and exhaust systems, and a 6-speed transmission that can be inspected through an opening in the housing without the need to dismantle the entire assembly. Previous variants could be upgraded via an update kit. The first deliveries of the car were made to the American-owned United Autosports team from Yorkshire in England. ===R8 LMS ultra (2012\u20132015)=== The R8 LMS ultra Unveiled at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show, the R8 LMS ultra is a modified version of the Audi R8 LMS with CFRP (carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic) doors with high-energy absorbing new crash foams, new PS1 safety seat developed by Audi, updated transmission providing additional reserves on long-distance runs, increased engine power to (depending on restrictor regulations) with higher torque at lower engine speeds, a larger engine oil cooler and transmission fluid cooler, relocated steering hydraulics oil cooler to the vehicle's midsection, enlarged air vents, improved air flow to radiator and interior, front 18-inch wheels with Michelin 30-65/18 tyres, optimized brake cooling at the front wheels, uniball joints transverse control arm mounts, weight-reduced compression and rebound-adjustable gas dampers from Bilstein, wider front hood with louvers, new wider rear wing with larger end plates, new front plate with optimised diffusion under the front end. ===R8 Grand-Am (2012\u20132013)=== As part of NASCAR's embracing of GT3 in their Grand American Road Racing Association Rolex Series races, GT3 cars were permitted to run with slight restrictions in the \"national\" GT3 in the United States. The R8 Grand-Am features an engine with its power reduced from to via an air restrictor and the engine electronics, a reduced fuel tank capacity of 83.3 litres, three-part rims for wheels and suspension, and deactivated anti-lock system and traction control (as NASCAR/Grand-Am does not permit either traction control nor anti-lock brakes). Additional changes include loss of aerodynamic grip via smaller front splitter and rear diffuser, stiffer roll cages, an Earnhardt bar (anti- intrusion bars on the windscreen), and side window nets on both sides, both of which are required in the Rolex Series. As per the rules, NASCAR specified Continental tyres are used. Compared to the Audi R8 LMS ultra, the R8 Grand AM has lower down force. This model made its debut at the 50th Daytona 24 Hours in January 2012. == Special models == ===Audi R8 V12 TDI concept (2008)=== Audi R8 TDI Le Mans The R8 V12 TDI (later renamed the R8 TDI Le Mans) is a concept car based on the R8 V8 coup\u00e9 with a twin-turbocharged V12 Diesel engine rated at and of torque at 1,750\u20133,000 rpm with Euro 6 emissions standard compliance via oxidizing catalyst and Diesel particulate filter, matt Grace Silver and brilliant red metallic body colours, 6-speed manual transmission with small-diameter double-plate clutch and quattro permanent all-wheel drive system with a ratio of 40:60 front and rear. The car also had many unique body features such as rhombus-pattern cover on the air inlets and outlets, continuous aluminum lip spoiler, glass roof with two large transparent sections, glazed engine compartment behind the seats, NACA duct in the middle of the roof for cooling of the bigger V12 engine, optional carbon fibre lining of the engine compartment, LED headlights with color temperature of 6,000 kelvin, three-spoke flat bottom diecast magnesium core sports steering wheel upholstered in Valcona leather, aluminum application on the center console, 24-piston (total) brake calipers (red six-piston monobloc aluminum front calipers, fixed six-piston rear calipers) and ventilated carbon fibre reinforced silicon carbide ceramic brake discs. The R8 TDI LeMans was unveiled first at the Detroit Auto Show in 2008 and then at the 2008 Geneva Motor Show. The development of the R8 TDI was cancelled, Audi cited the reason that the cost of re-engineering of the petrol R8 to accommodate the bigger twin-turbocharged diesel engine was simply too great, and that it would be unable to recoup its investment through sales alone. ===R8 e-tron=== ====R8 e-tron concept (2009)==== Audi e-tron concept car was unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show.|alt= The all-electric Audi e-tron concept car was unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show, followed by the 2009 LA Auto Show (in orange body colour), and at the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans. The Audi e-tron is a version of the R8 Coup\u00e9 with a slightly smaller body utilising four electric motors rated at and of torque. However the proposed torque rating is the torque measured at the wheels, not at the output shaft \u2014 as is the industry standard, the true torque rating is at around . Other features included a 42.4 kWh liquid cooled lithium-ion battery pack, a need-based energy management system, LED technology used for all lighting units, independent cooling system for each axle; doors, covers, sidewalls and roof made from carbon fibre-reinforced plastic; 3-mode flush gear selector (forward, reverse and neutral), instrument cluster with fold-out central display with integrated Audi MMI functions, climate control unit located to the right above the steering wheel, racing-inspired lightweight bucket seats, snow white and cognac interior colours, heat pump, climate control system; triangular double wishbones at the front axle and trapezoidal wishbones made of forged aluminum components at the rear axle, direct rack-and-pinion steering with speed-sensitive electromechanical steering boost, 235/35R19 front and 295/30R19 rear tires with a new blade design and the prototype version of an information processing system (car-to-x communication). Claimed performance figures for the R8 e-tron is a acceleration time of 4.8 seconds and a limited top speed of . The car has a limited all-electric range of . A full charge at 230 volts takes six to eight hours, while a 400-volt quick charger would reduce the charge time to about two and a half hours. Braking is accomplished and energy is recaptured through the electric motors\u2019 regenerative function, unless the car detects more aggressive deceleration is required, at that point a conventional electromechanical system featuring carbon-ceramic discs starts functioning to assist. The battery pack and its necessary inverter and power accoutrements weigh about , or nearly a third of the E-Tron's approximately curb weight achieved by the excessive use of carbon fibre, magnesium and aluminium. The car has a weight distribution of 42% at the front and 58% at the rear. ====R8 e-tron prototype (2011)==== 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show|alt= Audi originally announced the first e-tron model to be built by quattro GmbH at Neckarsulm, with a small production run beginning in late 2012. Keeping that announcement in place, Audi unveiled the R8 e-tron prototype at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show. Features included two permanent magnet synchronous motors at the rear axle rated and of total torque, a torque vectoring system, electric single-wheel anti-slip regulation, Multimaterial space Frame chassis with increased use of carbon-fibre- reinforced plastic, springs made from fiberglass-reinforced plastic, wheel hubs made of forged titanium, anti-roll bar boasts made from hybrid aluminum and carbon fibre, 19-inch wheels with friction-optimized 225-35 series tires, 48.6 kWh lithium-ion battery beneath the passenger cabin as structural element, Crescendo Red Metallic body colour, fine chrome horizontal struts on the grille, e-tron-specific LED headlamp design, diffuser at the rear, 7-inch Multi Media Interface display, 6.7-inch AMOLED (Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode) optic rear-view mirror system, leather and Alcantara upholstery, e-sound artificial engine noise emitting from a speaker system mounted in the underbody that is audible outside the car at speeds under . The prototype was based on the standard R8 and followed closely the original concept, with a shape reminiscent of existing V8 and V10 petrol-powered versions. Audi claimed the production version of the R8 e-tron was capable of a 0\u2013100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration time of around 4.8 seconds, making it only 0.2 seconds slower than the R8 V8. Top speed was to be limited to to protect the charge of the battery making the performance figures true to the concept. It was planned to be put into production in early 2012. Along with the R8 e-tron, Audi also considered a small-scale production of a smaller and lighter zero-emission sports car based on the second e-tron concept displayed at the 2010 Detroit Motor Show. ====Development==== Frankfurt Motor show In 2010, Audi began a development program with the objective to manufacture the R8 e-tron in limited numbers. On June 26, 2012, one of the earliest R8 e-tron prototypes set a new electric car lap record at the N\u00fcrburgring racetrack with a time of 8:09.099. In May 2013, after developing 10 prototypes for research and development purposes, Audi decided to put the production of the electric car on hold due to its limited all-electric range as battery technology did not advance as fast as Audi had initially expected, making the R8 e-tron unviable for series production. In March 2014, Audi revised its decision and announced it will build the R8 e-tron upon customer request. The company explained that their latest development work resulted in an increased range from to approximately . The limited production R8 e-tron was based on the second generation of the R8 platform shared with the Lamborghini Hurac\u00e1n. ===R8 NF=== The \"NF\" (i.e. \"Nachfolger\" or simply \"successor\") prototype is a light weight variant of the R8 with excessive use of the lightweight carbon fibre-reinforced polymer.
