    "text": "Adalatherium (meaning \"crazy beast\") is an extinct gondwanatherian that lived on Madagascar during the Cretaceous period, during the Maastrichtian. The discovery of the first nearly-complete Adalatherium skeleton from the Maevarano Formation was announced in April 2020. Adalatherium hui was unusually large for a mammal given the geologic era, at 60 cm (2 ft) long. Its skeleton is the most complete of any Southern Hemisphere Mesozoic mammal. Additionally, the front of the skull contains more foramina than any known mammal. == References == Category:Gondwanatheres Category:Late Cretaceous mammals Category:Maastrichtian life Category:Cretaceous Madagascar Category:Fossils of Madagascar Category:Maevarano Formation Category:Maevarano fauna Category:Fossil taxa described in 2020 Category:Taxa named by David W.
