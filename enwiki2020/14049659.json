Several team names and spellings were altered during the 1990s when traditional Indian names were introduced to replace those that were associated with the British Raj. Most notably, Bombay became Mumbai and the famous venue of Madras became Chennai. ==Domestic cricket== ===Ranji Trophy winners=== * 1985\u201386 - Delhi * 1986\u201387 - Hyderabad * 1987\u201388 - Tamil Nadu * 1988\u201389 - Delhi * 1989\u201390 - Bengal * 1990\u201391 - Haryana * 1991\u201392 - Delhi * 1992\u201393 - Punjab * 1993\u201394 - Bombay * 1994\u201395 - Bombay * 1995\u201396 - Karnataka * 1996\u201397 - Mumbai * 1997\u201398 - Karnataka * 1998\u201399 - Karnataka * 1999\u201300 - Mumbai ===Duleep Trophy winners=== * 1985\u201386 - West Zone * 1986\u201387 - South Zone * 1987\u201388 - North Zone * 1988\u201389 - North Zone & West Zone (shared) * 1989\u201390 - South Zone * 1990\u201391 - North Zone * 1991\u201392 - North Zone * 1992\u201393 - North Zone * 1993\u201394 - North Zone * 1994\u201395 - North Zone * 1995\u201396 - South Zone * 1996\u201397 - Central Zone * 1997\u201398 - Central Zone & West Zone (shared) * 1998\u201399 - Central Zone * 1999\u201300 - North Zone ==International tours of India== ===1986\u201387 Australia=== * 1st Test at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chepauk, Madras - tied match * 2nd Test at Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi - match drawn * 3rd Test at Wankhede Stadium, Bombay - match drawn ===1986\u201387 Sri Lanka=== * 1st Test at Modi Stadium, Kanpur - match drawn * 2nd Test at Vidarbha Cricket Association Ground, Nagpur - India won by an innings and 106 runs * 3rd Test at Barabati Stadium, Cuttack - India won by an innings and 67 runs ===1986\u201387 Pakistan=== * 1st Test at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chepauk, Madras - match drawn * 2nd Test at Eden Gardens, Calcutta - match drawn * 3rd Test at Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Jaipur - match drawn * 4th Test at Sardar Patel Stadium, Motera, Ahmedabad - match drawn * 5th Test at M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore - Pakistan won by 16 runs For details of this tour, see : Pakistani cricket team in India in 1986\u201387 ===1987\u201388 West Indies=== * 1st Test at Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi - West Indies won by 5 wickets * 2nd Test at Wankhede Stadium, Bombay - match drawn * 3rd Test at Eden Gardens, Calcutta - match drawn * 4th Test at MA Chidambaram Stadium, Chepauk, Madras - India won by 255 runs ===1988\u201389 New Zealand=== * 1st Test at M Chinnaswamy Stadium, Bangalore - India won by 172 runs * 2nd Test at Wankhede Stadium, Bombay - New Zealand won by 136 runs * 3rd Test at Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium, Hyderabad - India won by 10 wickets ===1990\u201391 Sri Lanka=== * 1st Test at Sector 16 Stadium, Chandigarh - India won by an innings and 8 runs ===1991\u201392 South Africa=== This tour marked South Africa's return to official international cricket.
