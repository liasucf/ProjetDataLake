The crusade was sent to Bohemia after negotiations, held in Pressburg and Cheb, between Hussites and the emperor Sigismund had failed. == Outcome == Catholic crusaders, probably Battle of Doma\u017elice, illustration from the Jena codex (15th century) Hussites persecuting the German soldiers after the Battle of Doma\u017elice, romantic painting The Imperial army was besieging the city of Doma\u017elice since 8 August, when the sight of the approaching and singing Hussite relief army led by Prokop the Bald and hearing their battle hymn \"Kto\u017e js\u00fa bo\u017e\u00ed bojovn\u00edci\" (\"Ye Who are Warriors of God\"), led to mass panicking among the crusaders, who fled through the Bohemian Forest. The Hussites immediately set after the fleeing Imperial army and annihilated its remnants completely. Reportedly, 8,000 wagons and all the equipment of the crusaders were captured. The crusader army was accompanied by papal legate Julian Cesarini who escaped, but lost his whole luggage in the retreat, including the secret correspondence and the Papal bull charging him to hire crusaders.John William Mears. \"Heroes of Bohemia: Huss, Jerome and Zisca.\" (1879) == Sources == * Ich Wolkenstein, by Dieter K\u00fchn; Insel Verlag Frankfurt am Main, 1977 ==External links== * Bellum.cz \u2013 Battle of Doma\u017elice 14 August 1431 *The National Monument Doma\u017elice on Czech Wikipedia Category:1431 in Europe Domazlice 1431 Domazlice 1431 Category:Conflicts in 1431 Doma\u017elice Category:Prokop the Great ",
