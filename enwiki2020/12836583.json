    "text": "The 57th Air Division is an inactive United States Air Force unit. Its last assignment was with the Fifteenth Air Force, based at Minot Air Force Base, North Dakota. It was inactivated on 24 June 1991. ==History== \"Established as the 8th Pursuit Wing, it conducted training from 1940 to 1941. As a paper unit, it moved to India and then to Egypt in December 1942.\" It finally gained personnel and aircraft, and became operational as the 57 Bombardment Wing in March 1944. \"Initially, the 57th flew close air support missions against enemy troops and gun emplacements in the vicinity of Anzio, Italy; later, it flew bombing missions against railway marshalling yards at Foligno, Littoria, and Terni, Italy. Between 19 March 1944 and 11 May 1944 the 57th took part in Operation Strangle to destroy Italian marshalling yards, railroad repair facilities and other rail targets such as bridges, tunnels, and viaducts. It continued to fly close air support and interdiction missions in Italy throughout the war, and supported the invasion of southern France on 15 August 1944.\" The unit was inactivated at the end of the war. Reactivated as an intermediate command echelon of Strategic Air Command in 1951, the 57th Air Division assumed a supervisory role of subordinate bombardment units. \"Its units trained to conduct long range bombardment, air refueling, and strategic reconnaissance operations around the world. Between 1965 and 1969, division units supported Operation Arc Light bombing and Operation Young Tiger air refueling operations in Southeast Asia. In 1980 the 57th reorganized to employ Strategic Air Command conventional strategic forces (bomber, tanker, and reconnaissance) in crisis situations worldwide.\" It was inactivated in June 1991 due to budget constraints and the reduction of forces after the end of the Cold War. ==Lineage== * Established as the 8th Pursuit Wing on 19 October 1940 : Activated on 6 November 1940 : Inactivated on 1 November 1941 * Redesignated 8th Fighter Wing on 6 July 1942 : Activated on 24 July 1942 : Redesignated 57th Bombardment Wing on 6 April 1943 : Inactivated on 12 September 1945 * Redesignated 57th Air Division on 10 April 1951 : Organized on 16 April 1951 : Discontinued on 16 June 1952 : Inactivated on 16 June 1952 * Activated on 16 June 1952 : Inactivated on 2 July 1969 * Activated on 22 January 1975 : Inactivated on 14 June 1991 ===Assignments=== * General Headquarters Air Force, 6 November 1940 * Southeast Air District (later Third Air Force), 16 January 1941 * Interceptor Command (of Third Air Force), 21 April 1941 * III Interceptor Command, c. 1 July \u2013 1 November 1941 * IX Fighter Command, 24 July 1942 : Attached to III Fighter Command, 26 July \u2013 c. 28 October 1942 * Ninth Air Force, 22 December 1942 : Attached to IX Fighter Command, 22 December 1942 unknown 1943 * Twelfth Air Force, c. 23 August 1943 * XII Air Support Command, 31 August 1943 * XII Bomber Command, 1 January 1944 * Twelfth Air Force, 1 March 1944 * Army Air Forces Service Command, Mediterranean Theater of Operations, 15 August \u2013 12 September 1945 * Fifteenth Air Force, 16 April 1951 16 June 1952 * Fifteenth Air Force, 16 June 1952 * Eighth Air Force, 4 September 1956 2 July 1969 * Fifteenth Air Force, 22 January 1975 14 June 1991 ===Components=== ====Wings==== ;
