    "text": "Medh\u0101tithi is one of the oldest and most famous commentators on the , more commonly known as the Laws of Manu. The text is a part of the Hindu Dharma\u015b\u0101stra tradition, which attempts to record the laws of dharma. ==Location== There is some debate over the exact location in which Medh\u0101tithi composed his commentary, but there is significant evidence which places him in Kashmir. Julius Jolly argues that he was an inhabitant of Southern India, while Georg B\u00fchler argues (and P. V. Kane tends to agree) that he was a Kashmirian, or at least an inhabitant of Northern India.Kane, P. V., History of Dharma\u015b\u0101stra, (Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1975), Volume I, Part II, 575. Robert Lingat does not acknowledge a debate about Medh\u0101tithi's origin, stating explicitly \"one knows nothing about him save that he lived in Kashmir.\"Lingat, Robert, The Classical Law of India, (New York: Oxford UP, 1973), 112. Clearly, the exact origin is unknown and may never be known, but there seems to be a tendency to place him at least in the northern part of India, if not in Kashmir or in Nepal, if not in from India. ==Dating and historical context== As with most ancient texts, the exact date that Medh\u0101tithi's commentary was written is unknown. Kane argues that, because Medh\u0101tithi names several other commentators that are dated earlier than he is, and because the author of the Mit\u0101k\u1e63ar\u0101 (a commentary on the Yajnavalkya Smriti) considers him as authoritative, he has to be writing later than 820 CE and before 1050 CE.Kane, P. V., History of Dharma\u015b\u0101stra, (Poona: Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1975), Volume I, Part II, 583. Lingat places him in the ninth century or in the early tenth century at the latest.Lingat, Robert, The Classical Law of India, (New York: Oxford University Press, 1973), 112. David Brick, in his 2010 review of historical literature on widow burning, places him about 1000 CE.Brick, David (April\u2013June 2010). \"The Dharmasastric Debate on Widow Burning\".
