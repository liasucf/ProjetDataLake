    "text": "Cryptic Collection 3 (abbreviated as CC3) is the third compilation album of Cryptic Collection series by American hip hop duo Twiztid. It was released on May 18, 2004 through Psychopathic Records and consists of nine previously unreleased tracks and five remixes, including a \"surprisingly faithful\" cover of the Steve Miller Band's \"The Joker\". AllMusic's reviewer Johnny Loftus wrote \"The song is likely a coded reference to those obsessed-over joker cards. But it's nice to think of Twiztid as regular-guy Michiganders, singing karaoke at the local sports bar\". Production was handled primarily by Fritz the Cat, except a couple of tracks produced by Amare Yaodaming. The project features guest appearances of Dark Lotus members. The album peaked at #85 on the Billboard 200 and at #2 on the Independent Albums in the United States. == Track listing == ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" ! scope=\"col\" |Chart (2004) ! scope=\"col\" |Peak position |- |- |} == References == ==External links== * Category:Sequel albums Category:2004 compilation albums Category:B-side compilation albums Category:Twiztid compilation albums Category:Psychopathic Records compilation albums ",
