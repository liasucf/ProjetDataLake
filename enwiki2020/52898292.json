After military defeat, Emperor Napoleon abdicates and is in exile on the island of Elba. As requested by the dying Captain, his assistant Edmond Dant\u00e8s approaches the island and takes with him a certain letter which he has to deliver in Paris. Dant\u00e8s is very young but his life is already full of happiness. The shipowner appoints Edmond as captain and in Marseille, the beautiful bride Mercedes waits for Dant\u00e8s. But the deep-seated jealousy of Edmond's enemies destroys everything... On the advice of Danglar, a close friend of Dant\u00e8s, the fisherman Fernand who is passionately in love with Mercedes writes a denunciation to the prosecutor of Marseilles and by the order of assistant prosecutor de Villefort hapless Dant\u00e8s becomes imprisoned in the most horrible dungeon Ch\u00e2teau d'If. Dant\u00e8s, not understanding what has happened, almost goes mad in the gloomy prison but by chance he meets Abb\u00e9 Faria, a wise and resilient old man. Abb\u00e9 tries to dig a hole to freedom in his cell but instead ends up in Edmond's cell. Faria decides to share with Dant\u00e8s all of his knowledge and experience, as well as the countless treasures that are hidden on the island of Monte Cristo. Years pass and Edmond Dant\u00e8s is reborn, becoming the most intelligent and educated person. Taking advantage of the death of Abb\u00e9 Faria, Edmond manages to escape from the Ch\u00e2teau d'If. Dant\u00e8s finds the treasure, \"buries\" his name forever and becomes the Count of Monte Cristo. Over the period of many years that Dant\u00e8s spent in prison the lives of his enemies have changed radically. Petty officer Danglar has become the Baron, one of the richest bankers in France. De Villefort was appointed as king's attorney, and the simple fisherman Fernand has become a Count, General, Lord of France and - the most important for him - Mercedes's husband. Power and money - all this is now in the hands of scoundrels making them almost invulnerable, but the Count of Monte Cristo is full of lust for revenge. He begins to investigate thoroughly the lives of his enemies, and soon discovers the terrible and bloody secrets they contain. And if Monte Cristo publicly reveals these mysteries he can severely punish his enemies... ==Cast== * Viktor Avilov \u2013 mature Edmond Dant\u00e8s / Count of Monte Cristo * Evgeniy Dvorzhetskiy \u2013 young Edmond Dant\u00e8s / Count Albert de Morcerf, son of Fernand and Mercedes (voice by Viktor Avilov) * Alexei Petrenko \u2013 Abb\u00e9 Faria * Anna Samokhina \u2013 Mercedes, Edmond Dant\u00e8s former bride and Fernand Mondego's wife * Mikhail Boyarsky \u2013 Fernand Mondego, Count de Morcerf * Nadira Mirzayeva \u2013 Haidee, Ali Pasha's daughter, the beloved of Count of Monte Cristo / Vasilika, Ali Pasha's wife * Aleksei Zharkov \u2013 Danglar, baron and banker * Svetlana Smirnova \u2013 Hermine Danglar, banker Danglar's wife * Yana Poplavskaya \u2013 Eugenie Danglar, banker Danglar's daughter * Igor Sklyar \u2013 Benedetto, robber, Bertuccio's adopted son * Arnis Licitis \u2013 De Villefort, king's attorney (voice by Aleksey Inzhevatov) * Valentina Voilkova \u2013 Heloise de Villefort, attorney De Villefort's wife * Ulle Sinisalu \u2013 Valentina de Villefort, attorney De Villefort's daughter * Vsevolod Shilovsky \u2013 Gaspard Caderousse, innkeeper, former friend of Edmond Dant\u00e8s * Natalia Pozdnyakova \u2013 Karkonta, Caderousse's wife * Igor Bogoduh \u2013 Pierre Morel, shipowner from Marseille * Peteris Gaudins \u2013 Maximilian Morrel, Pierre Morel's son (voice by Andrey Gradov) * Nadezhda Reason \u2013 Julie Morel, Pierre Morrel's daughter * Sergey Shentalinsky \u2013 Franz d'Epinay, Albert de Morcerf's friend * Nikolai Kochegarov \u2013 Beauchamp, Albert de Morcerf's friend * Oleg Shklovsky \u2013 Debray * Vyacheslav Tsoy \u2013 Lee, Count of Monte Cristo's faithful servant and bodyguard * Yuriy Dubrovin \u2013 Baptiste, Count of Monte Cristo's servant * Georgi Yungvald-Khilkevich \u2013 Artanyak, Count of Monte Cristo's assistant * Vladimir Steklov \u2013 Bertuccio, Count of Monte Cristo's servant * Yevgeni Platokhin \u2013 Luigi Vampa, the leader of the robbers *Alexander Slastin \u2013 Police Commissioner * Gia Lezhava \u2013 Berthier, the commandant of the Ch\u00e2teau d'If (voice by Alexey Buldakov) * Vladimir Portnov \u2013 jeweler ==Filming== * The author and performer of seven songs in the movie is Alexander Gradsky.
