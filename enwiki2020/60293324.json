    "text": "The Agrio Formation is an Early Cretaceous geologic formation that is up to thick and is located in the southern Mendoza Province and northern-central Neuqu\u00e9n Province, in the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin of northwestern Patagonia, Argentina. This formation is the youngest one of the Mendoza Group, overlying the Mulichinco and Bajada Colorada Formations and overlain by the Huitr\u00edn and La Amarga Formations. It is dated to the Late Valanginian to Early Hauterivian,Voglino, 2017, p.39 Late Valanginian to Early Barremian,Voglino, 2017, p.49 or Hauterivian to earliest Aptian.G\u00f3mez Dacal et al., 2018, p.113 The Agrio Formation is considered the third most important source rock in the hydrocarbon-rich Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, after the Vaca Muerta Formation and Los Molles Formation. Similarly to these older units, it is potentially a source of shale gas. This formation has provided fossils of ichthyosaurs, ammonites, gastropods, bivalves, decapods, echinoderm, corals and fish. The newly described species of fish, Tranawuen agrioensis, the ammonite Holcoptychites agrioensis, and the bivalve Pholadomya agrioensis have been named after the formation. == Description == Agrio Formation in Aguada de la Mula The Agrio Formation was first described by Weaver in 1931 and its three members, from bottom to top: Pilmatu\u00e9, Avil\u00e9 and Agua de la Mula Members, were defined by Leanza and Hugo in 2001. The formation crops out in an approximately wide band from north to south along 70\u00b0 longitude west, from 37\u00b0 to 39\u00b0 south in the northern-central part of the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin.Voglino, 2017, p.50 The southern termination of the formation is the Huincul High, formed by the Huincul Fault. Towards the east in the basin, the formation grades into the Centenario Formation. === Stratigraphy === Outcrop extent of the Agrio Formation The Agrio Formation is included in the Mendoza Group, representing its youngest formation. In the east of the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, the formation rests upon continental clastic deposits of the Mulichinco Formation, with the contact between the two formations characterized by a regional transgressive surface. Towards the west, the formation unconformably overlies the Bajada Colorada Formation.Olivo et al., 2016, p.218Gallina et al., 2014, p.2 In its eastern part, the Agrio Formation is overlain by the clastic, carbonaceous and evaporitic deposits of the Huitr\u00edn Formation and in the western area by the La Amarga Formation. The total thickness of the Agrio Formation reaches up to , with the Pilmatu\u00e9 Member having a thickness of and the Agua de la Mula Member reaching .Voglino, 2017, p.51 === Lithologies === Agrio Formation close to Pilmatu\u00e9 The Agrio Formation is primarily composed of pelitic rocks with intercalations of limestones, sandstones and rare fine conglomerates. The Pilmatu\u00e9 and Agua de la Mula Members are characterized by thick successions of black shales with intercalating limestones and sandstones. The Avil\u00e9 Member comprises sandstones and claystones with conglomerates. === Depositional environment === The Agrio Formation was deposited in a post-rift setting of the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, probably representing a tectonic regime of thermal subsidence. The sediments of the lower and upper members of the formation are marine in character, interpreted as the combination of thermal subsidence and a eustatic sea level rise. The middle Avil\u00e9 member was deposited in a fluvial environment. Within the marine Pilmatu\u00e9 Member, a succession of approximately thick, described as \"San Eduardo Beds\", is recognized as deposited in a wave- dominated deltaic setting with hyperdense currents. This sequence is overlain by about thick limestones deposites in a reefal environment. The presence of the newly described gastropod Eunerinea mendozana led researchers to estimate tropical conditions for the Agrio Formation.Cataldo, 2012 == Fossil content == The formation has provided many fossils of ammonites,Aguirre Urreta, 1998 gastropods, bivalves, corals, decapods, echinoids and crinoids.Kauffman & Leanza, 2004Agrio Formation at Fossilworks.org In 2018, ichthyosaur remains not determined to the genus level were described from the Agrio Formation, suggesting the possibility of viviparity of these marine reptiles in the epireic sea of the Neuqu\u00e9n Basin. The finds were notable as well because of a relative lack of abundance of ichthyosaur fossils from the Valanginian to Hauterivian worldwide.Lazo et al., 2018 Fossil fish of Gyrodus huiliches, and Tranawuen agrioensis were described from the formation in 2019.Gouiric Cavalli et al., 2019 The decapod Palaeohomarus pacificus,Aguirre Urreta et al., 2012 and ammonites Curacoites rotundus and Sabaudiella riverorum were described from the formation in 2012,Aguirre Urreta & Rawson, 2012 the gastropods Ampullina pichinka and Mesalia? kushea in 2016,Cataldo & Lazo, 2016 and the ammonite Comahueites aequalicostatus in 2018.Aguirre Urreta & Rawson, 2018 Newly described species of fish, Tranawuen agrioensis, ammonite, Holcoptychites agrioensis,Lazo, 2003 and the bivalve Pholadomya agrioensis were named after the formation. The first known brittle stars in the Southern Hemisphere and Cretaceous age have been identified in Agrio Formation.Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2019 However, fossils are not complete enough to define species. == Petroleum geology == The Agrio Formation is considered the third-most important source rock of the hydrocarbon-rich Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, after the older Vaca Muerta and Los Molles Formations.Geologic Map, 2007, p.142 Two levels of organic-rich sediments exist in the formation, related to the marine transgressions of the late Valanginian and the late Hauterivian, in the Pilmatu\u00e9 and Agua de la Mula Members respectively. The marly shales of the Pilmatu\u00e9 Member reach up to thickness in the western Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, while the same facies in the Agua de la Piedra Member is less than thick. The organic properties of the formation are similar to the Vaca Muerta, with a TOC value averaging 2.5%, with some levels up to 5%. The kerogen types are II to II/III.Voglino, 2017, p.39 == Gallery == Fragmento de amonoide (Formaci\u00f3n Agrio, Cret\u00e1cico inferior, cerro Marucho).jpg|Ammonite from the Agrio Formation Bivalvo (Formaci\u00f3n Agrio, Cret\u00e1cico inferior, cerro Santa Elena).jpg|Bivalve from the formation Fos\u00edl de Ptychomya koeneni.jpg|Bivalve (Ptychomya koeneni) == See also == * List of dinosaur-bearing rock formations * Caiu\u00e1 Formation, contemporaneous fossiliferous formation of the Paran\u00e1 Basin * Cerro Barcino Formation, contemporaneous fossiliferous formation of the Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n Asfalto Basin * Zapata and R\u00edo Belgrano Formations, contemporaneous fossiliferous formations of the Magallanes or Austral Basin == References == === Bibliography === ;General * * * * * * * * * * * * ;Paleontology * * * * * * * * * * ;Geologic map * Category:Geologic formations of Argentina Category:Lower Cretaceous Series of South America Category:Cretaceous Argentina Category:Aptian Stage Category:Barremian Stage Category:Hauterivian Stage Category:Valanginian Stage Category:Shale formations Category:Conglomerate formations Category:Sandstone formations Category:Limestone formations Category:Deep marine deposits Category:Shallow marine deposits Category:Deltaic deposits Category:Fluvial deposits Category:Reef deposits Category:Source rock formations Category:Shale gas Formations Category:Geology of Mendoza Province Category:Geology of Neuqu\u00e9n Province Category:Geology of Patagonia ",
