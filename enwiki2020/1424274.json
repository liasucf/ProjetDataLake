    "text": "A league is a unit of length. It was common in Europe and Latin America, but is no longer an official unit in any nation. The word originally meant the distance a person could walk in an hour. Since the Middle Ages, many values have been specified in several countries. == Different definitions == === Ancient Rome === The league was used in Ancient Rome, defined as Roman miles (7 500 Roman feet, modern 2.2 km or 1.4 miles). The origin is the leuga Gallica (also: leuca Callica), the league of Gaul.The Oxford English Dictionary === Argentina === The Argentine league (legua) is or 6 666 varas: 1 vara is .Espasa-Calpe Dictionary, Argentina and Mexico Edition 1945: headword Legua === English-speaking world === On land, the league is most commonly defined as three miles, though the length of a mile could vary from place to place and depending on the era. At sea, a league is . English usage also included many of the other leagues mentioned below (for example, in discussing the Treaty of Tordesillas). === France === The French lieue \u2013 at different times \u2013 existed in several variants: 10 000, 12 000, 13 200 and 14 400 French feet, about . It was used along with the metric system for a while but is now long discontinued. A metric lieue was used in France from 1812 to 1840, with 1 metric lieue being exactly 4 000 m, or 4 km (about 2.5 mi).Fran\u00e7ois Cardarelli: Scientific Unit Conversion (Springer-Verlag London, 1999) It is this unit that is mentioned both in the title and the body text of Jules Verne's novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1870).Jules Verne: Vingt mille lieues sous les mers (1871), Part 2, Chapter VII \"Aussi, notre vitesse fut-elle de vingt-cinq milles \u00e0 l\u2019heure, soit douze lieues de quatre kilom\u00e8tres. Il va sans dire que Ned Land, \u00e0 son grand ennui, dut renoncer \u00e0 ses projets de fuite. Il ne pouvait se servir du canot entra\u00een\u00e9 \u00e0 raison de douze \u00e0 treize m\u00e8tres par seconde. Quitter le Nautilus dans ces conditions, c\u2019e\u00fbt \u00e9t\u00e9 sauter d\u2019un train marchant avec cette rapidit\u00e9, man\u0153uvre imprudente s\u2019il en fut.\" \"Accordingly, our speed was twenty\u2013five miles (that is, twelve four\u2013kilometre leagues) per hour. Needless to say, Ned Land had to give up his escape plans, much to his distress. Swept along at the rate of twelve to thirteen metres per second, he could hardly make use of the skiff. Leaving the Nautilus under these conditions would have been like jumping off a train racing at this speed, a rash move if there ever was one.\" Translated by F. P. Walter === Mexico === Perhaps in some rural parts of Mexico, the league (Spanish legua) is still used in the original sense of the distance that can be covered on foot in an hour, so that a league along a good road on level ground is a greater distance than a league on a difficult path over rough terrain. === Portuguese-speaking world === In Portugal, Brazil and other parts of the former Portuguese Empire, there were several units called league (Portuguese: l\u00e9gua): * L\u00e9gua of 18 to a degree = 6 172.84 metres * L\u00e9gua of 20 to a degree (Maritime l\u00e9gua) = 5 555.56 metres * L\u00e9gua of 25 to a degree = 4 444.44 metres The names of the several l\u00e9guas referred to the number of units that made the length corresponding to an angle degree of a meridian arc. As a transitory measure, after Portugal adopted the metric system, the metric l\u00e9gua, of 5.0 km, was used. In Brazil, the l\u00e9gua is still used occasionally, where it has been described as about 6.6 km. === Spain === 9 leguas a \u00c1vila in geographical league The legua or Spanish league was originally understood as equivalent to (Spanish miles).Spence, Spence's Guide to Shipwreck Research, Narwhal Press (Charleston), 1997. This varied depending on local standards for the pie (Spanish foot) and on the precision of measurement, but was officially equivalent to (2.6 miles) before the legua was abolished by Philip II in 1568. It remains in use in parts of Latin America, where its exact meaning varies. * Legua nautica (nautical league): Between 1400 and 1600 the Spanish nautical league was equal to four Roman miles of 4 842 feet, making it 19 368 feet (5 903 metres or 3.187 6 modern nautical miles). That seems pretty straightforward until one realizes that the accepted number of Spanish nautical leagues to a degree varied between 14 1/6 to 16 2/3 so in actual practice the length of a Spanish nautical league was 25 733 feet (4.235 modern nautical miles) to 21 874 feet (3.600 modern nautical miles) respectively. * Legua de por grado (league of the degree): From the 15th century through the early 17th century, the Spanish league of the degree was based on four Arabic miles. Although most contemporary accounts used an Arabic mile of 6 444 feet (1 964 metres), which gave a Spanish league of the degree of 25 776 feet (7 857 metres or 4.242 modern nautical miles) others defined an Arabic mile as just 6 000 feet making a Spanish league of the degree 24 000 feet (or 7 315 metres, almost exactly 3.950 modern nautical miles).Spence's Guide to Shipwreck Research, by Dr. E. Lee Spence, Narwhal Press, Charleston/Miami, \u00a9 by Edward L. Spence, 1997, p. 32 * Legua geographica or geogr\u00e1fica (geographical league): Starting around 1630 the Spanish geographical league was used as the official nautical measurement and continued so through the 1840s. Its use on Spanish charts did not become mandatory until 1718. It was four millias (miles) in length. From 1630 to 1718 a millia was 5 564 feet (1 696 metres), making a geographical league of four millias equal 22 256 feet (6 784 m or 3.663 modern nautical miles). But from 1718 through the 1830s the millia was defined as the equivalent of just over 5210 feet, giving a shorter geographical league of just over 20 842 feet (6 353 m or 3.430 modern nautical miles). * Legua mar\u00edtima (maritime league): From around 1840 through the early 20th century, a Spanish marine league equaled 18 263.52 feet (5 566.72 metres or 3.005 79 modern nautical miles), i.e. about 35 feet (10 metres) longer than our modern maritime league. In the early Hispanic settlements of New Mexico, Texas, California, and Colorado, a league was also a unit of area, defined as 25 million square varas or about 4 428.4 acres. This usage of league is referenced frequently in the Texas Constitution. So defined, a league of land would encompass a square that is one Spanish league on each side. == Comparison table == A comparison of the different lengths for a \"league\", in different countries and at different times in history, is given in the table below. Miles are also included in this list because of the linkage between the two units. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
