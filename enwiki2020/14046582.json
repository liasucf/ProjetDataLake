    "text": "Saint Paul by Paolo Romano (c. 1460), entrance of the Ponte Sant'Angelo, Rome. Paolo Romano, also known as Paolo Tuccone and as Paolo di Mariano di Tuccio Taccone was an Italian early Renaissance sculptor and goldsmith. Giorgio Vasari in his Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects recounts that Paolo Romano was a modest man whose sculpture was far superior to that of his boastful contemporary Mino del Reame. The Vatican Museums and the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle in Rome are home to sculptures by Paolo Romano. His disciples include Giovanni Cristoforo Romano. == References == * Bessone-Aurelj, A.M., Dizionario degli scultori ed architetti italiani, Genova, Societ\u00e0 anonima editrice D.
