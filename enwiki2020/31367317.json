    "text": "Irakli Dzaria (born 1 December 1988) is a Georgian professional footballer, who plays as a defensive midfielder. ==Club career== ===Kuk\u00ebsi=== On 9 January 2018, Dzaria moved for the first time aboard and joined with Albanian club Kuk\u00ebsi by penning a contract until the end of the season with an option to renew for the next one worth $4,000 per month. He made his debut for the club on 31 January in the first leg of cup's quarter-finals against Tirana. His first Albanian Superliga appearance came four days later in the 1\u20131 draw versus Flamurtari Vlor\u00eb. Dzaria scored his maiden goal for the team on 24 February in form of a winner in the match against La\u00e7i. Later on 13 May, he scored a first-half brace in the eventual 2\u20132 draw versus Luft\u00ebtari Gjirokast\u00ebr which lifted his tally up to 4 goals. He ended the second part of 2017\u201318 season by making 16 league appearances, all of them as starter, collecting 1320 minutes as Kuk\u00ebsi finished runner-up in the championship. In June 2018, Kuk\u00ebsi gained the right to play UEFA Champions League football following the Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb's 10-year ban; the next month, Dzaria was included in manager Peter Pacult squad for the first qualifying round tie versus Malta's Valletta. In the second leg, with Kuk\u00ebsi trailing 0\u20131, Dzaria made himself a protagonist by netting in the 84th minute with a right-footed shot inside the box which gave the team a 1\u20131 draw at National Stadium, Ta' Qali. With the first match ending in a goalless draw, Kuk\u00ebsi progressed to the next round on away goal rule. It was his first Champions League goal, and he described it as the most important goal of his career. ==International career== Dzaria earned his first cap with the Georgian national team against Albania in Viseu on 29 February 2012. ===International goals=== :Scores and results list Georgia's goal tally first. {| class=\"wikitable\" !
