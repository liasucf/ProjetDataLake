The club was founded in 1892 and the members regularly sail on the River Mersey and New Brighton Marine Lake. The club mainly sails dinghys and has a thriving cadet section. The club hosts its annual regatta as part of the Wirral Regattas series where local sailors come to compete on the River Mersey. == History == West Cheshire Sailing Club was founded at New Brighton in 1892 by members of the now defunct Magazine Sailing Club and New Brighton Sailing Club. The headquarters of the club, was located in a building on the New Brighton Pier. Boats were stored on shore at the pier, or on moorings in the Mersey. The club moved to its present location when the pier was demolished in 1961. The brass cannon, now kept in the club was a signal gun from a large steam yacht, White Eagle. She was built in Portsmouth, but spent most of her life in the Irish Sea on the Clyde. From time to time club members would fire this gun at special events. The first Club Dinner held by WCSC was held with the Victoria Rowing Club at the Hotel Victoria, New Brighton, before World War I. Two famous members of the club were Sir Ernest Marples MP, the man who planned the motorways and built the M1, as well as a stint as Postmaster General. He was for many years a member of the committee and Vice President from 1948 to 1958. Lieutenant Commander Ian Fraser RN VC, was also a member of the club committee and captain of the club for three years. He served in submarines during World War II and was awarded the VC for his part in the attack on Japanese warships in Singapore Harbour in 1945. ==External links== * West Cheshire Sailing Club website Category:Sport in the Metropolitan Borough of Wirral Category:Yacht clubs in England Category:1892 establishments in England Category:Wallasey ",
