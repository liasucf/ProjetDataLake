    "text": "The Disregard of Timekeeping is the debut album of British hard rock band Bonham, released in 1989. It was produced by Bob Ezrin, who had previously worked with Alice Cooper, Pink Floyd and Kiss; in addition to his usual production duties, he also co-wrote three of the tracks. The album features Trevor Rabin as a guest, who was the lead guitarist and songwriter with Yes from 1982 to 1994. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic stated the record was \"palatable, but without the famous name it would be hard to distinguish from the army of other Zep imitators\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Daniel MacMaster \u2013 lead and backing vocals, keyboard *Ian Hatton \u2013 lead and rhythm guitars, backing vocals *John Smithson \u2013 bass guitar, keyboards, violin, backing vocals *Jason Bonham \u2013 drums, percussion, backing vocals ===Additional personnel=== * Trevor Rabin \u2013 bass on \"Bringing Me Down\", \"Holding on Forever\" and \"Don't Walk Away\", backing vocals * Duncan Faure \u2013 backing vocals * Jimmy Zavala \u2013 harmonica on \"Bringing Me Down\" * Bill Millay \u2013 keyboard programming, MIDI * Bob Ezrin \u2013 Orchestration ===Production=== *Produced by Bob Ezrin *Engineered by Brian Christian, Bob Ezrin, Stan Katayama *Assistant engineers: Rick Butz, Craig Johnson, Scott Pontius, Mike Tacci *Mixing: Stan Katayama *Mastering: Stephen Marcussen ==Charts== ===Album=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1989) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"left\"|Year !align=\"left\"|Title !align=\"left\"|Chart !align=\"left\"|Position |- |rowspan=\"2\"|1989 |rowspan=\"2\"|\"Wait for You\" |align=\"left\"|Mainstream Rock Tracks |align=\"left\"|9 |- |align=\"left\"|Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"left\"|55 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|1990 |align=\"left\"|\"Guilty\" |rowspan=\"2\"|Mainstream Rock Tracks |align=\"left\"|29 |- |align=\"left\"|\"Bringing Me Down\" |align=\"left\"|47 |} ==References== ==External links== *[ \"The Disregard of Timekeeping\" at allmusic] Category:1989 debut albums Category:Albums produced by Bob Ezrin Category:Epic Records albums Category:Bonham (band) albums ",
