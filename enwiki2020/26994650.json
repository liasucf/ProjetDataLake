Founded in 1991 by James Botte and Farrell McGovern in response to a perception that there were no dedicated public venues that featured primarily Canadian speculative fiction writers, editors, and artists. In addition to the focus on Canadian content, it was also an attempt to bring a focus on the book back to Ottawa science fiction and fantasy events.CAN\u2022CON '95/CANVENTION 15 Winter Programming Session backgrounder, W. Paul Valcour. March 2, 1995. It ran from 1992 through 1997, and again in 2001 before taking a hiatus of several years due to financial constraints; it was then relaunched in 2010. Over the years, CAN\u2022CON has had as guests or attendees the cream of Canadian English and French speculative fiction writers and artists (with the notable exceptions of Spider Robinson, Margaret Atwood, and William Gibson). As such, it became a meeting place for Canadian writers and artists and their fans, and provided a natural venue for the national meetings of various related Canadian organizations. This caught the notice of TOR Books' senior editor David Hartwell, who came to CAN\u2022CON and signed deals with many Canadian science fiction and fantasy writers. Of this he said, \"I did more business at CAN\u2022CON than I did at Worldcon\". This informal access to large numbers of Canadian writers enabled him to spearhead TOR's Canadian publishing initiative.David Hartwell ==Programming== CAN-CON has had some of the most diverse programming SF conventions have ever had, while retaining a focus on Canada, its writing environment, and uniqueness. It has also hosted events such as book launches, Canvention with its Prix Aurora Awards, the Bor\u00e9al Congress, a private label CAN-CON Wine, Virtual Reality gaming, and Co-Hosting the launch with the National Library of Canada of their exhibition \"Visions of Other Worlds\", Hosting Canada Post's Canadian Superhero Stamp Series Unveiling, to name a few of the notable events. The tenth Conference, which took place on September 21\u201323 of 2012, focused on introducing emerging and aspiring writers and artists to agents, editors, publishers and fans. The eleventh Conference, which took place at Minto Suites Hotel on October 4\u20136, 2013, had the theme of \"The Cutting Edge\"; it also hosted Canvention and the 33rd Aurora Awards. The seventeenth and most recent Conference occurred at the Ottawa Sheraton Hotel on October 18-20, 2019. ==History== ===Event history=== *1992 ** - **Venue: Market Square Holiday Inn ** Location: ** Guests: Writers: Guy Gavriel Kay, Donald Kingsbury; Multimedia Artist: Jeff Green; Artists: Meghan Dunn, Jan Scott; Fan: Paul Valcour.
