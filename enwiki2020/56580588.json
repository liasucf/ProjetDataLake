The system can detect incoming warheads such as anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM) with a range of 100m and within a 360-degree horizontal and 20-degree band. Upon detection, two defensive rockets are fired at the incoming threat. The system employs four multi-mission fire control radars for tracking and engaging incoming threats. It is to be installed on VT-4 main battle tanks.
