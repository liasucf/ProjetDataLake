It is the second most prestigious title in the discipline after the 800 metres at the Olympics. The competition format typically has two qualifying rounds leading to a final between eight athletes. The championship records for the event are 1:43.06 for men, set by Billy Konchellah in 1987, and 1:54.68 for women, set by Jarmila Kratochv\u00edlov\u00e1 in 1983. Set at the inaugural championships, Kratochv\u00edlov\u00e1's record is the longest-standing record of the competition.Championships Records. IAAF. Retrieved on 2015-07-12.

The most successful man is Wilson Kipketer, who won three straight titles from 1995 to 1999.

Yuriy Borzakovskiy, though never a champion, has won the most medals in the men's competition, with two silver and two bronze medals. Kenya is the most successful nation in the discipline, with five gold medals in the men's, two in the women's race, and a total of 13 medals overall.

The 1993 finalist Liliya Nurutdinova was the only woman disqualified at the 1993 championships. Another Russian, Lyubov Tsyoma, had her semi-final run in 1997 annulled. Ten years passed without incident until a third Russian, Svetlana Cherkasova was struck from the heats for doping in 2007. Two women semi-finalists were disqualified for doping in 2009: a fourth Russian, Svetlana Klyuka, and Tetiana Petlyuk of Ukraine.
