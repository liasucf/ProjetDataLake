The drawings were created in 1915 for the director of G\u00f6teborgs Mekaniska Verkstad, Mr Erik W Flobeck. The yacht was built at Eriksberg. No expenses were spared building the yacht. The hull was built of mahogany, flooring was made of teak and the decks were made of Oregon pine. All fittings were made of bronze and were chrome plated. Flobeck was one of the founders of the Swedish Voluntary Motorboat Corps, Sveriges Frivilliga Motorb\u00e5tsk\u00e5r (SFMK)in 1913. The yacht was also used in the Service of the Corps. Flobeck died in 1917 and the yacht was sold to new owners. The 52 foot yacht was one of the larger private yachts designed by C.G. Pettersson by this time. From 1925 and onwards, the yacht came into the possession of Ole Christian Olsen, director of Dals Eds Papermill.
