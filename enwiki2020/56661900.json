    "text": "Microtis eremaea, commonly known as the slender mignonette orchid or inland onion orchid is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia and western South Australia. It has a single thin, hollow, onion- like leaf and up to fifty small greenish-yellow flowers. The flowers have a distinctive heart-shaped labellum and the orchid generally grows in more inland areas than most other onion orchids. == Description == Microtis eremaea is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between ten and fifty yellowish-green flowers are crowded along a flowering stem tall. The flowers are long, wide with an ovary long. The dorsal sepal is long, about wide and hood-like. The lateral sepals are about long, wide with their tips rolled downwards. The petals are long, wide and are partly enclosed by the dorsal sepal. The labellum is heart-shaped, long, about wide and curves downwards with slightly wavy edges. Flowering occurs from August to October. ==Taxonomy and naming== Microtis eremaea was first formally described in 1996 by Robert Bates from a specimen collected on a granite outcrop west of Mount Magnet and the description was published in Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden. The specific epithet (eremaea) is derived from Latin eremaea, referring to the arid habitat of this orchid. ==Distribution and habitat== Microtis eremaea mostly grows on granite outcrops or near temporary watercourses, sometimes forming dense colonies. It is found between Balladonia and Cue in Western Australia and in the west of South Australia. ==Conservation== Microtis eremaea is classified as \"not threatened\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife. == References == == External links == * Category:Prasophyllinae eremaea Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1996 ",
