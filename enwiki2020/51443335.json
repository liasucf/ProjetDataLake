    "text": "Eddie John \"E. J.\" O'Sullivan was an Irish hurler whose championship career with the Cork senior team spanned four seasons from 1946 to 1949. Born in Blackrock, Cork, O'Sullivan first played competitive hurling in his youth. He quickly became involved with the Blackrock club, eventually becoming a key member of the senior team. O'Sullivan's career coincided with a 25-year barren spell for the club. Having never played minor or junior hurling for Cork, Lyons made his debut on the inter-county scene when he was picked on the Cork senior team for the first time in 1946. He won his sole All-Ireland medal that year, albeit as a non-playing substitute. O'Sullivan was a regular on the team over the next few years, also winning two Munster medals as a non-playing substitute. He played his last game for Cork in May 1949. ==Honours== ;Cork *All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (1): 1946 (sub) *Munster Senior Hurling Championship (5): 1946 (sub), 1947 (sub) ==References== Category:Blackrock hurlers Category:Cork inter-county hurlers Category:All- Ireland Senior Hurling Championship winners Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing ",
