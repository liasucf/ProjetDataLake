    "text": "The Cave of the Demons () is an 1898 French short silent film directed by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s. The film was one of M\u00e9li\u00e8s's early forays into themes that would later be linked to horror cinema (his The Haunted Castle, made in 1896, is sometimes labeled the first horror film). The Cave of the Demons is also believed to be the first film in which M\u00e9li\u00e8s used the cinematic technique of multiple exposure. The film was released by M\u00e9li\u00e8s's Star Film Company and is numbered 164 in its catalogues. It is currently presumed lost. ==See also== * List of ghost films ==References== ==External links== * Category:1898 films Category:French films Category:French silent short films Category:French black-and-white films Category:Lost horror films Category:1890s horror films Category:Films directed by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s Category:French horror films Category:Demons in film Category:Lost French films Category:1890s lost films ",
