    "text": "The Shiun Maru disaster (\u7d2b\u96f2\u4e38\u4e8b\u6545 Shiun Maru Jiko) was a ship collision in Japan on 11 May 1955, during a school field trip, killing 168 people. The Shiun Maru ferry sank in the Seto Inland Sea after colliding with another Japanese National Railways (JNR) ferry, the Uko Maru, in thick fog. A lack of radar onboard contributed to the accident. The victims included 100 students from elementary and junior high schools in Shimane, Hiroshima, Ehime and Kochi prefectures who were on school trips. The sinking of the Shiun Maru motivated the Japanese government to plan the Great Seto Bridge project, the longest two-tiered bridge system in the world. ==See also== *Akashi Kaiky\u014d Bridge ==References== ==External links== * List of Major Marine Accidents in the World and Japan * Japanese Railway Ships Category:Ferries of Japan Category:Maritime incidents in 1955 Category:Shipwrecks in the Pacific Ocean Category:Ships sunk in collisions Category:1955 in Japan Category:Maritime incidents in Japan ",
