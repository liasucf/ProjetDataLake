    "text": "The SNCF BB 20011 and SNCF BB 20012 were electric locomotives used for testing, built by Alsthom between 1985 and 1986. The two locomotives were the synchronous dual-voltage prototypes for Class BB 26000. In 1994 the locomotives were re-used for work on the channel tunnel, then converted to standard class BB 22200s in 1995. ==History== ===SNCF BB 26000 test locomotives=== In 1985 and 1986 the SNCF BB 22200 locomotives numbers 22379 and 22380 were modified to test dual voltage electric traction equipment, the microprocessor control, and auxiliary variable speed induction motors. 20012 was used to test the combination of pneumatic brake system and electric brake system. ===Channel tunnel machines=== In 1994 the units were used in the channel tunnel as motor engines for TTU trains. (Channel tunnel freight engines) ===Conversion to standard locomotives=== In 1995 the locomotives were converted back to standard SNCF Class BB 22200 type. ==Miniature models== The locomotive 20011 has been produced by Marklin and Roco in HO scale. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== ;Images * 20011 Category:Alstom locomotives Category:B-B locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1986 Category:Experimental locomotives Category:Multi-system locomotives Category:Standard gauge electric locomotives of France ",
