    "text": "The Mamiya 645 camera systems are a series of medium format film and digital cameras and lenses manufactured by Mamiya and its successors. They are called \"645\" because they use the nominal 6cm x 4.5cm film size from 120 roll film. They came in three major generations: first-generation manual-focus film cameras, second-generation manual-focus film cameras, and autofocus film/digital cameras. == Mamiya 645 Manual Focus System == === Mamiya 645 manual focus cameras === All seven of the manual-focus Mamiya 645 cameras can use the same lenses and film inserts (film spools). The two generations use different viewfinders, grips, and other accessories that are not always cross- compatible. ==== First Generation ==== * The M645 was manufactured from 1975 to 1987. This was the first model to offer a 6x4.5 cm frame, allowing 15 shots on a standard 120 roll film. The M645 was a true system camera, with interchangeable viewfinders and lenses. It used an electronically controlled cloth focal plane shutter offering speeds of 8 seconds to 1/500 second in one- stop increments. The camera featured a mirror lockup, as well as selectable multi-exposure. Film was carried in cartridges that could be pre-loaded, but no capability existed to allow changing of film magazines mid-roll. A waist- level non-metered finder was available, as well as a non-metered pentaprism and three varieties of through-the-lens (TTL) metered prisms (CdS, PD and AE). The metered prisms read the aperture dial through a mechanical coupling on the lens. The standard lens was the 80mm f/2.8 C or the 70mm f/2.8 C E or the 80mm f/1.9 C. * The M645 1000S was manufactured from 1976 to 1990. This camera added a 1/1000 second shutter speed to the M645, as well as a self-timer and a depth-of-field preview lever. The standard lens was the 80mm f/2.8 C or the 80mm f/1.9 C. * The M645J was manufactured from 1979 to 1982. This was a stripped-down version of the M645, with the mirror lockup knob and second shutter button removed. The standard lens was the 80mm f/2.8 C or the 80mm f/1.9 C. ==== Second Generation ==== * The Mamiya 645 Super was manufactured from 1985 to 1993. This was a new camera with a molded plastic shell on a diecast metal frame. Its features are the same as the M645 1000s, but it added removable film backs, whereby a dark-slide could be inserted and the back removed mid-roll. The standard lens was the 80mm f/2.8 N, or the 80mm f/1.9 C (early) or the 80mm f/1.9 N (late). * The Mamiya 645 Pro was manufactured from 1993 to 1998. It added a self-timer and a smoother styling. The standard lens was the 80mm f/2.8 N or the 80mm f/1.9 N. * The Mamiya 645 Pro-TL was manufactured from 1997 to 2006 and is functionally similar to the 645 Pro but adds through-the-lens flash metering. The standard lens was the 80mm f/2.8 N or the 80mm f/1.9 N. * The Mamiya 645E was first released in 2000. This was an entry-level version of the M645 Pro without switchable backs or viewfinders. It did have a light meter built in to the viewfinder, however. The standard lens was the 80mm f/2.8 N or the 80mm f/1.9 N. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+Mamiya 645 Manual Focus Camera Comparison !Model !Body / Frame Construction !Years !Slowest Shutter !Fastest Shutter !Flash Sync !Weight (body) !Switchable Backs !Switchable Finders !Mirror Lockup !Self Timer !Multi Exposure !DoF Preview on Body !Shutter buttons |- |M645 |Metal / Metal |1975-87 |8s |1/500s |1/60s |920g |No |Yes |Yes |No |Yes |No |Two |- |M645 1000S |Metal / Metal |1976-90 |8s |1/1000s |1/60s |965g |No |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |Two |- |M645J |Metal / Metal |1979-82 |1s |1/500s |1/60s |910g |No |Yes |No |No |Yes |No |One |- |645 Super |Plastic / Metal |1985-93 |4s |1/1000s |1/60s |895g |Yes |Yes |Yes |No |Yes |No |One |- |645 Pro |Plastic / Metal |1993-98 |4s |1/1000s |1/60s |980g |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |No |One |- |645 Pro-TL |Plastic / Metal |1997-06 |4s |1/1000s |1/60s |970g |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |Yes |No |One |- |645E |Plastic / Metal |2000-06 |4s |1/1000s |1/60s |1340g |No |No |Yes |No |Yes |No |One |} === Mamiya 645 Manual-Focus Lenses === A Mamiya 70mm f/2.8. This lens has a built-in leaf shutter, which is cocked by the grips at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions The Mamiya 645 Manual-Focus lenses will work on all manual-focus bodies. They will also work on autofocus bodies such as the Mamiya 645AF, Mamiya 645DF and Phase One 645DF, but manual-focus lenses will require light metering after the lens has been stopped down, unlike native autofocus lenses. Third-party adapters exist to use these manual-focus lenses on Nikon F mount, Canon EF mount, and other cameras. These lenses will not work on the Phase One XF unless modified. All Mamiya 645 lenses are multi-coated. Nearly all have curved aperture blades, rendering smooth backgrounds at wider aperture settings. The internal shutter in the first-generation 645 bodies only supported flash synchronization at 1/60th of a second. This made outdoors fill flash difficult, and so some lenses were equipped with a built-in leaf shutter which supported flash synchronization at all speeds up to 1/500th of a second. Leaf shutter lenses had a separate PC socket. In order to take advantage of the faster speeds the internal shutter had to be fired at 1/30th of a second or slower. ==== Lens abbreviations ==== * A or APO \u2014 the lens has an apochromatic (or near- apochromatic) design * C \u2014 the lens is stamped \u201cSekor C\u201d on the lens barrel. All manual-focus lenses for Mamiya 645 are Sekor C lenses, which Mamiya used to designate multi-coated lenses. * E \u2014 only for the 70mm f/2.8 E lens sold as a kit with the original M645, apparently late in the M645's production run to differentiate it from the leaf-shutter version. * Macro \u2014 the lens is optimized for close focusing and close-up (macro) photography * N \u2014 the lens has a \"new\" cosmetic design. \"N\" lenses were launched with the second generation manual-focus cameras. Many \"N\" lenses are the same as their prior \"C\" or \"S\" lens version, but have changes to the lens coatings and a plastic aperture ring instead of metal. Some \"C\" lenses received a cosmetic update (removal of the chrome on the focus ring) but were not otherwise changed and did not receive a \"N\" marking, such as the 50mm f/4.5 and 500mm f/5.6. \"N\" lenses may also be called \"CN\" lenses. *N/L \u2014 the lens has the \"new\" cosmetic design and an integrated Leaf Shutter. When used with the optional power drive WG-401 on second generation bodies, the leaf shutters are automatically cocked. On first generation bodies, or without the power drive, the leaf shutters must be cocked manually. * S \u2014 the lens is a revised version of a \"C\" lens. The only lenses with \"S\" versions are the 45mm f/2.8 and 55mm f/2.8 (both with different optical formulas and dimensions than their predecessors), but other accessories have \"S\" versions, including the Waist-level Finder W, the Prism Viewfinder PD, and the #3 extension tube. Early \"S\" lenses may have gold \"S\" stickers on them, while later \"S\" lenses may have the \"S\" engraved. \"S\" lenses may also be called \"CS\" lenses. * SF \u2014 the lens has a separate control ring to create a Soft Focus effect. * ULD \u2014 the lens has \u201cultra low dispersion\u201d glass in its design * Zoom \u2014 the lens has a variable focal length ==== Lens table ==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+Mamiya 645 Manual Focus Lenses !Focal length !Aperture !Versions* !Special Features !Aperture Range !Aperture Blades !Elements / Groups !Minimum focusing !Filter Size !Hood type !Length \u00d7 Diameter !Weight !Equivalent Focal Length in 35mm format !Equivalent Aperture in 35mm format !Peak Resolution Performance (lines/mm)** |- |24 mm |f/4 |C |ULD Fisheye |4-22 |5 |10 / 8 |0.3 m |Drop-in |Fixed |82 \u00d7 100 mm |785 g |15 mm |f/2.5 |N.A. |- |35 mm |f/3.5 |C, N | |3.5-22 |6 |9 / 7 |0.45 m |77 mm |None |62 \u00d7 80 mm |445 g |22 mm |f/2.2 |74 @ f/5.6 (AF version) |- |45 mm |f/2.8 |C | |2.8-22 |6 |9 / 7 |0.50 m |77mm |Slip-on |78 \u00d7 80 mm |540 g |28 mm |f/1.8 |N.A. |- |45 mm |f/2.8 |S, N | |2.8-22 |6 |9 / 7 |0.45 m |67 mm |Slip- on |71 \u00d7 75 mm (N version) |475 g |28 mm |f/1.8 |78 @ f/5.6 (AF version) |- |50 mm |f/4 |C |Shift |4-32 |6 |10 / 8 |0.45 m |77 mm |None |106 \u00d7 80 mm |735 g |31 mm |f/2.5 |N.A. |- |55 mm |f/2.8 |C | |2.8-22 |6 |9 / 6 |0.55 m |58 mm |Screw-in |71 \u00d7 70 mm |395 g |34 mm |f/1.8 |83 @ f/8 (C version) |- |55 mm |f/2.8 |S, N | |2.8-22 |6 |8 / 6 |0.45 m |58 mm |Screw-in |59 \u00d7 70 mm (N version) |335 g (S) 305 g (N) |34 mm |f/1.8 |73 @ f/8 (N version) |- |55 mm |f/2.8 |A N/L |Leaf Shutter |2.8-22 |5 |8 / 6 |0.45 m |67 mm |Screw-in |62 \u00d7 80 mm |520 g |34 mm |f/1.8 |N.A. |- |70 mm |f/2.8 |E | |2.8-22 |6 |6 / 4 |0.8 m |58 mm |Screw-in |50 \u00d7 70 mm |285 g |43 mm |f/1.8 |N.A. |- |70 mm |f/2.8 |C |Leaf Shutter |2.8-22 |5 |6 / 4 |0.8 m |58 mm |Screw-in |50 \u00d7 76 mm |395 g |43 mm |f/1.8 |N.A. |- |80 mm |f/1.9 |C, N | |1.9-22 |6 |7 / 6 |0.7 m |67 mm |Screw-in |59 \u00d7 76 mm |420 g |50 mm |f/1.2 |N.A. |- |80 mm |f/2.8 |C, N | |2.8-22 |6 |6 / 5 |0.7 m |58 mm |Screw-in |47 \u00d7 70 mm (C) 44 \u00d7 70 mm (N) |250 g (C) 220 g (N) |50 mm |f/1.8 |58 @ f/11 (C) 73 @ f/5.6 (N) 78 @ f/4 (AF) |- |80 mm |f/2.8 |A N/L |Leaf Shutter |2.8-22 |5 |6 / 5 |0.8 m |67 mm |Screw-in |62 \u00d7 80 mm |460 g |50 mm |f/1.8 |N.A. |- |80 mm |f/4 |C, N |Macro 1:2 |4-22 |5 |6 / 4 |0.37 m |67 mm |None |75 \u00d7 79 mm |585 g |50 mm |f/2.5 |N.A. |- |110 mm |f/2.8 |C, N | |2.8-22 |6 |5 / 5 |1.2 m |58 mm |Screw-in |60 \u00d7 70 mm |390 g |68 mm |f/1.8 |N.A. |- |120 mm |f/4 |A |APO Macro 1:1 |4-32 |9 |9 / 8 |0.4 m |67 mm |None |111 \u00d7 77 mm |745 g |74 mm |f/2.5 |71 @ f/8 (MF \"A\" version) |- |145 mm |f/4 |C |Soft Focus |4-32 |8 |7 / 5 |1.5 m |77 mm |Screw-in |116 \u00d7 82 mm |900 g |90 mm |f/2.5 |N.A. |- |150 mm |f/2.8 |A |APO |2.8-22 |8 |6 / 4 |1.5 m |67 mm |Built-in |112 \u00d7 75 mm |740 g |93 mm |f/1.8 |N.A. |- |150 mm |f/3.5 |C, N | |3.5-32 |6 |5 / 5 |1.5 m |58 mm |Built-in |80 \u00d7 70 mm (N version) |415 g (C) 420 g (N) |93 mm |f/2.2 |N.A. |- |150 mm |f/3.8 |A N/L |Leaf Shutter |3.8-22 |5 |5 / 5 |1.5 m |67 mm |Screw-in |82 \u00d7 79 mm |620 g |93 mm |f/2.4 |N.A. |- |150 mm |f/4 |C | |4-32 |6 |5 / 4 |1.5 m |58 mm |Built-in |91 \u00d7 70 mm |440 g |93 mm |f/2.5 |52 @ f/4 (C version) |- |200 mm |f/2.8 |A |APO |2.8-22 |8 |7 / 5 |2.4 m |77 mm |Built-in |144 \u00d7 91 mm |1100 g |124 mm |f/1.8 |64 @ f/8 (MF \"A\" version) |- |210 mm |f/4 |C, N | |4-32 |9 |5 / 4 |2.5 m |58 mm |Built-in |137 \u00d7 70 mm |715 g (C) 775 g (N) |130 mm |f/2.5 |77 @ f/4 (AF version) |- |300 mm |f/2.8 |A |APO |2.8-22 |8 |9 / 8 |3.5 m |43.5 mm rear |Built-in |237 \u00d7 140 mm |2660 g |186 mm |f/1.8 |72 @ f/5.6 (MF \"A\" version) |- |300 mm |f/5.6 |C, N |ULD (N version) |5.6-32 |9 |6 / 5 |4 m |58 mm |Built-in |164 \u00d7 70 mm |710 g |186 mm |f/3.5 |N.A. |- |500 mm |f/4.5 |A |APO |4.5-32 |N.A. |11 / 9 |5 m |43.5 mm rear |Built-in |378 \u00d7 162 mm |5410 g |310 mm |f/2.8 |N.A. |- |500 mm |f/5.6 |C | |5.6-45 |9 |6 / 5 |9 m |105 mm |Built-in |358 \u00d7 114 mm |2280 g |310 mm |f/3.5 |N.A. |- |500 mm |f/8 |C |Reflex / Mirror |8 (fixed) |Fixed |7 / 5 |4 m |Drop-in |Built-in |135 \u00d7 101 mm |880 g |310 mm |f/5.0 |N.A. |- |55 - 110 mm |f/4.5 |N |Zoom |4.5-32 |8 |11 / 10 |1.5 m |67 mm |Screw-in |104 \u00d7 77 mm |800 g |34-68 mm |f/2.8 |AF version: 61 @ 55mm/f11; 56 @ 75mm/f11; 52 @ 110mm/f8 |- |75 - 150 mm |f/4.5 |C |Zoom |4.5-32 |8 |11 / 10 |1.8 m |77 mm |Slip-on |114 \u00d7 84 mm |975 g |47-93 mm |f/2.8 |N.A. |- |105 - 210 mm |f/4.5 |C |Zoom |4.5-32 |6 |15 / 11 |2.5 m |77 mm |Screw-in |N/A \u00d7 80 mm |1220 g |65-130 mm |f/2.8 |N.A. |- |105 - 210 mm |f/4.5 |C |ULD zoom |4.5-32 |9 |13 / 11 |1.8 m |58 mm |Built-in |158 \u00d7 75 mm |875 g |65-130 mm |f/2.8 |AF version: 72 @ 105mm/f8; 60 @ 140mm/f8; 62 @ 210mm/f8 |} * Lens with multiple versions are combined to save space.

It was a departure from the previous manual system, in that the finders and grips were no longer detachable and interchangeable. It still used the same lens mount, but the new autofocus lenses did not have an aperture ring; rather, the lens aperture was controlled by dials on the camera. Manual-focus lenses could still be used on the autofocus cameras, but not vice versa. If manual focus lenses are used, the lens aperture must be set before metering the scene (known as \"stop-down metering\") which made the manual-focus lenses of limited usefulness compared to the newer autofocus lenses. === Mamiya 645 auto focus cameras === * Mamiya 645AF (1999) \u2014 Similar to 645 Pro TL, but power winder and AE prism finder are both built in.
