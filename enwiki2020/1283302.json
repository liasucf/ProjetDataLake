Gimli was located to the immediate north of the City of Winnipeg. It was bordered to the north by Interlake, to the west by Interlake and Lakeside, and to the east by Lake Winnipeg and Selkirk. Communities in the riding included Gimli, Winnipeg Beach, Petersfield, Clandeboye and Matlock. The riding's population in 1996 was 19,700.

The service sector accounts for 15% of industry in the riding, with a further 11% each in manufacturing and the retail trade. There is also a significant fishing and tourism economy in the riding. Gimli is home to the largest Icelandic community in the world outside Iceland, and many of its MLAs have been from this background. It also has significant Ukrainian and German communities, at 12% and 6% respectively. Gimli was a \"bellwether\" riding, and has elected a candidate from a governing party in all but five elections since its establishment (the exceptions were 1907, 1920, 1922, 1936 and 1999). ==List of provincial representatives== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
