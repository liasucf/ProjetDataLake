    "text": "Alfred Keller ant model on display at Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde Alfred Keller (1902\u20131955) was a museum artist who created large models of insects and other small animals; these models are unique for their impressive attention to detail. Keller was employed at the Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde (Museum of Natural History) in Berlin, Germany from 1930 until his death in 1955, and his sculptures can still be found there. He worked with papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 and several other materials such as celluloid and galalith to create models of insects including a flea (1930, 100:1 scale), a housefly (1932, 50:1 scale), a mosquito in flight (1937, 60:1 scale), a Colorado potato beetle (1940, 50:1 scale), and a ball bearer leafhopper (Bocydium globulare, 1953, 180:1 scale), among others. The housefly, typical of the painstaking attention to detail shown in Keller's sculptures, includes 2,653 bristles. Each model took about a year to complete. == Works == File:2013 Naturkundemuseum Berlin pulex irritans anagoria.JPG|flea (1930, 100:1 scale) File:2013 Naturkundemuseum Berlin musca domestica anagoria.JPG|housefly (1932, 50:1 scale) File:2013 Naturkundemuseum Berlin culex pipiens anagoria.JPG|mosquito in flight (1937, 60:1 scale) File:2013 Naturkundemuseum sitophilus granarius anagoria.JPG|Wheat weevil (1940, 50:1 scale) File:2013 Naturkundemuseum myrmica rubra laevinodis, periphyllus aceris anagoria.JPG|Myrmica rubra with Aphid, 1944, 100:1 scale, 1947 reconstruction of a model destroyed in World War II File:2013 Naturkundemuseum Berlin bocydium globulare anagoria.JPG|ball bearer treehopper (Bocydium globulare, 1953, 180:1 scale) ==References== ==External links== *German webpage including a photo of two of Keller's insect sculptures. *Nature article about Alfred Keller (subscription required) *Blog post containing a photograph of Keller's ball bearer leafhopper Category:Artists from Berlin Category:20th-century German sculptors Category:20th-century male artists Category:German male sculptors Category:1902 births Category:1955 deaths ",
