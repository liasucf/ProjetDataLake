BGN fell under the responsibility of HQ 4th Division in Aldershot until 2011 when Support Command (now Regional Command) took over that role. ==Operations== The mission of BGN is to deliver Gurkha recruitment, provide local support to the soldier and ex-servicemen and maintain Disaster Relief preparedness within resources in order to support Firm Base activity in Nepal.
