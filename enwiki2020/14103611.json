    "text": "Karol Sidor (July 16, 1901 \u2013 October 20, 1953) was a Slovak nationalist politician and journalist. Active from an early age, he was undecided about full independence and as a result was largely sidelined during the Slovak Republic. ==Political activity== A devout Roman Catholic, he was born in Ru\u017eomberok in the Lipt\u00f3 County of the Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Slovakia) and came to politics early as a low-level supporter of Andrej Hlinka.Philip Rees, Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890, 1990, pp. 356-357 He would later write a biography of Hlinka, his political idol.Stanislav J. Kirschbaum, A History of Slovakia: The Struggle for Survival, St. Martin's Griffin, 1996, , p. 147 After finishing his education he joined the Slovak People's Party (SPP) and became one of its leading members on the pro-Poland wing. Before long however he would become associated with the Ferdinand \u010eur\u010dansk\u00fd and the Vojtech Tuka wings of the party. He was elected to parliament in 1935 and, ironically given his early ideas, was chosen to argue against Poland's claims on Slovak territory. Sidor was also commander of the Hlinka Guard and had been touted as a successor to the priest, although this did not happen. He was given the position of Minister for Slovak Affairs by the Czechoslovakian government in 1938, a role which took him away from the radicals of the SPP, allowing Jozef Tiso to take control ahead of him. Wary of Nazi Germany, he rejected a move from Artur Seyss-Inquart to declare independence in 1939, leading to the Nazis concentrating their efforts on Tiso instead.J\u00falius Bartl, Slovak History: Chronology and Lexicon, Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, 2002, p. 138 When independence was declared Sidor served as Minister of the Interior for little over a month in 1939 before their pressure forced him out.Kirschbaum, A History of Slovakia, p. 190 Sidor was a strong anti-Semite but nevertheless he had reservations about the Nazis and would later serve in only the very minor role of Minister to the Holy See. From January to March 1939 he also a commission to examine the \"Jewish question\" in Slovakia, although nothing came of this initiative and ultimately the issue would be taken over by the Nazis.pp. 196-197 1945 passport validation signed by Karl Sidor who was the Slovakian representative at the Vatican. 1949 stateless travel document used by Karl Sidor's family to leave Italy for Canada. ==Exile== As the war ended, he left Czechoslovakia for the west, ultimately settling in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He had initially been refused asylum by the Government of Canada who considered him a persona non grata but they changed their minds in 1950 following the intervention of Pope Pius XII.Robert G. Weisbord & Wallace P. Sillanpoa, The Chief Rabbi, the Pope, and the Holocaust: An Era in Vatican- Jewish Relations, Transaction Publishers, 1992, p.87, n.58 Sidor had remained in the Vatican and his presence in Rome had become a source of some embarrassment to the Pope given Sidor's conduct in the war.Mark Aarons and John Loftus, Ratlines: How the Vatican's Nazi Networks Betrayed Western Intelligence to the Soviets, William Heinemann, 1991, p. 222 He was sentenced in absentia to 20 years by a Czechoslovak court in 1947. Sidor received a U.S. passport by 1947. Sidor died in Canada without serving the sentence. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1901 births Category:1953 deaths Category:People from Ru\u017eomberok Category:People from the Kingdom of Hungary Category:Slovak Roman Catholics Category:Slovak People's Party politicians Category:Government ministers of Czechoslovakia Category:Members of the Chamber of Deputies of Czechoslovakia (1935\u20131939) Category:Prime Ministers of Slovakia Category:Czechoslovak emigrants to Canada Category:Slovak emigrants to Canada ",
