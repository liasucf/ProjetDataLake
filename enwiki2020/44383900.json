    "text": "Since the fall of Communism in 1989, the nature of migration to and from Poland has been in flux. After Poland's accession to the European Union and accession to the Schengen Area in particular, a significant number of Poles, estimated at over two million, have emigrated, primarily to the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Ireland. The majority of them, according to the Central Statistical Office of Poland, left in search of better work opportunities abroad while retaining permanent resident status in Poland itself. After Poland joined the EU, Poles acquired the right to work in some EU countries, while some of the members implemented transition periods. The UK, Ireland, Sweden and Malta allowed Poles to work freely without any limitations from the start. Peaking in 2007, almost 2.3 million Poles lived abroad, mostly in Western Europe. This has been the largest wave of economic migration of Poles abroad since the Polish emigration to the United States in late 19th and early 20th century, which is estimated to have brought between about 1.5 million, and 3.5 million Poles to the United States. ==Numbers of Polish== Emigration of Poles, relatively modest in the first decade or so after the fall of communism in 1989,Dustmann & Frattini 2012, pg. 5. increased significantly in the late 1990s, with the share of emigrants in the overall Polish population growing from 0.5% (~100,000) in 1998 to 2.3% (~600,000) in 2008.Dustmann & Frattini 2012, pg. 2.Dustmann & Frattini 2012, pg. 6. The percentage of young people attending university has also increased dramatically since 1989 resulting in a 'brain overflow' by the time Poland joined the European Union in 2004. The number of young adults speaking English doubled in just one decade between 1996 and 2008.White 2011, chpt. \"Post- communist Poland\", pp. 29-30. Since the opening of the labour market following Poland joining the European Union in 2004, Poland experienced a mass migration of over 2 million abroad. As of 2011, 52 out of 1,000 Polish citizens have lived outside the country; estimated at 2.2 million by the Polish Central Statistics Office (GUS), and 2.6\u20132.7 million by the journalists. GUS statistics estimate that the number of long term Polish immigrants abroad have risen from 0.7 million in 2002 to a peak number of almost 2.3 million in 2007, and has since declined to 2 million by 201011.Wsp\u00f3\u0142czesne migracje zagraniczne Polak\u00f3w-w \u015bwietle bada\u0144 bie\u017c\u0105cych i wynik\u00f3w NSP 2011 III Mi\u0119dzynarodowa Konferencja Naukowa \u201eJako\u015b\u0107 i warunki \u017cycia a procesy demograficzne w Europie \u015arodkowej w czasach nowo\u017cytnych\u201d Zielona G\u00f3ra 24-25 pa\u017adziernika 2012 r.

Polish-born people in employment in the UK, 2003-2010 According to poll from 2007 for around 29% of Polish emigrants their job abroad is the first job they had in life.Kariery i mobilno\u015b\u0107 spo\u0142eczno-zawodowa migrant\u00f3w poakcesyjnych pod redakcja Ewy Jazwinskiej, page 27, October 2013 Professor Krystyna Iglicka has estimated that up to half a million Poles emigrated in 2013. As of 2011, approximately 80% of Polish emigrants settle in the countries of the European Union. As of 2013, the largest group of modern Polonia can be found in the United Kingdom (550,000),https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/jan/26/europe- population-who-lives-where followed by that in Germany (425,608), and in France (350,000 as of 2012). Significant Polish presence can also be found in Ireland (115,000 as of 2013), in Italy (94,000 as of 2011), and in the Netherlands (103,000 as of 2013).\"Sueddeutsche Zeitung\": Polska prze\u017cywa najwi\u0119ksz\u0105 fal\u0119 emigracji od 100 latInformacja o rozmiarach i kierunkach emigracji z Polski w latach 2004\u20132013, 2014, GUS, As of 2011, the largest groups of recent Polish emigrants outside EU were those in the United States (243,000) and in Canada (52,000). The number of Poles in Norway, itself not an EU member, has significantly increased recently (from 43,000 in 2011 to 71,000 as of 2013). Different regions of Poland have significantly different emigration patterns; as of 2011 the voivodeships of Poland with the highest number of emigrants were the Opole Voivodeship (10.6%), Podlaskie Voivodeship (9.1%), Podkarpackie Voivodeship (8.4%) and Warmi\u0144sko-mazurskie Voivodeship (7.5%), contrasted with much smaller emigration percentage from Mazowieckie Voivodeship (2.8%), \u0141\u00f3dzkie Voivodeship (2.9%) and Wielkopolskie Voivodeship (3.1%). Overall, the emigration is higher in the poorer, eastern region of Poland.CBOS BS/166/2013: POAKCESYJNE MIGRACJE ZAROBKOWE . http://www.cbos.pl/SPISKOM.POL/2013/K_166_13.PDF, p.8-9 ==Reasons== Primary reasons for the migration are almost always economic in nature. It has disproportionately affected young Poles, in their 20s and 30s. Reasons for the migration include higher wages offered abroad, and the difficult situation of young people in the Polish labor market, related to the increase in levels of unemployment during the global Great Recession of 2008.Polish Migration to the UK in the 'New' European Union: After 2004 edited by Dr Kathy Burrell De Monfort University 2012 page 9 Due to a large increase in the number of Poles attending universities after the fall of communism, the supply of educated workers exceeded the domestic demand and as a result many young Poles migrated to the west. According to a survey conducted in 2011, 33% of those questioned pointed to higher wages as motivation for emigration and 31% to unemployment, with 3% stating professional development and 16% declaring family reasons.

Positive consequences of the migration include gains in skills and familiarity with global culture. Estimates also suggest that the emigration raised wages for those workers who stayed behind, contributing about 11% of total wage growth between 1998-2007.Christian Dustmann, Tommaso Frattini, and AnnaRosso (2012). The Effect of Emigration from Poland on Polish Wages (PDF file, direct download). CDP No 29/12, pp. 27, 34. The migration has also been associated with lowering of unemployment in Poland and remittances of approximately 41 billion euros in the Polish economy. ==Returning migrants== With better economic conditions and Polish salaries at 70% of the EU average in 2016, the emigration trend started to decrease in the 2010s and more workforce is needed in the country, so the Polish Minister of Development Mateusz Morawiecki encouraged Poles abroad to return to Poland. ==See also== *Historical demographics of Poland *Emigration from Poland to Germany after World War II *Freedom of movement for workers#Transitional provisions in new member states *Poles *Swedish Poles *Polish diaspora ==References== ==External links== * 2014 - Raport CEED: Migracje w XXI wieku z perspektywy kraj\u00f3w Europy \u015arodkowo-Wschodniej \u2013 szansa czy zagro\u017cenie? * Migracje ludno\u015bci, GUS (list of publications) * Migracje zagraniczne ludno\u015bci - NSP 2011, GUS (not included in the list of publications above) * Poland's emigration headache in The Economist 5 November 2013 * Poland: Fid\u00e8les \u00e0 la Pologne, m\u00eame s'ils vivent en France by Claire Fleury in L'Obs Journaliste, 9 May 2014. * Poland: Immigration to UK is back for good life despite economic crisis by Helen Pidd in The Guardian, 27 May 2011. * Dutch language central office of statistics report of 2012 Category:Demographic history of Poland Category:Economic history of Poland Category:Internal migrations in Europe Category:History of Poland (1989\u2013present) Category:Polish communities Category:Polish minorities Category:Contemporary migrations ",
