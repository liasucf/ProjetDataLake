According to the US Treasury, he \"supervised ISIL's financial affairs, including salary payments. He previously oversaw ISIL\u2019s military financial affairs and served as one of AQI\u2019s financial chiefs.\" ==Death== He was reported killed in an American airstrike on 10 December 2015. The date of the airstrike was described as 'within recent weeks'. Other reports said the strike took place in November 2015. Col. Steve Warren of the US Army, formerly the American military spokesman in Baghdad, described him as \"one of the most senior and experienced members of ISIL\u2019s financial network\" and \"a legacy Al Qaeda member\". Col. Warren further called Abu Salah \"one of the most senior and experienced members\" of the militant group's financial network. \"Killing him and his predecessors exhausts the knowledge and talent needed to co-ordinate funding within the organisation,\" Col Warren said. ==References== Category:Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant members from Iraq Category:Members of al-Qaeda in Iraq Category:1973 births Category:2015 deaths ",
