On December 12, 2008, Cash was non- tendered by the Red Sox, officially making him a free agent. In Boston, Cash wore the uniform number 36, except from August 16, 2008, to the end of that season, due to Paul Byrd joining the Red Sox and wearing 36, his customary number. During this period, Cash switched to number 30. ===2009: New York Yankees=== On December 23, 2008, Cash signed a minor league deal with the New York Yankees with an invitation to Spring Training.

R. Towles. He had 11 hits in 54 at bats with Houston. On July 1, 2010, Cash was acquired by the Red Sox for \u00c1ngel S\u00e1nchez after Jason Varitek went on the disabled list.

While Cash played for both the 2007 Red Sox and 2009 Yankees, teams that went on to win World Series, Cash was not on the postseason roster for either team; his only postseason appearances as a player came with the Red Sox in 2008. Cash was notable for wearing his plastic catcher's cap forward (similar to how a field player wears a normal baseball cap) under his mask; normally, catchers will turn the cap around to provide stability for their mask. ==Post-playing career== ===2012\u201314: Scouting and coaching=== On January 8, 2012, Cash announced his retirement. He was announced as an advance scout for the Blue Jays during the 2012 season.
