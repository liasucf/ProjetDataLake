As a Reserve Force Unit, it has a status roughly equivalent to that of a British Army Reserve or United States Army National Guard unit. == History == ===Under the Union Defence Force=== ====World War 2 Mobilisation==== This regiment was founded on 1 February 1940 as a citizen force infantry unit and named the Piet Retief Regiment, with the main purpose to supply troops for the Second World War. On 16 March 1940, the regiment was reorganized as an artillery unit renamed the 5th Field Regiment taking part in the Second World War as such. ====Post World War==== After the Second World War, the 5th Field became virtually non existent, however some years later the remnants of the regiment was renamed to Regiment Algoa Bay, of which its Uitenhage company became known as Regiment Uitenhage at a later stage. ====Rebirth of Regiment Piet Retief==== On 1 January 1954, Regiment Piet Retief was re-established as a predominantly Afrikaans speaking motorized infantry citizen force regiment with its headquarters in Graaff-Reinet. In 1956 the HQ moved to Cradock and in 1962 it moved to the Drill Hall in Queenstown. During 1987 the HQ moved to Port Elizabeth, where it is still based. ===Under the SADF=== ====Numerous Name changes==== In 1960 the regiment's name was changed to Regiment Transkei (RTK), but by 1966, this was changed to Regiment Noordoos-Kaap (RNOK) and by 1 April 1967 the name was again changed back to Regiment Piet Retief (RPR). ====Colours==== On 22 November 1969, the regiment received its Regimental Colours and changed its role to that of an infantry CO.IN(counter insurgency) unit. On 19 May 1990 the unit received its National Colour, which was laid up at the Group 39 chapel in Queenstown in 1995. ===Under the SANDF=== ====Command==== On 11 November 1994, the regiment was placed under command of Group 39 in Queenstown, after being under command of Group 6 in Port Elizabeth for a number of years. On 1 April 1997 the regiment was again placed under command of Group 6, after the closure of Group 39. ====Amalgamation==== During the latter part of 2000, Regiment Algoa Bay, Regiment Uitenhage and Donkin Regiment were amalgamated with Regiment Piet Retief. A new command team was appointed by the Infantry Formation. Regiment Piet Retief was then placed directly under command of the Infantry Formation. ====Leadership Transformation==== In 2009, the regiment appointed its first black unit second in command, Lt V.P Mbali who acted in the post until 2011 when he was also promoted to the substantive rank of Maj. The same year WO1 A. M. Xokolo became the first black Regimental Sergeant Major. In 2012, the regiment through succession planning appointment Lt Col V.P. Mbali as its Officer Commanding with effect from 1 June 2012 and an official ceremonial handing and taking over parade occurred on 5 November 2012. In 2013 during the ICCC, the regiment received several accolades for outstanding service and compliance from the General Officer Commanding SA Army infantry Formation, Maj General Lindile Yam. ====Name change==== In 2014 the regiment submitted a name change request and a Freedom of the City was planned for 2015, proposing the name of the Nelson Mandela Regiment (NMR) to the Director Army Reserves. This was approved in August 2019.https://www.defenceweb.co.za/featured/new-reserve-force-unit- names/ The new honorific was granted in honor of the silver jubilee of the formation of the current SANDF and is in honour of the country's first black president, Nelson Mandela. The regiment also changed the use of the Aloe badge on the beret and now uses the generic SA Army Infantry Formation badge in line with the one force concept, keeping all other regimental regalia as standard. ====Current Command==== *Honorary Colonel: Col Mzwandile B. Vena *Officer Commanding: Lt Col Vusumzi Mbali *Second in Command: Maj Sizwe Morgan Singunza *RSM: MWO Alfred Melubakho Xokolo == Leadership == ===Regimental emblems=== ====Badge==== The regiments emblem depicts an Aloe (Aloe Ferox) in bloom with the motto \"AD MORTEM\" (till death) on the scroll beneath it. Ferox is a Latin adjective meaning brave, courageous and combative, which is a fitting to an aloe, due to the difficult circumstances under which it normally has to grow and fitting to true infantrymen, due to the difficult circumstances under which they sometimes have to operate. ===Dress=== The regiment's leader group used to wear their infantry lanyards around the right shoulder with dress number 1 and 4, because of the regiments historical connection with the artillery, namely the 5th Field Regiment. The current leadership felt its necessary to align itself with the current dress code and regulations and changed the lanyard to the left as the rest of the Infantry Formation. The regiment has its own unique mess dress with an orange jacket, depicting the colour of the flowers of its emblem, as well as the regiment's strong roots in the Eastern Cape, where orange is a traditional colour used widely by many of the Xhosa tribes. The regiment also has its own blue blazer with an aloe in full colour on the pocket badge for all unit members. A silver aloe is used on the pocket badge for those regiment members with John Chard Medals (for 10 years long service), loyal service medals and Gold for members with JCD and 20 years in service. The regiment also has an informal attire consisting of a golf shirt, padded jacket, jersey, shorts, cap and track suit all with the regiment's emblem on it. ===Toast=== The regiment toasts with aloe juice. When members are promoted, they are congratulated to their new rank or appointment by being expected to have a drink of aloe juice, after which they say the unit motto \"AD MORTEM\" aloud. ===Battle cry=== In order to motivate the regiments soldiers as Infanteers, the regiment has its own unique \"Battle Cry\" that also promotes the regiments and Infantry ethos. ===Song=== The regiment encouraged members to compose a song that would identify them and their uniqueness from the Eastern Cape, including the long road the regiment has travelled in protecting the countries citizens as a force multiplier to the Regular Force. == Regimental Symbols == The units emblem is the tough Aloe plant, for which the Eastern Cape is known. ===Previous Dress Insignia=== SADF era Regiment Piet Retief insignia ===Current Dress Insignia=== SANDF era Infantry Formation insignia == Battle honours == None known == References == Category:Infantry regiments of South Africa Category:Military units and formations established in 1964 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1997 ",
