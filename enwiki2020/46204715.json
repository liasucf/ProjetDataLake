    "text": "The extensive and persistent impact on media and popular culture of Creature from the Black Lagoon began even before it was seen in theaters. To publicize the release of the film in 1954, Ben Chapman, in costume, introduced the Gill- Man to the public on live television in The Colgate Comedy Hour with Abbott and Costello. ==Film influence== * Many films featuring monsters put the Gill- Man's likeness in the background as an homage. Its likeness was also used for the film The Monster Squad. However, due to licensing issues with Universal, the Creature is referred to as the Gill-Man. * In the 1955 comedy The Seven Year Itch, Marilyn Monroe and Tom Ewell come out of a theater showing Creature from the Black Lagoon. Monroe expresses some sympathy for the Gill-Man, saying that it was not really bad and that it \"just wanted to be loved\". * The Gill- man appears in the Rankin/Bass Productions Halloween film, Mad Monster Party?, as one of many monsters invited to Baron Boris von Frankenstein's monster reunion party. It also appears in the Rankin/Bass TV film Mad Mad Mad Monsters as one of many monsters invited to Baron Henry von Frankenstein's wedding of the Monster and his newly-created Bride. * The Gill-man reappears in Fred Dekker\u2019s The Monster Squad, where it shows little interest in human females as opposed to its classic counterpart. Instead, it allies itself with Count Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, the Mummy and the Wolfman in order to secure a magical amulet which will allow them to conquer the world. After snapping the necks of several policemen, the Gill-man is killed by Monster Squad member Horace, who shoots it with a shotgun. For its appearance in The Monster Squad, the Gill-man was redesigned by Stan Winston in order to merely suggest Milicent Patrick\u2019s original design, due to licensing issues. The Gill-man was the first costume portrayal of Tom Woodruff, Jr. who would later work prominently in the Alien film series. * Director William Winckler was inspired by the film when producing his 2005 black-and-white horror film Frankenstein vs. the Creature from Blood Cove. In the 90-minute retro monster movie, a bio- genetically engineered half-man, half-fish creature battles Frankenstein's monster on a beach and beneath the waves, with underwater photography reminiscent of the underwater shots in Creature from the Black Lagoon. A stuntman/diver wearing a full-body latex rubber costume was used to portray the Blood Cove creature on camera, not unlike Ben Chapman and Ricou Browning in costume in Creature from the Black Lagoon. * The 2017 film The Shape of Water is a romantic fantasy between a mute woman and an amphibious creature (performed by Doug Jones) from South America. Director Guillermo del Toro was inspired to make the film from childhood memories of seeing the Julia Adams swimming scene in Creature from the Black Lagoon and hoping the creature would get with the girl.http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3457493/iconic-horror- movie-scene-inspired-shape-water/ ==Television influence== * In an Abbott and Costello sketch on TV's The Colgate Comedy Hour, the Gill-man appears in a haunted house after the Frankenstein Monster faints at the sight of Lou Costello. * In an episode of the classic TV series The Munsters, the Munster family receives a visit from \"Uncle Gilbert\", who proudly refers to himself as the \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\". *The TV series I'll Be Gone in the Dark repeatedly references the swimming scene from the film. * In The Comic Strip, he has a son named Lagoon. * Attack of the Killer Tomatoes: The Animated Series parodied the film in \"The Tomato from the Black Lagoon\". In this episode, the gang looks for a missing-tomato-link in the San Zucchini Botanical Gardens, whilst they are stalked by an amphibious tomato that goes after Tara (who is also part tomato). * The Gill-Man appeared in the Robot Chicken episode \"Shoe\", voiced by Seth Green. He tells a man that he prefers the lagoon to be called the \"African-American Lagoon\". It also appears in the Robot Chicken sketch \"We Are a Humble Factory\", now voiced by Breckin Meyer. Learning of the success of Count Chocula, FrankenBerry, and BooBerry, as well as Fruity Yummy Mummy and Fruit Brute appearing as generic monster who are also jealous of the threesome having their own cereal, the Gill-Man decides to make his own cereal called \"Creature with the Black Macaroons\" because \"macaroon\" sounds like \"lagoon\" and are said to turn milk black. However, the cereal was not successful. When all the cereal were dumped into his lagoon, he says \"Should've gone with legumes\" as \"legume\" also sounds like \"lagoon\". ==Musical references== * Trinidadian calypso singer Lord Melody released a song called \"Creature From The Black Lagoon\" in 1957. In this song, he is compared to the Gill-Man by his son's friends, which his son protests. This song became one of his signature songs and also endured as a nickname for Melody for many years. * Dave Edmunds, with his band Rockpile, also performed a song called \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\". Edmunds' song, included in his 1979 album Repeat When Necessary, was written by Rockpile's lead guitarist Billy Bremner. * Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13, a band from North Carolina who were fronted by Murderdolls lead singer and solo artist Wednesday 13, also did a song about the Gill-Man, titling it \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\". * The heavy metal band Iced Earth also did a song about the Gill-Man called \"Dragon's Child\" on the Horror Show album. ==Other cultural influences== 1962 magazine cover depicting the Gill-Man * Creature from the Black Lagoon was made into a pinball game, designed by John Trudreau (a.k.a. \"Dr. Flash\") and released in 1992 by Midway under the Bally brand name.
