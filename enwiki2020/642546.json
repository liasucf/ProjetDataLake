On August 14, 2005 G4 began rebroadcasting the complete series.g4tv.com/fastlane After finishing its initial run on the network, Fastlane stopped airing on G4. ==Plot summary== Van Ray and Deaqon Hayes are two mismatched cops teamed together by shady, sexy police lieutenant, Wilhelmina \"Billie\" Chambers, in a secretive undercover division of the Los Angeles Police Department. Operating with the motto \"Everything we seize, we keep. Everything we keep, we use,\" their base of operations is the \"Candy Store\"\u2014a warehouse containing a fortune in confiscated cars, clothes, weapons and everything else needed to blend into the seedy criminal underworld of Los Angeles. Given criminal covers, the officers use all of the resources at their disposal to apprehend dangerous criminals while walking the line between cop and criminal. == Cast == === Main === * Peter Facinelli as Donovan \"Van\" Ray * Bill Bellamy as Deaqon \"Deaq\" Hayes * Tiffani Thiessen as Wilhemina \"Billie\" Chambers === Recurring === * Jay Mohr as Roland Hill * Mark Famiglietti as Jarod * Big Boy as Aquarius * Vondie Curtis-Hall as Andre Hayes * Jennifer Sky as Cassidy Shaw * Robert Forster as Raymond Ray * Jamie Brown as Sophia Jones * Bill Duke as Captain Parish * Lamont Johnson as Wisdom Bailey === Guest appearances === Over the course of its run, Fastlane featured cameos and guest appearances from several known figures, including Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Mischa Barton, Jenny McCarthy, Krista Allen, Jake Busey, Bokeem Woodbine, Hudson Leick, Jaime Pressly, George Hamilton, Eric Mabius, Michelle Forbes, Navi Rawat, Iggy Pop, Naomi Campbell, Tommy Lee, Terrence Howard, Isaac Hayes, the Red Elvises, Tatyana Ali, Paul Gleason, Antonio Fargas, Biz Markie, Kurupt, Treach and Ali Landry. Actor Randall Park also appeared on the show. ==Series run== The series consisted of twenty-two episodes, forty-five minutes each, plus an unaired pilot which ended up being very similar to the first episode broadcast. Episodes 13 and 14 (\"Defense\" and \"Offense\") form a two-part story, while episodes 21 and 22 (\"Dosed\" and \"Iced\") form a two-part story ending on a cliffhanger which sees Billie Chambers kidnapped and forced to do drugs. As the series was canceled at that point due to the high costs of each episode, there is no known resolution. Each episode cost the two studios making it (Warner Bros. and Fox) $2.6 million. The show's hallmarks\u2014unconventional cinematography, pyrotechnics, guest appearances, licensed soundtracks, supercars and other exotic vehicles\u2014were the root cause of the exorbitant production costs. The show was canceled because of these high production costs and the ratings drop it suffered from being moved from Wednesday nights to Friday nights. The show gained a strong cult following especially for the chemistry between the cast, the action scenes, the humor and the direction.https://uproxx.com/tv/fastlane-reboot-revival-fox-facinelli-bellamy- thiessen/https://tv.avclub.com/fox-s-flashy-fastlane-drove-too-close-to-the- sun-too-s-1798244347 ==Episodes== ==Home media== Warner Home Video released Fastlane: The Complete Series on DVD as a six disc set on July 8, 2008 in the Region 1.
