    "text": "Beachmasters (1985) is a novel by Australian author Thea Astley. It won the 1986 ALS Gold Medal. ==Plot summary== The novel is set on the small Melanesian island of Kristi in the far-western Pacific. A band of discontented Kristians and sympathetic colonials launch a revolution against the island government, which is composed of both French and British officials. While no single character predominates, it is the dilemma of Gavi Salway trapped between ties of blood and tradition and forced to decide whether to aid or betray the revolution's leader that affects us most.Amazon - \"Beachmasters\" ==Author's notes== \"Astley almost disclaims the expectation that 'Beachmasters' might raise its readers' eyes \u2014 if not as far as the South Pacific, then at least to racial problems closer to home: 'You know, one does, but... \"'Writing's a funny business.

Unless you've written 'War and Peace'.\"'\"To the Island with Thea Astley\", Peter Fuller, \"The Canberra Times\", 9 March 1985, p17 ==Reviews== * Laurence Hill in Library Journal: \"The Third World setting and politics evoke comparison to the work of V.S. Naipaul and Graham Greene. While Astley does not quite attain their high level of achievement, she has produced a work of considerable power and distinction.\" * Publishers Weekly: \"The result is a fragmented narrative, held together by the poetry of Astley's writing, which is often haunting but occasionally overly ponderous.\"\"Beachmasters, Thea Astley, author\", Publishers Weekly ==References== *Middlemiss.org Category:1985 Australian novels Category:Novels by Thea Astley Category:ALS Gold Medal winning works Category:Penguin Press books ",
