    "text": "The New Zealand Republican Party of 1995 was a political party which campaigned for the creation of a New Zealand republic as one of its main policies. It existed from 1995 to 2002. ==Founding== The party was registered as an incorporated society on 24 January 1995 as \"The Confederation of United Tribes of New Zealand Incorporated\" but changed its name on 8 February 1995 to the New Zealand Republican Party. It was led by William Powell. ==1996 election== Although the party was registered in time for the 1996 election, it was late in submitting its party list. The party challenged its exclusion as a result of failing to submit a list at the High Court of New Zealand, and attempted to have the 1996 elections postponed to allow this. Their application for an injunction was rejected however. ==1999 election== In the 1999 election, the party submitted a list, but won only 0.01% (292 votes in total) of the vote, the lowest of all registered parties. The party was officially de-registered on 24 June 2002, just before the 2002 election. ==See also== * Republicanism in New Zealand ==References== Category:Political parties established in 1995 Category:Defunct political parties in New Zealand Category:Republicanism in New Zealand Category:Republican parties Category:Political parties disestablished in 2002 Category:1995 establishments in New Zealand Category:2002 disestablishments in New Zealand ",
