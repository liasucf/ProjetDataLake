It will be the nation's eighteenth appearance at the Summer Olympics. ==Athletics== Pakistani athletes further achieved the entry standards, either by qualifying time or by world ranking, in the following track and field events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event): ;Track events {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Heat !colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal !colspan=\"2\"|Final |-style=\"font-size:95%\" !Time !Rank !Time !Rank !Time !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Najma Parveen |align=left|Women's 200 m | | | | | | |} ;Field events {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"2\"|Qualification !colspan=\"2\"|Final |- style=\"font-size:95%\" !Distance !Position !Distance !Position |-align=center |align=left|Arshad Nadeem |align=left|Men's javelin throw | | | | |} ==Equestrian== For the first time in history, Pakistan entered one eventing rider into the Olympic equestrian competition, by finishing in the top two, outside the group selection, of the individual FEI Olympic Rankings for Group F (Africa and Middle East). In September 2020, Azad Kashmir, who Khan rode when he qualified, died after suffering a severe heart attack.
