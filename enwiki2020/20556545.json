    "text": "Randolph E. Brooks (March 15, 1919 \u2013 March 21, 1967) was an American jazz trumpeter and bandleader. Brooks began on trumpet at age six, and by eleven was touring with Rudy Vallee. He then worked with Claude Thornhill, Bob Allen, Bernie Cummins, Art Jarrett, and Les Brown before founding his own band in 1944. John Benson Brooks (no relation) contributed arrangements to the ensemble, and Stan Getz played in it in 1946. Among his hits for Decca Records were \"Tenderly\", \"Harlem Nocturne\" and \"The Man With The Horn\", but his swing- based style and large ensemble were out of step with the times, and his success eroded toward the end of the decade. He married Ina Ray Hutton and moved to Los Angeles, where he suffered a stroke and was unable to continue as a musician. He died of smoke inhalation in a fire at his Sanford, Maine, apartment. He is buried in Oakdale Cemetery in Sanford, Maine, beside his parents. ==Discography== ===78rpm singles (all on Decca)=== *18697: I'D DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN (v: Billy Usher) // LAND OF THE LOON (v: Billy Usher) *18703: I'M GONNA LOVE THAT GUY (Like He's Never Been Loved Before) (with Marion Hutton) // NO MORE TOUJOURS L'AMOUR (Hoya, Hoya) (with Marion Hutton) *18713: A KISS GOODNIGHT (with Ella Fitzgerald) // BENNY'S COMING HOME ON SATURDAY (with Ella Fitzgerald) *18752: IN THE MOON MIST (v: Billy Usher) // DON'T LET ME DREAM (v: Billy Usher) *18844: HARLEM NOCTURNE (with Eddie Caine-alto sax) // THUNDER ROCK *18874: WITHOUT YOU (Tres Palabras) (v: Harry Prime) // STRANGE LOVE (v: Harry Prime) *18897: SURRENDER (v: Harry Prime) // ONE LOVE (v: Harry Prime) *23869: AFTER HOURS (with Sammy Price-piano) // TIPPIN' IN *23935: A NIGHT AT THE DEUCES // HARLEM NOCTURNE [reissue] *24161: TENDERLY // LAMPLIGHT (v: Harry Prime) *27205: HOLIDAY FOREVER (Brooks' theme song) // MORE THAN YOU KNOW *28532: AFTER HOURS [reissue] // TIPPIN' IN [reissue] *28533: THE MAN WITH THE HORN // SOMEBODY LOVES ME *29479: THUNDER ROCK [reissue] // HOW HIGH THE MOON ===Albums=== *Trumpet Moods (Decca DL-5446 [10\" LP], 1952) *Trumpet Moods (Decca DL-8201 [12\" LP], 1956) reissue with 4 tracks added on. ===CD compilation=== *The Issued Recordings 1945\u20131947 (Jazz Band EBCD-2149, 2000) ==References== *Scott Yanow, [ Randy Brooks] at Allmusic Category:1919 births Category:1967 deaths Category:American jazz trumpeters Category:American male trumpeters Category:American jazz bandleaders Category:Big band bandleaders Category:People from Sanford, Maine Category:20th-century American musicians Category:20th-century trumpeters Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:American male jazz musicians ",
