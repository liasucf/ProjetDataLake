    "text": "Kissinger Associates, Inc. is a New York City-based international geopolitical consulting firm, founded and run by Henry Kissinger since 1982. The firm assists its clients in identifying strategic partners and investment opportunities and advising them on government relations. ==History== The firm was founded in 1982 by Henry Kissinger. In 1999 Mack McLarty joined Kissinger to open Kissinger McLarty Associates, the firm's office on Eighteenth and Pennsylvania streets in Washington, D.C. McLarty was White House Chief of Staff under Bill Clinton. Kissinger McLarty is a corporate member of the Council of the Americas, the New York-based business organization established by David Rockefeller in 1965. As of January 2008, the two firms have separated and McLarty Associates, headed by Mack McLarty, is an independent firm based in Washington.http://www.maglobal.com maglobal.com Kissinger Associates is located in River House on Park Avenue at Fifty-first Street, in a building also occupied by Peter Peterson's Blackstone Group. It was established in July 1982 after loans had been secured from Goldman Sachs and a consortium of three other banks. These loans were repaid in two years; by 1987 annual revenues had reached $5 million.Isaacson, Kissinger, p.732. Kissinger Associates doesn\u2019t disclose its clients under U.S. lobbying laws. The firm once threatened to sue Congress to resist a subpoena for its client list. It has in the past advised American Express, Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, Daewoo, Midland Bank, H. J. Heinz, ITT Corporation, LM Ericsson, Fiat, and Volvo. But the firm does belong to the U.S.\u2013Russia Business Council, a trade group that includes ExxonMobil, JPMorgan Chase, and Pfizer. == Organization == ===Associated organizations=== Kissinger Associates has had strategic alliances with several firms, including: *APCO Worldwide, (October 12, 2004) *The Blackstone Group,,http://ir.aigcorporate.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=76115&p;=irol- newsArticle&ID;=231037&highlight; an investment and advisory firm *Hakluyt & Company, a strategic intelligence and advisory firm *Covington & Burling, international law firm (2003) === Prominent staff=== *L.

However, over time details from proxy statements and the tendency of senior businessmen to talk about their relationship with Kissinger have leaked out and a number of major corporate clients have been identified.Isaacson, Kissinger: A Biography, pp.730-751. The secrecy of their corporate client list has caused problems where Kissinger or a member of his staff were called to public service. In 1989, George H. W. Bush nominated Lawrence Eagleburger as his Deputy Secretary of State. Congress required that Eagleburger disclose the names of 16 clients, some of which were his through his Kissinger Associates affiliation. Later, Kissinger himself was appointed chairman of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States by George W. Bush. Congressional Democrats insisted that Kissinger disclose the names of clients. Kissinger and President Bush claimed that such disclosures were not necessary, but Kissinger ultimately stepped down, citing conflicts of interest.
