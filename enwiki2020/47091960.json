    "text": "Giovan Antonio Rusconi (c. 1500-05; \u2020 1578) was a Venetian architect, hydraulic engineer, translator and illustrator of Vitruvius. == Life == Della Architettvra. Illustration. Apart from being introduced into building and painting young Antonio Rusconi studied mathematics at the University of Padua under Giovanni Battista Memmo and Niccol\u00f2 Tartaglia. Extensively consulting Vitruvius\u2019 \"Ten Books on Architecture\" while he was constructing a novel type of watermill Antonio became aware of many grave technical errors within the work\u2019s early Renaissance editions and commentaries. Finally Pietro Lauro, who had rendered Leon Battista Alberti\u2019s \u201cDe Architectura\u201d into the vernacular, convinced Rusconi to set out with a translation of his own. The text was finished until 1552 and illustrated with more than three hundred supplementary woodcuts. Earlier, Rusconi had already provided the illustrations for Lodovico Dolce\u2019s version of the Ovidian \u201cMetamorphoses\u201d. Yet, since then countless treatises on architecture and commentaries on Vitruvius (e.g. by Daniele Barbaro, Gicaomo Vignola and Andrea Palladio) were being published, Rusconi\u2019s Venetian editors, Giolito and Tommaso Porcacchi, saw no benefit in printing another title on the subject. Together with Palladio Rusconi draughted the \"Palazzo municipale\" (Brescia) in 1562, they also took part in rebuilding the Doge's Palace after the fire of 1577 and constructing the Palazzo Grimani. Nevertheless throughout his life Rusconi\u2019s main occupation was that of a hydraulic engineer for the Republic of Venice. After having fallen gravely ill in 1575 Giovan Antonio died in 1579.Cf. Anna Bedon, Giovan Antonio Rusconi: illustratore di Vitruvio, artista, ingegnere, architetto, in: Della Architettura di Gio[van]Antonio Rusconi, Centro Internazionale di Studi di Architettura Andrea Palladio di Vicenza, Testi e fonti per la storia dell\u2019architettura, Verona, Vicenza 1996, pp. IX\u2013XXI; Louis Cellauro, La biblioteca di un architetto del Rinascimento la raccolta di libri di Giovanni Antonio Rusconi, in: Arte Veneta 58 (2001), pp. 224\u2013237. == Rusconi's \"Della Architettura\" == Rusconi\u2019s \u201cVitruvius\u201d was only printed after his death in 1590 by the son of his former editor Giolito. Although the latter recognised the value of Giovan Antonio\u2019s xylographies he considered his translation and annotations as outdated, and thus a strange \u201cVitruvius without Vitruvius\u201c was published:Cf. Bedon 1996, p. XII: \u201equesta strana edizione vitruviana senza Vitruvio, senza traduzione, senza autore.\u201c Just about 160 of originally 300 woodcuts were compiled with extracts from Fra Giocondo\u2019s and Cesariano\u2019s translations of Vitruvius\u2019 treatise. For many of Rusconi\u2019s illustrations containing references to textual explanations, it is particularly regrettable that his translation has hence been lost.Cf.
