    "text": "The voiced velar fricative is a type of consonantal sound that is used in various spoken languages. It is not found in Modern English but existed in Old English. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , a Latinized variant of the Greek letter gamma, , which has this sound in Modern Greek. It should not be confused with the graphically- similar , the IPA symbol for a close-mid back unrounded vowel, which some writingsSuch as and . use for the voiced velar fricative. The symbol is also sometimes used to represent the velar approximant, which, however, is more accurately written with the lowering diacritic: or . The IPA also provides a dedicated symbol for a velar approximant, , but there can be stylistic reasons to avoid using it in phonetic transcription. There is also a voiced post-velar fricative, also called pre-uvular, in some languages. For the voiced pre-velar fricative, also called post-palatal, see voiced palatal fricative. ==Features== Features of the voiced velar fricative: ==Occurrence== Some of the consonants listed as post-velar may actually be trill fricatives. {| class=\"wikitable\" !colspan=2| Language !!
