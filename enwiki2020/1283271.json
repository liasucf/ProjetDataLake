The first phase, between Plaza Once and Caseros, opened 18 October 2007, currently stretches over 8.8 km between Hospitales and Facultad de Derecho stations.L\u00ednea H \u2013 Buenos Aires Ciudad It is the first entirely new line built in Buenos Aires since the opening of Line E on 20 June 1944. 300px According to projections, the line will stretch a total of about 11.85 km and will run from between Retiro to S\u00e1enz once the remaining sections are constructed. It connects the southern part of the city with the north, improving the flow to the centre of the city. It is also designed to serve as a transversal line and provide cross- connections across all radial lines, mainly under the axis of Jujuy and Pueyrred\u00f3n avenues. == Rolling stock == The 300 Series (right) replaced the temporary Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein & Koppel stock (left). During its early years, Line H was served by a temporary fleet of refurbished and original vintage Siemens-Schuckert Orenstein & Koppel train sets originally introduced on line C, with electric current supplied by overhead lines. The cars featured 42 seats and 4 doors per side.La L\u00ednea C Subterr\u00e1neos de Buenos Aires (SBASE) (Spanish) \u2013 Retrieved 2010-11-29 As the line was extended and passenger numbers increased, the rolling stock was replaced by new Alsom 300 Series units ordered from that company in 2012 in order to make up the entirety of the Line's rolling stock. The first 6 of the 120 new Alstom cars arrived In August 2015, with the remainder being gradually phased-in since then, as the line has been extended.Licitan inspecci\u00f3n t\u00e9cnica de coches Alstom para la l\u00ednea H \u2013 EnElSubte, January 2015As\u00ed son los nuevos trenes Alstom para la l\u00ednea H \u2013 EnElSubte, 2015-03-25Llegaron al pa\u00eds seis coches nuevos con aire acondicionado para la l\u00ednea H \u2013 La Nacion, 27 August 2015. ==Further expansion== Las Heras station before its inauguration.

The Facultad de Derecho station (located at the University of Buenos Aires Faculty of Law) was originally intended to be located across the road next to Plaza Francia, however concerns that it would damage the prestigious Recoleta Cemetery necessitated the revisal of these plans and therefore delayed construction of the station, which eventually opened in May 2018.Nuevos retrasos en la extensi\u00f3n de la l\u00ednea H \u2013 EnElSubte, February 2015 The final stretch to Retiro is not set to open until some time after since its trajectory must also be revised following the relocation of the Plaza Francia station. == Chronology == {| class=\"wikitable\" !
