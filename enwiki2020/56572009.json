Peter Feld joined Smith and Mitchell in 2005. Starboard Value merged with the Cowen Group in 2008, and was Cowen's hedge- fund until 2011, when it went independent. Smith, Mitchell, and Feld all stayed with Starboard.Butt, Rachel; Here are the 10 biggest activist money managers and some of their most impressive bets; Business Insider; June 17, 2016; http://nordic.businessinsider.com/top-10-biggest-activist- investors-2016-6?r=US&IR;=T == Structure == Starboard has a five-member board of directors. As of February 2019, the five directors were John Leonard, chief executive officer of Intellia Therapeutics; Jeffrey Smith, Starboard's own chief executive officer; Janet Vergis, chairman of the board at Amneal Pharmaceuticals; James Tyree, chairman of Tyree & D'Angelo Partners; and Steven Shulman, managing partner of Shulman Family Ventures. ==Investments and activist campaigns== In 2011, Starboard won seats on the boards of SurModics, a maker of biopharmaceuticals, and Regis, a chain of hair-cutting salons. In December 2011, Starboard sought to gain seats on AOL's board, charging that the firm's CEO, Tim Armstrong, was \"wasting money by funding the losses at Patch, a network of local-news websites,\" and calling on Armstrong to \"return to shareholders much of the more than $1 billion it received from the sale of its patents to Microsoft in 2012.\" Although Starboard lost a proxy battle six months later, Armstrong followed Starboard's advice, spinning off Patch and returning the $1 billion from Microsoft to its shareholders. Consequently, the value of Starboard's AOL stock more than doubled.Cohan, William D.; Starboard Value's Jeff Smith: The investor CEOs fear most; Fortune; December 3, 2014; http://fortune.com/2014/12/03/starboard-capitals-jeff-smith-activist-investor- darden-restaurants/ After accumulating a 15% stake in Office Depot, Starboard asked for its CEO, Neil Austrian, to be fired, and urged that the firm complete its merger with Office Max.

Cohan of Fortune Magazine described as a \"brilliantly executed campaign\" involving \"withering public criticism\" of the firm's leadership and \"careful courtship\" of its major shareholders, Smith effectively took control of Darden Restaurants, a Fortune 500 company that owns Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse.Cohan, William D.; Starboard Value's Jeff Smith: The investor CEOs fear most; Fortune; December 3, 2014; http://fortune.com/2014/12/03/starboard-capitals-jeff-smith-activist- investor-darden-restaurants/ Among Smith's criticisms was that the pasta at Olive Garden was inadequately salted.Butt, Rachel; Here are the 10 biggest activist money managers and some of their most impressive bets; Business Insider; June 17, 2016; http://nordic.businessinsider.com/top-10-biggest- activist-investors-2016-6?r=US&IR;=T On the HBO program Last Week Tonight, host John Oliver did a three-minute comedy bit based on Starboard's presentation. As of February 1, 2018, it had been seen by nearly four million viewers. While owning less than 10% of the firm, Smith replaced the entire board and became Darden's chairman. By doing so, wrote Cohan, Smith \"fired a shot over the bows of directors everywhere,\" informing them that shareholders were now in the ascendant, and \"managers ignore them at their peril.\" According to Cohan, \"the scope of Smith's triumph with Darden has left jaws hanging open across Wall Street and beyond. Only in a handful of times in the past few years has an activist managed to replace an entire board of directors, and never at a company the size of Darden.\"Cohan, William D.; Starboard Value's Jeff Smith: The investor CEOs fear most; Fortune; December 3, 2014; http://fortune.com/2014/12/03/starboard-capitals-jeff-smith-activist- investor-darden-restaurants/ After Starboard took over Darden, its stock went up by almost 60%.Butt, Rachel; Here are the 10 biggest activist money managers and some of their most impressive bets; Business Insider; June 17, 2016; http://nordic.businessinsider.com/top-10-biggest-activist- investors-2016-6?r=US&IR;=T ==Profitability== From 2002 to 2014, Starboard generated annualized returns of 15.5%.
