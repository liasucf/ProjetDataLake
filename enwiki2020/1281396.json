The Billboard Liberation Front practices culture jamming via altering billboards by changing key words to radically alter the message, often to an anti-corporate message. It started in San Francisco in 1977. Advertising executives informed Jill Posener, author of Spray it Loud (1982), that the executives designed billboards to attract attacks because the changes drew attention to the products. The BLF were aware of this possibility and considered invoicing advertisers including Chiat Day for the BLF's work. In 2013, Complex Magazine named the BLF #27 of The 50 Most Influential Street Artists of All Time. == Cooperation == The BLF cooperated with a range of other art groups, like Guerrilla Girls,Lo Down Magazine, \"Billboard Liberation Front and Guerrilla Girls, Pump Up the Jam\" monochrommonochrom and BLF: Great Firewall of China, on Boing Boing TV, 2008 and Joey Skaggs. ==See also== *Billboard Utilising Graffitists Against Unhealthy Promotions == References == ==External links== * Billboard Liberation Front Creative Group * Interview with Jack Napier of the Billboard Liberation Front * Interview with Jack Napier on Bombing science *San Francisco Chronicle *Salon.com *Adweek *LA Weekly Category:Cacophony Society Category:Culture jamming Category:Anti-consumerist groups Category:Graffiti in the United States Category:1977 establishments in California Category:Organizations based in San Francisco Category:Culture of San Francisco ",
