It is protected by the heritage listing Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural. ==History== Archeological research shows that the building was originally constructed as a mosque in the 10th century,\"El Consorcio vuelve a mostrar el \u00abPatrimonio Desconocido\u00bb\" on: ABC.es (06-11-2007) and enlarged in the 11th century. The mosque was called Al-Dabbagin,The existence of the Al-Dabbagin mosque is attested by a short reference by Ibn Baskuwal (1101-83) reported by Fath ibn Ibrahim. see: Actas de las i jornadas de Cultura Isl\u00e1mica, Toledo, Instituto Occidental de Cultura Isl\u00e1mica (ed.) 1987, p. 158 sometimes transliterated as Adabaqu\u00edn. It was close to the former city gate called \"Bab-al-Dabbagin\" also known by its Spanish name as \"Puerta de los Curtidores\" (English translation: gate of the tanners). It was also close to the baths now known by the Spanish name Ba\u00f1os de Tener\u00edas. Some time after Toledo was reconquered in 1085 the building became a church, belonging to one of six parishes where Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile permitted the use of the Mozarabic rite.\"Iglesias Desaparecidas\" (retrieved on December 1, 2008) The architectural reconstruction dates from the late 12th or 13th century. ==Architecture== The church as it now remains shows the characteristics of the Mud\u00e9jar architectural style, with rich Arabic decorations. The tower of the church shows characteristics of the former minaret that stood in its place and is from the 15th century.Matilde Revuelta Tubino, Inventario Artistico de Toledo, Madrid, Centro Nacional de Informaciones Art\u00edstica, 1983-89, p.320 == Concert Hall and Museum == Since 1916 in the hands of the Consorcio de Toledo, the building is used as a Concert Hall and center for expositions of contemporary artists. 2017 the Spanish artist Lita Mora showed her installation about Dante's Inferno and 2018 the Consorcio of Toledo organized the exhibition of Swiss artist Daniel Garbade: \"In Bed with Greco and Picasso\".
