    "text": "Baker Channel, also known as Calen Inlet, is a channel of Chile located in the Tortel, Ays\u00e9n del General Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo Region. The Baker River discharges into Martinez Inlet, the northern part of this large estuary. It penetrates the mainland about and opens into Tarn Bay at the south-east corner of the Gulf of Penas. Merino Jarpa Island lies wholly within this great estuary, while at its mouth lies a group of smaller islands, called Baker Islands, which separate it from Messier Channel. Baker Channel also receives the waters of the O'Higgins/San Mart\u00edn Lake through the Pascua River. The lake's far-reaching fjord-like arms extend approximately from lat. 49\u00b0 11' to 48\u00b0 22' S. Its north-west arm is that which drains into the mentioned river. The calving front of Jorge Montt Glacier, which is the northern glacier of the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, reaches the Baker Channel. A number of icebergs can be seen in this area. The channel marks the northern border of the Bernardo O'Higgins National Park, and is home to the Katalalixar National Reserve on Merino Jarpa Island. ==See also== *Caleta Tortel *Guayaneco Archipelago *Northern Patagonian Ice Field ==References== Category:Straits of Chile Category:Landforms of Ays\u00e9n Region ",
