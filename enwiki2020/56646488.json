Parks is most known for her fan art pieces Doctor Mew (Doctor Whos the Doctor as cats) and The Catvengers (the Avengers also as cats) and her books Star Trek Cats and Star Trek: The Next Generation Cats. ==Background== Parks started drawing cat versions of people since about age 11 or 12. Around 12, she loved The Phantom of the Opera and had a running gag about The Phantom of the Cats. Eventually, she drew the characters as cats. A few years later, Parks became obsessed with the British television series Doctor Who. Around 2008, Parks began drawing more realistic Doctor Who cats. Parks has a Bachelor's degree (BFA) in Illustration from the California College of Arts and a graduate degree in scientific illustration from the UC Santa Cruz. Previously, Parks drew wildlife like big cats, birds, dinosaurs, fruit bats, insects, and plants. Her work can be found via iPhone apps for the National Park Service. Parks would regularly attend conventions as C2E2, San Diego Comic-Con, and WonderCon. Parks' art is drawn and painted digitally via Paint Tool SAI and Photoshop. Parks creates her art digitally with a Cintiq graphics tablet via Photoshop. Her fan art career took off with a table at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con where she had Doctor Mew buttons and posters as well as when Doctor Mew went viral. Parks became famous due to Doctor Mew. Later, Parks created other fan art pieces as The Catvengers. Doctor Mew represented her most prominent work until Star Trek Cats in 2017. In March 2018, Star Trek Cats was followed-up with Star Trek: The Next Generation Cats. Parks also has a Patreon account. ==Works== East German Interkosmos cosmonaut. ===Books=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! Title ! Publisher !
