He is Professor of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Cambridge, and a fellow of King's College, Cambridge. His research is primarily in partial differential equations and mathematical physics (statistical mechanics, Boltzmann equation, Vlasov equation). ==Biography== Mouhot obtained his PhD in 2004 under the supervision of Cedric Villani at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon. Since 2011, he is Associate editor of Acta Applicandae Mathematicae and of the Journal of Statistical Physics. Since 2012, he is Co-Editor-in-chief of the ESAIM Proceedings. Since 2014 he is Associate editor of Communications in Mathematical Physics. His work \"On Landau damping\" with Villani (published in 2011) was quoted in the Fields Medal laudation of Villani in 2010. In 2013, his work \u201cKac\u2019s program in kinetic theory\u201d with Mischler was the subject of a S\u00e9minaire Bourbaki. In 2014 he was awarded the Whitehead Prize. and the \"Grand Prix Madame Victor Noury\" of the French \"Acad\u00e9mie des sciences\". He has won the 2015/2016 Adams Prize writing on the subject Applied Analysis. In 2018, Mouhot helped organise a letter protesting Noah Carl's appointment to a fellowship at St Edmund's College, with Mouhot and other signatories describing Carl's work on genetics and race as pseudoscience. ==References== Category:French mathematicians Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Cambridge mathematicians Category:Whitehead Prize winners Category:Fellows of King's College, Cambridge ",
