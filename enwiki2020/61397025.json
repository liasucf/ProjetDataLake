    "text": "The South Australian Railways F Class (1st) Locomotives were built in 1869 by Avonside Engine Co of Bristol, England. No. 21 was in service for the South Australian Railways by September 1869 followed by No. 22 in October 1869. The career of the South Australian Railways first F class were unfortunately cut short due to hornplates not being used while they were lifted by a workshop crane in 1892, thus the frames on both the locomotives were broken beyond repair and made unserviceable. ==History== The F class locomotives were introduced to the South Australian Railways in 1869. They took over working goods trains from the A class locomotives on the new Roseworthy to Tarlee line. Eventually these locomotives were utilised on other lines on the SAR network, pulling passenger and goods trains. Near the end of the unfortunate short working life of these locomotives they were relegated to various yards on the network for shunting duties, until condemned in 1892 after ignorance during lifting these locomotives during a rebuild of both locomotives. ==References== F Category:Broad gauge locomotives in Australia Category:Avonside locomotives Category:4-4-0T locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1869 ",
