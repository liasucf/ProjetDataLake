    "text": "Scott Wexton, also known by his stage name Voodoo Organist, is an American vocalist and keyboardist. He has also served as a member of the noise rock/post-hardcore group Today Is the Day and as a founding member of the band Batterie:Acid. Since 2001, he has recorded solo work and performed under the name Voodoo Organist. He is currently living in Yucca Valley, California where he runs a comic retailer named HooDoo. ==Biography== Scott Wexton was born in Detroit, Michigan and began playing the organ at the age of ten as a Catholic altar boy. He started Tribe in Detroit with percussionist Christopher Gwizdala in 1991. The duo expanded its membership to five members and became Batterie:Acid in 1992. Their releases were limited to several hundred pressings on cassette tape. The group dissolved in 1995 and Wexton moved to Nashville where he was recruited to play the sampler in Today Is the Day with singer/guitarist Steve Austin and drummer Brad Elrod. He recorded on album with them, the self-titled Today Is the Day album released in 1996. In 2001, Wexton had a near death experience when he began bleeding internally and was rushed to the emergency room, where he was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. The episode affected Wexton, who became aware of his own mortality and his need to express his individual musical creativity. He quit his day job and began a solo musical project called Voodoo Organist, booking two consecutive tours for himself and composing an album's worth of material. == Discography == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=\"33\"| Year ! width=\"110\"| Artist ! width=\"170\"| Album ! width=\"140\"| Label |- |align=\"center\"| 1993 | rowspan=\"2\"| Batterie:Acid | Atazir | rowspan=\"2\"| Anathemus |- |align=\"center\"| 1994 | re:evolution now\u2022here |- |align=\"center\"| 1996 | Today Is the Day | Today Is the Day | Amphetamine Reptile |- |align=\"center\"| 2002 | rowspan=\"8\"| Voodoo Organist | Exotic Demonic Blues | Witch Doctor |- |align=\"center\"| 2003 | The Return of the Voodoo Organist | rowspan=\"2\"| Dead Teenager |- |align=\"center\"| 2005 | Holy Ghost Town |- |align=\"center\"| 2006 | The Serpent Dance | rowspan=\"5\"| Voodoo Man Music |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 2008 | This Burning Hell |- | Darwin Dance Hall Days |- |align=\"center\"| 2012 | Organeddon! |- |align=\"center\"| 2013 | Vampire Empire |- |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Living people Category:Musicians from California Category:Musicians from Detroit Category:American rock keyboardists Category:American heavy metal keyboardists Category:Today Is the Day members Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
