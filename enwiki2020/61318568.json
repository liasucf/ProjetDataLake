It is located on the rue de Metz (RN3) roundabout at the west entrance of the city. The history of this mansion is closely related to the industrial past of the city. Built in 1766 for Jean-Charles de Wendel and his wife Anne Marguerite d'Hausen de Weidesheim, it was at that time located near the forge the de Wendel had erected a few years before (1758\u201359). The ch\u00e2teau (as well as the forge) stayed in the d\u2019Hausen family until 1882, when it was acquired by the Gouvy family.This family, originally from Sarrebruck, had repurchased the foundry in 1850. After the Second World War, the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Hausen came under the ownership of the HBL, the state coal corporation in Lorraine, and served as the corporation board's seat until 1996. The Ch\u00e2teau d'Hausen was inscribed on the list \"Inventaire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral du patrimoine culturel\" in 1987.Data sheet of the inscription (M\u00e9rim\u00e9e database). In 2003, the city purchased the building and converted it for use as the town hall. ==References== ==External links== * Official website of the city. * Tourist office.
