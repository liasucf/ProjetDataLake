It is located near the village of Ond\u0159ejov, southeast of Prague, Czech Republic. It has a wide telescope, which is the largest in the Czech Republic. ==History== The facility was constructed in 1898, by Czech amateur astronomer and entrepreneur Josef Jan Fri\u010d as a private observatory. On 28 October 1928, he donated the facility to the Czechoslovak state to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its independence.Dorschner, J., & L\u00f6ffler, G., Astronomy, a Popular History, (New York City: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1975). The observatory, located at an altitude of , away from the air and light pollution of urban Prague, was administered by Charles University until the founding of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences in 1953, which from then on operated it as part of its Astronomical Institute in conjunction with other Czechoslovak observatories. In 1967, a telescope measuring in width was added to the observatory, which at that time was the 7th largest telescope in the world. Now it is the largest telescope in the Czech Republic and is in the second hundred in the world. It has been responsible, among other scientific achievements, for the discovery of numerous asteroids; more recent works of astronomers from Ond\u0159ejov include examination of the trajectory and origin of the Chelyabinsk meteor. More than 700 minor planets have been discovered at this observatory. While most of these discoveries are officially credited to the astronomers who discovered them, a remaining 23 minor planets are directly credited to \"Ondrejov\" (the observatory itself) by the Minor Planet Center for the period 1997\u20132008. The main-belt asteroid 7204 Ond\u0159ejov, discovered by Petr Pravec in 1995, was named for the village where the observatory is located. {| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"font-size: 0.9em; width: 270px;\" |+ Minor planets discovered: 23 |- | see |} == List of discovered minor planets == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 89%; float: left; width: 25em; margin- right: 1em; line-height: 1.65em !important; height: 324px;\" |- | 31139 Garnavich || 25 September 1997|| |- | 37788 Suchan || 25 September 1997|| |- | 42924 Betlem || 2 October 1999|| |- | 42981 Jenniskens || 2 October 1999|| |- | 53285 Mojm\u00edr || 24 March 1999|| |- | 76713 Wudia || 6 May 2000|| |- | 82559 Emilb\u0159ezina || 28 July 2001|| |- | || 26 August 2001|| |- | || 28 September 2002|| |- | || 28 July 2001|| |- | 127196 Hanaceplechov\u00e1 || 16 April 2002|| |- | || 29 July 2001|| |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 89%; float: left; width: 25em; margin-right: 1em; line-height: 1.65em !important; height: 297px;\" |- | || 26 April 2000|| |- | || 16 February 1999|| |- | || 8 March 2002|| |- | || 23 September 1999|| |- | || 15 August 2001|| |- | || 5 November 2008|| |- | || 14 October 2001|| |- | || 19 September 2001|| |- | || 12 October 2001|| |- | || 6 November 2008|| |- | || 2 December 1999|| |} == Gallery == File:Ond\u0159ejov Astro Solar radio telescope1.jpg|Ten-meter solar flux monitor at Ond\u0159ejov.
