He has been called a \"master of the graphic translation of complex cultural ideas\"Poynor, Rick. \"The Woman Who Took on the Wolf Man,\" Eye Magazine #83 (2012). The Wolf Man: Graphic Freud is an illustrated narrative of one of Sigmund Freud's most famous case studies and founding text of modern psychoanalysis.

Two books in the series, Postmodernism for Beginners/Introducing Postmodernism and Introducing Learning and Memory were co-authored with Ziauddin Sardar.\"Our Books: Introducing,\" Icon Books website. Accessed Jan. 10, 2015. === Novels === Appignanesi has written four novels, the first three of which were published as a fiction trilogy, Italia Perversa, consisting of the novels Stalin's Orphans, The Mosque, and Destroying America, originally drafted in 1967, saw light in the early 1980s. The trilogy is epic in the scale of its locations \u2013 Vienna, Zagreb, Italy while its Quebecois protagonist's travels are ultimately fated to ominous disillusionment through his separatist terrorism. However, Appignanesi's demanding and highly literate prose, in contrast to the generally well received approachable style of the illustrated texts, produced ambivalent reviews. It has been described as \"A tour of twentieth century European culture with inescapable echoes of Musil, Svevo and Kafka. . . . A fretful, nervous brilliance playing over much of the book a piece of infinite fascination, the sort of novel which, for all its faults, jerks us out of our provincialism.\"Keates, Jonathan. The Observer Review (June 30, 1985). And \"Literary devices and ambitions almost bury this 1967 saga . . . [but] . . . discussions are interesting and Mr. Appignanesi's descriptive skills are considerable.\"MacDonald, Sandy. \"In Short: Fiction,\" New York Times (November 23, 1986). Almost two decades later Appignanesi published Yukio Mishima's Report to the Emperor, a fictional autobiography of the Japanese poet, novelist, playwright, film director, actor and bodybuilder Yukio Mishima (1925\u20131970), one of the most important Japanese literary and artistic figures of the 20th century as well as an extreme-right activist. Appignanesi's novel is set predominantly in post-World War II reconstruction Japan and in Benares, India. Its narrative builds up to Mishima's horrific ritual suicide by seppuku that accompanied his failed right-wing coup against the Japanese government. The novel explores some of the more malignant recesses of Japanese society and culture. Its tone is one of a dark magical realism and the protagonist's journey traverses a variety of grotesque and horrific, yet often lyrically rendered landscapes. Penny Mountain, in the UK trade journal The Bookseller, wrote, \"This formidable literary achievement [\u2026] In this fictional autobiography, Appignanesi . . . imagines in macabre, shocking and often comic detail the life and suicide of the extraordinary Japanese writer\u2026\"Mountain, Penny. The Bookseller (8 February 2002). === Monographs === What Do Existentialists Believe? is an introduction to existentialism through a series of \"thought experiments\" about what it means to view our being human existentially.

Axis Enigma,Act 3, Endgames, Pluto Press (London, 1997). is a comparative study of Fassbinder, Mishima and Pasolini, three tragically gifted writers from defeated Fascist countries, linked by a common \"axis,\" the aesthetic of sadism. === Poetry === A volume of poetry,The Street to Damascus, was published in 1972. == Curatorships == Appignanesi co-curated with Juliet Steyn Pretext: Heteronyms, a Rear Window art exhibition of 21 artists responding to Fernando Pessoa's heteronymic personae, at Clink Street Studios, in London, in 1995. The exhibition, retitled Heteronymous, transferred in 1997 to the Palazzo San Michele a Ripa in Rome. It was co-curated by Appignanesi, Juliet Steyn, Achille Bonito Oliva, and Anna Maria Nassisi.
