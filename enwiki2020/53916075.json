It is subtitled ' (fairy-tale opera in one act) and has been called a satirical fairy-tale opera. == History == A note to the press by the publisher Universal Editio (UE), probably from the end of 1927 and entitled ' (A cycle of one-acters) announces that Ernst Krenek composed three one-act operas after the success of Jonny spielt auf, to be premiered together at the Festspiele Wiesbaden of 1928. Das geheime K\u00f6nigreich is listed as the second of the three, and described as a satirical fairy-tale (Satirisches M\u00e4rchen). The premiere of the three operas was part of the Mai-Festwoche at the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden on 6 May 1928. It was the first festival after 1914. == Roles == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Role !Voice type !Premiere cast, 6 May 1928 Conductor: Joseph Rosenstock\"Die Mai-Festwochen in Wiesbaden\", Wiesbadener Bade-Blatt, 8 Mai 1928, p. 1 (for all the cast) PDFlink= |- | King | baritone | Herr (Karl) K\u00f6ther |- | Queen | coloratura soprano | Frl.

The opera was coupled with Erich Korngold's Der Ring des Polykrates at the L\u00fcbeck Opera in 2012. A reviewer described the music as intellectual and musical fireworks (\"intellektuelles und musikalisches Feuerwerk\"), with music at the same time ambitious and effective. He notes similarities to Shakespeare's The Tempest and Mozart's Die Zauberfl\u00f6te, with a King who wants to resign after a revolution, and his Jester, and a Queen who falls in love with a revolutionary leader, and is turned into a tree. The same year, it was performed at the Semperoper in Dresden. A reviewer notes the stories ending about the divinity of a simple creature, and the more complex and darker dimensions (\"komplexere, dunklere Dimension\") below this surface. The opera was performed, along with its companion pieces by the Oper Frankfurt on 30 April 2017, entitled Drei Opern (Three operas). The stage director, David Hermann, placed it at the end of the evening, making the King the person who started as the Dictator in the first opera. The conductor was Lothar Zagrosek. == References == == Literature == * Stewart, John, Ernst Krenek, The Man and His Music, University of California Press, 1991. * Das geheime K\u00f6nigreich / M\u00e4rchenoper in einem Akt, Opera Guide * Matthew Lynch: Krenek's neglected opera Das geheime K\u00f6nigreich brought to life in Dresden, bachtrack.com 28 October 2012 == External links == * Drei Opern, Oper Frankfurt * Bernhard Uske: Der Diktator h\u00e4lt sich fit / Ernst Kreneks disparates Opern-Triptychon in Frankfurt plausibel pr\u00e4sentiert.
