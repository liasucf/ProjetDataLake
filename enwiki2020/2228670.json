Alvarado was born in Ciudad de la Esperanza, Intibuc\u00e1, but later lived in Gracias a Dios in the department of Lempira, where he worked as a surveyor. There he became a judge of first instance and Jefe Pol\u00edtico of Gracias. He was a member of the Constituent Assembly and was elected President of this Parliament. On 26 October 1838 under the provincial government of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Martinez Salinas, the province of Honduras had declared itself a separate state. Francisco Ferrera, led the party of the federal government under Jos\u00e9 Francisco Moraz\u00e1n Quezada and resisted the separation. On 5 April 1839 his troops were defeated by Nicaragua and to the troops of Moraz\u00e1n in the battle of Espiritu Santo in El Salvador. On 25 September 1839, at San Pedro Perulap\u00e1n, the troops of Honduras surprised Francisco Ferrera, who was wounded and fled to Nicaragua. Although Alvarado stated that he withdrew for reasons of health, the political and military pressure from Moraz\u00e1n contributed to it. He died in Gracias. ==Sources== *http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Honduras.htm *German Wikipedia Category:1798 births Category:1857 deaths Category:People from Intibuc\u00e1 Department Category:Honduran people of Spanish descent Category:Presidents of Honduras Category:19th-century Honduran people ",
