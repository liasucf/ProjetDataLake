The most successful stage show in Saskatchewan history, Paper Wheat opened in Sintaluta, Saskatchewan on May 18, 1977 and subsequently played to full houses across the province and nation. Paper Wheat was an example of documentary theatre, with company members traveling to local communities to collect stories about Saskatchewan history. ==Film== A Prairie tour of the play was filmed by National Film Board of Canada filmmaker Albert Kish (in 1979), as one of the last films in its Challenge for Change series. ==References== ==External links== *Watch Paper Wheat at NFB.ca Category:Canadian plays Category:1979 films Category:National Film Board of Canada films Category:Documentary films about theatre Category:Culture of Saskatchewan Category:Films set in Saskatchewan Category:Docudrama plays Category:Historical plays Category:Plays set in Canada Category:Documentary films about agriculture Category:1977 plays ",
