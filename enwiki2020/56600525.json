    "text": "Gozdawa coat of arms.Jan of the Gozdawa coat of arms (???-1227) was bishop of P\u0142ock from 1225 to 1227. After the death of Bishop Gedka in 1223, the P\u0142ock Cathedral chapter were at an impasse in the choice of his successor. Some supported Jan, the others Gunter. This resulted in a two-year vacancy on the episcopal capital which ended with the resignation of Gunter and appointment Jan in 1225. Little is known about Jan himself. Jan D\u0142ugosz merely calls him in his catalog of the P\u0142ock Bishops an excellent and prudent bishop. ==References== Category:Year of birth unknown Category:13th-century births Category:1227 deaths Category:13th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Medieval Polish nobility Category:13th-century Polish people ",
