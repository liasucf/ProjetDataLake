    "text": "Marie Vieux-Chauvet (September 16, 1916 \u2013 June 19, 1973) was a Haitian novelist, poet and playwright. Born and educated in Port-au-Prince, she is most famous works for the novels Fille d'Ha\u00efti (1954), La Danse sur le Volcan (1957), Fonds des N\u00e8gres (1961), and Amour, Col\u00e8re, Folie (1969). She was also published under her maiden name, Marie Vieux. ==Family history== Marie Vieux- Chauvet was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on September 16, 1916, to Constant Vieux, a Haitian politician, and his wife Delia Nones, a woman originally from the Virgin Islands. Marie completed her studies at the l'Annexe de l'\u00c9cole Normale d'Institutrices and obtained a degree in elementary education in 1933. She married Aymon Charlier, a doctor, then divorced him. She later married Pierre Chauvet, a travel agent. ==Work== Vieux-Chauvet's works focus on class, color, race, gender, family structure and the upheaval of Haitian political, economic and social society during the United States occupation of Haiti and dictatorship of Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier. Although she lived under heavy surveillance during Duvalier's dictatorship, Vieux-Chauvet persisted as a writer, hosting meetings of the Les Araign\u00e9es du Soir (Evening Spiders), a group of poets and writers of which she was the only female. Vieux-Chauvet sent a trilogy of novellas to France to be published as a single book titled Amour, Col\u00e8re, Folie (Love, Anger, Madness). The trilogy Amour, Col\u00e8re, Folie was published in 1968 by the prestigious publishing house Gallimard in Paris with the support of Simone de Beauvoir. The trilogy was perceived as an attack on the Haitian dictator Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier. Fearing the dictator's legions of Tonton Macoutes, her husband bought all the copies of the book he could find in Haiti, and Vieux-Chauvet's daughters bought the remaining copies from Gallimard a few years later. She moved to New York City, where she worked as a housekeeper, and she remarried. She died of brain cancer in the United States on June 19, 1973. Extracts from her work appear in the anthologies Her True- True NamePamela Mordecai and Elizabeth Wilson (eds), Her True-True Name, Heinemann, 1989. and Daughters of Africa.Margaret Busby (ed.), Daughters of Africa, London: Jonathan Cape, 1992. An English translation of Amour, Col\u00e8re, Folie (Love, Anger, Madness) by Rose-Myriam R\u00e9jouis and Val Vinokur was published in 2009 with an introduction by Haitian-American writer Edwige Danticat. ==Literary awards== *1954 Prix de l'Alliance Fran\u00e7aise for Fille d'Ha\u00efti *1960 Prix France-Antilles for Fonds des N\u00e8gres *1986 Prix Deschamps (posthumous), for Amour, Col\u00e8re et Folie ==Bibliography== ===Novels=== *Fille d'Ha\u00efti (Paris: Fasquelle, 1954; Paris: Zellige, 2014) *La Danse sur le Volcan (Paris: Plon, 1957; Paris / L\u00e9chelle: Maisonneuve & Larose / Emina Soleil, 2004 (reprint with a preface by Catherine Hermary-Vieille); L\u00e9chelle: Zellige, 2008, 2009) Translated into English by Salvator Attanasio as Dance on the Volcano (New York: William Sloane Associates, 1959) *Fonds des N\u00e8gres (Port- au-Prince: Henri Deschamps, 1960) *Amour, Col\u00e8re et Folie (Paris: Gallimard, 1968; Paris / L\u00e9chelle: Maisonneuve & Larose / Emina Soleil, 2005; L\u00e9chelle: Zellige, 2007, 2011; Paris: Zulma, 2015) *Les Rapaces (Port-au-Prince: Deschamps, 1986) ===Plays=== *La L\u00e9gende des Fleurs (Port-au-Prince: Henri Deschamps, 1947; Port-au-Prince: \u00c9ditions Marie Vieux, 2009) *Samba (produced around 1948 in Port-au-Prince.
