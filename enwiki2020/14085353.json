In 2010, former model Ann Kirsten Kennis filed suit against Vampire Weekend and Mr. Brody claiming misuse of the image which she said she believed to be a Polaroid taken by her mother. Her attorney later recanted that claim, saying they didn\u2019t know what the origin of the photo was. Vampire Weekend then filed suit against Mr. Brody who later filed a counter suit against the band. After the initial filings and interrogatories, negotiations continued and ultimately, the suits were settled out of court when Vampire Weekend paid an undisclosed figure to Ms. Kennis. Mr Brody ultimately was not party to the cash settlement. Mr. Brody was initially represented by the Los Angeles law firm Lavely & Singer and later by Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. In Mr. Brody\u2019s initial answer to the suit he provided detailed information about the taking of the photo, including information about Ms. Kennis, who simply went by the name \u201cKirsten\u201d as a model. All litigation by all parties in the Vampire Weekend case was dismissed by Judge Valerie Baker Fairbank of the United States District Court for the Central District of California on August 12, 2011, after the suit was settled out of court. == Awards == In 1997, the Producers & Executive Producers of Marvin's Room. received a Christopher Award.
