    "text": "The National Chiao Tung University School of Law (\"NCTU Law\") began as the \"Intellectual Property Management\" Program in 1993, and then the Institute of Technology Law (ITL) in 2000. The ITL was transformed into the School of Law in 2015. NCTU Law is a postgraduate law school at National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan. Its programs award advanced degrees including master's degrees as well as doctorate degrees. It is a postgraduate professional school, aiming to provide legal training for students already having bachelor's or more advanced degrees, and focuses on a cross- disciplinary legal education environment. Of note, NCTU Law stands out as one of the few law schools in Taiwan that teaches Anglo-American common law systems, alongside traditional civil law systems. ==Student body== As a result of providing courses focusing on inter-disciplinary needs, as well as an emphasis on intellectual property right laws and the American common law system, NCTU Law hosts a more diverse student body than most of the traditional law schools or departments in Taiwan, where the mainstream has been awarding bachelor's degrees in law and accepting only those with an prior law degree into more advanced legal programs. NCTU Law recruits students with a legal educational background, such as those with a first or more advanced law degree, and also students from other academical disciplines, such as literature, science, or engineering. NCTU Law accepts full-time students and part-time students, among which include those in the legal professions such as judges, prosecutors, lawyers, and counsels who seek more advanced study, and those with technical backgrounds including engineers, salespersons, and businesspersons, a lot of them being from corporations from the nearby Hsinchu Science Park, who intend to acquire knowledge of law. ==NCTU Law Review== The NCTU Law Review endorses the ideals of internationalization of jurisprudence, empirical studies of law, and interdisciplinary integration. The journal encourages innovative legal studies, believing that jurisprudence should reflect social realities as well as pursue fairness and justice. The journal also aims to serve as a platform for interdisciplinary dialogue. ==Reputation== In 2020, NCTU Law was ranked 101\u2013150 in the world in the subject of law and the 2nd best law school in Taiwan by the QS World University Rankings. ==International Cooperation== The Institute of Technology Law maintains a cooperative relationship with John Marshall Law School, Chicago, Illinois, and provides a cross-campus program which, upon fulfillment of successful completion of sufficient credit hours, awards the degree of master of law from ITL, together with an LL.M. degree from John Marshall Law. In the summer, faculties of John Marshall Law also occasionally lecture at ITL as visiting scholars. ==See also== * National Chiao Tung University ==External links== * National Chiao Tung University School of Law Category:National Chiao Tung University Category:Law schools in the Republic of China ",
