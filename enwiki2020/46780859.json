    "text": "Soviet Philatelist or Sovetskii Filatelist was a Soviet central philatelic magazine published in 1922\u20131932 by the All-Russian Society of Philatelists. For a number of years, in 1925 and in 1928\u20131932, its name was changed to Soviet Collector or Sovetskii Kollektsioner. == History == By 1922, shortly after the Civil War, a number of magazines and pamphlets for collectors appeared in Soviet Russia: * Russkii Kollektsioner (Russian Collector), published in Novocherkassk, * Priural'skii Kollektsioner (Ural Collector), * Krymskii Kollektsioner (Crimean Collector), etc. However, centralisation of collectors' organisations and periodicals was wanted: By 1924, these local magazines eventually closed down. In September 1922, the new magazine, Soviet Philatelist, first saw print in Moscow. Its founder and editor was , the Commissioner for Philately and Scripophily. In 1925, the magazine name was changed to Sovetskii Kollektsioner. The magazine was published biweekly. It was edited by V. A. Bessonov at that time. In 1926 three magazines, Sovetskii Filatelist, Sovetskii Kollektsioner and Radio de Filintern, were combined. They began to be published under one cover. Their individual lineal numeration was preserved. The last combined issue came out in December 1927. In the first half of 1928, the cover of the combined issues was only under one title, Sovetskii Filatelist. In July 1928, the magazine was renamed to Sovetskii Kollektsioner. It was published by the Soviet Philatelic Association and the All-Russian Society of Philatelists. The last issue appeared in December 1932. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+Historical outline of publishing Soviet Philatelist (Soviet Collector) !rowspan=2|Title !rowspan=2|Year !colspan=2|Start Issue !colspan=2|End Issue |- !No. (lineal No.) !Date !No. (lineal No.) !Date |- |rowspan=3|Sovetskii Filatelist |1922 |1 |9/1922 |4 |12/1922 |- |1923 |1 |1/1923 |12 |12/1923 |- |1924 |1 (17) |1/1924 |11/12 (27/28) |12/1924 |- !colspan=6|Name change to: |- |Sovetskii Kollektsioner |1925 |1 (29) |1/1925 |23/24 (51/52) |12/1925 |- !colspan=6|Combination of three magazines published under one cover: |- |rowspan=2|Sovetskii Filatelist |1926 |1 (53) |1/1926 |12 (64) |12/1926 |- |1927 |1 (65) |1/1927 |12 (76) |12/1927 |- |rowspan=2|Sovetskii Kollektsioner |1926 |1 (25) |1/1926 |12 (36) |12/1926 |- |1927 |1 (37) |1/1927 |12 (48) |12/1927 |- |rowspan=2|Radio de Filintern |1926 |1 (13) |1/1926 |12 (24) |12/1926 |- |1927 |1 (25) |1/1927 |12 (36) |12/1927 |- !colspan=6|Name change to (still three unique magazines, just one masthead): |- |Sovetskii Filatelist |1928 |1 (77) |1/1928 |6 (82) |6/1928 |- !colspan=6|Name change to: |- |rowspan=6|Sovetskii Kollektsioner |- |1928 |1 (83) |7/1928 |6 (88) |12/1928 |- |1929 |1 (89/91) |1\u20133/1929 |10/12 (98\u2013100) |10\u201312/1929 |- |1930 |1 (101) |1/1930 |12 (112) |12/1930 |- |1931 |1 (113) |1/1931 |12 (124) |12/1931 |- |1932 |1 (125) |1/1932 |10/12 (134/136) |10\u201312/1932 |} == See also == == Notes == == References == == Further reading == * Archived from the original and another source on 2015-05-15. == External links == * * Category:Philately of the Soviet Union Category:1922 establishments in the Soviet Union Category:Magazines established in 1922 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1932 Category:Philatelic periodicals Category:Monthly magazines published in Russia Category:Biweekly magazines Category:Russian-language magazines Category:Defunct magazines published in the Soviet Union Category:Hobby magazines Category:1932 disestablishments in the Soviet Union ",
