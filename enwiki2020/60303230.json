The sixth- generation Volkswagen Jetta, known as the NCS (New Compact Sedan) during its development, was announced in the North American market on 16 June 2010. The new model was larger and less expensive to manufacture than the previous generation making the vehicle more competitive against rivals such as the Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic and Nissan Sentra as part of Volkswagen's goal of reaching sales of 800,000 units in the North American market by 2018. Production of the vehicle is at Volkswagen's Puebla, Mexico, facility. The sixth generation Volkswagen Jetta was primarily designed by Volkswagen Mexico under the supervision of Volkswagen Germany and 70% of the parts are designed and manufactured in Mexico. The 2013 Volkswagen Jetta Hybrid unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show. Although no longer sharing any body panels with the Golf and having a longer wheelbase, this generation was partly based on the same PQ35 platform. Volkswagen's target of increasing its North American sales removed the Jetta from the premium compact car market. This forced many cost-cutting measures to be made for the North American models, which included a lower quality trim material for the interior and the replacement of leather with leatherette as an optional seating upholstery. Leather was still available on Canadian-spec models. The North American version also lost the multi-link rear suspension of the previous generation on lower-end models until the 2015 model year. Engines from the MK5 Jetta carried over included the 127 kW (170 hp; 177 PS) 2.5 L (five-cylinder) as well as the economy-minded 104 kW (140 hp; 142 PS) 2.0 TDI (diesel) engine. A Turbo Hybrid, 1.4 L TSI intercooled turbocharged engine mated with a electric motor providing a combined and became available in 2013, due to Hybrid popularity in North America. Additionally, the SEL Premium model retains the upscale soft touch interior, as well as the multi-link independent rear suspension found on the GLI, though softened for a more comfortable ride. It also has as standard a 6-speed sequential manual DSG gearbox, with Sport and Tiptronic modes. The Jetta Turbo Hybrid has an estimated combined fuel economy of . The 2013 Volkswagen Jetta Turbo Hybrid was unveiled in January 2012 at the North American International Auto Show. In North America, the base model (S in the US, Trendline in Canada) received a 2.0-liter 8-valve four-cylinder engine with and torque. Sales of the 2013 model year Jetta Turbo Hybrid are scheduled to begin in the U.S. by late 2012. From model year 2016 onward, American S and SE models, and Canadian models Trendline and Comfortline Jettas would receive a 1.4 liter turbocharged engine that produces and of torque. This engine replaced the 2.0-litre in those markets. New for 2014, VW is replacing the 2.5 L inline 5 with the new 1.8 L TSI turbo-charged 4 cylinder. Based on VW's EA888 platform, the 1.8 TSI is listed as one of Ward's 10 Best Engines for 2014, producing and of torque, all while achieving an EPA rating of 25 MPG city / 36 MPG highway. Other updates for 2014 include an independent multilink rear suspension as found in European counterparts, and electronic power steering (1.8 TSI models only.) In Europe, the engine range consists of the 1.2 TSI, 1.4 TSI (122 or 160 PS), 2.0 TSI, 1.6 TDI and 2.0 TDI engines. The European version will differ in some respects, particularly in having multi- link suspension at the rear. The European version will also incorporate soft- touch plastics on most of the dashboard (not the doors for this generation), and the rear seat center air vents have been restored. For the 2015 model year, Volkswagen made numerous improvements to the Jetta such as new front and rear fascias, headlights, reworked interior, fully independent suspension for all US models, a suite of driver-assistance systems such as blind spot monitoring, cross traffic alert, and standard rearview camera. The sixth- generation Jetta went on sale on 22 July 2010 in Mexico, thus becoming one of the only countries in the world where both the fourth (sold as the Volkswagen Cl\u00e1sico), and sixth generation Jetta were available simultaneously. (Both models are also both available in Colombia and Argentina). The sixth generation Jetta replaced the fifth, known in Mexico as the Volkswagen Bora. A special edition called the \"Volkswagen Jetta Edici\u00f3n Especial Bicentenario\" and approved by the Mexican Federal Government commemorates that country's 200th anniversary of the beginning of the Mexican War of Independence, on 16 September 1810. It is also the first car in Mexico with granted permission to use an official government logo (a \"2010\" plaque). It was launched in India on 17 August 2011. Volkswagen launched the 2015 Jetta facelift in the Indian car market on 17 February 2015. The sedan came with a Completely Knocked Down (CKD) kit, and is locally assembled at Volkswagen's Chakan factory, near Pune. It was launched in Australia and South Africa in September 2011.
