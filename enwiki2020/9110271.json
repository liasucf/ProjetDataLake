He came from Mutsu Province in the Sendai Domain (part of what is now Miyagi Prefecture). ==Career== Maruyama went to Edo (now Tokyo) at the age of just 17, and was trained by . His height was 197 cm and his weight was 166 kg. He left Edo to fight in Osaka sumo. In Osaka, he debuted at west \u014dzeki in 1737. It is said that he lost only two bouts in his career. He is considered to have been a strong wrestler but it has not been proven that he was awarded a yokozuna license. In honor of him, the house of Yoshida Tsukasa allowed him to be their disciple from August 1749 but this did not confer him the status of yokozuna. However, there are tales told that he wore a black-and-white rope. Though it was not a traditional shimenawa, Masahiko Nomi conjectured that it may have been related to the shimenawa. Maruyama died in Nagasaki while an active sumo wrestler on November 14, 1749 possibly from dysentery. His grave lies in Nagasaki, Nagasaki Prefecture. A statue of him stands in Yoneyama, Tome, Miyagi. It was not until over 150 years after his death that Maruyama was recognised as the third yokozuna by later yokozuna Jinmaku when he was compiling a formal list for a monument. His life and career predate banzuke and tournament records so no record of his rank and bouts exists. ==See also== *Glossary of sumo terms *List of yokozuna *List of past sumo wrestlers ==References== ==External links== *Brief biography Category:1713 births Category:1749 deaths Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers Category:Sumo people from Miyagi Prefecture Category:Yokozuna Category:Sumo wrestlers who died while active ",
