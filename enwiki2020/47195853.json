This book contains the journals, not originally intended for publication, that Greene kept on journeys he made for research purposes before writing those two novels. The first part, Congo Journal, mainly deals with his journey to the Belgian Congo in 1941 and the people he meets along the way. The second part, Convoy to West Africa, covers his journey to Sierra Leone in 1959. He made this trip with the story of his 1960 novel A Burnt-Out Case already partly written and it is apparent he is searching for characters to populate that story.https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/graham-greene/in-search-of-a- character/ Greene fans often find it interesting as a glimpse into the mind of the writer and of the man. ==References== Category:1961 non-fiction books Category:Books by Graham Greene Category:British travel books Category:The Bodley Head books Category:Books about Africa Category:Books about writing Category:English non-fiction books Category:African travel books ",
