    "text": "Le Voyage de la famille Bourrichon (known in English as The Voyage of the Bourrichon Family or The Voyage of the Family Bourrichon) is a 1912 French silent film directed by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, based on a music-hall comedy by Eug\u00e8ne Labiche. It is a comedy in the style of Max Linder, and is notable for being M\u00e9li\u00e8s's last film. Like all of M\u00e9li\u00e8s's 1911\u20131912 films, The Voyage of the Bourrichon Family was made under the supervision of Charles Path\u00e9 and was planned for release by the Path\u00e9 Fr\u00e8res studio. The film was probably completed by M\u00e9li\u00e8s at the end of 1912 (or possibly the beginning of 1913), and was advertised as an upcoming release in the French Cin\u00e9-Journal in May 1913. Some accounts claim that Path\u00e9 did not actually ever release it. The film was presumed lost as late as 2000, but was rediscovered in time to be included on a 2008 DVD collection of M\u00e9li\u00e8s's films. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Films directed by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s Category:French films Category:1912 films Category:1910s rediscovered films Category:French silent short films Category:French black-and-white films Category:French comedy films Category:1912 comedy films Category:Rediscovered French films ",
