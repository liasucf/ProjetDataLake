    "text": "Jackson Square is a rapid transit station in Boston, Massachusetts. It serves the MBTA's Orange Line. It is located at the intersection of Centre Street and Columbus Avenue in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood. ==History== The station opened in 1987 along with the rest of the southern Orange Line stations. The granite monolith located at the station \"Grandmothers\" was written by Cambridge writer/artist Christine Palamidessi Moore. The story is a memoir about her ethnic grandmothers and was selected for placement at the subway station by local residents. In 2004, the MBTA added murals as well as better lighting and new sidewalks after a spree of violent crimes near the station. The improvements at the station were designed to reduce criminal activity as well as provide a more welcoming atmosphere for transit riders. Additional murals were added in December 2007. The MBTA plans to add a second platform elevator, rebuild the existing elevator, and make other repairs to the station. A design contract was awarded in April 2020. ==Bus connections== A route 41 bus at Jackson Square Jackson Square station is served by five MBTA bus routes: *: Roslindale Square\u2013 *: \u2013 via Talbot Ave *: \u2013Jackson Square *: Centre Street & Eliot Street\u2013 *: Jackson Square station\u2013Ruggles station All of the routes operate into an off-street busway located adjacent to the station.
