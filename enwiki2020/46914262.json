    "text": "Harrogate International Festivals (HIF) is Yorkshire's longest running arts festival and a registered charity that programmes festivals and events supported by a year-round programme of arts and cultural activities for young people and communities across the north of England. Festivals include the Harrogate Music Festival, Theakston Old Peculier Crime Writing Festival, Harrogate International Spring Series, Raworths Harrogate Literature Festival and a programme of outreach and new programmes under the banner of HIF+ including the Spiegeltent and Children\u2019s Festival programmes. HIF also runs a broad programme of community outreach under the HIF+ programme including literacy, music and arts programmes for young people and communities with least access to the arts due to rural isolation, geographical location or social exclusion. In 2017, HIF won the Northern Soul Arts Festival of the Year Award. ==History== The Harrogate International Festival was set up in response to local demand to re-establish the quality of event that people had been used to between the wars in the town\u2019s spa heyday. In 1966, with the help of composer Benjamin Britten and singer Peter Pears of Aldeburgh Festival fame, and financial support from Harrogate Borough Council and the Arts Council of England, Clive Wilson launched the Festival and became its first Director. In artistic terms the Festival has changed radically from its origins in the late sixties. The Festival dates (originally in mid-August) were chosen as they had to fit into the town\u2019s conference & exhibition calendar (the summer gap after Gift Fair and before Carpet Fair). In its early days the Festival featured music, literature, drama, visual arts and science. However, over the following decades music came to the fore, making up around 90% of the programme. In 1984 following a national Arts Council strategy review entitled \u201cThe Glory of the Garden\u201d funding was withdrawn from all festivals north of Cheltenham. Up to that point Harrogate had received a guarantee against loss of \u00a338,000, the biggest Arts Council grant of any festival in England. The loss of the grant demanded a more populist approach to programming in order to build ticket revenue and to enable the major scaling up of corporate sponsorship. In 1991 it was recognised that a broadening of the artistic programme was needed to extend the audience reach - geographically and the under 55s - as well as by genre and to increase sponsorship, trust funding and box office revenue, in order for the Festival to grow. An incremental expansion of the performing arts programming commenced initially with jazz, contemporary dance and classical ballet, World Music and literature. Over the last 12 months the Festivals have staged over 300 distinct events and attracted over 90,000 people to its activities. Alongside box office sales they rely on sponsorship, grants and charitable giving. The current Chairman of the Trustees is Fiona Movley, she has background in communications and fundraising. This is voluntary position. Previous Chairman include Peter Blackburn CBE and Clive Leach CBE. ==Current Festivals== ===Harrogate Music Festival=== Harrogate Music Festival \u2013 July International arts festival taking place throughout July. === Theakstons Old Peculier Crime Writing Festival === Currently held at The Old Swan Hotel dates for 2020 are Thursday 23 July \u2013 Sunday 26 July.
