    "text": "Latin grammarians generally present Latin as having six main tenses, three non-perfect or tenses (the present, future, and imperfect) and three corresponding perfect or tenses (the perfect, future perfect, and pluperfect).Kennedy (1962), p. 56; Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 64; Allen & Greenough (1903), p. 72. These six tenses are made using two different stems: for example, from the verb 'I do' the three non-perfect tenses are and the three perfect tenses are . In addition to these six tenses of the indicative mood, there are four tenses in the subjunctive mood: present, imperfect, perfect, and pluperfect (). To these can be added various 'periphrastic' tenses, consisting of a future participle and part of the verb sum, for example 'I am going to do'.Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 88. Because Latin verbal groups do not have perfect English equivalents, it is often the case that the same word can be translated in different ways depending on its context: for example, can be translated as 'I did', 'I do', and 'I am doing', and can be translated as 'I have done' and 'I did'.cf. Wigtil (1992). However, occasionally Latin makes a distinction which is not made in English: for example, and both mean 'I was' in English, but they differ in Latin (the distinction is also found in Spanish and Portuguese). Participles in Latin have three tenses (present, perfect, and future) and the imperative mood has two tenses (present and future). The infinitive has two main tenses (present and perfect) and a number of periphrastic tenses used in reported speech. For the most part the use of tenses in Latin is straightforward, but there are certain idioms where Latin and English use different tenses.See Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), pp. 154-167. For example, in future conditions of the type 'if anything happens, I will tell you', English uses the present tense in the subordinate clause, but Latin has the future perfect tense ('if anything will have happened, I will tell you'). In some cases the use of tenses can be understood in terms of transformations of one tense or mood into another, especially in indirect speech. For example, in indirect questions, a present indicative of direct speech, such as 'is', is changed first from indicative to subjunctive mood (), and then, if the context is past, from the present to the imperfect tense (). Another very common transformation is for the main verb in an indirect statement to be changed into the closest tense of the infinitive, so that the present tense changes to the present infinitive , and the imperfect 'he was' and perfect 'he was' both change to the perfect infinitive . ==Formation of the tenses== Latin has six main tenses in the indicative mood, and four in the subjunctive mood. These are illustrated below using a 1st conjugation verb, 'I love', a 2nd conjugation verb 'I advise', a 3rd conjugation verb, 'I lead', and a 4th conjugation verb, 'I hear'. Also shown on the table are the tenses of the common irregular verbs 'I am', 'I am able', 'I want' and 'I go'. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 55em;\" |- ! ! Present ! Future ! Imperfect !

The three perfect tenses are formed using a different stem (e.g. instead of ). ===Future tenses=== There are three ways of forming the future tense in Latin: (1) -b\u014d, -bis, -bit (1st and 2nd conjugation and 'I go'; (2) -am, -\u0113s, -et (3rd and 4th conjugation); and (3) er\u014d, eris, erit (). ===Future perfect endings=== In early Latin the future perfect had a short i in the persons -eris, -erimus, -eritis, while the perfect subjunctive had a long i: -er\u012bs, -er\u012bmus, -er\u012btis. But Catullus (and apparently Cicero, judging from the rhythms of his clausulae) pronounced the future perfect with a long i (f\u0113cer\u012bmus).C.J. Fordyce (1961), Catullus, note on Catullus 5.10. Virgil has a short i for both tenses; Horace uses both forms for both tenses; Ovid uses both forms for the future perfect, but a long i in the perfect subjunctive.Wackernagel (2009) Lectures on Syntax, p. 305, note 7. ===Perfect passive tenses=== The perfect tense passive is formed periphrastically using a perfect participle and the verb . The participle changes according to gender and number: 'she was led', '(the women) were led' etc. The perfect tense of deponent verbs (for example 'I set out') is formed in the same way. The order of the participle and auxiliary is sometimes reversed: . When negative there are various possibilities: , , 'he did not dare' all commonly occur. A perfect participle used as part of the perfect tense passive should be distinguished from one which is merely an adjective, as in the following sentence:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 166. : (Caesar)Caesar, B.G. 1.1. :'Gaul, seen as a whole, is divided into three parts' Here the meaning of is not 'was divided' or 'has been divided' but the participle is simply descriptive. ===Perfects made with and === Perfect tenses can also be formed occasionally using instead of , for example 'I forgot', and e.g. 'I have led'. For the meaning of these see below. ===Shortened endings=== The 2nd person singular passive endings are often shortened by changing -is to -e, e.g. for 'you were being led'. The 3rd person plural perfect indicative can also be shortened: for 'they led'. The shortened form of the perfect is common in poetry, but is also sometimes found in prose. ==Meanings of the indicative tenses== ===Present indicative=== There is no distinction of aspect in the present tense: faci\u014d can mean 'I do (now)', 'I do (regularly), or 'I am doing'; that is, it can be perfective, habitual, or progressive in aspect. ====Current situation==== The present tense can refer to a current situation: : (Cicero)CIcero, in Cat. 1.2. :'the Senate understands this; the Consul sees it; yet this man is still alive' : (Cicero)Cicero Academica Pos. 2. :'perhaps you are telling the truth' ====Habitual==== The present tense can be used for habitual actions: : (Cicero)CIcero Fam. 6.5.1. :'I see (your son) nearly every day' ====General truths==== The present, as in English, can also describe a general truth:Pinkster (1990), p. 224. : (Catullus)Catullus, 5.1. :'suns can set and return again' ====Perfective present==== It can also be used performatively to describe an event which takes place at the moment of speaking: : (Cicero)Cicero, pro Flacco 39. :'I come now to the testimony of the Dorylensians' ====Historic present==== The present tense is often used in narrative in a historic sense, referring to a past event, especially when the writer is describing an exciting moment in the story. This is known as the 'historic present': : (Caesar)Caesar, B.C. 6.38. :'he sees the enemy threatening ... he immediately seizes weapons from those next to him ...' According to Pinkster, the historic present is the most frequent tense used in narrative in both prose and poetry.Pinkster (1990), p. 224. It can replace not only the perfect tense, but also the imperfect tense:Pinkster (1990), p. 240. : (Caesar)Caesar, B.G. 6.37.6. :'throughout the camp people were panicking' After 'while', the present indicative also has the meaning of an imperfect tense: : (Ovid)Ovid, Met 4.55 :'while she was fleeing, her cloak () slipped from her back () and she left it behind' In Caesar when a verb is placed initially in the sentence, as in the first example above (), it is very frequently in the present tense.Devine, Andrew M. & Laurence D. Stephens (2006), Latin Word Order. Structured Meaning and Information. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 159. Another situation where the use of the historic present is frequent is in utterance verbs, such as 'they give a pledge' or 'they beg'. More than half the historic presents in Caesar are of this kind.See Viti (2010). ====Perfect continuous meaning==== The present can sometimes mean 'has been doing', referring to a situation that started in the past and is still continuing. In some sentences a length of time is given and the adverb 'now' is added:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), pp. 157, 159. : (Cicero)Cicero, Verr. 2.4.38. :'he has been living in Lilybaeum for many years now' : (Cicero)Cicero, Verr. 2.2.23. :'he has been a Roman citizen for a long time now' The present tense can also be used in this meaning when combined with a temporal clause using :Woodcock (1959), p. 176. : (Terence)Terence, Eun. 84. :'I've been trembling and shivering ever since I caught sight of her' Sometimes the clause itself has the present tense: : (Martial)Martial 6.21.7. :'ever since he has been (lit. 'is') mine, he has never harmed me with a mistress' : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 2.11.1. :'I've been feeling completely out of touch ever since I've been in Formiae' Another idiom is the following using the conjunction :Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 372. :mult\u012b ann\u012b _sunt_ cum in aere me\u014d _est_ (Cicero)Cicero, Fam. 15.14.1. :'he has owed me money for many years now' (lit. 'there are many years that he is in my bronze') ======== Another idiom that can be mentioned is the phrase , which means 'it would take a long time' or 'it would be tedious'. It is frequently used by Cicero as well as other writers:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 168. : (Nepos)Nepos, Hann. 5.4. :'it would be tedious to recount all the battles' ===Future indicative=== ====Future event or situation==== The future tense can describe an event or a situation in the near or distant future: : (Vitruvius) :'I will explain this in the next book' : (Cicero) :'when I get there, I shall be expecting your letters every day' There is no distinction in the future between perfective and imperfective aspect. ====Future in subordinate clauses==== After 'when' or 'if' or other subordinate clauses referring to a future time, usuallyGildersleeve & Lodge (1895), pp. 156. the future is used where English has a present tense. The simple future, not the future perfect, is used if the time of the two verbs is simultaneous: : (Cicero)Cicero, ad Att. 5.6.2. :'I will tell you when I have some news' (lit. 'I will have') : (Cato)Cato, de R\u0113 R\u016bstic\u0101 156. :'if you are going to be eating it (i.e. cabbage) raw, dip it in vinegar' : (Cicero)Cicero, ad Att. 14.20.5. :'through him we shall easily get what we want' (lit. 'what we will want') ====Polite requests==== The future can also be used for polite requests, as when Cicero sends greetings to his friend Atticus's wife and daughter: : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 16.6.4. :'please give my greetings to Pilia and Attica' ===Imperfect indicative=== The imperfect indicative generally has an imperfective meaning and describes situations in the past. Often the imperfect can be translated into English as 'was doing', but sometimes the simple tense 'did' or expressions such as 'used to do', 'would do', 'kept doing', 'began to do', 'had been doing' are more appropriate. ====Habitual use==== The imperfect tense can describe a situation that used to take place regularly or habitually: : (Cicero) :'I used to listen to him a lot' ====Iterative use==== Similar to the above is the iterative or 'frequentative'Wheeler (1903), pp. 177\u20139. use of the imperfect, describing what something that kept on happening or which happened on an indefinite number of occasions: : ([Caesar])Bellum Alexandrinum 36. :'Pharnaces sent several embassies to Domitius ... (each time) Domitius would reply ...' ====Situation at a particular time==== It can also describe a situation that existed at a particular moment: : (Livy)Livy, 45.12. :'with a stick, which he was carrying in his hand, he drew a circle round the king' Often an expression such as 'then' or 'at that time' is added: : (Livy)Livy, 1.12.9. :'at that time (the time of his death) Mettius was fighting on horseback' : (Livy)Livy, 32.32.1. :'by this time it was already winter' ====Vivid description==== The use of the imperfect rather than the perfect can be used to make a scene more vivid, as with this sentence of Cicero's: : (Cicero)Cicero, Verr. 2.5.162. :'a Roman citizen was being flogged with rods in the middle of the forum of Messana, judges' The passage is commented on by Aulus Gellius. He says that the use of rather than creates a 'drawn-out vivid description' ();Aulus Gellius 10.3.12; cf. Ker (2007), p. 345. that is to say, making it seem to the audience that the scene is taking place in front of them. ====Geographical description==== Sometimes the imperfect is used for description of the surroundings: : (Caesar)Caesar, B.G. 1.6.1. :'a very high mountain hung over (the road)' ====Unfinished action==== Another use is to describe an action that someone was intending to do, or about to do, but which never actually took place, or which was interrupted by another event:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), pp. 158; Allen & Greenough (1903), p. 329. : (Tacitus)Tacitus, Ann. 2.34 :'he was on the point of leaving the Senate house' : (Tacitus)Tacitus, Ann. 16.33. :'he would have rushed into the embrace of his daughter, who was running towards him, if the bodyguards hadn't intervened and stood in the way of both of them' : (Tacitus)Tacitus, Hist. 2.66. :'after the soldiers of the 14th legion descended from the Alps, all the more rebellious men were for carrying the standards to Vienne; but they were checked by the consensus of the better men and the legion was transported across to Britain' ===='Began doing'==== Another meaning is inceptive, describing a situation that began at a certain moment and continued indefinitely:Woodcock (1959), p. 174. : (Livy)Livy, 1.27.11. :'after the rout began, some began rushing blindly into the water, others, while they were hesitating on the banks, were crushed' : (Sallust)Sallust, Jugurtha 25.6. :'when he heard that some important people had come, he began to agitated with alarm' ====Pluperfect continuous meaning==== When the imperfect tense is used with the adverb 'now' and a length of time it means 'had been doing': : (Livy)Livy, 24.29 :'which they had been desiring for a long time now' ====Epistolary imperfect==== Sometimes in letters a writer imagines himself in the position of the recipient and uses a past tense to describe an event which for the writer himself is present:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), pp. 166-7. : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 1.10 (6) :'as a matter of fact I was sitting there as I was writing this to you' (i.e. 'I am sitting there as I write this to you') ====Potential meaning ('would be')==== Sometimes the imperfect of is used with a potential meaning ('would be'):Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 386. : (Quintilian)Quintilian 2.8.8. :'teaching would be completely superfluous, if nature was sufficient' : (Pliny)Pliny, Ep. 4.13.4. :'it would be very much in your interests, those of you who are fathers, if your sons could study here rather than in another town' ===Perfect indicative=== ====Past event==== The perfect most frequently narrates an event in the past. The usual translation is the simple English past tense with '-ed' or the equivalent: : (Caesar)Suetonius, Vita divi Iulii 37. :'I came, I saw, I conquered' : (Servius to Cicero)Cicero, ad Fam. 4.12.1. :'there I met Marcus Marcellus, and I spent that day there' : (Caesar)Caesar, B.G. 4.25.5. :'all at the same time, they leapt down from the ship' ====Present perfect meaning==== The perfect can also be used like the English present perfect ('I have done'):Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 159. : (Cicero)Cicero, Fam, 16.9.3. :'I have left a horse and a mule for you at Brundisium' : (Cicero)Cicero, Fam. 12.27. :'I haven't yet quite made my mind up' : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 14.18.1. :'he was due to pay the money on the 1st January, but he still hasn't paid it' ====Experiential perfect==== As with the English perfect, the Latin perfect can sometimes be used to relate experiences which have happened several times in the past: : (Cicero)Cicero, Orator 50.168. :'I have often seen public meetings shout out loud when the words fell aptly (i.e. with a striking rhythm)' Similar to this is the 'gnomic perfect', which states a general truth based on past experience:Allen & Greenough (1903), p. 299. : (Horace)Horace, Ep. 1.2.47 :'a heap of bronze and gold has never taken away fevers from the body' (i.e. doesn't takes away) ====Iterative action==== In sentences which mean 'whenever X occurs, Y occurs', referring to general time, the perfect tense is used for event X if it precedes event Y.Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 363; Allen & Greenough (1903), p. 332. In English the present tense is often used: : (Cicero)Cicero, Tusc. Disp. 1.24. :'while I am reading, I agree, but as soon as I put the book down all that agreement slips away' : (Cicero)Cicero, d\u0113 \u014cr\u0101t. 2.24. :'whenever I come here, this very \"doing nothing\" delights me' ====Length of time==== The perfect, not the imperfect, is used when a situation is said to have lasted in the past for a certain length of time, but is now over:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 158. : (Cicero)Cicero, Lucullus 16. :'he lived for ninety years' : (Seneca)Seneca Ep. 83.12. :'Cassius drank water throughout his whole life' : (Cicero)Cicero, 17. :'all the Consuls before you obeyed the Senate' Exceptions to this rule are very rare, but they do occur, for example the following, which describes an ongoing unfinished situation:Cited by Pinkster (1990), p. 216. : (Livy)Liv. 32.35.2 :'Philip was nowhere in sight, and for several hours no messenger arrived from him' Similarly the perfect is used for a situation which has always existed and still exists: : (Cicero)Cicero, de Oratore 1.191. :'he lives with me, and has always done so' ====Eram and fu\u012b==== Both of these in English mean 'I was', but in Latin there is usually a difference. As with other verbs, the perfect is usually used when the length of time is mentioned: : (Livy)Livy 7.10.1 :'for a long time there was silence' The perfect is also used when the sentence describes an event rather than a situation: : (Livy)Livy 35.9.1. :'that year there were huge floods and the Tiber inundated the flat areas of the city' : (Cicero)Cicero, Cat. 1.9. :'you were therefore there at Laeca's house that night, Catiline!' (i.e. you attended the meeting) However, the perfect 'I was once', 'I used to be' is sometimes used to describe a former situation, emphasising that it is no longer in existence:Allen & Greenough (1903), p. 299. : (Petronius)Petronius, Satyricon 75. :'I was once just like you are' : (Livy)Livy, 1.36.5 :'there was once a statue of Attus to the left of the senate house' : (Virgil)Virgil, Aeneid 2.325. :'we have ceased to be Trojans; Troy is no more' The perfect is also used in sentences such as the following, which describe a permanent state, as opposed to the imperfect, which describes a temporary one:Pinkster (1990), p. 238, \u00a711.3.1. : (Terence)Terence, Eun. 107 :'my mother was a Samian; she was living in Rhodes (at that time)' : (Caesar)Caesar B.G. 1.2.1 :'Among the Helvetians by far the noblest and the most wealthy was Orgetorix' According to Pinkster, the use of erat in these two examples would sound wrong. 'In both cases the reader would want to know \"What happened next?\"'Pinkster (1990), p. 239, \u00a711.3.1. The perfect must also be used with adverbs such as 'once', 'twice', 'three times', which imply that the situation is now over:Pinkster (1990), p. 223, \u00a711.1.3. : (Cicero)Cicero, Planc. 84. :'I have been in Bithynia twice' For geographical description, erat is used: : (Caesar)Caesar, B.G. 2.5.6. :'on that river there was a bridge' There are also some types of sentences where either tense may be used indifferently, for example when describing someone's name or character: : / (Livy)Livy 26.27, 24.7. :'his name was Manus' / 'his name was Dinomenes' : / (Nepos)Nepos, Conon 1.2; Alcibiades 1.2. :'he was a hard-working general' / 'he was an excellent general' The equivalent of these two tenses, and both meaning 'I was', still exist in Spanish and Portuguese today. (See Spanish conjugation, Portuguese verb conjugation.) ====Memin\u012b, \u014dd\u012b, n\u014dv\u012b==== Certain verbs, of which the most common are 'I remember', 'I hate', and 'I know', are used in the perfect tense but have the meaning of a present tense: : (Cicero)Cicero, Fin. 2.55 :'I remember being present' : (Catullus)Catullus 30.11. :'even if you have forgotten, yet the gods remember' : (Catullus)Catullus 85. :'I hate and I love' The future perfect and pluperfect of these verbs serve as the equivalent of a future or imperfect tense: 'I will remember', 'I remembered'. has an imperative 'remember!' The verb usually means 'I know' but sometimes it has a past meaning 'I became acquainted with': : (Cicero)Cicero, Div. Caec. 20. :'we don't know you, we don't know who you are, we have never seen you before' : = . (Plautus)Plautus, Pseud. 618. :'I am (the one you mentioned). But where on earth did you make my acquaintance or see me or ever converse with me?' The perfect of , 'I have grown accustomed', is also often used with a present meaning:Allen & Greenough (1903), p. 300. : (Caesar)Caesar, B.G. 4.29. :'this day generally makes the highest tides' ====Perfect with ==== Occasionally the beginnings can be seen of a perfect tense formed with habeo ('I have') and the perfect participle, which became the regular way of forming the perfect in French and Italian: : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 15.20.4. :'As for Eros's accounts, although I haven't seen him in person, I have more or less learnt what they say from his letter' : (Cicero)Cicero, ad Brut. 1.1.1. :'I have now thoroughly examined, learnt, and judged Clodius's mind' According to Gildersleeve and Lodge, this form of the perfect 'is not a mere circumlocution for the Perfect, but lays particular stress on the maintenance of the result'.Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 160. In later Latin this construction became more common, for example:Haverling (2012), p. 373. : (Gregory of Tours, 6th century)Greg. Tur. Vit. Patr. 3.1. :'you have invited the Bishop, and we have scarcely four jars of wine left!' A variation with 'I hold or keep' is also sometimes found, but usually with emphasis on the idea of holding: : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 9.12.3. :'an army of the Roman people is besieging Gnaeus Pompey, is keeping him fenced in (has fenced him in) with a ditch and wall, and preventing him from fleeing' A pluperfect can similarly be made using one of the past tenses of :Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 161 note 2. : ([Caesar]) 7.3. :'Pompeius had placed a camp in the mountains within sight of both towns' : (Caesar)Caesar, B.G. 1.15.1. :'Caesar sent ahead all the cavalry which he had gathered together from the whole province' : ([Caesar])[Caesar] Bellum Alexandrinum 10. :'and so they drew up and manned with fighters all the ships which they had earlier got ready for sailing' ====Perfect passive with fu\u012b==== Normally the perfect passive tenses are formed with , , and (e.g. 'I was captured', 'I will have been captured', 'I had been captured'). Occasionally, however, they can be formed with , for example .Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), pp. 165\u20136. : (Gellius)Gellius 13.19.2 :'Sophocles was born before Euripides' : (Cicero)Cicero, Rosc.Com. 1.3. :'whatever is (lit. will have been proved) acceptable to you will be acceptable to him' : (Cicero)Cicero, Div. 1.34.74. :'the weapons which had (earlier) been fixed on the walls were found on the ground' : (Cicero)Cicero, Tusc. 4.15. :'if ever (desire) has obtained what it had earlier set its heart on, it brings joy' In these examples, the fact that the verb with in each case refers to an earlier state than the verb with is clearly a factor in the choice of tense.Woodcock (1959), p. 79. In authors from Livy onwards the pluperfect with and future perfect with are sometimes loosely used for the normal pluperfect with and future perfect with :Woodcock (1959), p. 80. : (Livy)Livy 1.56.11. :'Sextus had been left behind in Rome' In Plautus these tenses are used several times with the deponent verb 'I forget': : (Plautus)Plautus, Poenulus 39. :'I almost forgot!' : (Plautus)Plautus, Most. 484. :'by chance I had forgotten to extinguish the lamp' ===Future perfect indicative=== ====Independent use==== The future perfect is usually used in a sentence with 'if' or 'when' referring to future time, but it can sometimes be used on its own, as in the following sentences: : (Cicero)Cicero, ad Att. 5.1.3. :'Pomponia, you invite the women, and (meanwhile) I will have summoned the men' Another famous passage with a future perfect is the call of the eagle-bearer to his men when their boat reached the shore of Britain in 55 BC: : (Caesar)Caesar, B.G. 4.25.3. :'Jump down, soldiers,' he said, 'unless you want to betray the eagle to the enemy. I will certainly have done my own duty for the republic and the commander!' There is also an idiom using the future perfect of , where the future perfect is almost equivalent to a command:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 163. : (Livy)Livy, 1.58.10. :'you must see to it what is due to that man' ====After s\u012b and cum==== More frequently the future perfect tense is found after 'if' or 'when' in clauses referring to a future time. In such sentences English uses the present tense:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), pp. 373; 380-381Allen & Greenough (1903), p. 300. : (Livy)Livy 1.58.3. :'you will die, if you utter a sound!' (lit. 'if you will have uttered') : (Catullus)Catullus 5.10. For the length of the \u012b, see Fordyce's note. :'then, when we have made many thousands, we will muddle up the accounts' : (Cicero)Cicero, Fam. 5.21.5. :'if anything happens, I'll let you know at once' : (Cicero)Cicero, d\u0113 \u014cr. 2.261. :'as you sow (lit. will have sown), so shall you reap' ====Future perfect of and ==== The future perfect of and has a simple future meaning: : (Plautus)Plautus, Curculio 491. :'I'll remember, don't worry about that' : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 9.12.2. :'I hate the man, and I always will' ===Pluperfect indicative=== ====Prior event==== The pluperfect can be used as in English to describe an event that had happened earlier than the time of the narrative: : (Caesar)Caesar, B.C. 3.80.1. :'this nation had sent ambassadors to Caesar a few months previously' Often, like the imperfect tense, the pluperfect can be used to describe the situation prevailing at a certain moment: : (Curtius)Curtius, 8.1.50. :'the others had already departed; Clitus was going out last, without a light' ====Iterative use==== In subordinate clauses of the type 'whenever...', 'whoever...' etc. in past time the pluperfect indicative is used if the event precedes the event of the main clause. Usually in English the simple past is used:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 363. : (Cicero)Cicero, Verr. 2.5.27. :'it was only whenever he saw a rose that he thought that spring was beginning' : (Cicero)Cicero, Verr. 2.5.27. :'at the end of the journey, whenever he came to some town, he would be carried in the same litter straight into his bedroom' In later writers such as Livy, the pluperfect subjunctive is used in a similar context.Allen & Greenough (1903), p. 333. ====Potential meaning ('would have')==== Sometimes in a conditional clause a pluperfect indicative can have the meaning of a potential pluperfect subjunctive ('would have'), when it refers to an event which very nearly took place, but did not:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 386. : (Florus)Florus, 2.13.19. :'the war would have been completely finished, if (Caesar) had been able to crush Pompey at Brundisium' ====Pluperfect of , , ==== The pluperfect of , and has the meaning of an imperfect: : (Caesar)Caesar, B.C. 3.47.5. :'they remembered how they had put up with a great shortage at Alesia' : (Cicero)Cicero, Fam, 7.2.3. :'I hated this man even more than I hated Clodius himself' : (Cicero)Cicero, Cael. 10 :'he did not know Catiline, since the latter was at that time governor of Africa' ==Subjunctive mood== The subjunctive mood in Latin has four tenses, which are as shown below. Note that the meanings given here are only very approximate, since in fact each tense has a wide variety of meanings. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Subjunctive tenses (3rd conjugation) ! ! Active ! Meaning ! Passive ! Meaning |- ! Present | ' || 'I would/should/can lead' || ' || 'I would/should be led' |- ! Imperfect | ' || 'I would/should/could lead/be leading'|| ' || 'I would be (being) led' |- ! Perfect | ' || 'I would/could have led' || ' || 'I would have been led' |- ! Pluperfect | ' || 'I would/could/should have led' || ' || 'I would have been led' |- |} For the subjunctive of other verbs, see the table at the beginning of this article. The present subjunctive of 3rd conjugation verbs resembles the future in the 1st person singular, but in other persons it differs. The subjunctive goes while the future indicative goes There is no future subjunctive tense as such, although there is a periphrastic future subjunctive (), which is used for example in indirect questions. The present subjunctive of 1st conjugation verbs ends in -em, -\u0113s, -et, of conjugations 2, 3, and 4 in -am, -\u0101s, -at, and of in -im, -\u012bs, -it. The imperfect subjunctive of every active verb has the same form as the infinitive with the endings -em, -\u0113s etc.: , , etc. In 1st conjugation verbs, the ending is frequently contracted to . ===Present subjunctive=== ====Potential==== The present subjunctive can be potential ('would', 'could') or jussive ('should'). After the word perhaps, it can mean 'may', expressing a possibility: : (Cicero)Cicero, Ver. 2.5.7. :'this may perhaps seem harsh' It can also express a wish for the future (the word is usually added): : (Cicero)Cicero, Att, 3.3. :'may I live to see that day!' A more usual translation for the potential subjunctive, however, is 'would'. In conditional sentences, the present subjunctive usually refers to some hypothetical situation in the future. This kind of conditional sentence is known as 'ideal':Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 385; Woodcock (1959), pp. 154\u20135. : (Cicero)Cicero, Cat. 1.19. :'if your country were to say this to you, shouldn't she be granted her request?' : (Cicero)Cicero, de Div. 2.45. :'if I were to deny that this road is a rough one, I would be lying' In early Latin, a present subjunctive can also be used to make an unreal conditional referring to the present:Woodcock (1959), p. 153. : (Plautus)Plautus, Men. 640. :'I wouldn't be asking you, if I knew' However, there was a gradual shift in usage, and in the classical period, and even sometimes in Plautus, the imperfect subjunctive is used in such clauses (see below for examples). ====Historic potential==== Sometimes in poetry a present subjunctive can be used to refer to a potential past event, where in prose a pluperfect subjunctive would be used in both halves of the sentence:R.D. Williams on Aeneid 6.292\u20134. Other examples in the Aeneid are 2.599f, 5.325f, 12.733. : (Virgil)Virgil, Aeneid 6.292-4. :'had his learned companion not warned him, Aeneas would have rushed in and beaten aside the ghosts with his sword in vain' ====Generalising 2nd person==== When a conditional sentence expresses a generalisation, the present subjunctive is used for any 2nd person singular verb, whether in the subordinate clause or the main clause:Woodcock (1959), p. 151; Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 381. Thus, in the subordinate clause: : (Cato)Cato apud Gell. 11.2.6. :'if ever you use iron, it gets worn away' : (Seneca)Seneca, Ep. 12.4. :'old age is full of pleasure, if you know how to enjoy it' And in the main clause: : (Plautus)Plautus, Trin. 671. :'whenever there's a shortage of something, you want it' ====Jussive==== When the subjunctive has a jussive meaning, it can be a suggestion or command in the 1st or 3rd person: : (Catullus)Catullus, 5.1. :'let's live, my Lesbia, and let's love' : (Gellius)Gellius, Noct\u0113s Atticae 2.2.6. :'let him sit here!' In philosophy it can set the scene for a discussion: : (Cicero)Cicero, Off. 3.54. :'let us suppose that a good man is selling a house' Another use is concessive: : (Cicero)Cicero, Verr. 2.5.4. :'he may well be a thief, he may well be a temple robber, he may be the leader of all outrages and vices; nonetheless he is a good general!' The subjunctive is also used in deliberative questions (which are questions which expect an imperative answer):Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 174; Woodcock (1959), pp. 129\u2013130. : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 9.5.2. :'what ought I to do about Pompey?' ====In dependent clauses==== The present subjunctive is also used in a great variety of subordinate clauses set in present time, such as purpose clauses, indirect commands, consecutive clauses, clauses of fearing, indirect questions, and others. In some of these constructions, it can often be translated simply as if it were an ordinary present indicative, such as after causal : : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 10.8.7, and often. :'since these things are so' The subjunctive is also used in purpose clauses (also known as final clauses):Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 345. : (Rh\u0113torica ad Herennium)ad Herr. 4.28.39. :'you should eat so that you can live, not live so that you can eat' One of the most common uses of the subjunctive is to indicate reported speech. When a question is made indirect, the verb is always changed into the subjunctive mood. The present subjunctive can therefore represent what would be a present indicative if the question was direct: : (Catullus)Catullus 85. :'do you perhaps ask why I do that?' In reported speech, the present subjunctive can also represent a present imperative or a jussive subjunctive. This type of construction is known as an indirect command: : (Livy)Livy, 1.58.5 :'she sends a messenger (to say) that they should come' After , if the context is clearly future, a present subjunctive can sometimes represent a future tense or potential subjunctive:Woodcock (1959), p. 136 : (Caesar)Caesar, B.G. 1.31.15. :'they said that if these things were reported to Ariovistus, they didn't doubt that he would put them all to death' Similarly in the protasis ('if' clause) of a conditional sentence in indirect speech, a present subjunctive can represent an original future indicative:Woodcock (1959), p. 237. : (Caesar)Caesar, 1.44.11. :'(Ariovistus told Caesar that) if he did not retreat and withdraw his army, he would treat him as an enemy' In other examples in reported speech, the subjunctive in the 'if' clause represents an original present subjunctive with potential meaning: : (Cicero)Cicero, 3.1. :'I believe that Pleasure, if she were to speak for herself, would give way to Dignity' ====Archaic subjunctives==== In old Latin, a form of the subjunctive with -s-, known as the sigmatic aorist subjunctive, is preserved ( etc.). This is used in wishes for the future:Woodcock (1959), p. 88. : (Plautus)Plautus, Asinarius 654. :'may the gods preserve you always!' : (Cicero)Cicero, Fam. 14.3.3. :'may the gods ensure that it be allowed' In Plautus this subjunctive is also used in prohibitions, when it exists:De Melo (2007) : (Plautus)Plautus, Mostellaria 524. :'don't worry about me!' In some phrases it has a conditional meaning: : (Plautus)Plautus, Poenulus 1089. :'I would willingly do him harm!' : (Livy)Livy, 1. :'I do not know, nor, if I knew, would I dare to say' Another archaic subjunctive is for , which is very common in Plautus and Terence, but fell out of use later: : (Terence)Terence, Eunuchus 346. :'do you know where she is?' Less common is , with the same meaning. This occurs occasionally in Plautus and also once in Lucretius (4.635) and once in Virgil's Aeneid, where the archaic form is presumably appropriate for the speech of the god Jupiter: : (Virgil)Virgil, Aeneid, 10.105 :'whether it be Trojan or Rutulian, I shall make no distinction!' Another old subjunctive is , from the verb 'I give'. It occurs mostly in Plautus and Terence, but sometimes also in Cicero, in phrases like the following: : (Plautus)Plautus, Stichus 593. :'may the gods destroy you!' ===Imperfect subjunctive=== The imperfect indicative is always imperfective in aspect ('was doing'); the imperfect subjunctive is also often imperfective in meaning ('I was doing', 'I would be doing'). However, as the examples below show, it can also sometimes be perfective ('I did'), in view of the fact that it often represents the transformation into past time of a present or future tense or an imperative. ====Potential==== The imperfect subjunctive is often used in wishes to represent an imagined or wished for situation impossible at the present time:Woodcock (1959), p. 154. : (Cicero)Cicero, Phil. 8.22. :'if only Servius Sulpicius were alive!' Similarly in unreal conditional sentences, the imperfect subjunctive represents a situation which is hypothetical or imaginary, referring to the present time: : (Cicero)Cicero, in Caec. 19. :'if the whole of Sicily were able to speak with one voice, it would be saying (would say) this' : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 6.1.11. :'I would write more about this to you, if you were in Rome' : (Plautus)Plautus, Pseud. 640. :'if he were inside, I would be calling him out' : (Seneca)Seneca, Ep. 99.2. :'how would you react, if you had lost a friend?' In the following sentence, the imperfect subjunctive is used to wish for something that cannot now come true, while the present subjunctive leaves open the possibility that it may be true: : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 15.4.4. :'I wish it had been true about Menedemus; I hope it may be true about the queen' ====Generalising 2nd person==== The 2nd person imperfect subjunctive when potential is nearly always indefinite and generalising, i.e. an imaginary 'you':Woodcock (1959), p. 91. : (Livy)Livy, 2.43.9. :'you would have thought them beaten' ====Jussive==== A rarer use of the imperfect subjunctive is the past jussive:Williams, R.D. (1973). The Aeneid of Virgil books 7\u201312, on book 8.643. : (Virgil)Virgil, Aeneid 8.643. :'you should have remained true to your words, o Alban!' This usage is quite common in PlautusSee examples in Woodcock (1959), p. 86. but rare in later Latin. The normal prose practice is to use either a past tense of 'I have a duty to' or 'it is proper' with the infinitive, or else a gerundive with a past tense of . The imperfect subjunctive can also be used in deliberative questions, that is to say, questions asking for advice, in a past time context: : (Virgil)Virgil, Ec. 1.40; 7.10. :'what was I to do?' ====In dependent clauses==== The imperfect subjunctive is very commonly found in past context dependent clauses, where it can represent the transformation of a present indicative or imperative. The following example contains an indirect command reflecting an imperative in direct speech: : (Nepos)Nepos, Hannibal, 12.4. :'he ordered him to go round all the doors of the building' Another very common use is the circumstantial cum-clause with the imperfect subjunctive. Here the imperfect subjunctive has the same meaning as an imperfect indicative would have if cum were omitted: : (Cicero)Cicero, Verr. 2.4.32. :'while I was sitting at home in a sad mood,' he said, 'Venerius came running up' On the other hand, in result clauses after verbs meaning 'it happened that...', the imperfect subjunctive is always used even of a simple perfective action, which, if the grammatical construction did not require a subjunctive, would be expressed by a perfect indicative:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 319. : (Nepos)Nepos, Alcibiades 3.2. :'it happened that in a single night all the statues of Hermes were thrown down except one' In indirect questions in a historic context, an imperfect subjunctive usually represents the transformation of a present indicative:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 296. : (Cicero)Cicero, F\u012bn. 2.30. :'Epaminondas asked whether his shield was safe' Similarly, in the following example after , the imperfect subjunctive also represents the transformation of a present indicative: : (Curtius)Curtius 3.8.14. :'nor did the Persians doubt that, now that they had abandoned Issus, the Macedonians were fleeing' However, when the context makes it clear that the reference is to the future, the imperfect subjunctive after can have a prospective or future meaning:Woodcock (1959), p. 136. : (Cicero)Cicero, Red. Pop. 14. :'and I didn't doubt that, if the republican government were restored, it would bring me back with it' An imperfect subjunctive can also have a prospective or future meaning after a verb of fearing or expecting:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 321. : (Nepos)Nepos, Hann. 9.1. :'fearing that he might be handed over to the Romans, he fled to Crete' It can also have a prospective or future meaning in a relative clause:Goodrich (1917) : (Cicero)Cicero, Phil. 3.11. :'before dawn he announced those vows which he was never to fulfil' In the protasis of a conditional clause in indirect speech the imperfect subjunctive can similarly represent a future indicative:Woodcock (1959), p. 239. : (Livy)Livy, 9.29.4. :'with the intention of remaining inactive, unless (at some future time) the Etruscans were to attack of their own accord' ======== Just as the verb 'I am' has a future infinitive , short for , so it also has a past-potential subjunctive , short for . This is not used in Caesar, but is common in Livy and Nepos.Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 166. It is used especially in conditional sentences,Lewis & Short, Latin Dictionary, s.v. sum. either in the protasis ('if' clause) or the apodosis (main clause), and it generally has a potential or future meaning. One common use, in combination with a perfect passive participle, is with the meaning 'would have been' in past conditional sentences: : (Livy)Livy, 3.22.9. :'and the army would have been annihilated if the woods hadn't provided cover for those who were fleeing' : (Livy)Livy, 2.51.2. :'and the city would have been besieged, if the consul Horatius had not been recalled' Another use is in indirect speech after 'if' as the equivalent of a future indicative in the original direct speech: : (Livy)Livy, 1.26.1. :'Tullus ordered him to keep the young men armed; he would need their help if (at some future time) there was a war with the people of Veii' : (Cicero)Cicero, Tusc. Disp. 3.38. :'(he was confident) that even if (the pain) were going to be very great, it would be brief' It can also be used with a future meaning in sentences like the following, which are not conditional: : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 7.21.2. :'I personally have no doubt [epistolary imperfect] that he will be in Apulia any moment now' : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 10.14.3. :'he said that he would far rather die in his own bed, whatever might happen in future' : (Sallust)Sallust, Cat/ 22. :'and it is said that he did this so that (in future) they would be more trustworthy to one other' : (Livy)Livy, 10.20.10. :'some were standing still, uncertain whether it would be safer to go forward or to retreat into the camp' : (Gellius)Gellius, 13.5.4. :'Aristotle replied that he would do what they wanted when it was going to seem to him a suitable time' With a perfect participle after or , + the perfect participle can represent a future perfect tense of a deponent or passive verb: : (Cicero)Cicero, 1.42, quoting from an unknown poet. :'the oracle told Priam that he should forbear to raise the first son who was going to be born to him subsequently' : (Livy)Livy 2.32.1. :'the senators began to be afraid that if the army were dismissed, there would be further secret meetings and conspiracies' : (Gellius)Gellius, 17.9.6. :'in case those letters were captured by the enemy and their plans discovered, they used to send them in this way' However, the same future perfect meaning can be expressed with a simple participle or by an ordinary pluperfect subjunctive: : (Caesar)Caesar, B.G. 5.48.4. :'he sent this in Greek, in case the letter was intercepted and our plans learnt by the enemy' : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 1.17.9. :'there was the greatest danger that if they didn't obtain any concession, they would be completely alienated from the Senate' In other sentences, however, it has no future meaning, merely potential, as in the following example, where it appears to be used simply for metrical convenience as the equivalent of in the second half: : (Ovid)Ovid, Met. 6.678. :'if it were made of ash-wood, it would be light in colour; if cornel-wood, there would be a knot in it' Similarly in the following conditional clause, it has a past, not future, meaning: : (Terence)Terence, Hec. 526. :'if I had ever seemed either of these things to you, I wouldn't have been made a mockery of by your deeds in this way' ===Perfect subjunctive=== ====Independent use==== In wishes, the perfect subjunctive expresses a wish for the past, leaving open the possibility that it may have happened:Woodcock (1959), p. 88. : (Cicero)Cicero, Rep. 4.8. :'I hope that I have prophesied correctly!' Sometimes the perfect subjunctive seems to refer to present or future time, and mean 'could'.Woodcock (1959), p. 90. For example, in the following idiom the perfect is usual: :Cicero, Verr. 2.4.94. :'I couldn't easily say (= I don't think) that I have ever seen anything more beautiful' In a conditional sentence it can mean 'would do':Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 383. : (Juvenal) :'these days no one would give Cicero even two hundred tuppences, unless a huge ring glittered (on his finger)' In the following, it is the transference into hypothetical mood of a future perfect indicative, describing a future potential result: : (Plautus)Plautus, Cas. 424. :'if I were to hang myself now, I would simply end up having given pleasure to my enemies' In the following sentence both 'could' and 'could have' are possible:Woodcock (1959), p. 154. : (Livy)Livy 26.49.3. :'I could have written that the number of captives was as many as sixty, if I were to follow the Greek authority' In other examples the perfect subjunctive definitely refers to the past and means 'could have done' or 'would have done':Woodcock (1959), pp. 90\u201391. : (Cicero)Cicero, Off. 1.75. :'Themistocles could have said nothing about how he himself helped the Areopagus' : (Livy)Livy, 21.38.7. :'both of these passes would have brought (Hannibal) down to the Libuan Gauls' With the negative particle it can express a negative command. Here the subjunctive has a jussive use, not potential: :Cicero, Tusc. 1.98. :'you should not fear death' ====In dependent clauses==== The perfect subjunctive is most commonly used in dependent clauses. Usually it represents what would be a perfect indicative in an independent clause. However, since there is no way of expressing an imperfect tense in primary sequence except using the perfect subjunctive, it could also sometimes represent an imperfect indicative.Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 315; Woodcock (1959), pp. 136, 224, 226; Allen & Greenough (1903), p. 304. The perfect subjunctive is generally found when the main verb is one of the primary (i.e. non-past) tenses. One common use is in indirect questions when the context is primary: : (Nepos)Nepos, Timoth. 4.2. :'from this it will be easily conjectured how dear he was to his people' : (Cicero)Cicero, Phil. 7.26. :'we do not yet know what the ambassadors have done' (or 'were doing', or 'did') : (Seneca the Elder)Seneca, Controv. 2.4.1. :'I don't know whether I was standing or sitting' Verbs in subordinate clauses in indirect speech (or implied indirect speech) are also always in the subjunctive mood: : (Cicero)Att. 10.3A.2 :'Caesar is pardoning me by means of a letter for the fact that I didn't come' : (Plautus)Plautus, Cist. 101. :'my mother is angry because I didn't return' It can also be used after , both after a primary and after a historic verb: : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 12.38.1. :'I have no doubt that you were very busy' (original or ) : (Cicero)Cicero, Verr. 2.5.140. :'there was no one in Lilybaeum who did not see it' It can also be used in a result clause after a historic verb as in the following: : (Cicero)Cicero, Verr. 2.5.27. :'he showed himself to be so tough and energetic that no one ever saw him sitting on a horse' In the following sentence it is used after with a causal sense ('inasmuch as' or 'in view of the fact that'):Allen & Greenough (1903), p. 345. : (Cicero)Att 10.10.1 :'I must be blind that I didn't see this before!' It can also follow in a restrictive clause:Allen & Greenough (1903), p. 345. : (Cicero)Cicero, Brutus 65. :'the speeches of Cato, at least such as I have discovered' ===Pluperfect subjunctive=== ====Independent use==== In independent sentences, the pluperfect subjunctive means 'would have done', 'might have done', could have done' or 'should have done'. One common use is in conditional sentences, where the pluperfect subjunctive is used to express a hypothetical event in the past, which might have taken place, but did not. This usage is found as early as Plautus:Woodcock (1959), p. 154. : (Plautus)Plautus, Trin. 927. :'if you had called him, he would have replied' Another use, when it represents the transformation of the future perfect tense, is to describe a hypothetical event which is yet to take place: : (Livy)Livy, 2.40.8. :'therefore if I had not given birth, Rome would not now be being attacked; if I did not have a son, I would have died as a free woman in a free country' It can also express a hypothetical event in the past which is wished for, but which did not take place: : (Cicero)Cicero, In Cat. 2.4. :'if only he had led out all his forces with him!' In the following sentence Queen Dido contemplates what 'might have been':Williams, R.D. (1972), The Aeneid of Virgil note on 4.604\u20136. : (Virgil)Virgil, Aen. 4.604\u20135. :'I could have carried torches into the camp and filled the gangways with flames' Others see the pluperfect subjunctive in such sentences as a wish ('if only I had carried!'); others again as jussive ('I ought to have carried!').See Sonnenschein (1911), p. 244; cf. also Aeneid 10.850, 11.162. A more certain example of the jussive pluperfect is in the following example from Cicero, using the negative :Woodcock (1959), p. 87. : (Cicero)Cicero, Verr. 3.195. :'what was it your duty to do? you ought to have returned the money, you ought not to have bought the corn' ====In dependent clauses==== In dependent clauses, the most common meaning of the pluperfect subjunctive is 'had done'. In a conditional clause it describes a hypothetical situation that didn't actually happen: : (Tacitus)Tacitus, Hist. 1.49. :'by everyone's consent, Galba would have been seen as capable of being Emperor, had he never become one' Another very frequent use of the pluperfect subjunctive is after cum in a temporal clause: : (Cicero)Cicero, de Off. 3.112. :'when he heard this, he is said to have hurried to Rome' Another use is in indirect speech in a past-time context, where the pluperfect subjunctive is often a transformation of a perfect indicative in direct speech.Woodcock (1959), p. 136. In the following example, the original direct question would have had the perfect tense (): : (Cicero)Cicero, Cat. 2.13. :'I asked Catiline whether he had been at a night- time meeting at Marcus Laeca's house or not' But in some sentences, the pluperfect subjunctive is a reflection of an original imperfect indicative, as in the following example, where the original verbs would have been and :Woodcock (1959), pp. 224, 225. : (Livy)Livy 42.33.3. :'[he said] that they begged just one favour, that they should be not assigned lower ranks than those which they had held when they were on military service' In other sentences, the pluperfect is a reflection of a future perfect indicative, put into historic sequence. The original words of the following sentence would presumably have been 'if you do (will have done) otherwise, you will be doing Caesar a disservice': : (Cicero)Cicero, Fam. 8.11.2. :'he said that if the man were to do otherwise, he would be doing Caesar a disservice' ==The imperative mood== The imperative mood has two tenses, present and future. ===Present imperative=== ====Positive commands==== The present imperative mood is the normal tense used for giving direct orders which the speaker wishes to be carried out at once. The active form can be made plural by adding -te: : (Catullus)Catullus 5. :'give me a thousand kisses, then a hundred!' : (Livy)Livy 1.58.7 :'give me your right hands and your oath!' Deponent verbs such as 'I set out' or 'I follow' have an imperative ending in -re or -min\u012b (plural): : (Cicero)Cicero, Cat. 1.10 :'the gates are open: depart!' : (Terence)Terence, Hec. 793 :'follow me this way inside, both of you' ====Negative commands==== An imperative is usually made negative by using (literally, 'be unwilling!') plus the infinitive: : (Seneca the Elder)Seneca the Elder, Controv. 7.7.2 :'don't be surprised' However, in poetry an imperative can sometimes be made negative with the particle n\u0113: : (Virgil)Virgil, Aen. 12.875 :'do not terrify me, who am already scared, obscene birds!' A negative order can also use the perfect subjunctive:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 173. : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 4.17.4. :'do not be afraid on my account' In later Latin, plus the present subjunctive became more common, for example in the Vulgate Bible.Gerd V.M. Haverling, in Baldi & Cuzzolin (eds), p. 400. In the following example the first three verbs use the present subjunctive, and the third the perfect subjunctive: : (Mark, 10.19) :'do not commit adultery, do not kill, do not steal, do not give false testimony' ===Future imperative=== Latin also has a Future imperative or 2nd imperative,Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 174. ending in -t\u014d(te), used to request someone to do something at a future time, or if something else happens first: : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 10.1.3 :'if anything happens, write to me' : (Plautus)Plautus, 770. :'ask tomorrow; it will be given to you' This imperative is very common in early writers such as Plautus and Cato, but it is also found in later writers such as Martial: : (Terence)Terence, Eunuchus, 592. :'when we have finished washing, get washed if you wish' : (Cato)Cato, de Agri Cultura 156. :'if you are (going to be) eating it (cabbage) raw, dip it in vinegar' : (Martial)Martial, 2.28. :'Sextillus, _laugh out_ loud at these people who call you a 'faggot' and _show_ them the middle finger' Some verbs have only the second imperative, for example 'know', 'remember'.Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 174. ===3rd person formal imperative=== Related to the colloquial future imperative is the formal imperative (usually used in the 3rd person) of legal language, as in this invented law from Cicero's : : (Cicero)Cicero, Leg. 3.8. :'there shall be two men with royal power; and from consulting they are to be called 'consuls'; they are to obey nobody; for them the welfare of the people is to be the supreme law' According to J.G.F. Powell, is not a genuine archaic form; in early Latin is used only in deponent verbs and is 2nd or 3rd person singular.Powell (2005), p. 137. ==Periphrastic tenses== A series of periphrastic tenses can be formed by combining a future participle (e.g. 'going to lead') or a gerundive (e.g. 'needing to be led') with any tense of the verb 'I am', as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Periphrastic tenses ! ! Active ! Meaning ! Passive ! Meaning |- ! Present | ' || I am going to lead || ' || I need to be led |- ! Future | ' || I will be going to lead || ' || I will need to be led |- ! Imperfect | ' || I was going to lead || ' || I needed to be led |- ! Perfect | ' || I was going to lead || ' || I needed to be led |- ! Future perfect | (no examples) || || ' || I will have needed to be led'' |- ! Pluperfect | ' || I had been going to lead || ' || I had needed to be led |- ! | |- ! Present subj. | ' || I am going to lead || ' || I need to be led |- ! Imperfect subj. | ' || I was going to lead || ' || I needed to be led |- ! Perfect subj. | ' || I would have led || ' || I needed to be led |- ! Pluperfect subj. | ' || I had been going to lead || ' || I had needed to be led |- |} The passive tenses formed with the gerundive are known as the 'periphrastic conjugation of the passive'.Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 166. Although the two series are similar in appearance, they are not parallel in meaning or function. Woodcock writes of the passive form: 'But for the introduction of the idea of necessity, it would form a periphrastic future passive tense parallel to the periphrastic future active.'Woodcock (1959), p. 163. For this reason, examples of the gerundival periphrastic tenses are gathered in a separate section below. ===Periphrastic indicative=== ====Periphrastic future==== The present version of the future periphrastic describes a person's intention at the present time: : (Cicero)Cicero, Fam. 8.7.2. :'Paulla Valeria is planning to marry Decimus Brutus' : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 15.20.4. :'I'm not intending to leave until the money is paid' ====Future periphrastic future==== Despite its name, the future periphrastic tense is really a present tense, describing a person's present intentions. For this reason, it can have a future form , used for example in future conditional or future temporal clauses: : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 12.34.2. :'but if you come to any arrangement with Silius, even if it is on the very day I am due to come, please let me know' ====Imperfect periphrastic future==== A past version of the periphrastic future can be made with the imperfect tense of sum, describing what someone's intentions were at a moment in the past: : (Servius to Cicero)Cicero, Fam. 4.12.1. :'on the next day he was intending to sail to Italy' : (Ovid)Ovid, Met. 3.200. :'when she saw her face and horns in the water, \"o poor me!\" she was about to say, but no words came out' In a conditional sentence this tense can mean 'would have done':Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 386. : (Ovid)Ovid, Trist. 1.7.40. :'I would have removed the faults, if I had been free to do it' ====Perfect periphrastic future==== Although less common than the periphrastic future with , the perfect tense version of the periphrastic future is also found:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 164. : (Seneca)Seneca, Ep. 71.11. :'on the day Cato was defeated in the election, he played; on the night he was intending to die, he read' This tense can also be potential, expressing the meaning 'would have done': : (Curtius)Curtius 7.1.39. :'if I had not obeyed you, I would rightly have paid the penalty' ====Pluperfect periphrastic future==== : (Livy)Livy 10.11.4. :'... whom the Senate had been intending to order should be declared dictator' ===Periphrastic subjunctive=== ====Periphrastic present subjunctive==== In indirect statements and questions, the active periphrastic future can represent a future or periphrastic future tense of direct speech in primary sequence. In this case there is not necessarily any idea of planning or intention, although there may be:Woodcock (1959), pp. 228\u2013229. : (Cicero)Cicero Fam. 3.6.5. :'I don't know when I'm going to see you' : (Cicero)Cicero, Fam. 7.16.3. :'let me know in detail what you are doing and whether at all you are planning to come to Italy this winter' This tense can also be used in primary sequence reported speech, to represent the main clause in either an ideal conditional sentence or a simple future one (according to the grammars, the distinction between these two disappears in indirect speech):Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 418; Woodcock (1959), p. 237. : (Cicero)Cicero, Tusc. 2.51. :'we ourselves have never seen such a (perfectly wise) man; but it is explained in the opinions of philosophers what such a person _would be_ like, if one were ever to exist' ====Periphrastic imperfect subjunctive==== If the main verb is in past time, an imperfect version of the periphrastic future subjunctive is used: : (Cicero)Cicero Att. 15.9.2. :'I wasn't sure whether you were going to receive this letter' It is also possible to form an imperfect periphrastic subjunctive with instead of (the first instance of this is in Sallust):Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 164. : (Sallust)Sallust, Jugurtha 109.2. :'he said that he had come to ask him whether he was intending to make peace or war' ====Periphrastic perfect subjunctive==== A perfect periphrastic subjunctive can be used with a conditional meaning ('would have done') in hypothetical conditional clauses in indirect questions in primary sequence. In this case it represents a pluperfect subjunctive in the original direct speech:Woodcock (1959), p. 139. : (Livy)Livy 9.33.7. :'tell us, Appius Claudius, what you would have done, if you had been censor at that time?' : (Cicero)Cicero, Lig 34. :'can anyone doubt that if Quintus Ligarius had been able to be in Italy, he would have been of the same opinion as his brothers were?' In an indirect question, the perfect periphrastic subjunctive can also sometimes reflect a potential imperfect subjunctive:Woodcock (1959), p. 139. : (Seneca)Seneca, Ep. 32.2. :'imagine how much speed you would put on, if an enemy were threatening you from behind!' These tenses can be compared with the similar examples with the perfect periphrastic infinitive cited below, where a conditional sentence made in imperfect subjunctives is converted to an indirect statement. ====Periphrastic pluperfect subjunctive==== The pluperfect version of the periphrastic subjunctive can be used in a circumstantial clause: : (Cicero)Cicero, Phil. 3.24. :'when Antony was about to bring some motion about the republic, a message suddenly arrived about the 4th legion and he lost his composure' It can also be used in conditional sentences after , as in the following sentence from an imaginary letter from Helen to Paris: : (Ovid)Ovid, Heroides 17.91. :'by flatteries such as these, if I had been going to sin, I might have been persuaded' It can also reflect a potential pluperfect subjunctive ('would have done') in historic sequence in an indirect question:Woodcock (1959), p. 139. : (Livy)Livy, 10.45.3. :'it occurred to them how impossible Etruria would have been, if anything had gone wrong in Samnium' ===Gerundive tenses=== ====Present gerundive==== The gerundive of the verb (an adjectival form ending in -ndus) can be combined with the verb 'I am' to make a passive periphrastic tense. This usually expresses what is needing to be done: : (Pliny)Pliny, Ep. 3.15.2. :'I don't need to be asked or encouraged' (i.e. I will do it willingly) : (Celsus)Celsus, de Medicina 6.10.3. :'tumours of this kind need to be lanced' ====Negative==== The negative gerundive usually means 'not needing to be', as in the first example above. However, sometimes the interpretation 'ought not to be' or 'it isn't possible for it to be' is more appropriate: : (Seneca)Seneca, Constant. 2.7.2. :'you do not need to be reminded now that no one is good except the wise man' : (Ovid) :'the story of Achilles shouldn't (or can't) be told using the metre of Callimachus' ====Impersonal construction==== Very often the passive periphrastic is used impersonally, together with a dative of the agent: : (Cicero)Cicero, ' 2. :'a decision needs to be made by you today' The impersonal form of this tense can also be made with intransitive verbs such as 'I go' and verbs such as 'I persuade' and 'I use' which do not take an accusative object:Woodcock (1959), p. 163. : (Cicero)Cicero, Mur. 18. :'there is no need to reply to everything' : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 13.9.2. :'I have to go to Arpinum' : (Celsus)Celsus, Med. 6.7.3a. :'when there is need for them to be used, these ingredients are diluted with vinegar' ====Future gerundive==== An example of a future gerundive periphrastic is the following: : (Cicero)Cicero, pro Fonteio 36. :'since that isn't possible, we will need to ask my friend, Marcus Plaetorius' ====Imperfect gerundive==== An example of the imperfect passive periphrastic is the following: : (Cicero)Cicero, Mil. 66 :'he was afraid not only of those things which needed to be feared, but everything' ====Perfect gerundive==== As with the active perfect periphrastic, in a conditional sentence the perfect gerundive periphrastic tense can mean 'would have done':Woodcock (1959), p. 156. : (Livy)Livy 2.38.5. :'if you had delayed just one day, you would all have died' Another meaning of the perfect passive is 'ought to have been done': : (Cicero)Cicero, Phil. 11.20. :'either his army ought to have been taken away or he should have been given the command' In the following result clause, this tense becomes subjunctive: : (Cicero) :'what you write about Pomptinus is correct: for the result is that, if he is going to be in Brundisium before the 1st June, there was less need for Marcus Anneius and Lucius Tullius to be urged to hurry' ====Future perfect gerundive==== The active future perfect periphrastic tense is not found, but the passive occurs: : (Vitruvius)Vitruvius, de Architectura 2.7.5. :'whenever it is necessary for a building to be made (using local stone), the stones for it should be quarried two years in advance' ==Sequence of tenses rule== Latin speakers used subjunctive verbs to report questions, statements, and ideas. When the verb of telling or asking in the dominant clause is primary, the subjunctive verb in the dependent clause must also be primary; when the verb in the dominant clause is historic, the subjunctive verb in the dependent clause must also be in a historic tense. This rule can be illustrated with the following table:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 315. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Sequence of tenses rule ! ! Main verb ! Dependent verb |- ! Primary tenses | Present Future Future Perfect (Perfect) || Present subjunctive Perfect subjunctive |- ! Historic tenses | Perfect Imperfect Pluperfect Historic infinitive | Imperfect subjunctive Pluperfect subjunctive |} This rule applies to all kinds of sentences where the dependent verb is put in the subjunctive mood, for example indirect speech, indirect questions, indirect commands, purpose clauses, consecutive clauses, clauses after verbs of fearing, clauses and others. It does not apply to more loosely connected dependent clauses, such as relative clauses, where the verb is in the indicative, or to a dependent infinitive in indirect statement. The perfect tense appears in both rows, depending on whether it has a present perfect meaning ('have done', primary) or past simple meaning ('did', historic). But even when it has a present perfect meaning it is often treated as a historic tense (see further below). ===Examples of primary sequence=== Some examples of primary sequence are the following: Present indicative + present subjunctive: : (Cicero)Cicero, Clu. 72 :'they ask where it is' Present subjunctive + present subjunctive: : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 15.4.4. :'I hope it is true' Present imperative + periphrastic perfect subjunctive: : (Livy)Livy, 9.33.7. :'tell us what you would have done' Present indicative + Perfect subjunctive: : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 8.12B.1. :'I wonder what the reason was that you changed your plan' ===Examples of historic sequence=== Reported Question: : (Cicero)Cicero, Verr. 2.5.107 :'people asked where he was' Imperfect subjunctive + pluperfect subjunctive: : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 15.4.4. :'I wish it had been true' Perfect indicative + imperfect subjunctive: : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 7.15.2. :'the Senate decreed that he should go at once' Historic infinitive + imperfect subjunctive:Postgate (1905), p. 443. : (Sallust)Sallust, Cat. 27.2. :'he constantly encouraged them to be always on their guard and ready' ===Perfect tense main verb=== When the main verb is a perfect tense, it is usually considered to be a historic tense, as in the above example. Occasionally, however, when the meaning is that of an English present perfect, the perfect in a main clause may be taken as a primary tense, for example:Woodcock (1959), p. 107; Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 317. : (Cicero)Cicero, Fam. 12.27. :'I haven't yet quite made my mind up whether our friend Trebatius has brought me more trouble or pleasure' : (Plautus)Plautus Amph. 195. :'he has sent me home ahead of him so that I can take this news to his wife' However, the historic sequence after a perfect with present perfect meaning is also very common,Woodcock (1959), p. 102.Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 317. for example: : (Cicero)Cicero, Tusc. Disp. 1.14. :'you have compelled me to confess' : (Plautus)Plautus, Trin. 591. :'at last I've got him to go away!' ===Historic present main verb=== When the main verb is a historic present, the dependent verb may be either primary or historic, but is usually primary:Postgate (1905), p. 443. : (Livy)Livy 1.58.5. :'she sends a message that they should come' (both verbs primary) : (Livy)Livy 9.4.2. :'they send ambassadors to ask for peace' (second verb historic) Sometimes both primary and historic are found in the same sentence. In the following example the first dependent verb is primary sequence, but is pluperfect:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 317. : (Cicero)Cicero, Quinct. 5.18. :'he asked him to pay attention to what he had said' ===Exceptions=== There are frequent exceptions to the sequence of tenses rule, especially outside of indirect speech. For example, in the following sentence, a historic tense is followed by a perfect subjunctive:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 317. : (Cicero)Cicero, Phil. 2.61. :'what soldier was there who did not see her in Brundisium?' In consecutive clauses also, a perfect tense in the main clause is often followed by a present or a perfect subjunctive:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 318. : (Cicero)Cicero, Verr. 1.4.12. :'Verres so harried Sicily for three years that it cannot be restored to its original state.' Another exception is that an imperfect or pluperfect subjunctive in a clause that is already subordinate in the original sentence may often remain even in primary sequence: : (Livy)Livy, 9.33.7. :'tell us what you would have done if you had been censor?' Conversely, in such conditional sentences, the periphrastic perfect subjunctive may remain even after a historic-tense main verb:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 387. : (Livy)Livy, 4.38.5. :'nor was there any doubt that if they had been able, the enemies would have fled' The perfect tense also can replace a pluperfect tense with the meaning 'could have':Gildersleeve & Lodge, (1895), p. 387; Woodcock (1959), pp. 139\u201340. : (Livy)Livy, 4.38.5. :'there was no doubt that, if that delay had not intervened, the Carthaginian camp could have been captured on that day' In general, in Livy, there is a tendency for a present or perfect tense of the original speech to be retained in historic sequence, as in the above example, while Cicero is more strict in following the historic sequence.Andrewes (1951), p. 143. Caesar and Sallust can sometimes use a present subjunctive in historic sequence when the meaning is jussive (although this practice is not always followed):Andrewes (1951), p. 143. * (Sallust)Sallust, Cat. 34; contrast Caesar, B.G. 1.7.5. :'he replied that if they wished to make any request from the Senate, they should disarm' ==The infinitive== ===Overview=== The various tenses of the infinitive are as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Infinitive tenses ! ! Active ! Meaning ! Passive ! Meaning |- ! Present | || to love to see to lead to do to hear to be to be able to want to be unwilling to prefer to go to bring || || to be loved to be seen to be led to be done to be heard \u2013 to be brought |- ! Perfect | ' || to have led || ' || to have been led |- ! Future | ' || to be going to lead || ' || to be going to be led |- ! Perfect periphrastic | ' || to have been going to lead || || |- ! Future perfect periphrastic | || || 'Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 334 note 1; Woodcock (1959), p. 22. || to be going to have been led'' |- ! Gerundive present | || || ' || to be needing to be led'' |- ! Gerundive perfect | || || ' || to have been needing to be led'' |- ! Gerundive future | || || ' || to be going to need to be led'' |- |} The present passive and deponent infinitive usually ends in -r\u012b (e.g. ' 'to be loved', ' 'to promise'), but in 3rd conjugation verbs in -\u012b only (e.g. ' 'to be captured', ' 'to follow'). The passive ' is used impersonally: : (Livy)Livy 2.6.8. :'Brutus noticed that an attack was being made on him' In 1st conjugation verbs, the ending is very often shortened to , e.g. ' 'to have loved'. The infinitives of 'I am' are ' 'to be', ' 'to have been', and ' (often shortened to ') 'to be going to be'. Other irregular present infinitives are ' (sometimes in Plautus and Lucretius ') 'to be able', and '/' 'to eat'. The irregular verbs 'I am able' and 'I want' have no future infinitive. In these verbs the present infinitive is used instead.Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 334, note 3. In early Latin (especially Plautus), the passive and deponent infinitive often ends in -ier: ' 'to be scolded', ' 'to be seen', ' 'to obtain', ' 'to wake up' etc. ====Compound infinitives==== The compound infinitives are usually found in the accusative case, as shown in the table above. Occasionally, however, they are found in the nominative, for example with 'he is said' or 'he seems': : (Cicero)Cicero, Fam. 14.23. :'he is said to be planning to come' The participle can also change to show gender and plurality, as in the following where is feminine plural: : (Cicero)Cicero, Mil. 31. :'it is agreed that an ambush was made' However, the passive future infinitive (') is made using the supine of the verb. The -um therefore stays constant and does not change for gender or number. The future infinitive is used only for indirect statements (see below).Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 331, note 3. ====Omission of ==== Very often the part of a compound infinitive is omitted: : (Seneca)Seneca, d\u0113 C\u014dns\u014dl\u0101ti\u014dne 11.16.1. :'he heard that his brother had been killed' : (Caesar)Caesar, B.C. 3.58.5. :'Pompey reckoned that he needed to attempt something' : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 9.6A.1. :'I am sure that I will come to the city soon' ===Historic infinitive=== The infinitive is occasionally used in narrative as a tense in its own right. It usually describes a scene in which the same action was being done repeatedly. There are often two or more historic infinitives in succession:Woodcock (1959), p. 15. : (Sallust)Sallust, Jug. 101.11. :'then there was a ghastly spectacle on the open plains: people were chasing, fleeing, being killed, being captured' : (Cicero)Cicero, Verr. 2.5.17. :'the poor man kept shouting, as he was being dragged away, that he had done nothing' ==='Could have done', 'ought to have done'=== The perfect tense with the infinitive can often mean 'I was able to' or 'I managed to': : (Cicero)Cicero, Am\u012bc. 73. :'Scipio managed to make Publius Rupilius Consul, but he wasn't able to do the same for Rupilius's brother Lucius' However, it can also mean 'I could have done (but did not)': : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 3.15.8. :'what I was and what I could have been, I can now no longer be' It can also be used in unreal past conditional sentences in the sense 'could have done':Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 386; Woodcock (1959), p. 139. : (Juvenal)Juvenal, 10.123. :'(Cicero) could have despised Antony's swords (i.e. would have had no reason to fear them), if he had spoken everything in this way!' : (Cicero)Cicero, Planc. 60. :'you ask what more Plancius could have achieved, if he had been the son of Gnaeus Scipio' 'Ought to have done' is often expressed with a past tense of 'I have a duty to' or 'it is fitting' together with a present infinitive: : (Cicero)Cicero, Dom. 5. :'you ought not to have come to the Senate on that day' : (Cicero)Cicero, Fam. 6.13.1. :'although I ought to have written something to you, yet I still have not done so' (epistolary pluperfect) Sometimes, in familiar style, can be used with the perfect infinitive passive:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 180. : (Cicero)Cicero, Cat. 1.2.5. :'this ought to have been done long ago' ===Indirect statement=== The infinitive is very commonly used for the main verb in indirect statements. Except with passive sentences using 'he is said' or 'he seems' and the like, the subject of the quoted sentence is put into the accusative case and the construction is known as an 'accusative and infinitive'. The rule of tense is that the present infinitive is used for any action or situation which is contemporary with the main verb, the perfect for actions or situations anterior to the main verb, and the future infinitive for actions or situations later than the main verb.Gildersleeve & Lodge (1959), p. 333. An exception to this rule is the verb 'I remember', which when used of personal reminiscence (e.g. 'I remember being present') is usually followed by a present infinitive.Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 181. The verbs 'I order' and 'I want' are always followed by the present infinitive, however. Occasionally also 'I promise' and 'I threaten' can be followed by a present infinitive, if no accusative subject is added.Woodcock (1959), p. 21.Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 334. ====Present infinitive==== The present infinitive is used to express an action or situation simultaneous with the verb of speaking: : (Cicero)Cicero, Off. 1.30.108. :'Solon pretended that he was mad' : (Nepos)Nepos, Hann. 12.5. :'(Hannibal) realised that he was being sought' The present infinitive is used after when describing a personal reminiscence:Lewis & Short, Latin Dictionary, s.v. . : (Seneca the Elder)Seneca the Elder, 3.7.16. :'I remember going into his school when he was just about to recite a speech against Milo' It also represents a present imperative (or jussive subjunctive) in indirect commands made with the verbs 'I order' and 'I forbid':Woodcock (1959), p. 102. : (Eutropius)Eutropius, 2.11. :'he ordered that they should be led through the camp, shown the whole army, and then dismissed' ====Perfect infinitive==== In indirect statement, a perfect infinitive represents any event or situation prior to the time of the verb of speaking: : (Cicero)Cicero, Verr. 2.1.80. :'you say that your bodyguard was killed' : ([Caesar])Bellum Alexandr\u012bnum 10. :'they learnt that Caesar had come' : (Servius to Cicero)Cicero Fam. 4.12.2. :he brought me news that Marcus Marcellus had been stabbed with a dagger and had received two wounds' Often the verb of speaking is omitted: : (Livy)Livy, 1.58.5. :'a terrible thing had happened' (she said) The perfect infinitive may also at times be translated with a continuous tense in English: : (Caesar)Caesar, B.C. 3.105.1. :'he discovered that Titus Ampius had been trying to steal money from the temple of Diana in Ephesus' ====Future infinitive==== The future infinitive is used for events or situations in reported speech which are to take place later than the verb of speaking: : (Cicero)Cicero, Fam. 5.5.3. :'I am sure that you will do everything' As with the perfect passive infinitive, is often omitted: : (Nepos)Nepos, Hann. 12.3. :'they would easily find the place where he was (he said)' The future passive made using the supine of the verb with is comparatively rare:Woodcock (1959), p. 113. : (Terence)Terence, Hecyra 38. :'a rumour came that a gladiator show was going to be given' The verb 'I am able' has no future infinitive, but can have a future meaning:Woodcock (1959), p. 113. : (Caesar)Caesar, 1.3.7. :'they hope that they will be able to gain control of the whole of Gaul' ======== Another way of expressing the future in indirect statement is to use the phrase 'it would be the case that'. This can be used with an active or passive verb, and almost always with either the present or the imperfect subjunctive:Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), pp. 165, 334. : (Cicero)Cicero, Tusc. 1.34. :'I hope that we shall have that good fortune' : (Tacitus)Tacitus, Ann. 14.9. :'the astrologers replied that (Nero) would become Emperor, and that he would kill his mother' : (Cicero)Cicero, Verr. 2.4.86. :'they all thought that the poor man was going to be beaten with rods' Sometimes is used instead of : : (Cicero)Cicero, de Div. 1.101. :'(the voice predicted) that unless precautions were taken, Rome would be captured' Very rarely can be followed by a perfect or pluperfect subjunctive.Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 165. In the following example, the pluperfect subjunctive represents a future perfect indicative of direct speech: : (Cicero to Plancus)Cicero, Att. 16.16E.2. :'I hope (epistolary imperfect) that by the time you receive this letter, what I requested from you in my earlier letter will have been granted' ====Future perfect infinitive==== To express a future perfect tense in indirect statement is possible only if the verb is passive or deponent.Woodcock (1959), p. 22; Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 334, note 1. In the following examples, a perfect participle is combined with the future infinitive : : (Livy)23.13.6; cf. Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 334. :'the Carthaginians thought that the war was soon going to have been brought to an end' : (Cicero)Cicero, Tusc. 4.46. :'if someone were to remove fear, all carefulness of life would be removed too' : (Cicero)Cicero, Sull. 27. :'I can say this, that I will have achieved enough, if no danger redounds on me' ====Periphrastic perfect infinitive==== The periphrastic perfect infinitive represents a potential pluperfect subjunctive ('would have done') in indirect statement:Woodcock (1959), p. 235. : (Livy)Livy, 30.15. :'but take this message to him, that I would have died better if I had not married on the day of my funeral!' : (Cicero)Cicero, Post Reditum 17. :'he said that if I had not been consul, the republic would have been completely finished' If the introductory verb is passive, such as 'he seems', the participle is nominative: : (Quintilian)Quintilian, 5.12.3. :'it is unlikely that he would have told a lie unless he had been desperate' The same tense of the infinitive can also represent the transformation into indirect statement of an imperfect potential subjunctive, referring to a hypothetical present situation:Terrell (1904) collects numerous examples. Cf. also Woodcock (1959), pp. 236\u20137; Allen & Greenough (1903), pp. 383\u20134. : (Cicero)Cicero, d\u0113 D\u012bv. 2.141. :'do you think any old woman would ever be so crazy as to believe in dreams if they didn't come true by chance sometimes?' : (Pliny)Pliny, Ep. 4.22.6. :'what do we think would be happening to him if he were alive?' \u2013 'he would be dining with us!' : (Cicero)Cicero, F\u012bn. 5.31.93. :'they confess that they would not lift a finger for the sake of virtue, unless virtue itself gave pleasure' : (Cicero to Marcellus)Cicero, Fam. 4.9.1. :'do you suppose that the person (i.e. Pompey) who hadn't followed your very wise advice when you were consul, nor was willing to consult you and your brother when your brother held the consulship, would now, if he were holding supreme power, be wanting our opinions?' In all the above examples, the imperfect subjunctive in the subordinate clause is left unchanged, despite the fact that the main verb is primary. Just as is used to make a future passive infinitive, so can be used to make a potential passive infinitive:Allen & Greenough (1903), p. 383. : (Caesar)Caesar, B.C. 3.101.3. :'if at that very moment certain reports had not arrived bringing news of Caesar's victory, most people reckoned that the town would have been lost' However this is very rare, and in fact only two instances have been noted (the other being Cicero Tusc. 3.69).Woodcock (1959), p. 236. ====Gerundive infinitives==== The gerundive infinitive in indirect speech indicates something which needs to be done at the time of the verb of speaking: : (Cicero)Cicero, Fam. 16.4.2. :'I think something should be given to the doctor himself' The perfect gerundive infinitive indicates something that was necessary at a previous time: : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 4.15.2. :'I imagine that it was unavoidable for you to undertake that journey to Asia' It can also refer to what ought to have been done at some time in the past:Allen & Greenough (1903), p. 381. : (Livy)Livy 31.48. :'what, pray, ought a praetor to have done?' In a conditional clause in reported speech the perfect gerundive infinitive can also refer to something that would have been necessary in some hypothetical situation: : (Tacitus)Tacitus, Ann. 11.36. :'and (he said that) there wouldn't be anyone who would be forced to die sooner than himself if Silius were Emperor' The future gerundive infinitive is made with . It is used in indirect statements to describe something which it is going to be necessary to do: : (Curtius)Curtius, 3.8.20. :'and so he had ordered his men to lay out their camp in that very place, delighted that it was going to be necessary to fight the decisive battle in that particular narrow plain' It can also describe what must necessarily happen at a future time: : (Curtius)Curtius 4.5.6. :'(he had written that) a person would inevitably grow old just visiting such a huge country, even without fighting a battle' ==An overview of the tenses in indirect speech== A characteristic of Roman historical writing is that long speeches are reported indirectly (). In this practice Roman writers such as Caesar, Sallust, Livy, Curtius, and Tacitus differ from Greek writers such as Thucydides, as well as from Roman poets such as Virgil and Ovid, who write their speeches in direct speech (). The rule for is that the infinitive is used to represent the main verbs of statements (this also sometimes applies to questions), while all other verbs, that is, those in commands, most questions, and subordinate clauses, are put into the subjunctive mood. The writer may use primary sequence or historic, or sometimes a mixture of the two.Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), pp. 416\u20137. The use of primary tenses in a historic context is known as .Woodcock (1959), p. 238; Postgate (1905); Ker (2007). In some cases, the use of the subjunctive indicates that the sentence is partly in . This is known as virtual :Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 340; Woodcock (1959), p. 238. : (Cicero)Cicero, Tusc. Disp. 5.105. :'wasn't Aristides expelled from his country because (people said) he was excessively righteous?' Subordinate clauses generally change their tenses less than the main clauses in reported speech. In some cases, when the main verb is 1st or 2nd person, the subordinate clause is not put in the subjunctive at all:Salmon (1931). : (Cicero)Cicero, Att. 1.2.1. :'I hope that if (Catiline) is acquitted, he will work more closely with me in my election campaign' The following table shows the tenses used in main clauses in indirect questions (subjunctive) and indirect statements (infinitive): {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ How tenses change when put into indirect speech (main clauses) ! Tense of original verb ! Subjunctive (primary) ! Subjunctive (historic) ! Infinitive |- ! Present, Imperative, Jussive subjunctive | Present || Imperfect || Present |- ! Imperfect, Perfect, Pluperfect | Perfect|| Pluperfect|| Perfect |- ! Future, Potential present subjunctive | Periphrastic present, (Present) || Periphrastic imperf., (Imperfect) ||Future, Fore ut + pres/impf subj. |- ! Future perfect | No examples || No examples||Perfect participle + fore, \\+ perf/pluperf subj. |- ! Potential imperfect subjunctive | Perfect periphrastic, Imperfect || Perfect periphrastic, Imperfect||Perfect periphrastic |- ! Potential pluperfect subjunctive | Perfect periphrastic, Pluperfect, Potuerit || Perfect periphrastic, (Plupf. periphrastic), Pluperfect, Potuerit ||Perfect periphrastic, \\+ pres/impf subj. |} ==Participles== Compared to Greek, Latin is deficient in participles, having only three, as follows, as well as the gerundive. The Romans themselvesDonatus Ars Minor: de participio; Quintilian 9.3.9. considered the gerundive also to be a participle, but most modern grammars treat it as a separate part of speech.Woodcock (1959), p. 71. The different participles of the verb are shown below: {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Participles and gerundive (3rd conjugation) ! ! Active ! ! Passive ! |- ! Present | ', pl. ' || leading || || |- ! Perfect | || || ', pl. ' || led, having been led |- ! Future | ', pl. ' || going to lead || || |- ! Gerundive | || || ', pl. ' || needing to be led |} The participles are all verbal adjectives, and so the ending changes according to case, gender, and number. As the table shows, there is no passive present or future participle, and no active past participle. In deponent verbs, however, the Perfect participle is active in meaning, e.g. , 'having set out', 'having tried'. In deponent verbs, the gerundive is usually used in impersonal form and with an active meaning: 'it is necessary to set out', 'it is necessary to die', 'it is necessary to try'; but some deponent verbs have a personal gerundive with a passive sense: 'needing to be encouraged', 'needing to be followed': : (Columella)Columella, 9.16.4. :'a middle course must be followed' Deponent verbs also have active present and future participles, e.g. 'dying', 'about to die'. The verb 'I am' has no Present or Perfect participle in classical Latin, but only the Future participle 'going to be'. The compound verbs and , however, form the Present participles . The verbs 'I want' and 'I am able' have no future participle. , the present participle of , has a limited use as an adjective meaning 'powerful'. The 3rd and 4th conjugation gerundive in older texts such as Plautus ends with -undus: , , .Gildersleeve & Lodge (1895), p. 89. Such endings are sometimes found even in classical Latin. Later, -endus became usual, but in the verb 'I go', the gerundive is always 'necessary to go'. Like the infinitive, the tenses of the participles are not absolute but relative to the main verb of the sentence. For example, a future participle can refer to an action in the past, provided it is later than the time of the main verb; and similarly the perfect participle can refer to an action in the future, provided it is earlier than the time of the main verb. ===Present participle=== The present participle usually describes a condition or an action which is happening at the time of the main verb: : (Cicero)Cicero, Ver. 2.1.67 :'he was doused with _boiling_ water' : (Livy)Livy, 1.58.2. :'having drawn his sword, he came to Lucretia while she was sleeping' Occasionally, a present participle can refer to an action which takes place immediately before the time of the main verb: : (Livy)Livy, 1.58.7. :'and when her husband asked \"are you all right?\" \"no!\" she replied' ===Perfect participle=== The perfect participle refers to an action which took place before the time of the main verb, or to the state that something is in as a result of an earlier action: : (Eutropius)Eutropius, 2.11 :'he buried the _dead_ (those who had been killed)' ===Future participle=== The future participle is most commonly used in the periphrastic tenses or in indirect statements (see examples above). 'An examination of the usage of the various authors shows that the form in -\u016brus did not reach the full status of a participle till the time of Livy. Up to the time of Caesar and Cicero its use was almost restricted to a combination with the verb , making a periphrastic future tense (Woodcock).Woodcock (1959), p. 82. Woodcock speculates that the -\u016brus ending might originally have been a verbal noun. In later authors the future participle is sometimes used as in Greek to indicate purpose: : (Pliny)Pliny, Ep. 6.16.9. :'he launched some warships, with a view to bringing help' ==Bibliography== *Andrewes, M.
