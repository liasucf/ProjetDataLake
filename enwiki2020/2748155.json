Finley wanted two years. His exasperated AL colleagues voted 9-1 that KC's offer was reasonable. **The San Francisco Giants sign pitcher Masanori Murakami\u201a third baseman Tatsuhiko Tanaka\u201a and catcher Hiroshi Takahashi, the first Japanese ballplayers ever to play for American teams. All three are assigned to the Magic Valley Cowboys of the Pioneer League. ===April=== *April 1 - Cleveland Indians manager Birdie Tebbetts suffered a heart attack. George Strickland will fill in for three months until the 51-year old skipper returns to the team with limited duties. *April 8 \u2013 Houston Colt .45s relief pitcher Jim Umbricht dies of cancer at the age of 33. In 1965, the franchise, by then known as the Astros, would retire his number. *April 9 - Much to the chagrin of team executive Branch Rickey the St. Louis Cardinals traded Jimmie Coker and Gary Kolb to the Milwaukee Braves for catcher Bob Uecker. After introducing himself, The Redbirds' new backstop is quickly informed by Rickey. \"I didn't want you, I wouldn't trade one Gary Kolb for a hundred Bob Ueckers\". *April 10 - Demolition of the Polo Grounds in Manhattan began, with the same wrecking ball that demolished Ebbets Field in Brooklyn four years earlier. *April 13 - After beating The Cincinnati Reds 6-3 in the traditional home opener in Cincinnati. Houston was in first place for the only time as the Houston Colt 45s. The next year they were known as The Houston Astros, in reflection of the NASA space program. *April 14 \u2013 Sandy Koufax goes all the way in his only opening day start, allowing no walks and beating the St. Louis Cardinals, 4\u20130. at Dodger Stadium. Frank Howard homers for the Dodgers. *April 17 \u2013 The New York Mets play their first game at brand-new Shea Stadium and lose 4\u20133 to the Pittsburgh Pirates. Willie Stargell hits the first home run in the stadium's history, a second-inning solo shot off the Mets' Jack Fisher. In the first-ever \"Kiner's Korner\" from Shea, Ralph Kiner's guest is Casey Stengel. *April 19 - The Mets win their first of 1,859 victories at Shea Stadium as they beat The Pirates 6-0 behind Al Jackson's 6-hitter. *April 23 \u2013 At Colt Stadium, Ken Johnson of the Houston Colt .45's no-hits his former team, the Cincinnati Reds, but loses 1\u20130. Two ninth-inning errors allow the Reds to score the game's lone run: a two-base throwing error by Johnson himself on Pete Rose's ground ball, and the second by Nellie Fox on Vada Pinson's grounder, which scores Rose. To date, the game is the only one in Major League history whose losing pitcher had pitched a nine-inning no-hitter. ===May=== *May 2 \u2013 The Minnesota Twins became the third club in MLB history to hit four consecutive home runs in the same inning, as Tony Oliva, Bob Allison, Jimmie Hall and Harmon Killebrew went deep in the top of the 11th inning in a 7\u20133 victory against the Kansas City Athletics. The Twins also became the first team to hit at least three consecutive home runs in an extra innings game.Baseball Reference \u2013 May 2, 1964, Twins at Athletics Box Score and Play by Play Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax *May 31 \u2013 The second game of a double header at Shea Stadium between the San Francisco Giants and New York Mets lasts 23 innings. The Giants eventually win it, 8\u20136. ===June=== *June 4 \u2013 Sandy Koufax pitches the third of his four career no hitters, to pace the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 3\u20130 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies at Connie Mack Stadium. *June 15 \u2013 The Chicago Cubs trade Lou Brock, Jack Spring and Paul Toth to the St. Louis Cardinals for Ernie Broglio, Doug Clemens and Bobby Shantz. The swap eventually gains notoriety as perhaps the most lopsided in the history of baseball, as Brock goes on to a Hall of Fame career in St. Louis while Broglio posts a 7\u201319 record in a Cubs uniform. *June 21 \u2013 On Father's Day at Shea Stadium, Jim Bunning fans ten, drives in two runs, and pitches the first perfect game (excluding Don Larsen's 1956 World Series effort, and Harvey Haddix's extra-innings loss) since Charlie Robertson's on April 30, , as the Philadelphia Phillies beat the New York Mets 6\u20130. Bunning also becomes the first pitcher to throw no-hitters in both leagues, and Gus Triandos becomes the first catcher to catch a no-hitter in each league. Bunning throws just 90 pitches in winning his second no-hitter. The next time Bunning faces the Mets he will shut them out, the first no-hit pitcher in the 20th century to do that. The Mets fare little better in the nightcap, as 18-year-old rookie Rick Wise pitches into the seventh inning to win his first game, giving up just three hits and three walks (Johnny Klippstein pitched the final three innings). The Phillies increase their National League lead to two games over the San Francisco Giants. ===July=== *July 7 \u2013 At Shea Stadium, Johnny Callison's ninth-inning three-run home run off Dick Radatz caps a four- run rally and gives the National League a 7\u20134 win over the American League in the All-Star Game. Callison is named Game MVP as the NL triumph evens the series at 17. *July 15 \u2013 At Metropolitan Stadium, Minnesota Twins pitcher Mudcat Grant serves up thirteen singles and a walk over eight innings\u2014but none of the Washington Senators batters comes around to score. The totals in Grant's 6-0 shutout win rank one behind the major league record. *July 19 \u2013 Luis Tiant pitches a complete-game, four-hit shutout in his Major League debut, leading the Cleveland Indians to a 3\u20130 victory over Whitey Ford and the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium. Tiant allowed just four singles while striking out eleven. *July 23 \u2013 Bert Campaneris of the Kansas City Athletics became the second player in Major League history to hit two home runs in his Major League debut, joining Bob Nieman, who did it in the season. Mark Quinn will join the select group in . ===August=== *August 12 \u2013 Mickey Mantle hits a home run from both sides of the plate in a 7\u20133 Yankees win over the Chicago White Sox. It is the tenth time in his career that he has done so and a major league record for switch-hit homers in a game. *August 20 \u2013 At Comiskey Park, the Chicago White Sox complete a four-game sweep of the New York Yankees with a 5\u20130 shutout. As the Yankees' team bus heads to O'Hare International Airport after the game, infielder Phil Linz takes out a harmonica and plays a plaintive version of \"Mary Had a Little Lamb.\" Manager Yogi Berra tells Linz to put the harmonica away. After Linz asks what Berra had said, Mickey Mantle tells Linz to \"play it louder\", which he does, prompting an unusually angry Berra to storm to the back to the bus and slap the harmonica out of Linz' hands; the instrument strikes Joe Pepitone's knee. The \"Harmonica Incident\" convinces the Yankee front office that Berra has lost control of the team and cannot command respect from his players. As a result, the decision is made to fire Berra at the end of the season. *August 27 \u2013 The New York Mets sign Jerry Koosman as an amateur free agent. *August 31 \u2013 Ground breaking is held for the new Anaheim Stadium. ===September=== *September 1 \u2013 At Shea Stadium, pitcher Masanori Murakami of the San Francisco Giants becomes the first Japanese player to appear in the Major Leagues. He enters the game in the ninth inning of the Giants' 4\u20131 loss to the New York Mets and strikes out Charley Smith, the first batter he faces; Ed Kranepool also strikes out two batters later. *September 9 \u2013 The St. Louis Cardinals and Philadelphia Phillies go into extra innings at Connie Mack Stadium tied at five. An error by Dick Allen leads to three unearned runs as the Cards score five in the eleventh for a 10\u20135 victory. *September 12 \u2013 Frank Bertaina of the Baltimore Orioles beats Bob Meyer of the Kansas City Athletics, 1\u20130, in a game in which both pitchers throw a one-hitter. *September 20 \u2013 Jim Bunning strikes out Johnny Roseboro in the ninth inning to preserve the Philadelphia Phillies' 3\u20132 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers in Los Angeles. The win comes after two straight losses (both charged to Jack Baldschun) and leaves the first place Phils in front of the National League by six and a half games with 12 games to play. When they return to Philadelphia in the early morning, 2,000 fans, including mayor James Tate are on hand to greet the team. *September 21 \u2013 John Tsitouris hurls a 1\u20130 shutout for the Cincinnati Reds over Art Mahaffey and the first-place Phillies, launching a 10-game Phillies losing streak. Rookie Chico Ruiz scores the only run when, with Frank Robinson at bat, he steals home with two outs in the sixth inning. *September 27 \u2013 Johnny Callison hits three home runs, but the Phillies lose to the Milwaukee Braves 14\u20138. The Phils suffer the seventh loss in their 10-game losing streak, while the Reds sweep the New York Mets (4\u20131 and 3\u20131). These results knock Philadelphia out of first place, with the Reds replacing them atop the NL standings. The Phillies would never return to first place in 1964. *September 29 \u2013 The Pittsburgh Pirates blank the Reds 2\u20130 at Crosley Field (despite the Reds getting 11 hits off Bob Friend) to end the Reds' nine-game winning streak. Meanwhile, Ray Sadecki records his 20th victory as his St. Louis Cardinals defeat the Phillies 4\u20132 at Busch Stadium, the seventh win in the Cardinals' eight-game winning streak and the ninth loss in the Phillies' 10-game losing streak. The win puts the Cardinals into a tie for first place with the Reds; St. Louis had been 11 games out of first on August 23. ===October=== *October 3 - The New York Yankees clinch their 14th American League pennant in 16 years with an 8\u20133 victory over the Cleveland Indians, holding off the Chicago White Sox by a single game. *October 3 - As a result of the now-concluded Phillies' 10-game losing streak, this day begins with four teams still having a mathematical shot at the NL pennant, and it is still mathematically possible to get a 4-way tie for such. But then one of those four teams, the San Francisco Giants, is eliminated with a 10\u20137 loss to the Chicago Cubs. At the end of the day's play, the Reds and the Cardinals are tied for 1st place, with the Phillies a game back. In recent days, the NL has had to scramble to schedule various possible playoffs. *October 4 \u2013 The Phillies defeat the Reds, 10\u20130, in the last regular-season game for both teams unless there is a playoff; because of the Reds' loss, the Cardinals clinch a tie for the NL pennant. At the end of that game, the Phillies and Reds are 1/2 game back of the Cardinals, and await the result of the Cardinals-Mets game. Then, the Cardinals, never in first place until the last week of the season, clinch their first pennant since 1946 with an 11\u20135 win over the Mets, who had just beaten the Cardinals twice in the two preceding days. The win by the Cardinals averts a three-way tie for the NL pennant, with the Phillies and the Reds finishing one game back in a second-place tie. *October 14 \u2013 The Los Angeles Dodgers released Jim Gilliam and Lee Walls. *October 15 \u2013 The St. Louis Cardinals take an early lead in the deciding World Series Game Seven over the New York Yankees. Lou Brock hits a fifth-inning home run to give pitcher Bob Gibson a 6-0 lead. Mickey Mantle, Clete Boyer and Phil Linz homer for New York, but the Yankees fall short. The Cardinals win the game 7\u20135 and are the World Champions. The Boyer brothers, Ken for St. Louis and Clete for the Yankees, homer in their last World Series appearance, a first in major league history. *October 16 \u2013 The day after the final game of the World Series, the managerial posts of both pennant winning teams are vacant. In the morning, Johnny Keane, manager of the victorious St. Louis Cardinals, resigns, much to the surprise of owner Gussie Busch. Hours later, New York Yankee general manager Ralph Houk fires Yogi Berra as his manager, citing Berra's lack of control over team and his inability to command respect from his players. Less than a week later, Houk replaces Berra with Keane, who himself will be replaced (as St. Louis manager) by coach and former Cardinal star Red Schoendienst. Meanwhile, Berra reunites with Casey Stengel by becoming a coach with the New York Mets. ===November=== *November 2 \u2013 CBS Broadcasting Inc. becomes the first corporate owner of a Major League team after buying eighty percent of the New York Yankees assets for $11,200,000. *November 10 \u2013 The Braves sign a 25-year lease to play in the new Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium. *November 18 \u2013 Baltimore Orioles third baseman Brooks Robinson, who hit .317 with 28 home runs and 118 RBI, is named American League Most Valuable Player with 269 points, becoming the first non-Yankee to win the award since Nellie Fox of the Chicago White Sox in 1959. The Yankees' Mickey Mantle (171) and his Yankee teammate Elston Howard (124) are the runners-up. *November 24 \u2013 St. Louis Cardinals third baseman Ken Boyer, who hit .295 with 24 home runs and 119 RBI, is named National League Most Valuable Player with 243 points. The Phillies' Johnny Callison (187) and Boyer's Cardinal teammate Bill White (106) are the runners-up. ===December=== *December 1 \u2013 The Houston Colt .45s officially change their nickname to Astros. The change coincides with the team's impending move from Colt Stadium to the Harris County Domed Stadium, also known as the Astrodome. A change in name for the three-year-old franchise is necessitated due to a dispute with the Colt firearm company; the Astros name is chosen due to Houston being the home of NASA's Manned Spacecraft Center (later the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center). *December 4: **The Minnesota Twins acquire extremely versatile utility C\u00e9sar Tovar from the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for pitcher Gerry Arrigo. Tovar will play eight seasons in Minnesota. **MLB owners decide to use a free agent draft beginning in January .
