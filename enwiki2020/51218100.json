    "text": "The Ducati Scrambler is an V-twin engined standard or roadster motorcycle made by Ducati. The Scrambler was introduced at the 2014 Intermot motorcycle show, with US sales beginning in 2015, in seven configurations: the Classic, Urban Enduro, Icon, Flat Track Pro, Full Throttle, Italia Independent, and the Sixty2. The Scrambler name and design concept are a revival of the Scrambler line of dual-sport singles made from 1962\u20131974. While the retro design incorporates some motocross elements such as the handlebar and brake pedal, the bikes are intended for street use only and are not adapted to off-road riding. The Urban Enduro version, while not literally an enduro motorcycle, has additional off-road oriented components, namely wire wheels, a handlebar cross bar brace, fork protectors, a sump guard, a headlight grill, and Pirelli MT60 dual-sport tires, and Ducati says the bike \"may be used occasionally on dirt trail\" but it is not designed for \"heavy off-road use\". Cycle Worlds Don Canet said, \"tackling fire roads and mild single-track is well within the Scrambler role\". The Scrambler bikes' engines and frames are made at Ducati's Borgo Panigale, Italy, factory and then shipped to Thailand for final assembly. Production began in December 2014. As of 2017 there are six different variations of the Ducati Scrambler model they are the Sixty2, Icon, Classic, Full Throttle, Caf\u00e9 Racer, and Desert Sled. Cycle World tested the 803 cc Scrambler Icon's acceleration from at 12.46 seconds at , and in 3.7 seconds. The Icon's braking distance was of . In 2018 Ducati added a new line of Scrambler models with a larger displacement engine (1,079 cc) https://scramblerducati.com/us/bike/1100 and larger frame, the Scrambler 1100. 3 models were introduced: Scrambler 1100, Scrambler 1100 Special, and the Scrambler 1100 Sport. The 1100 line added features that were lacking in the original Scrambler line such as Traction Control, 3 Riding Modes (Active, Journey and City), and a fuel gauge. == Gallery == == References == == External links == * Scrambler (2015) Category:Standard motorcycles Category:Motorcycles introduced in 2015 ",
