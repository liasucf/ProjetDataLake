    "text": "There Goes Rhymin' Simon is the third solo studio album by American musician Paul Simon rush-released on May 5, 1973. It contains songs covering several styles and genres, such as gospel (\"Loves Me Like a Rock\") and Dixieland (\"Take Me to the Mardi Gras\"). It received two nominations at the Grammy Awards of 1974, including Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male and Album of the Year. As foreshadowed by the lead single \"Kodachrome\" (which reached No. 2 on the Billboard charts, behind Billy Preston's \"Will It Go Round in Circles\"), There Goes Rhymin' Simon was a bigger hit than its predecessor, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart (behind George Harrison's Living in the Material World), and No. 1 on Cashbox Magazine for one week from June 30, 1973. In the United Kingdom, the album peaked at No. 4. Subsequent singles were also the No. 2 single \"Loves Me Like a Rock\" (knocked off by Cher's \"Half-Breed\", but reaching No. 1 on Cashbox on September 29, 1973), and the Top 40 hit \"American Tune\". Also, \"Take Me to the Mardi Gras\" was released in the UK reaching the Top 10. The song \"Kodachrome\" is named after the Kodak film of the same name. Kodak required the album to note that Kodachrome is a trademark. The song was not released as a single in Britain, where it could not be played on BBC radio due to its trademarked name. ==Reception== Critics praised the album. The Denver Post's Jared Johnson called it \"a brilliantly executed masterpiece, and surely the finest album in three years,\" citing such 1970 releases as Bridge Over Troubled Water and After the Gold Rush.DENVER POST, \"Roundup\" section, May 27, 1973, p. 17. Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times said, \"Combining a variety of musical textures (from a touch of gospel to an infectious trace of Jamaican rhythm to a hint of the old Simon and Garfunkel grandeur), Simon's new album firmly establishes him as one of our most valuable and accessible artists.\"DENVER POST, \"Roundup\" section, July 29, 1973, p. 20. Stephen Holden of Rolling Stone praised the album as \"a rich and moving song cycle, one in which each cut reflects on every other to create an ever-widening series of refractions.\" However, Stereo Review's Noel Coppage, while giving the album an \"excellent\" rating, nonetheless felt that it was \"deficient in spontaneity, excitement, strain\", calling its arrangements \"clean and sensible\" but \"oddly predictable\".STEREO REVIEW, October 1973, Vol.31, #4, p. 112. In 2000 it was voted number 421 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. ==Track listing== All tracks written by Paul Simon. The melody of \"American Tune\" is taken almost note-for-note from the St Matthew Passion, written by Johann Sebastian Bach, who was not credited on the album. In turn, Bach had imitated the melody of Hans Leo Hassler's Mein G'mueth ist mir verwirret. ==Personnel== *Paul Simon \u2013 vocals, acoustic guitar (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) *Pete Carr \u2013 electric guitar (3, 5, 9), acoustic guitar (1) *Jimmy Johnson \u2013 electric guitar (1, 3) *Cornell Dupree \u2013 electric guitar (2) *Al Gafa, David Spinozza \u2013 guitar (4) *Jerry Puckett \u2013 electric guitar (8) *David Hood \u2013 bass guitar (1, 3, 5, 9, 10) *Gordon Edwards \u2013 bass guitar (2) *Bob Cranshaw \u2013 bass guitar (4, 6, 7) *Vernie Robbins \u2013 bass guitar (8) *Richard Davis \u2013 double bass (4) *Barry Beckett \u2013 piano, Fender Rhodes (1), Hammond organ (3), piano (5), vibraphone (9) *Paul Griffin \u2013 piano (2) *Bob James \u2013 Fender Rhodes (4); harmonium, piano, keyboards (6) *Bobby Scott \u2013 piano (4) *Carson Whitsett \u2013 Hammond organ (8) *Don Elliott \u2013 vibraphone (4) *Roger Hawkins \u2013 percussion, drums (1, 3, 5, 10) *Rick Marotta \u2013 drums (2) *Grady Tate \u2013 drums (4, 6) *James Stroud \u2013 drums (8) *Airto Moreira \u2013 percussion (7) *The Onward Brass Band \u2013 horns (3) *The Dixie Hummingbirds \u2013 group vocals (2, 10) *Rev.
