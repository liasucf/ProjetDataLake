    "text": "The G\u00f6del Prize is an annual prize for outstanding papers in the area of theoretical computer science, given jointly by European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS) and the Association for Computing Machinery Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computational Theory (ACM SIGACT). The award is named in honor of Kurt G\u00f6del. G\u00f6del's connection to theoretical computer science is that he was the first to mention the \"P versus NP\" question, in a 1956 letter to John von Neumann in which G\u00f6del asked whether a certain NP-complete problem could be solved in quadratic or linear time. The G\u00f6del Prize has been awarded since 1993. The prize is awarded either at STOC (ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, one of the main North American conferences in theoretical computer science) or ICALP (International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming, one of the main European conferences in the field). To be eligible for the prize, a paper must be published in a refereed journal within the last 14 (formerly 7) years. The prize includes a reward of US$5000. The winner of the Prize is selected by a committee of six members. The EATCS President and the SIGACT Chair each appoint three members to the committee, to serve staggered three-year terms. The committee is chaired alternately by representatives of EATCS and SIGACT. == Recipients == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Year !width=40% class=\"unsortable\"| Name(s) !width=45% class=\"unsortable\"| Notes !Publication year |-valign=\"top\" |1993 ||L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Babai, Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, Shlomo Moran, and Charles Rackoff ||for the development of interactive proof systems || 1988, 1989 |-valign=\"top\" |1994 ||Johan H\u00e5stad || for an exponential lower bound on the size of constant-depth Boolean circuits (for the parity function). || 1989 |-valign=top |1995 ||Neil Immerman and R\u00f3bert Szelepcs\u00e9nyi ||for the Immerman\u2013Szelepcs\u00e9nyi theorem regarding nondeterministic space complexity || 1988, 1988 |-valign=\"top\" |1996 ||Mark Jerrum and Alistair Sinclair || for work on Markov chains and the approximation of the permanent of a matrix || 1989, 1989 |-valign=\"top\" |1997 ||Joseph Halpern and Yoram Moses || for defining a formal notion of \"knowledge\" in distributed environments || 1990 |-valign=\"top\" |1998 ||Seinosuke Toda || for Toda's theorem which showed a connection between counting solutions (PP) and alternation of quantifiers (PH) || 1991 |-valign=\"top\" |1999 ||Peter Shor || for Shor's algorithm for factoring numbers in polynomial time on a quantum computer || 1997 |-valign=\"top\" |2000 ||Moshe Y.
