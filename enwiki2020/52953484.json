    "text": "TV (also known as Apple TV, the Apple TV app, and the TV app) is a line of media player software programs by Apple Inc. for viewing television shows and films on consumer electronic devices. It can stream content from the iTunes Store, the Apple TV Channels a la carte video on demand service, and the Apple TV+ original content subscription service. On iPhones, iPads, iPod Touches, and tvOS-based Apple TVs it can also index and access content from linked apps of other video on demand services. The app was released in the United States on December 12, 2016 with iOS 10.2 and tvOS 10.1 and was rolled out to other countries starting in late 2017. Originally available only on Apple devices running iOS and tvOS, in 2019 it was brought to Mac with macOS Catalina and to non-Apple devices such as many Roku players, some Amazon Fire TVs, several televisions that include Roku or Fire TV software, and certain Samsung and LG smart televisions. Content from the TV app may also be streamed via Apple's AirPlay 2 protocol from a device supporting the TV app to particular smart television sets from Sony, Vizio, LG, and Samsung. ==Platforms== ===iOS and tvOS versions=== The TV app icon used in iOS and tvOS from December 2016 to March 2019 TV was announced at an Apple media event on October 27, 2016, and was released in the United States on December 12, 2016 with iOS 10.2 and tvOS 10.1, replacing the \"Videos\" application in earlier versions of iOS. It aggregates television shows and movies from the iTunes Store with content from installed partner apps, and can track progress across devices using the same Apple ID. Only content from Apple's services opens inside the TV app, for other content it will open the linked app. The app originally contained five sections: \"Watch Now\", \"Sports\", \"Library\", \"Store\" and \"Search\". Push notifications for sports scores can be enabled. TV received a major redesign following Apple's March 2019 media event, which refocused it as a hub for Apple-distributed video streaming. The new version added support for Apple TV Channels and debuted a new icon similar to the Apple TV hardware icon, replacing the previous icon resembling a television. TV was added to the pre- tvOS 3rd generation Apple TV in March 2019, though this version lacks the ability to link with other video on demand apps. Picture-in-picture and switching between multiple Apple IDs was added in tvOS 13 to fourth generation and newer Apple TVs. TV supports 4K, Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and HDR10 on the Apple TV 4K. Dolby Vision and HDR10 are supported on iPad Pros and iPhones released in 2017 or later, and Dolby Atmos on 2018 iPad Pros and iPhones. ===macOS version=== TV was released with macOS Catalina on October 7, 2019 as one of three applications created to replace iTunes. It supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and HDR10 on MacBooks released in 2018 or later, while 4K HDR playback is supported on the iMac Pro and other Macs released in 2018 or later when connected to a compatible display. ===Non-Apple devices=== Apple announced in January 2019 that the TV app would be made available on non-Apple platforms for the first time. The decision to expand to other platforms was cited as part Apple's efforts to expand its service revenues by making video content available widely to the public. The app launched on Samsung TVs on March 14, 2019. It is scheduled to launch on televisions from LG, Sony, and Vizio sometime in the future. It launched on Roku players on October 15, 2019, and is available on models with a 3800 model number or higher. It launched on Amazon Fire TV on October 24, though limited to Fire TV Sticks released in 2016 or later. Non-Apple devices do not support Dolby Atmos or Dolby Vision. ==Content sources== ===Apple TV+=== TV is the portal for Apple's Apple TV+ service, featuring original content created for Apple. ===Apple TV Channels=== Apple TV Channels is a service that aggregates content from popular video on demand a la carte subscription services and is accessed from the TV app. Announced in March 2019, it is designed to simplify subscriptions by making them purchasable and accessible in one video content hub, so the consumer need not use each service's own sign-up mechanism or view the content through each service's own app or website. It is designed to compete with similar services such as Amazon Channels and Hulu Add-Ons, which similarly make multiple subscription premium networks available in one location. The payment method can also be centralized through Apple's own billing service. Because the content is from paid subscription services, it will be ad-free. Content can also be downloaded to the device for offline viewing, and there is an option to share accounts within families. Partners include Showtime, Cinemax, Starz, Epix, CuriosityStream, Urban Movie Channel, Mubi and CBS All Access. HBO was a launch partner but deprecated their channel following the launch of HBO Max, discontinuing new subscriptions and retaining existing ones for Apple users who registered for the channel before the May 2020 launch of HBO Max (while granting access to HBO Max at no extra charge). The broad reach of the 1.4 billion Apple devices in use globally induced major services, some of which already have their own content distribution systems, to make deals with Apple. Netflix declined to be involved with the service, with CEO Reed Hastings saying that they chose not to integrate its service's programming into Apple TV Channels because \"we prefer to have our customers watch our content in our service.\" Netflix would have received little or no data about viewers from Apple TV Channels. AT&T; CEO Randall Stephenson, during an on-stage discussion with CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin at a fintech event, pushed back on the suggestion that content providers like AT&T;'s HBO would \"not have the same level of access to the data\" captured from Apple TV Channels that they currently receive through their own apps and websites to \"see what everybody's really watching and be able to make certain decisions\", instead insisting that AT&T;'s digital distribution deals provide it \"access to data ... critical to advertising delivery, [ ] critical to marketing\". ===iTunes Store=== TV can stream content rented or purchased from the iTunes Store. ===Linked video on demand apps=== The versions of the TV app on iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS can integrate and curate content from supported video on demand apps installed on the same device, and can track progress across devices using the same Apple ID. Only content from Apple's services opens inside the TV app, for other content it will open the linked app. Support from apps varies by country. Support for Netflix is limited; their television shows and films will appear in search results and play, but other features like curation and progress tracking are unavailable. ==Release history== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" !Region !Date ! |- | |December 12, 2016 | |- | |rowspan=\"2\"|September 19, 2017 |rowspan=\"2\"| |- | |- | |rowspan=\"2\"|October 31, 2017 |rowspan=\"2\"| |- | |- | |rowspan=\"3\"|December 8, 2017 |rowspan=\"3\"| |- | |- | |- | |rowspan=\"2\"|March 30, 2018 |rowspan=\"2\"| |- | |- |90 additional countries |rowspan=\"1\"|May 13, 2019 |rowspan=\"1\"| |- |} ==References== === Notes === ==External links== *Official page for the Apple TV app at apple.com Category:IOS software Category:Video on demand services Category:Apple Inc. software Category:TvOS software Category:IOS ",
