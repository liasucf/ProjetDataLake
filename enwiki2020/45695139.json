She lives in California with her family. She was born in 1970 and raised in Toronto, Canada. In college, she spent a summer as a volunteer in an Indian orphanage, which seeded the idea for her first novel, Secret Daughter, published in 2010. It was a New York Times and #1 international bestseller, and was translated into over 30 languages. Secret Daughter was shortlisted for the South African Boeke Literary Prize, longlisted for the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, was an IndieNext Great Read, a Target Book Club Pick, a ChaptersIndigo Heather's Pick, and an Amnesty International Book Club Pick.

She has served on the Advisory Board of the Children's Defense Fund, and is a Patron of Childhaven International, the organization for which she volunteered in India. == Career == === Novels === ==== Secret Daughter ==== Gowda's debut novel was published by HarperCollins/William Morrow in 2010 and became a New York Times bestseller and a #1 international bestseller. It was translated into more than 30 languages and became a bestseller in several foreign countries, in addition to the US and Canada. The story was inspired by Gowda's experience volunteering at an orphanage in India during a summer in college, and explores the repercussions of female infanticide that is prevalent in many parts of Asia. It features a girl born in an Indian village, unwanted because of her gender, who is later adopted by a professional couple in California. The novel traces the lives of the girl, both her biological and her adoptive families over two decades. The Washington Post said of the novel, A nuanced coming-of-age story that is faithful to the economic and emotional realities of two very different cultures. ... As the author moves among the perspectives of her various characters, she gives full weight to the humanity of each and views the problems of poverty and affluence with equal empathy. ... Gowda doesn't neaten up the messy complications of family life as she warmly affirms the power of love to help people grow and change. Secret Daughter was shortlisted for the South African Boeke Literary Prize, longlisted for the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, was an IndieNext Great Read, a Target Book Club Pick, a ChaptersIndigo Heather's Pick, and an Amnesty International Book Club Pick. ==== The Golden Son ==== Gowda's second novel was published in 2015-16 around the world, and it too became a #1 international bestseller. The story features two childhood friends who grow up in the same village in India, but whose paths diverge when Anil goes to America to pursue his dream of becoming a doctor, while Leena moves to a neighboring village to have an arranged marriage. Marisa de los Santos, New York Times bestselling author of Belong to Me and The Precious One, commented on The Golden Son, saying, Shilpi Somaya Gowda \"is as adept at crafting disparate, fully realized worlds\u2014a village in India, a medical school in Texas\u2014as she is at creating compelling characters. I ached and cheered for Leena and Anil, as they struggle to live lives of their own choosing amidst the demands of tradition and the sometimes beautiful, sometimes painful bonds of family.\" ==== The Shape of Family ==== Gowda's third novel will be published, again by HarperCollins/William Morrow. It is currently scheduled for release on 10/15/2019 in Canada, 3/17/2020 in the US, and dates to come in several other countries.
