It was known as the Oneida and Genesee Conference Seminary, the Oneida Conference Seminary, and the Central New York Conference Seminary over the years. It did not officially adopt the name Cazenovia Seminary until 1894, but the name was at times used from its inception and is often used to refer to it at any time before it became a college. In 1942 Church sponsorship of Cazenovia was withdrawn, and it was reorganized to include a junior college program as well as the prep school, with the name of Cazenovia Junior College.
