    "text": "Zbigniew Uni\u0142owski (born 1 May 1909 in Warsaw, Poland, died 12 November 1937 in Warsaw) was a Polish writer. == Early years == Uni\u0142owski as a child with parents (1913) Uni\u0142owski was born in Warsaw in a petty-bourgeois family. His parents were W\u0142adys\u0142aw Uni\u0142owski and Jadwiga Uni\u0142owska n\u00e9e Ciechonski. After the death of both parents (his mother died of tuberculosis, while father committed suicide), as a teenage boy, he lived with his aunt, a poor seamstress in Powi\u015ble. Not completing junior high school for financial reasons, he was forced to take up employment, including as a bricklaying helper, a parcel delivery service for a tailor or a waiter boy in the Warsaw restaurant \"Astoria\". There, in 1926, Karol Szymanowski noticed him, being intrigued by the young waiter who read Joseph Conrad's prose. Szymanowski's financial assistance enabled Uni\u0142owski to self-study, facilitated literary contacts, and above all, enabled him to stay frequently in Zakopane, which was advisable due to developing tuberculosis. == Start of literary career == Uni\u0142owski spent some time from 1927 to 1930 mainly in Zakopane, at times staying in Warsaw. During his stay in the Tatra Mountains, he wrote his first published works - short stories collected later in the book Cz\u0142owiek w Oknie (Man in a window). He also began writing his opus magnum, an unfinished novel, Dwadzie\u015bcia lat \u017cycia (Twenty Years of Life). The stay in Zakopane also provided an opportunity to meet the personalities of contemporary literary life - Uni\u0142owski met there, among others, Stanis\u0142aw Ignacy Witkiewicz, Jaros\u0142aw Iwaszkiewicz and Micha\u0142 Choroma\u0144ski. In 1930, he returned to Warsaw. He was mainly active in the environment of the poetic group Kwadryga, with whom he had worked for a year. He described this period in roman \u00e0 clef Wsp\u00f3lny pok\u00f3j (Shared Room), published in 1933. The publication of the novel became the basis of a social scandal in the Warsaw literary community, and the novel was requisitioned for censorship. However, intervention from the authorities and the considerable interest from literary critics gained significant attention for the young author. Uni\u0142owski with wife and son (1937) Uni\u0142owski stayed in Warsaw until 1934, leaving for a short time in 1931, when he was called up for the military service in W\u0142odawa. He didn't stay in the army for long, thanks to the influence of his protectors. The growing literary position enabled the writer to go to Brazil thanks to Ministry of Foreign Affairs stipend. During his stay there, he published Dzie\u0144 rekruta (Recruit Day), a story based on his experiences from military service. This work caused another scandal, and the author was accused of anti-state attitude. As a result, he was forced to shorten his journey and return to Poland in July 1935, bringing with him two new novels - \u017byto w d\u017cungli (Rye in the Jungle) and Dziennik morski (Sea Diary). == Marriage and death == In 1935, Zbigniew Uni\u0142owski married Maria Lilpop, daughter of Franciszek Lilpop. Thanks to this marriage, the writer, who was constantly in a difficult financial situation, gained material and life stability. Two years later their son was born. At that time, Uni\u0142owski intensively worked on Dwadzie\u015bcia lat \u017cycia (Twenty Years of Life), the first part of which was published in 1937. He died unexpectedly from meningitis at the age of 28, not having finished Dwadzie\u015bcia lat \u017cycia. He was buried at the Pow\u0105zki Cemetery.
