    "text": "The Juans is a Filipino pop rock band based in Malolos, Philippines. It currently consists of lead vocalist and keyboardist Carl Guevarra, vocalist and lead guitarist Japs Mendoza, sub-vocalist and bassist Chael Adriano, sub- vocalist and acoustic guitarist RJ Cruz, and drummer Joshua Coronel. ==History== The Juans was initially categorized as a boy band, but the management team decided to recategorize them as a conventional band. Jiad Arroyo was a founding member, along with Daniel Grospe. Carl Guevara, Japs Mendoza, and Jason de Mesa joined later. The band was initially named at a coffee shop shortly after a One Direction concert, where the boys were mulling the British boy band's popularity. They were initially called the D\u2019 Juans, after Juan De La Cruz. ==Band members== Current members * Carl Guevarra (Lead vocals, keyboards) studied music production at the De La Salle\u2013College of Saint Benilde and was a Top 12 finalist in the musical reality show on GMA Network's Ride to Fame. He worked in theater and appeared in musicals including Kelly Kelly ang Hit na Musical, Batang Rizal, Lola Basyang and Peter Pan. He appeared in commercials and hosted shows like the Ignite Gospel Music Festival and Jam on television. * Japs Mendoza (Vocals, lead guitar) is a former painter who had learned guitar, also got started in show business through a talent contest. He joined MACIPRISA, an inter-school singing contest in Bulacan. The experience encouraged him to consider singing as a career, so he uploaded his performance videos to YouTube and watched them in order to find and correct his mistakes. He soon felt confident enough to audition for The Voice of the Philippines and was picked by Lea Salonga. * Chael Adriano (Bass guitar, backing vocals) is an engineer. * RJ Cruz (Acoustic guitar, backing vocals) is a freshman college student at De La Salle\u2013College of Saint Benilde. * Joshua Coronel (Drums) is now married. Former members * Jiad Arroyo first appeared in the Gandang Lalake segment on variety show It's Showtime. He achieved first runner-up in the competition and earned valuable insights into the intricacies of show business. Arroyo is a self-taught guitarist, studying YouTube tutorials and subsequently learned from his bandmates. Arroyo is apparently acting on television, while pursuing his passion for motorcycles, custom building units for clients. * Jason De Mesa was apparently set to be an actor. His father was the late Rico J. Puno, one of the country's greatest singers and entertainers. He could possibly have achieved anything he wanted to with assistance from his father but preferred to pursue success in his own way. His initial experience was in the theater, with roles in the musicals Ibong Adarna and Saranggola Ni Pepe. De Mesa has his own clothing line called Felipe after his departure from the band. * Daniel Grospe started as an actor, after winning an acting contest in Eat Bulaga! This gained him entry into acting workshops and a role on GMA's Saang Sulok ng Langit television series. Frustrated over the slow pace of his career, he went back to music, playing the drums, first in church and then later with the pop-jazz group Southwind. Then, as one of the finalists in TV5's Kanta Pilipinas, he got the chance to interpret the song \"Kesa\" in the first Philpop Music Festival. The opportunity gave Daniel the Awit Award for Best Performance as New Male Artist. Grospe is currently running his own record company to help and handle new artists. == Discography == ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of extended plays, with selected details !
