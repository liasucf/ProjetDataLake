Currently there are ongoing cross- breeding programmes with Arado cattle, in an attempt to increase the milk production of the latter. == Origin of the cattle breed == Ethiopia has been at a crossroads for cattle immigration to Africa due to * proximity to the geographical entry of Indian and Arabian zebu * proximity to Near-Eastern and European taurine * introgression with West African taurine due to pastoralism Furthermore, the diverse agro-ecology led to diverse farming systems which, in turn, made Ethiopia a centre of secondary diversi\ufb01cation for livestock : * The Sanga cattle originated in Ethiopia. They are a major bovine group in Africa \u2013 a cross-breeding of local long-horned taurines and Arabian zebus * The Begayt are one of the Zenga (Zebu-Sanga) breeds, which resulted from a second introduction and crossing with Indian zebu == Threats on the cattle breed == * socio-political stresses: civil wars and recent urbanisation * panzootic stresses: cattle plague * environmental stresses drought and destruction of ecosystems * extensive cross-breeding with Arado ==Closely related types== * Arado cattle == References == Category:Cattle breeds Category:Tigray Region Category:Cattle breeds originating in Ethiopia ",
