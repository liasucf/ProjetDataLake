Co- founded in 1983 in Nashville, Tennessee by Thomas W. Beasley, Robert Crants, and T. Don Hutto, it received investments from the Tennessee Valley Authority, Vanderbilt University, and Jack C. Massey, the founder of Hospital Corporation of America. As of 2016, the company is the second largest private corrections company in the United States. CoreCivic manages more than 65 state and federal correctional and detention facilities with a capacity of more than 90,000 beds in 19 states and the District of Columbia. The company's revenue in 2012 exceeded $1.7 billion. By 2015, its contracts with federal correctional and detention authorities generated up to 51% of its revenues. It operated 22 federal facilities with the capacity for 25,851 prisoners. By 2016, Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) along with GEO Group were running \"more than 170 prisons and detention centres\". CCA's revenues in 2015 were $1.79bn. CCA has been the subject of much controversy over the years, mostly related to apparent attempts to save money, such as hiring inadequate staff, extensive lobbying, and lack of proper cooperation with legal entities to avoid repercussions.Kerkham, Chris (February 14, 2012). \"Private Prisons Buying State Prisons\", Huffington Post. Retrieved September 13, 2017. CCA rebranded itself as CoreCivic amid the ongoing scrutiny of the private prison industry. ==History== Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility, Mississippi Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) was founded in Nashville, Tennessee, on January 28, 1983, by Thomas W. Beasley, Doctor Robert Crants and T. Don Hutto. Beasley served as the chairman of the Tennessee Republican Party; Crants was the chief financial officer of a real estate company in Nashville; Hutto was the president-elect of the American Correctional Association. A founding member of its board of directors was Maurice Sigler, the former chairman of the United States Board of Parole. The initial investment came from Jack C. Massey, co-founder of the Hospital Corporation of America.Harmon L. Wray, Jr., \"Cells for Sale\" , Southern Changes: The Journal of the Southern Regional Council, Volume 8, Number 3, 1989 An early investor prior to the IPO was Vanderbilt University, where Beasley had completed his law degree. Additionally, the Tennessee Valley Authority was another early financial backer. According to a 2013 CCA video, Hutto and Beasley were the chief founders. Hutto had years of experience in corrections and was president-elect of the American Correctional Association. The two men met with representatives of the Federal Bureau of Prisons and Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS, now ICE), which operated under U.S. Department of Justice from 1933 to 2003, to discuss a potential joint venture for a facility to detain undocumented immigrants in Texas. CCA was awarded a contract in late 1983 by the U.S. Department of Justice for the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (formerly Immigration and Naturalization Service). This was the \"first contract ever to design, build, finance and operate a secure correctional facility.\" This is considered to have marked the beginning of the private prison industry. CCA had to have the facilities ready by early January 1984, ninety days from the signing of the contract. Hutto and Beasley flew to Houston and after several days, negotiated a deal with the owner of Olympic Motel\u2014a \"pair of nondescript two-story buildings\" on \"I-45 North between Tidwell and Parker\"\u2014to hire their family and friends to staff the re-purposed motel for four months as a detention facility. On Super Bowl Sunday at the end of January, Hutto personally processed the first 87 undocumented immigrants at this facility, and CCA received its first payment. The company opened its first facility, the Houston Processing Center, in 1984. The Houston Detention Center was built to house individuals awaiting a decision on immigration cases or repatriation. In 1984, CCA also took over the operations of the Tall Trees non-secure juvenile facility, for the Juvenile Court of Memphis and Shelby County. Two years later, CCA built the 200-bed Shelby Training Center in Memphis to house juvenile male offenders. In 1989, it opened the New Mexico Women's Correctional Facility in Grants, New Mexico; it had constructed this facility of 204 beds.New Mexico Women's Correctional Facility, Grants, Corrections, State of New Mexico In the 1980s, CCA officials met with representatives of the Mitterrand administration in France. They did not win any contracts there for CCA prisons. In 1990, CCA opened the first medium- security privately operated prison, the state-owned Winn Correctional Center, in Winn Parish, Louisiana.Louisiana Department of Corrections It opened the Leavenworth Detention Center, operated for the U.S. Marshals Service, in 1992. This 256-bed facility was the first maximum-security private prison under direct contract to a federal agency.Prison Information CCA entered the United Kingdom in 1992, when it entered a partnership with Mowlem and Sir Robert McAlpine to form UK Detention Services. It opened the 650-bed Blackenhurst prison in Worcestershire, England. The stockholders are mostly corporate entities and it is classified as a real estate investment trust, or REIT. Research published in Social Justice by scholars at Rutgers University showed that in 2007, the company had \"114 institutional stockholders that together amount[ed] to 28,736,071 shares of stock.\" The scholars added, \"The largest number of shares of CCA stock is held by RS Investments (3,296,500), WesleyCapital MGMT (2,486,866) and Capital Research and MGMT (2,057,600).\" In 2010, the ACLU filed a lawsuit on behalf of inmates at the Idaho Correctional Center, claiming that understaffing contributed to the high levels of violence there. In 2014, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began an investigation into CCA management of the ICC to ascertain whether any Federal statutes were violated because of the understaffing of the facility and what was found to be falsification of staffing records.Rebecca Boone (March 7, 2014).

The Washington Post. August 14, 2016. CCA was renamed CoreCivic in October 2016. ==Overview== Founded in 1983, Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) owns or operates jails and prisons on contract with federal, state and local governments. CCA designs, builds, manages and operates correctional facilities and detention centers for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the United States Marshals Service, as well as state and county facilities across the United States. CCA houses approximately 90,000 offenders and detainees in its more than 60 facilities; it employs more than 17,000 persons nationwide. Federal contracts for correctional and detention facilities generated up to 51% of its revenues in 2015. It operated 22 federal facilities with the capacity for 25,851 prisoners. The American Correctional Association (ACA) has accredited 90% of CCA's facilities.CCA Facilities Receive High Marks from American Correctional Association, 2011 CCA press release. Retrieved February 10, 2014. ACA's Accreditation is a system of verification that correctional agencies and facilities comply with national standards promulgated by the American Correctional Association. Accreditation is achieved through a series of reviews, evaluations, audits and hearings.ACA Standards, American Correctional Association On August 18, 2016, Deputy U.S. Attorney General Sally Yates announced that the Justice Department intended to end its Bureau of Prisons contracts with for-profit prison operators, because its own analysis concluded \"...the facilities are both less safe and less effective at providing correctional services...\" than the Federal Bureau of Prisons.Justice Department says it will end use of private prisons, The Washington Post, Matt Zapotosky & Chico Harlan, August 8, 2016.

Retrieved August 19, 2016. ===Inmate rehabilitation=== The United States prison system provides reentry and rehabilitation programs for inmates.What Science Says About Designing Effective Prisoner Reentry Programs, Family Impact Seminars Such programs often include education, vocational training, addiction treatment as well as faith-based programs. In addition to the reentry and rehabilitation programs, prisons often offer inmates recreational and optional faith-based opportunities. The latter is considered an integral part of inmate rehabilitation. CCA says it offers basic adult education, post-secondary education, GRE preparation, and testing and literacy programs to all inmates. The Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics reported in 2008 that 40% of privately run facilities did not offer such programming to inmates. According to national research, providing inmates with education and vocational programs can reduce the likelihood that offenders will commit new offenses upon release and return to prison. In 1993, CCA launched the LifeLine substance abuse training program at the Metro-Davidson County Detention Facility in Nashville, Tennessee. In the early 21st century, CCA offers the program in 23 of its 60 facilities.\"Lifeline graduates first class\", News Herald ===Occupancy and profitability=== In a 1990s report, Prudential Securities was bullish on CCA but noted, \"It takes time to bring inmate population levels up to where they cover costs. Low occupancy is a drag on profits... company earnings would be strong if CCA succeeded in ramp(ing) up population levels in its new facilities at an acceptable rate\". In 2011, responding to an initiative from the State of Ohio to reduce \"overhead costs by saving $13 million annually while adding 700 beds to house inmates in the overcrowded system,\" Corrections Corporation of America agreed to buy the Lake Erie Correctional Institution for $72.7 million. This is a change in company policy, as previously CCA had always constructed its own prisons. The purchase was contingent on the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction agreeing to a high level of occupancy under the contract.\"Ohio State Prison System Sales\", Cleveland, September 2011. The State failed to find buyers for many other prisons which it offered for sale. This was considered good news by the Ohio Civil Service Employees Association, the union for prison guards. In 2012, CCA sent a letter to prison officials in 48 states, offering to buy prisons from these states in exchange for a 20-year management contract with a guaranteed occupancy rate of 90%. Many community organizations have criticized the proposals, arguing that the contractual obligations of states to fill the prisons to 90% occupancy are poor public policy, creating an incentive to criminalize behavior and lengthen sentences in order to keep the prisons filled. They believe that these contractual clauses end up costing taxpayers more than state-run prisons would and add to over-incarceration. ===Employment issues=== In 2002 CCA agreed to pay more than $152,000 in back wages to 96 Oklahoma women denied employment because of gender discrimination. A U.S. Department of Labor audit showed women applicants, who were equally or better qualified than men hired, were rejected. In 2008 CCA was ranked as one of the 100 best corporate citizens by Corporate Responsibility Officer magazine.CCA Named One of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens in the U.S. The national military magazine GI Jobs highlighted CCA as a solid employer for veterans.Corrections Industry Offers Steady Growth and Stable Employment Opportunities In 2010 it ranked CCA as one of the \"Top 50 Military Friendly Jobs.\"\"Corrections Provider CCA Named To GI Jobs Magazine's Top 50 List of Military Friendly Employers\", Press Release, Corrections Corporation But in 2010, a Muskogee, Oklahoma federal court jury found CCA guilty of violating the employment rights of a shift supervisor by terminating his job when he was deployed to Iraq.

There had been widespread reports of escapes, inmate violence, and deplorable conditions in such private facilities. Speculative prison building, sometimes supported by small municipalities hoping to increase local employment, had increased competition and the pressure to keep prisons filled. The Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), which became CoreCivic in October 2017, as well as the industry as a whole, rebounded in the early 2000s. This followed a massive increase in detentions of undocumented immigrants by the federal government in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, which created a new market for its facilities. From 2001 to 2011, CCA's revenue increased 88 percent, and it received at least $1 billion in revenue for each of the eight years from 2003 to 2011. In 2012, CCA derived 30 percent of its revenue from federal contracts. In 2012 some $546 million for CCA came from federal contracts with the Bureau of Prisons and the U.S. Marshals Service. Although they have denied lobbying, private prison corporations specifically target Republican legislators over \"immigration reform\".

A subsequent detainee death at the facility resulted in an additional inquiry and \"another scathing report,\" according to The New York Times. In August 2009 the ACLU filed suit against CCA and related government agencies because government officials who were responsible for overseeing the care provided failed to provide data about conditions.

CCA responded that it does not lobby lawmakers to increase jail time or push for longer sentences under any circumstance, noting that it \"educates officials on the benefits of public-private partnership but does not lobby on crime and sentencing policies.\"Who Profits From the Prison Boom , Diversity Inc. Among its risk factors listed in its 10-K annual report, as required by the SEC, CCA includes the following: > The demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected by > the relaxation of enforcement efforts, leniency in conviction or parole > standards and sentencing practices or through the decriminalization of > certain activities that are currently proscribed by our criminal laws. For > instance, any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or > illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, > and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional > facilities to house them. At the federal level, the corporation's lobbying focuses largely on immigrant detention. In 2012, CCA spent nearly $1.8 million lobbying Congress and federal bureaucracies on issues relating to homeland security, law enforcement, immigrant detention, and information disclosure legislation.\"Meet the private prison industry's lobbyists who could shape immigration reform\", Grassroots Leadership blog, February 2013. ===Lawsuit about gang influence in Idaho prison=== In 2010 the FBI conducted an investigation of CCA practices following an incident at their prison in Idaho Correctional Center in which a prison inmate was beaten unconscious in an inmate attack. A video released by the Associated Press showed the incident underway as guards watched without taking action. Because the matter was under litigation, the company had said publicly that the release of the video is \"an unnecessary security risk to our staff, the inmates entrusted to our care and ultimately to the public.\" CCA said it was cooperating with investigators. In March 2010, the ACLU filed suit in federal court against CCA in Idaho, alleging that guards were not protecting inmates from other violent inmates.Rebecca Boone, \"ACLU suing Corrections Corp. of America\", Associated Press, in Corrections One, March 11, 2010 In February 2014, the federal judge hearing the case awarded $349,000 in attorney fees to the ACLU for its costs in bringing the action.'Federal judge orders CCA to pay attorney fees to ACLU', Idaho Press-Tribune, February 22, 2014. Retrieved February 23, 2014. A settlement was reached to correct conditions at the prisons run by CCA. In November 2012, eight inmates filed a federal lawsuit in Idaho alleging that CCA prison officials partially ceded control of the Idaho Correctional Center to gang leaders. The lawsuit cited Idaho Department of Correction claimed CCA used gang members of the Aryan Knights and the Severely Violent Criminals to manage the institution. Investigators reported IDOC was aware the prison housed members of the same gangs together in some cell blocks to reduce violent clashes. In September 2013, a federal judge held CCA in contempt of court for persistently understaffing the Idaho Correctional Center in direct violation of a legal settlement. In October 2013, CCA was discouraged from bidding on a new contract to operate the Idaho Correctional Center. The state took back control and operations of its prison on July 1, 2014. Also in 2012, former and current employees in Lieutenant positions, who were categorized as \"Salary Employees,\" filed lawsuits arguing that their daily duties and work hours were not that of a salary employee. They worked considerable overtime. Specifically, they sued CCA because their actual duties were not those of typical salaried employees in criminal justice, nor did they have the authority to \"Hire and Fire\" as a salaried employee should. CCA lost the lawsuit and paid a settlement of hundreds of thousands of dollars to its current and former Lieutenants. After losing the suit, CCA continued to classify their Lieutenants as salaried employees, saying, \"It's cheaper to pay out law suits every couple years than it is to pay them for the (overtime) hours they actually work.\" ===Co- operation with local law enforcement in a school drug sweep=== In 2012, CCA conducted a drug sweep of Vista Grande High School in Casa Grande, Arizona in concert with local law enforcement. Caroline Isaacs, the program director of the Tucson office of the American Friends Service Committee said, \"It is chilling to think that any school official would be willing to put vulnerable students at risk this way.\" ===2012 fatal prison riot in Mississippi facility=== In May 2012 a riot at CCA-operated Adams County Correctional Facility in Natchez, Mississippi resulted in the death of a Corrections Officer and injury to sixteen staff members and three prisoners. Twenty-five employees were held hostage during the disturbance. It was quelled by facility staff with assistance from the Mississippi Highway Patrol and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. According to a company statement, the fatality was the second time an employee had \"lost his life to inmate assault.\" ===Prison incidents and fatalities in Oklahoma=== In 2015 violence increased at Cimarron Correctional Facility in Cushing, Oklahoma, including a riot involving 200\u2013300 prisoners in June 2015 that resulted in eleven inmates being hospitalized. On September 13, 2015, a fight between white gangs broke out that resulted in the deaths of four inmates and hospitalization of four others because of their injuries. It was the deadliest event in Oklahoma corrections' history. CCA declined multiple requests for a recorded interview after the Cimmaron events. Corrections Commissioner Joe Allbaugh said, \"We don't have the flexibility in our system to segregate these gangs, so they are together in close quarters and so sometimes things happen.\" The director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Oklahoma says the non-profit receives numerous complaints about treatment in private prisons: \"I would say we get roughly double the number per capita from private prison inmates from public prison inmates.\" The complaints range from safety concerns to lack of appropriate food and medical care. Oklahoma sent a \"notice to cure\" in October 2015 to inform Cimarron Correctional Facility that it was more than seven months behind in reporting use of force standards and reportable incidents. According to DOC's contract with CCA, the business has five days to submit proper reporting, but the state was waiting on reports dating back to March 2015. The ACLU's Brady Henderson said this demonstrated a practice within the prison system of concealing records of activities. \"Even in public facilities, there's an incredible amount of secrecy,\" a lack of transparency. \"It's already hard to know. It gets 10 times harder with a private facility,\" he said. In 2015 Allbaugh said that because of overcrowding in the Oklahoma system, his agency would continue to do business with private prison companies. \"As much as I don't think the state ought to be doing business with private prisons, I'm glad they're around because they're our only relief valve available to us during this crunch.\"\"Fourth inmate dies after prisoner clash at Oklahoma prison\", Associated Press, Sean Murphy, September 13, 2015.

Robinson found CoreCivic illegally recorded phone calls between attorneys and their incarcerated pre- trial clients at its Leavenworth, Kansas prison. Defense attorneys representing inmates objected after discovering their privileged conferences with clients had been recorded, despite CoreCivic having repeatedly assured them the meetings would be kept private. Robinson scolded prosecutors for speeding forward with an alleged prison contraband case, which she called a \u201chorrendous situation\u201d. Robinson said, \"You all need to get your act together,\" Robinson authorized wide latitude devoted to an investigation into recordings of phone calls and video of meetings between attorneys and inmates at Leavenworth Detention Center. Robinson said she planned to order the U.S. Department of Justice to pay for the investigation, which is expected to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Prosecutors said they obtained the recordings inadvertently while gathering evidence of a prison contraband ring that could have involved as many as 95 inmates and 60 non-inmates. A grand jury subpoena issued to the U.S. Attorney's office resulted in the provision of illegal recordings of meetings between attorneys and clients. Dozens of attorney-client phone call were provided to other lawyers in the case. Robinson said it appeared the rights of some inmates had been violated. The FBOP forbids recording in attorney-client meeting rooms yet CoreCivic contends that silent video recordings of inmate-attorney meetings \u201care a standard practice\u201d throughout the country and are used for prison security. In August 2016, Robinson ordered the recordings be halted. CoreCivic offered prisoners attorneys an option that such recordings be disabled for case conferences with their clients but a defense attorney informed the court that calls between himself and a client at Leavenworth had been recorded despite his multiple requests that such recordings end and his receipt of assurances from CoreCivic that the practice had been terminated. Barry Pollack, president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers said, \"You have a failure on the part of the institution that is recording something that it shouldn't be. Here, they turned it over to the prosecutors.\" \"Anyone facing prison time needs legal counsel, and essentially, they aren't getting it.\"Recorded prison videos are 'horrendous situation,' judge says, Kansas City Star, Ian Cummings, September 7, 2016.

Johnson announced that the group would be reviewing its use of private detention facilities for housing illegal immigrants. This followed the announcement by the Department of Justice that the Bureau of Prisons would phase out its private contracts. As of 2015, federal revenues made up 51% of CCA's total income. CCA operates 22 federal facilities with a capacity of 25,851 prisoners. In 2017, however, after the change in administrations, officials under President Donald Trump said that both the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security would continue to use private prisons. ===Contempt of court=== In May 2016, the company was found in contempt of court for having failed to comply with a court order regarding the Idaho State Correctional Institution.
