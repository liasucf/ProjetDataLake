It all depends on how you interpret them, but yes, I did write songs for Rachel, especially around that time.\" In 2013 he admitted that he still thought about Barber every day. He released his debut studio album, Emmanuel, on 18 April 2005. Since releasing his debut album, he has been travelling the world and taking a break from his recording career.
