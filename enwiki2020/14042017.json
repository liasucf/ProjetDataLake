    "text": "In enzymology, a precorrin-6A reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction ::precorrin-6A + NADPH + H+ \\rightleftharpoons precorrin-6B + NADP+ The three substrates of this enzyme are precorrin 6A, NADPH and a proton; its two products are precorrin 6B and NADP+. This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH=CH group of an acceptor with NAD or NADPH as donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is precorrin-6B:NADP+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include precorrin-6X reductase, precorrin-6Y:NADP+ oxidoreductase and CobK. This enzyme is part of the biosynthetic pathway to cobalamin (vitamin B12) in aerobic bacteria. ==See Also== * Cobalamin biosynthesis ==References== * * Category:EC 1.3.1 Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes Category:Enzymes of unknown structure ",
