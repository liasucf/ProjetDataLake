    "text": "Dizzie Tunes with Grethe Kausland. Dizzie Tunes was a Norwegian musical show group from the city of Skien. Dizzie Tunes was one of the most successful in Norwegian show business. == Biography == The group was founded as the dance band Rex Band in 1959, was named Dizzie Tunes in 1962, and disbanded in 2002. The regular group members were Yngvar Numme, Svein-Helge H\u00f8gberg, \u00d8yvind Klingberg, Tor Erik Gunstr\u00f8m and Einar Idland. Their record debut came in 1963 with the single \"Mette Mette Mette\". Their first album was called Dizzie Tunes (1967). Their first revue was \u00c5, s\u00e5 heldig vi er, staged at Chat Noir in 1966 and starring Wenche Myhre. Their next revues were Syv glade lerker p\u00e5 en bl\u00e5 gren from 1969 and Show f\u00f8r jo heller from 1971. In 1972 singer and actress Grethe Kausland starred at the revue P\u00e5 scenekanten, and she later regularly performed with the group. Other revues were Memories of Music from 1980 and The show must go home from 1984. The 1988 revue Festsprell i Dizzie Tider had Hege Sch\u00f8yen and Jon Skolmen as guest stars, and Dizzie og Damene at Chat Noir in 1993 had Elisabeth Andreassen and Ellen Nikolaysen as guest performers. In their comedy routines Numme and Gunstr\u00f8m became an iconic couple playing their characteristic parts, exchanging insults and witty retorts, with Numme attempting to teach and direct the hopelessly inept Gunstr\u00f8m in various tunes and performances. Gunstr\u00f8m's comedic talent would often make the audience bowl over laughing. The group won the Spellemannprisen award for 1973 for best children's album, with Den aller siste ra-ta-ta-ta. They reached a large public through their television shows. Their television show Sim Sala Bim from 1973 won the Bronze Rose at the Festival Rose d'Or in Montreux. The film Tut og kj\u00f8r was produced in 1975. The group was awarded the statuette Snill Gutt in 1988, the Swedish Lisebergappl\u00e5den in 1991, the Jens Book-Jenssen's prize in 1993, and the Leonard Statuette in 1993. A square in the city Skien was named \"Dizzie Tunes plass\" in 1999. == Band members == * Yngvar Numme \u2013 front vocals, textwriter, trumpet * Tor Erik Gunstr\u00f8m \u2013 drums, vocals * \u00d8yvind Klingberg \u2013 piano, vocals * Svein Helge H\u00f8gberg \u2013 bass, vocals * Einar Idland \u2013 guitar, vocals ==References== == External links == *Dizzie Tunes - Ny Y\u00e5kke, Ny Y\u00e5kke on YouTube Category:1959 establishments in Norway Category:2002 disestablishments in Norway Category:Children's musical groups Category:Leonard Statuette winners Category:Melodi Grand Prix contestants Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2002 Category:Musical groups established in 1959 Category:Norwegian comedy troupes Category:Norwegian musical groups Category:Spellemannprisen winners ",
