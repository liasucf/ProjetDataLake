    "text": "Labour in red. Elections to Manchester City Council were held on 5 May 2011, along with the 2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum. One third of the council was up for election, with each successful candidate serving a four-year term of office, expiring in 2015. The Labour Party retained overall control of the council, managing to win every seat contested. Overall turnout was a comparatively high 31.6%, although much down on the previous year's general election turnout of 50.9%. Councillors elected in 2007 were defending their seats this year, and vote share changes are compared on this basis. ==Election result== After the election, the composition of the council was as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Party!!Seats!! \u00b1 |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |Labour || 75 || +13 |- |style=\"background- color: \" | |Liberal Democrat || 20 || -11 |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |Independent Liberal Democrat || 1 || -1 |- |style=\"background-color: \" | |Conservative || 0 || -1 |} ==Ward results== Asterisks denote incumbent Councillors seeking re-election. Councillors seeking re-election were elected in 2007, and results are compared to that year's polls on that basis. ===Ancoats and Clayton=== ===Ardwick=== ===Baguley=== ===Bradford=== ===Brooklands=== ===Burnage=== ===Charlestown=== ===Cheetham=== ===Chorlton=== ===Chorlton Park=== ===City Centre=== ===Crumpsall=== ===Didsbury East=== ===Didsbury West=== ===Fallowfield=== ===Gorton North=== ===Gorton South=== ===Harpurhey=== ===Higher Blackley=== ===Hulme=== ===Levenshulme=== ===Longsight=== ===Miles Platting and Newton Heath=== ===Moss Side=== ===Moston=== ===Northenden=== ===Old Moat=== ===Rusholme=== ===Sharston=== ===Whalley Range=== Incumbent councillor Faraz Bhatti was last elected in 2007 as a Liberal Democrat but defected to the Conservatives in January 2008.
