    "text": "Telltale Texas Hold'em is a poker video game released by Telltale Games. It is the only game by Telltale Games to use solely original characters rather than licensed ones. The game was hinted at by Telltale Games before release when they stated that they would release a mini game or two before the announcement of their first adventure game. Telltale Texas Hold'Em was released by Telltale to examine the benefits of digital distribution. The game would serve as the basis for Telltale's other poker games, Poker Night at the Inventory and Poker Night 2. == Plot == Harry Weinhead, Boris Krinkle, Theodore Dudebrough, and Grandma Shakey compete against the player in the Telltale Texas Hold'Em tournament, a fictional poker tournament held in Las Vegas, Nevada. Boris Krinkle looks very much like Leonard Steakcharmer, a minor antagonist/character in Sam & Max Save the World and Sam & Max Beyond Time and Space. This fact is mentioned by both Theodore in Telltale Texas Hold'em and by Max in Sam & Max Save the World. ==Reception== Telltale Texas Hold'em was named \"indie game of the month\" by PC Zone magazine in July 2005. ==References== == External links == * Official Telltale Texas Hold'em website * * Category:2005 video games Category:Telltale Games games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Windows- only games Category:Poker video games ",
