Hunt shot Baltimore police officer Vincent Adolfo twice in an East Baltimore alley on November 18, 1985, after Adolfo spotted him running from a stolen Cadillac. He was captured five days later at a bus station in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In June 1986, a Baltimore jury convicted Hunt of first degree murder, and he was sentenced to death the following month. Eleven years later, Hunt was executed by lethal injection at the Maryland State Penitentiary, at the age of 38. == See also == * Capital punishment in Maryland * Capital punishment in the United States ==References== *Capital Punishment History - Persons Executed in Maryland since 1923.
