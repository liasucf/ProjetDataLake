Set on a limestone outcrop on the south side of the bay, the fortification occupies a natural niche in the formation, with a wall of piled coral rocks and cement covering part of the opening. This wall is about long, high, and thick. A cement gunport is set in the wall, about above ground level. This fortification was built by Japanese soldiers occupying Guam between 1941 and 1944. The structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991, as \"Inalahan Pillbox\". ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Guam ==References== Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Guam Category:World War II on the National Register of Historic Places in Guam Category:1940s establishments in Guam ",
