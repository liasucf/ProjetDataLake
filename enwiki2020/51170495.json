    "text": "Martin Hairer's theory of regularity structures provides a framework for studying a large class of subcritical parabolic stochastic partial differential equations arising from quantum field theory. The framework covers the Kardar\u2013Parisi\u2013Zhang equation , the \\Phi_3^4 equation and the parabolic Anderson model, all of which require renormalization in order to have a well- defined notion of solution. Hairer won the 2021 Breakthrough Prize in mathematics for discovering regularity structures. ==Definition== A regularity structure is a triple \\mathcal{T} = (A,T,G) consisting of: * a subset A (index set) of \\mathbb{R} that is bounded from below and has no accumulation points; * the model space: a graded vector space T = \\oplus_{\\alpha \\in A} T_{\\alpha} , where each T_{\\alpha} is a Banach space; and * the structure group: a group G of continuous linear operators \\Gamma \\colon T \\to T such that, for each \\alpha\\in A and each \\tau \\in T_{\\alpha}, we have (\\Gamma-1)\\tau \\in \\oplus_{\\beta<\\alpha} T_{\\beta} . A further key notion in the theory of regularity structures is that of a model for a regularity structure, which is a concrete way of associating to any \\tau \\in T and x_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} a \"Taylor polynomial\" based at x_{0} and represented by \\tau, subject to some consistency requirements. More precisely, a model for \\mathcal{T} = (A,T,G) on \\mathbb{R}^{d}, with d \\geq 1 consists of two maps :\\Pi \\colon \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\to \\mathrm{Lin}(T; \\mathcal{S}'(\\mathbb{R}^{d})), :\\Gamma \\colon \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\to G. Thus, \\Pi assigns to each point x a linear map \\Pi_{x}, which is a linear map from T into the space of distributions on \\mathbb{R}^{d}; \\Gamma assigns to any two points x and y a bounded operator \\Gamma_{x y}, which has the role of converting an expansion based at y into one based at x. These maps \\Pi and \\Gamma are required to satisfy the algebraic conditions :\\Gamma_{x y} \\Gamma_{y z} = \\Gamma_{x z}, :\\Pi_{x} \\Gamma_{x y} = \\Pi_{y}, and the analytic conditions that, given any r > | \\inf A |, any compact set K \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{d}, and any \\gamma > 0, there exists a constant C > 0 such that the bounds :| ( \\Pi_{x} \\tau ) \\varphi_{x}^{\\lambda} | \\leq C \\lambda^{|\\tau|} \\| \\tau \\|_{T_{\\alpha}}, :\\| \\Gamma_{x y} \\tau \\|_{T_{\\beta}} \\leq C | x - y |^{\\alpha - \\beta} \\| \\tau \\|_{T_{\\alpha}}, hold uniformly for all r-times continuously differentiable test functions \\varphi \\colon \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\to \\mathbb{R} with unit \\mathcal{C}^{r} norm, supported in the unit ball about the origin in \\mathbb{R}^{d}, for all points x, y \\in K, all 0 < \\lambda \\leq 1, and all \\tau \\in T_{\\alpha} with \\beta < \\alpha \\leq \\gamma. Here \\varphi_{x}^{\\lambda} \\colon \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\to \\mathbb{R} denotes the shifted and scaled version of \\varphi given by :\\varphi_{x}^{\\lambda} (y) = \\lambda^{-d} \\varphi \\left( \\frac{y - x}{\\lambda} \\right). ==References== Category:Stochastic differential equations Category:Quantum field theory Category:Statistical mechanics ",
