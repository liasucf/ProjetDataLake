    "text": "The Swindon Speedway team, also known as the Swindon Robins, are an English motorcycle speedway team established in 1949 that competes in the SGB Premiership, the top division of speedway league competition in the United Kingdom. They were league champions in the 2017 and 2019 seasons.\"Result: Thursday October 17\", speedwaygb.co.uk, 17 October 2019. Retrieved 18 October 2019 The club have raced on their home track at the Abbey Stadium, Lady Lane, Blunsdon since their inception. == History == === Early history === The Abbey Stadium, the home of Swindon Robins The formation of the club followed the sport's prehistory in the town at the now-demolished Gorse Hill Aerodrome, where dirt track racing had taken place since 1928. The birth of the Robins was a product of the partnership of Bristol speedway manager Reg Witcomb and businessman Bert Hearse. Under their direction, a cinder track was built. The first meeting, a non-league home challenge match, took place on 23 July 1949 against future rivals Oxford, and an official attendance figure of 8,000 was given, although employees of the club believe that 10,000 would be closer to the truth. The Robins lost their debut meeting 39\u201345 in a meeting that saw Ginger Nicholls top score for the home side with 11 points on his wedding day. In the process he won the first-ever race, was beaten by an opponent only once, and set the first-ever track record at 82.8 seconds. === 2010-2019 === Following difficult campaigns in 2010 and 2011, Swindon signed Denmark's Peter Kildemand, former world #5 Hans Andersen and Australian international Troy Batchelor, who rode for the Robins in 2008 and part of the 2009 season. Alun Rossiter also returned as team manager after a 2-year spell with Coventry, with whom he won the Elite League in 2010. In 2012, the Robins won the Elite League title after beating the Poole Pirates 95\u201389 on aggregate following a 45-year wait for glory. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, the Robins made the semi- finals of the playoffs, but failed to advance further. At the start of the 2015 season, Swindon Robins No 1 Adrian Miedzi\u0144ski was injured in the first meeting at the Abbey vs Poole Pirates, with Peter Kildemand filling in on a temporary basis before the club signed Australian international Darcy Ward. However, Ward suffered a career-ending accident while riding in Poland, and Kildemand once again stepped in to complete the season. The 2016 Swindon Robins team was nicknamed Roscos Roo's, because it contained five Australians in addition to the required two British reserves. In 2017, the Robins won the League Championship against Wolverhampton Wolves despite losing the first leg at their home track. A new stadium was planned to be built for the 2018 season. At the start of the 2019 season, the Abbey Stadium was to be reduced in size to 320 metres from its original 363 metres; the track record holder on the old track size was Leigh Adams, with a time of 63.86 seconds, on 31 August 2009. ==Riders== ===2019 team=== * Jason Doyle * Troy Batchelor * Rasmus Jensen * Adam Ellis * Tobiasz Musielak * Claus Vissing * Ellis Perks ===Previous seasons=== 2018 team 2018 Team * * * * * * * 2017 team * * * * * * * * 2016 team * * * * * * * 2010 team * * * * * * * * * * 2009 team * * * * * * * * * (No. 8) Also Rode: * * * * (as No. 8) 2008 team * * * * * * * * (No.8) Also Rode: * * * (as No.8) 2007 team * * * * * * * * (No.8) Also rode: * 2006 team * * * * * * * * * ==Club honours== ===British League=== Champions: 1967 ===National League=== Champions: 1957 ===National League Division Two=== Champions: 1956 ===Elite League Pairs Championship=== *2004 (Leigh Adams and Charlie Gjedde) *2005 (Leigh Adams and Lee Richardson) ===Premier League KO Cup=== Winners: 2000 ===Premier League Four-Team Championship=== Winners: 2003 ===British League Division Two Best Pairs=== Winners: 1994 (Tony Olsson and Tony Langdon) ===Young Shield=== Winners: 2000 ===Midland Cup=== Winners: 1967, 1968, 1994 ===Elite Shield=== Winners: 2008, 2018 ===Elite League=== Champions: 2012 ===SGB Premiership=== Champions: 2017, 2019 ==Individual honours== ===World Champion=== * Barry Briggs (1964 and 1966) * Jason Doyle (2017) ===World Under-21 Champion=== * Peter Nahlin (1988) * Leigh Adams (1992) ===World Ice Speedway Champion=== * Erik Stenlund (1988) ===British Speedway Championship=== * Barry Briggs (1964, 1965, 1966, 1967 & 1969) * Steve Bastable (1981) ===British League Riders' Championship=== * Barry Briggs (1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970) ===British League Division Two Riders Championship=== * Gary Allan (1993) ==All-time points scorers== {| border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 style=\"border-collapse:collapse\" |- align=left style=\"background:#efefef;\" !width=150|Rider !!width=100|Total Points !!width=50|Average |- align=left | Leigh Adams | 6442.5 | 9.72 |- align=left | Martin Ashby | 5476.5 | 8.61 |- align=left | Phil Crump | 4254 | 9.52 |- align=left | Mike Broadbank | 4239 | 7.84 |- align=left | Bob Kilby | 4192 | 7.95 |- align=left | Jimmy Nilsen | 3815 | 8.41 |- align=left | Barry Briggs | 3681 | 10.71 |- align=left | Ian Williams | 3452.5 | 7.54 |- align=left | Brian Karger | 2754 | 7.60 |- align=left |Neil Street | 1802.5 | 7.45 |- align=left |} ==Notable riders== ==References== ==External links== * * Save Swindon Speedway BBC Action Network * James Wright official website Category:Speedway Elite League teams Category:Sports clubs established in 1949 Category:Sport in Swindon ",
