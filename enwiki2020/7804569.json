    "text": "The City Tunnel () is a 17-kilometre rail link in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, running between Malm\u00f6 Central Station (Malm\u00f6 C) and the \u00d8resund Bridge, of which six kilometres under Malm\u00f6 city centre is in a tunnel, to increase capacity on the Scanian network by changing Malm\u00f6 C from a terminus to a through station. It is a part of the \u00d8resund Line to Copenhagen Central Station. The work was projected to cost 9.45 billion SEK. Under construction since March 2005, the line was inaugurated by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden on 4 December 2010 and revenue service commenced on 12 December 2010. Unlike other dual track railways in Sweden, traffic travels on the right; the tracks switch sides in Arl\u00f6v around 5 km north-east of Malm\u00f6 Central Station, at a flyover constructed separately. == Background == Planning for a railway connection passing through Malm\u00f6 to the proposed \u00d6resund bridge began in 1991. The task of investigating technology and cost of several options was assigned to Svedab AB (Svensk-Danska Brof\u00f6rbindelsen). In 1995, the City Tunnel Consortium was formed, starting the design of the tunnel solution. The main purpose of the tunnel was to transform Malm\u00f6 C from a terminal into a through station by building new underground platforms, enabling more rail traffic in the Sk\u00e5ne region and across the bridge to Denmark), to create more stations in Malm\u00f6, to relieve Continental Line from passenger traffic, to expand the catchment area of cross-\u00d6resund traffic and improve connections between places south of Malm\u00f6 and \u00d6resund trains. The opening of the new Triangeln underground station creates what will be one of the country's largest railway stations, with significantly reduced travel times from the region's cities to southern parts of central Malm\u00f6, including the large Malm\u00f6 University hospital. Malm\u00f6 thus now has two stations in the city center, of which Triangeln station has the most jobs and housing in its vicinity. A new station was also built in Hyllie, south of Malm\u00f6. === Construction === Construction commenced on 8 March 2005. Three major construction sites had been established, at Malm\u00f6 C, Triangeln and Holma/Hyllie. By the end of 2006, another construction site had been opened in Lockarp, where connecting tracks to Ystad and Trelleborg were being built. The underground station at Malm\u00f6 C was built in a 0.8 km long open trench which was then covered. To minimize traffic disruption, the extensive and time- consuming work was done in stages. In order to build Triangeln station, two 25 m deep vertical shafts were dug at the northern and southern part of the site, and the station was then milled out of the rock by a roadheader \u2014 a machine equipped with a rotating cutter head on a telescopic arm. The rock was then lined with concrete elements to finish the structure. Hyllie Station was built in an approximately 7 m deep shaft; the vault that covers the station is a distinct landmark in the Hyllie development area. The tunnel was mostly bored by two tunnel boring machines (TBMs). Underground drilling commenced in November 2006 and February 2007, respectively. On 25 March 2008, one of the TBMs achieved breakthrough at Malm\u00f6 C, followed by the second TBM on 21 April. Work was completed in December 2010, six months ahead of schedule. === Finances === The platforms of Triangeln station during the opening week According to a final estimate, presented on 30 November 2009, the cost of the City Tunnel will be 8.565 billion Swedish kronor (SEK) in 2001 prices, almost a billion SEK less than the budgeted 9.450 billion SEK established just before the start of construction in 2005, when the procurement of the large contracts and the comprehensive environmental assessment was completed. Following the latest cost estimate, the Swedish Transport Administration's share is about 6 billion SEK, Scania County 800 million SEK and the City of Malm\u00f6 more than a billion SEK. The European Union's contribution is 700 million SEK. According to an economic analysis conducted at the Center for Transport Economics (CTEK), the tunnel will produce a result ranging from slightly negative to slightly positive; most likely, it will bear its own costs. According to the Swedish Transport Administration's own forecasts, the project will not be profitable. These calculations were carried out in 2001, and since the early 2000s there has been a sharp increase in local and regional train journeys, making calculations from 2001 highly unreliable. In April 2008 the Swedish Transport Administration revised its forecasts, stating that \"...the economic viability of many railway projects in the real world will exceed the previously estimated [sic].\"http://banportalen.banverket.se/banportalen/templates/bvSubPage.aspx?id=1472&epslanguage;=SV&subject;=356 The report was commissioned as part of the basis for infrastructure investment in the transport sector from 2010 to 2021. According to a political principle established in Sweden during recent years, construction projects in areas where construction is overly expensive does not need to be fully economically viable. In such cases, a lower cost estimate can be used in the calculation, since it is not politically desirable for certain metropolitan areas to be neglected merely because of the high cost associated with construction in these areas. Without such a principle, it would not have been possible to build the City Tunnel, S\u00f6dra l\u00e4nken, G\u00f6tatunneln and other upcoming city projects. == Operation == Running time between Malm\u00f6 C and Copenhagen Central Stations was reduced from 35 to 33 minutes, since the savings gained by the shorter route are partly offset by the extra stop at Triangeln station. Maximum time savings will be 15\u201325 minutes for trips to and from Triangeln, a central location in Malmo. From locations north of Malm\u00f6, travel times were reduced by approximately 10 minutes for journeys to Copenhagen, since trains no longer have to reverse at Malm\u00f6 C. The full potential of the tunnel will not be realized until the line between Lund and Malm\u00f6 has been expanded to four tracks, a project currently in advanced planning. ===Route=== The railway starts at a new underground station section built beneath Malm\u00f6 C, called Malm\u00f6 C Nedre (Lower). From there, the railway runs in a tunnel to the new Triangeln underground station, 25 meters underground in central Malm\u00f6. It then turns south until it reaches Holma, and continues in an open shaft to the new station at Hyllie, a new development area south of the city centre. Here two lines branch off: one west to the \u00d6resund Railway Line, the other (opened in August 2011) to the Ystad and Trelleborg (Kontinentalbanan) lines.

Due to delays in equipment installation for integration between ERTMS and the older Swedish and (especially) Danish systems, there is a temporary arrangement using ATC. In 2012 (tentatively), when all trains using the City Tunnel are retrofitted, ATC will be removed and ERTMS deployed. Since ERTMS is already installed and tested, the changeover can be done overnight. ==Images== Image:Citytunneln, Holma, Malm\u00f6.jpg|Holma Image:S\u00f6dra schaktet, Citytunneln, Triangeln, Malm\u00f6.jpg|Triangeln Image:Citytunneln, Centralen, Malm\u00f6.jpg|Near Malm\u00f6 C ==References== == External links == * J\u00e4rnv\u00e4g.net entry on Citytunneln * PERIform Sverige AB - City Tunnel Malm\u00f6, Sweden * Category:Railway tunnels in Sweden Category:Buildings and structures in Malm\u00f6 Category:Tunnels completed in 2010 Category:\u00d8resund Bridge Category:Oresund Line Category:Underground commuter rail ",
