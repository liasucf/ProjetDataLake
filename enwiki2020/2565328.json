The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks (the former Paxson Communications). KKPX-TV's offices are located on Price Avenue in Redwood City, and its transmitter is located atop San Bruno Mountain. On cable, KKPX-TV is available on Comcast Xfinity channels 16 (SD) and 711 (HD). ==History== The station first signed on the air on November 15, 1986, as KLXV-TV (the last three letters of the callsign representing the Roman numeral for 65) and was an affiliate of the Trinity Broadcasting Network. In 1995, the station became an affiliate of the infomercial service InTV. In August 1997, the station's call letters were changed to KKPX after Paxson Communications (now Ion Media Networks) bought the station. KKPX became a charter owned-and-operated station of Pax TV (the predecessor of Ion Television, to which the network was renamed in 2007) on August 31, 1998. ==Digital television== RabbitEars TV Query for KKPX KKPX-TV had plans for a Mobile DTV feed of subchannel 65.1.http://www.rabbitears.info/market.php?request=atscmph A Mobile DTV feed did later launch, but it carries programming from 65.2 (Qubo). ===Analog-to- digital conversion=== KKPX-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 65, on June 12, 2009, as part of the federally mandated transition from analog to digital television.List of Digital Full-Power Stations The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 41, using PSIP to display KKPX-TV's virtual channel as 65 on digital television receivers, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition. ==Newscasts== From 2000 to 2005, KKPX aired rebroadcasts of KNTV (channel 11)'s 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts at 7 and 11:30 p.m. each weeknight. The newscasts were originally branded as NewsChannel 11 on Pax when KNTV was affiliated with The WB; after KNTV joined NBC in January 2002, the newscasts were first renamed to NBC 3 News on Pax, then to NBC 11 News on Pax several months later, after KNTV stopped branding by its common channel number on Bay Area cable systems. Like most other such arrangements involving Pax stations and major network affiliates, the simulcasts were dropped on June 30, 2005 (the day prior to Pax's rebranding as i: Independent Television). ==References== ==External links== * * * KKPX(TV) EEO Compliance statement Category:Ion Television affiliates Category:Television channels and stations established in 1986 Category:1986 establishments in California KPX-TV Category:ATSC-M/H stations Category:Television in San Jose, California ",
