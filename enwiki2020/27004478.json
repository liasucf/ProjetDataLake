The ovate, conical shell has an ash-gray color. It is ornamented with a reddish zone at the suture, and another, much wider and more deeply colored band, at the base of the body whorl. The spire is composed of seven rounded, swollen whorls, provided with ten or twelve distant and slightly oblique folds, marked also by a great number of transverse striae, which intersect the folds at right angles, and become more apparent near the base of the body whorl. The aperture is whitish or violet colored and nearly round. The outer lip is slightly margined, covered internally with transverse striae. The columella is arcuated, and twisted at its base. The inner lip, which partially covers it, is indistinctly striated, and forms a wrinkle at the upper part.Kiener (1840).
