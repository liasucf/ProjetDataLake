    "text": "Lamrim (Tibetan: \"stages of the path\") is a Tibetan Buddhist textual form for presenting the stages in the complete path to enlightenment as taught by Buddha. In Tibetan Buddhist history there have been many different versions of lamrim, presented by different teachers of the Nyingma, Kagyu and Gelug schools.The Sakya school, too, has a somewhat similar textual form, the lamdr\u00e9. However, all versions of the lamrim are elaborations of Ati\u015ba's 11th- century root text A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment (Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa).Lamrim: the Gradual Path to Enlightenment ==History== When Ati\u015ba, the originator of the lamrim came from India to Tibet,Lam Rim Meditation \u2014 What is it? he was asked by king Jang Chub \u00d6 to give a complete and easily accessible summary of the doctrine in order to clarify wrong views, especially those resulting from apparent contradictions across the sutras and their commentaries. Based upon this request he wrote the Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa (\"A Lamp for the Path to Awakening\"), teaching what came to be known as the lamrim for the Tibetans. Ati\u015ba's presentation of the doctrine later became known as the Kadampa tradition in Tibet. According to Tsong Khapa, in his Lam Rim Chen Mo (\"The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path to Enlightenment\"), Ati\u015ba took the number and order of the subjects in Maitreya and Asa\u1e45gas Abhisamayalankara (\"Ornament of clear realizations\"), which was based on the wisdom sutras, as the basis to write the Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa. In the Abhisamayalankara they emphasised the hidden meanings of the sutras.Abhisamayalankara Tibetan Buddhists thus believe that the teachings of the lamrim are based on the sutras that the Buddha taughtIntroduction to the Lamrim series; Preeminent qualities of the compilers and of the teachings pgs. 4-6Lamrim - The Stages of the Path and therefore contains the essential points of all sutra teachings in their logical order for practice. Gampopa, a Kadampa monk and student of the famed yogi Milarepa, introduced the lamrim to his disciples as a way of developing the mind gradually. His exposition of lamrim is known in English translation as \"The Jewel Ornament of Liberation\" and is studied to this day in the various Kagyu schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Tsongkhapa, founder of the Gelug school which is primarily based on Ati\u015ba's Kadampa school, wrote one of his masterpieces on lamrim: The Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path of Enlightenment (Tib. Lam-rim Chen-mo) which has about 1000 pages, and is primarily based on literary sources. There is also a medium-length lamrim text by Tsongkhapa (200 pages) and a short one, called Lam-rim D\u00fc-d\u00f6n (Tib.), which is recited daily by many Gelugpas and is about 10 pages long. The Lamrim was the first Tibetan text translated into a European language by Ippolito Desideri, a Jesuit missionary, who visited Tibet and made an extensive study of Tibetan Buddhism from 1716\u20131721.Alison Gopnik, Could David Hume Have Known about Buddhism? Charles Francois Dolu, the Royal College of La Fl\u00e8che, and the Global Jesuit Intellectual Network, accessed 26 March 2017, http://www.alisongopnik.com/papers_alison/gopnik_humestudies_withtoc.pdf Desideri studied the Lam Rim Chen Mo of Tsongkhapa, and his manuscript describing Tibet was one of the most extensive and accurate accounts of Buddhist philosophy until the twentieth century. ==Philosophy== ===Three kinds of motivation=== The starting point of the lamrim is a division of Buddhist practitioners into beings of three scopes, based upon the motivation of their religious activity. Disregarded in this division are individuals whose motives revolve around benefits in their current life. Striving for a favorable rebirth is implicitly the minimum requirement for an activity or practice to be classified as spiritual. Ati\u015ba wrote in \"Lamp of the Path\" (verse 2) that one should understand that there are three kind of persons: # Persons of modest motive search for happiness within samsara; their motive is to achieve high rebirth. Buddhists traditionally consider that this domain includes followers of most non-Buddhist religions who strive for a rebirth in a heaven. # Persons of medium motive are searching for their own ultimate peace and abandon worldly pleasure. This includes the paths of pratyekabuddhas and \u015bravakabuddhas, which seek personal liberation alone, the traditional goal of H\u012bnay\u0101na practice. # Persons of high motive, who, based on their insight of their own suffering, seek by all means to stop the suffering of all beings. This is the Mah\u0101y\u0101na Bodhisattva path of the samyaksa\u1e43buddhas, who practice the six Perfections. One of the formulaic presentations of the Buddhist path in the Nikayas is anupubbikath\u0101, \"graduated talk\" or \"progressive instruction,\" in which the Buddha talks on generosity (d\u0101na), virtue (s\u012bla), heaven (sagga), danger of sensual pleasure ( \u0101d\u012bnava)In regards to translating \u0101d\u012bnava, Bullitt uses the word \"drawbacks\" while \u00d1\u0101\u1e47amoli & Bodhi (2001) use \"danger\" (p. 485), and Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-25) recommend \"disadvantage, danger\" (p. 99, entry for \"\u0100d\u012bnava,\" retrieved 2007-11-13 from ). and renunciation (nekkhamma). When the listener is prepared by these topics, the Buddha then delivers \"the teaching special to the Buddhas,\"Majjhima Nikaya 56, To Upali, verse 18.Bhikkhu Nanamoli & Bhikku Bodhi. the Four Noble Truths (catt\u0101ri ariya-sacc\u0101ni),See, for instance, Bullitt (2005). by which arises \"the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma.\"Carole Anderson (2013), Pain and its Ending, p.143 In the Tibetan Lamrim teachings, the Bodhisattva-path, with its training of the six perfections, is added to this formula. ===Subjects of the lamrim=== Although lamrim texts cover much the same subject areas, subjects within them may be arranged in different ways. The lamrim of Ati\u015ba starts with bodhicitta, the altruistic mind of enlightenment, followed by taking the bodhisattva vows. Gampopa's lamrim, however, starts with the Buddha-nature, followed by the preciousness of human rebirth. Tsongkhapa's texts start with reliance on a guru (Tib.: lama), followed by the preciousness of human rebirth, and continue with the paths of the modest, medium and high scopes. Gampopa and Tsongkhapa expanded the short root-text of Ati\u015ba into an extensive system to understand the entire Buddhist philosophy. In this way, subjects like karma, rebirth, Buddhist cosmology and the practice of meditation are gradually explained in logical order. ====Liberation in the Palm of your Hand==== An example of the outline for lamrim teachings is that of Liberation in the Palm of your Hand by Pabongkhapa D\u00e9chen Nyingpo. An abbreviated and annotated outline follows to show the structure of this lamrim: ;Introduction * the greatness of the author of the lamrim, to establish the authenticity of the teaching * the greatness of the lamrim itself, to gain respect for it * the way the instructions are to be received and given * the way the students are to be guided through the subjects. This fourth subject has two divisions: :* the way to rely on a spiritual guide :* the way to train your mind on the basis of the correct way to rely on the spiritual guide. This last heading contains the rest of the instructions under the headings: ::* the way to encourage yourself to take the essence of this precious human rebirth ::* the way to take the essence of this precious human rebirth (that is: training your mind in the paths of the three scopes included within the lamrim) ;The path shared with persons who have the modest scope motivation Striving for a rebirth in the upper realms: * the reality that this life will end and that you will die * the suffering in a rebirth in the lower realms (a rebirth as hell being, hungry ghost or animal, which you want to avoid) * (so you) take refuge in the three Jewels: Buddha, Dharma and Sangha * (and adjust your behavior of body, speech and mind according to the) law of cause and effect/ karma which will lead you to a favorable rebirth within cyclic existence in the human-, demigod-, or god realm. ;The path shared with persons who have the medium scope motivation Striving for liberation of cyclic existence. The training in the medium scope path will lead to the development of the wish to be liberated from all un-free rebirths in cyclic existence through the power of afflictive emotions and karma. It consists of: * The Four Noble Truths: :* The truth of suffering (in cyclic existence in general, including the favorable rebirths) :* The truth of the causes of suffering (the afflictive emotions, especially ignorance) :* The truth of cessation (there is a state that is free of suffering and its origins) :* The truth of paths (the way to attain this state free of suffering and its causes by practicing ethics, concentration and wisdom) * Another presentation of the middle scope subjects is the presentation of the 12 links of dependent arising ;The path for persons who have the high scope motivation Striving for complete buddhahood: * Developing mind of enlightenment (bodhicitta), the wish to become a buddha for the welfare of all sentient beings: :* the advantages of the mind of enlightenment; :* the way to develop the mind of enlightenment :* the 7-point instruction in seeing all sentient beings as your mothers (from previous lives and contemplating their kindness towards you) :* the instruction on how to exchange your self-interest for others' interest (by looking at the drawbacks of self-cherishing and the advantages of cherishing others) * the way to train your mind after developing the mind of enlightenment, by training the six perfections: :* training in the perfection of generosity :* training in the perfection of ethics :* training in the perfection of patience :* training in the perfection of joyful effort :* training in the perfection of concentration :* training in the perfection of wisdom ==Further reading== ===Classical Lamrim Books (in historical order)=== * *Atisha's Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment by Geshe Sonam Rinchen, Snow Lion Publications *The Jewel Ornament of Liberation by Gampopa, translated and annotated by Herbert V.
