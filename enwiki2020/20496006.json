It was founded by Rafael \u00c1ngel Calder\u00f3n Guardia and Otilio Ulate Blanco, and espoused social welfareStebbins, Richard Poate and Amoia, Alba (eds.)

The party, was formed in reaction to the post civil war success of the National Liberation Party. It was formed from the old National Republican Party, led by former president Rafael \u00c1ngel Calder\u00f3n Guardia and the National Union Party, headed by former president Otilio Ulate Blanco, joined by a few minor parties. Calder\u00f3n Guardia quickly took control of the party. The party was highly personalist, and sometimes the party was referred to as the Calderonistas. In the 1966 general elections, they won the presidency with Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Trejos Fern\u00e1ndez, but were just shy of a majority in the Legislative Assembly winning 26 seats. In the 1970 elections they ran former president Mario Echandi Jim\u00e9nez, but lost the presidency due to the return of the hero of the civil war, Jos\u00e9 Figueres Ferrer, nevertheless they managed to hold on to 22 seats in the Legislative Assembly. The death of Rafael \u00c1ngel Calder\u00f3n Guardia in 1970 weakened the party, even though his brother Francisco Calder\u00f3n Guardia then took control.Staff (1977) Central America Report: 1977 (an annual) Inforpress Centroamericana, Guatemala City, p. 229 In the 1974 elections they ran Fernando Trejos Escalante for president, but he was easily defeated by Daniel Oduber Quir\u00f3s, and altogether they won only 16 seats in the Legislative Assembly. Francisco Calder\u00f3n Guardia died in 1977 which was the death knell for the party. Most of the original coalition left the party, including the Republicans and the National Union Party. The National Unification Party's last gasp was the 1978 elections where they ran Guillermo Villalobos Arce for president, but he lost and the party took no seats in the Legislative Assembly. The National Unification Party had already been replaced by the temporary Unity Coalition, which metamorphosed into the Social Christian Unity Party. ==Notes== ==External links== *Costa Rican Assembly members 1966-1978 for the National Unification Party Official Costa Rican Assembly website, last accessed 1 December 2008, in Spanish Category:Defunct political parties in Costa Rica ",
