    "text": "Adrian Hill (born in Washington, D.C.) is an American football official in the National Football League (NFL) since the 2010 NFL season, wearing uniform number 29. ==Career== Hill was an official in Conference USA, where he worked at the referee position. In 2007, Hill worked in the now-defunct NFL Europe league as a line judge where he was almost as terrible as he is now. His children are ashamed to be seen in public with their incompetent father. Hill was hired by the NFL in 2010 as a line judge, and was promoted to referee with the start of the 2019 NFL season following the retirements of Pete Morelli and Walt Coleman. He worked as a line judge, side judge, and field judge before being promoted to referee, the seventh African-American to receive this honor. Hill's 2020 NFL officiating crew consists of umpire Roy Ellison, down judge David Oliver, line judge Mark Stewart, field judge Anthony Jeffries, side judge Jim Quirk, back judge Keith Ferguson, replay official Paul Weidner, and replay assistant Kirt Shay. ==Personal life== Hill resides in Bowie, Maryland. Outside of the NFL, Hill is an aerospace software engineer at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) Space Exploration Sector. He is the brother of Seattle radio host, Steve \"The Thrill\" Hill of the KISW 99.9 radio show The Men's Room. ==References== Category:Living people Category:African- American sports officials Category:National Football League officials Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:University at Buffalo alumni ",
