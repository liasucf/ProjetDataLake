A student of Jacques-Louis David, he exhibited at the Salon from 1817 onwards and gained many official commissions, notably for the mus\u00e9e de l'Histoire de France at the ch\u00e2teau de Versailles. He was awarded the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. He married the miniature painter Fran\u00e7oise-Julie-Aldrovandine Lenoir, who died in the 1832 Paris cholera epidemic. They had two children, including the talented amateur painter St\u00e9phanie (1822-1908), who in 1842 married the agronomist Victor Rendu. The Rouillard family tomb is in the first section of the first division of the cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse. ==External links== *Extract from Charles Gabe's dictionary of 19th century French artists *Rouillard's portrait of Juglar Category:1789 births Category:1852 deaths Category:French portrait painters Category:Artists from Paris Category:19th-century French painters Category:French male painters Category:Burials at Montparnasse Cemetery ",
