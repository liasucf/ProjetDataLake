It is prepared primarily from roasted corn flour (a.k.a tom brown) and palm nut soup and kidney beans, or any stew as a variety and for mordernization with assorted other ingredients. Its a food that is served on special occasions and it is feared to go extinct. Aprapransa in a Pack Aprapransa as a complete meal is not a food that is commonly found on the streets of Ghana or is prepared every day in the house. It is usually served by the Akan tribe on special occasions such as marriage ceremonies, naming ceremonies, birthday celebrations, family cookouts, etc. Its name derived from the fact that it is a complete meal with its soup/stew integrated that one only needs to wipe their hand (prapra wo nsa) to eat. == Ingredients and preparation == The main ingredients are roasted corn flour (Tom brown) and palmnut or palm oil. Other ingredients include beans, vegetables such as tomatoes, onion, pepper, ginger, or garlic. It features seafood such as smoked fish, dried fish, salted fish or crabs. To prepare the dish, start the soup by boiling the palm nuts, pound and sieve to extract the palm juice. Steam the fish/meat with the ingredients for about ten minutes then pour the palm nut juice into the pot to cook for about 30 minutes. When the soup is well-cooked, some of the palm oil is scooped and some meat taken out for garnishing. A mixing spoon is washed and ready as the fried-corn flour is gradually added to the soup while it is stirred continuously to prevent it from lumping. Water is added if the texture is too thick. After about twenty minutes, the cooked kidney beans are poured into the broth and stirred to mix. In about ten minutes, after adding the beans it must be well-cooked and ready to be served. If stew is to be used instead, then the vegetables are fried in palm oil, adding seafood and group pepper. Water and corn flour are added and the dish is brought to a boil. It is simmered until cooked and served hot. Roasted corn flour can either be purchased at Ghanaian markets or made from plain corn flour in a pan. == See also == * Ghanaian Cuisine == External links == * Video: How to prepare Aprapransa == References == Category:African cuisine Category:Ghanaian cuisine Category:Maize dishes Category:National dishes ",
