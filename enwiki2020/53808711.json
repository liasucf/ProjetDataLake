The Legendaries are five heroes who, in an attempt to stop an evil sorcerer named Darkhell from using the Stone of Jov\u00e9nia,one of six magical stones used to create the world of Alysia, were unable to keep it from shattering, causing everyone, themselves included, to revert to childhood. Blamed by the people of Alysia for the \"Jov\u00e9nia Incident\", the Legendaries split up, only to be reunited by their erstwhile leader Danael in an attempt to undo the spell and restore their adulthood. Sales for the comic books began in October 2012. The comic books sold over 2 million copies. ==The Legendaries== * Danael - The Leader of the Legendaries.
