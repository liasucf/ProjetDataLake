    "text": "Arthur Millett (April 21, 1874 in Pittsfield, Maine \u2013 February 24, 1952 in Los Angeles, California), born Arthur Nelson Millett, was an early American motion picture actor whose career was at its height in the silent film era. ==Biography== Born in 1874, Millett was signed on to appear in his first film relatively late in life at age 40 in 1914, but immediately work began to pick up. His first film The Lost Treasure was released in 1914. In 1915, he starred in films such as Coals of Fire and The Law of the Wilds, working with prolific actors such as Harry von Meter and Vivian Rich. Millett starred in a total of 116 film in his career. With the advent of sound films, however, his career declined significantly. In the majority of the roles in his 60 or so films after 1927, Millett was uncredited. He retired from film in 1940 and died in 1952. ==Partial filmography== * Coals of Fire (1915) * The Law of the Wilds (1915) * The Hidden Spring (1917) * Madame Sphinx (1918) * Shifting Sands (1918) * Station Content (1918) * Alias Mary Brown (1918) * The Hand at the Window (1918) * Her American Husband (1918) * Todd of the Times (1919) * Bare- Fisted Gallagher (1919) * The Egg Crate Wallop (1919) * West Is West (1920) * Drag Harlan (1920) * The Scuttlers (1920) * Live Sparks (1920) * Hearts Up (1921) * The Match-Breaker (1921) * A Broken Doll (1921) * Tracked to Earth (1922) * Around the World in Eighteen Days (1923) * A Man of Action (1923) * Yankee Madness (1924) * The White Sin (1924) * American Manners (1924) * Mistaken Orders (1925) * The Crimson Runner (1925) * The Buckaroo Kid (1926) * Glenister of the Mounted (1926) * The Two-Gun Man (1926) * The Glorious Fourth (1927) * Wolf's Clothing (1927) * Shootin' Irons (1927) * The Body Punch (1929) * The Widow in Scarlet (1932) * No Living Witness (1932) * Honor of the Mounted (1932) * The County Fair (1932) * Winds of the Wasteland (1936) * The Fugitive Sheriff (1936) * The Lion's Den (1936) ==External links== * Category:1874 births Category:1952 deaths Category:American male film actors Category:People from Pittsfield, Maine Category:American male silent film actors Category:20th-century American male actors Category:Male actors from Maine ",
