It then included four contributing buildings and a contributing site. It was deemed significant as a rare surviving example of a farm operated by the same African-American family for over 100 years. It was started by Crawford Robertson who was born a slave in Arkansas; it was operated in 2007 by grandson Evelyn Robertson with help of a cousin and a lessee. The registration included 24 photos (not available online as of April 2017). ==References== Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Tennessee Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1906 Category:Hardeman County, Tennessee Category:1906 establishments in Tennessee ",
