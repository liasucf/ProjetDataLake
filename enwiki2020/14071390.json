It serves the Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur region from its headquarters in Marseilles and secondary production centre in Antibes, along with newsrooms in Toulon and Nice. France 3 Provence-Alpes produces regional news, sport, features and entertainment programming. == History == RTF T\u00e9l\u00e9-Marseille began broadcasting on 20 September 1954. In 1964, RTF was replaced with ORTF by the government, with RTF T\u00e9l\u00e9-Marseille becoming ORTF Marseille Provence. After the de-establishment of ORTF on 6 January 1975, ORTF T\u00e9l\u00e9-Marseille became FR3 M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. Following the establishment of France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions on 7 September 1992, FR3 M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e was rebranded France 3 M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. ==Programming== ===News=== France 3 M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e produces daily news programmes for its two sub-regions - programming for the C\u00f4te d'Azur sub-region is produced in Antibes, with the Provence-Alpes sub-region receiving programming from Marseille. Each sub-region produces a 27-minute bulletin (midi-pile) at 1200 CET during 12|13 and a main half-hour news broadcast at 1900 during 19|20. Three 10-minute local bulletins for the Marseille, C\u00f4te Varoise and Nice areas are broadcast during 19|20 at 1845 CET. On 5 January 2009, a 5-minute late night bulletin was introduced, forming part of Soir 3. On some weekends and holiday periods, as well as during major events, the C\u00f4te d'Azur and Provence- Alpes news bulletins are combined into pan-regional M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e editions. == See also == * France 3 C\u00f4te d'Azur == External links == * Official site 03 France 3 Provence-Alpes Category:Television channels and stations established in 1954 Category:Mass media in Marseille Category:Mass media in Antibes ",
