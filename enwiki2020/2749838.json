It is headquartered in Arlington County, Virginia. The company's CEO is Josh Eastright. The company was founded in 1929 by David Lawrence and became employee-owned in 1947. When it was acquired by Bloomberg in September 2011, it was the oldest employee-owned company in the United States. == History == === Early history (1929\u20132011) === The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc. (BNA) was founded in 1929 by newsman David Lawrence as a subsidiary of United States Daily, now known as the US News & World Report. BNA's first publication was U.S. Patent, Trademark & Copyright Reports (now United States Patent Quarterly). In 1946, Lawrence sold BNA to five of his top editors: Dean Dinwoodey, John D. Stewart, Ed Donnell, Adolph Magidson and John Taylor. The editors opened up ownership to the rest of their BNA colleagues and from 1947 until 2011, the company was owned entirely by current and former employees. Tax Management, Inc., a subsidiary of Bloomberg BNA, was founded in 1959 by Leonard Silverstein to provide tax analysis in the form of the Tax Management Portfolios. The company has published over 500 Portfolios and now offers research, news, practice tools, and guidance for tax attorneys, CPAs, corporate tax managers, estate planners, and financial accountants. It offers federal, state, international tax and accounting services. Tax Management, Inc., is fully integrated into Bloomberg Industry Group and is based in Arlington, Virginia. === Recent history (2011\u2013present) === On August 25, 2011, Bloomberg L.P announced it would purchase BNA for an estimated $990 million. The transaction closed in late September 2011 at which time Bloomberg paid $39.50 a share in cash through a tender offer to BNA's employee owners. Bloomberg purchased BNA to bolster its existing Bloomberg Government, Bloomberg Law and Bloomberg News services and integrated BNA's vast databases and deep reporting of policy into its news and online products. In January 2014, Bloomberg BNA took over day-to-day operations of Bloomberg Law. On July 1, 2017, Bloomberg Government officially became part of Bloomberg BNA. On September 3, 2019 Bloomberg BNA changed its name to Bloomberg Industry Group. === Timeline === 1926 \u2013 Publisher David Lawrence launches The United States Daily, a daily newspaper of record covering the effects of government on business. 1929 \u2013 U.S. Patent, Trademark & Copyright Reports; BNA\u2019s first publication launched March 4 (today called United States Patents Quarterly). 1933 \u2013 The United States Daily folds in the aftermath of President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s \"bank holiday;\" converts into a weekly.
