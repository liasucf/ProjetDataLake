    "text": "Juraj J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk (first name also Juro or Jurko, ; baptised January 25, 1688, died March 17, 1713) was a Slovak highwayman. J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk has been the main character of many Slovak novels, poems, and films. According to the legend, he robbed nobles and gave the loot to the poor, a deed often attributed to the famous Robin Hood. The legend is known in neighboring Poland (under the name Jerzy Janoszik or Janiczek / Janicek) and the Czech Republic. The actual robber had little to do with the modern legend, whose content partly reflects the ubiquitous folk myths of a hero taking from the rich and giving to the poor. However, the legend was also shaped in important ways by the activists and writers in the 19th century when J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk became the key highwayman character in stories that spread in the north counties of the Kingdom of Hungary (much in present Slovakia) and among the local Gorals inhabitants of the Podhale region north of the Tatras. The image of J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk as a symbol of resistance to oppression was reinforced when poems about him became part of the Slovak and Czech middle and high school literature curriculum, and then again with the numerous films that propagated his modern legend in the 20th century. During the anti-Nazi Slovak National Uprising, one of the partisan groups bore his name. ==Biography== The page No. 39 of the protocol from the trial with Juraj J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk. It is archived under the title Fassio Janosikiana, anno 1713 die 16 mensis Martii. J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk is called here \"agili Georgius Jano\u0161\u00edk Tyarchoviensis latronum et praedorum antesignatus\" - cautious (or agile) Juro J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk from the \u0164archov\u00e1, the chief of the thieves and outlaws. J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk was born shortly before his baptism on January 25, 1688. His parents were Martin J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk and Anna \u010ci\u0161n\u00edkov\u00e1 from Terchov\u00e1. His godparents were Jakub Merjad and Barbara Kri\u0161tof\u00edkov\u00e1. He grew up in the village of Terchov\u00e1 in the Habsburg monarchy's Kingdom of Hungary area (present-day \u017dilina District in northwestern Slovakia). He fought with the Kuruc insurgents when he was fifteen. After the lost Battle of Tren\u010d\u00edn, J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk was recruited by the Habsburg army.Juraj J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk osobnosti.sk | \u017eivotopisy, diela, tvorba, \u010dl\u00e1nky, linky In autumn 1710, as a young prison guard in Byt\u010da, he helped the imprisoned Tom\u00e1\u0161 Uhor\u010d\u00edk escape.Ko\u010di\u0161 (1986), p. 47 They formed a highwayman group and J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk became its leader at the age of 23, after Uhor\u010d\u00edk left to settle in Klenovec.Ko\u010di\u0161 (1986), p. 50 The group was active mostly in northwestern Kingdom of Hungary (today's Slovakia), around the V\u00e1h river between Va\u017eec and V\u00fdchodn\u00e1,Odpo\u010d\u00edva J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk na dne Liptovskej Mary? Aktuality Terchov\u00e1 | terchova-info.sk but the territory of their activity extended also to other parts of today's Slovakia, as well as to Poland and Moravia. Most of their victims were rich merchants. Under J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk's leadership, the group was exceptionally chivalrous: They did not kill any of the robbed victims and even helped an accidentally injured priest. They are also said to share their loot with the poor and this part of the legend may be based on the facts too. J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk was captured in autumn 1712 and detained at the Mansion of Hrachov, but was released soon afterwards.Ko\u010di\u0161 (1986), p. 53 He was captured again in spring of 1713, in the Uhor\u010d\u00edk's residence in Klenovec (Klen\u00f3c).Ko\u010di\u0161 (1986), p. 56 Uhor\u010d\u00edk lived there under the false name Martin Mravec at that time. According to a widespread legend, he was caught in a pub run by Tom\u00e1\u0161 Uhor\u010d\u00edk, after slipping on spilled peas, thrown in his way by a treacherous old lady. J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk was imprisoned and tried in Liptovsk\u00fd Sv\u00e4t\u00fd Mikul\u00e1\u0161, present Liptovsk\u00fd Mikul\u00e1\u0161). His trial took place on March 16 and March 17, 1713 when he was sentenced to death. The date of his execution was not recorded, but it was customary to carry it out as soon as the trial was over. The manner of his execution, not in public awareness until the early 19th century, became part of his modern legend. A hook was pierced through his left side and he was left dangling on the gallows to die. This brutal way of execution was reserved for leaders of robber bands. However, sources diverge about how he was executed, and it is also possible that J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk was hanged. A legend says that he refused the grace offered in exchange for enlisting soldiers of his abilities with the words: \"If you have baked me so you should also eat me!\" and jumped on the hook.About Janosik ==Other members of J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk's group== * Vrabel and Hun\u010diak (aka Huncaga) (so-called Turiak) from Sta\u0161kov * Jakub Chliastkov from O\u0161\u010dadnica * Ondr\u00e1\u0161 from Dlh\u00e1 nad Kysucou * Ondrej Kindis from Dlh\u00e9 Pole * Plav\u010d\u00edk from Dunajov * Pavol Bernat\u00edk from Nov\u00e1 Bystrica * Kovalsk\u00fd and Bagaj from Rakov\u00e1 * Koval\u00ed\u010dek, Holubek and Val\u00ed\u010dek from Moravia * Gavora, Satora and Oresiak from Poland ==J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk in film== * 1921 J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk - first Slovak feature film; financed by Slovak-American Tatra Film Co.; director: Jaroslav Jerry Siake\u013e, J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk: Theodor Pi\u0161t\u011bk.
