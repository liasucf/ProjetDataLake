Okura studied at Trinity College, Cambridge from 1903 to 1906 but did not graduate. He competed in the first ever car race held at Brooklands in Surrey on July 6, 1907, where he came in second. Okura was also one of the pioneers who introduced the motor car to Japan. He was President of the Imperial Hotel, part of the Okura luxury hotel chain that is still important in Japan today. Okura Kishichiro was a primary patron in the establishment of the Nihon Ki-in or Japanese Go Association in 1924, where he organized and supported professional go players in Japan following the Meiji Restoration and subsequent ceasing of government support for the four go houses. He also invented the musical instrument the Okraulo, a type of vertical flute. == See also == *Kikuchi Dairoku *Suematsu Kench\u014d *Inagaki Manjir\u014d *Anglo-Japanese relations *Japanese students in Britain ==References== ==External links== * Reminiscences from the website of the Cambridge & Oxford Society, Tokyo * Japanese Students at Cambridge University in the Meiji Era, 1868-1912: Pioneers for the Modernization of Japan, by Noboru Koyama, translated by Ian Ruxton.
