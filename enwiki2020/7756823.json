    "text": "Trinity Catholic College is an independent Roman Catholic co-educational secondary day school, located over two adjacent campuses in the Northern Rivers region, on the northern fringe of Lismore, New South Wales, Australia. ==History== St Mary's College for Girls was founded by the Presentation Sisters in 1886, as a single-sex boarding school, and continued its development when the Marist Brothers opened St Joseph's High School for Boys in 1911. The two schools formally amalgamated to form Trinity Catholic College, Lismore in 1985, with a ceremony in late 1984 which laid the banners of St Mary's and St Joseph's schools to rest, and marked the official amalgamation of the two schools into Trinity Catholic College. Brother Peter Pemble, a former principal of the College between 2001 and 2007, was sentenced in 2015 for child sexual abuse crimes against a boy that occurred in the 1970s while Pemble was a teacher at Marist Brothers High School, . After pleading guilty, Pemble was given a custodial sentence of 18 months, with a non-parole period of nine months. In 2017, College Principal, Brother John Hilet, reported to the media that he felt privileged when two FTM transgender students confided in him that they were experiencing gender identity issues and sought to be identified as males. == Symbols == ===Motto=== Trinity's motto is; In Word And Deed. This is based on from the New Testament: \"little children, let us love one another, not in word or speech, but in truth and action\". ===Badge=== The triangle is an age old symbol of the blessed trinity \u2013 The father, Son and Holy Spirit. The cross stands as a reminder of the Christian nature of the college, and is the symbol of the life of Jesus. The Holy Trinity is a belief held by some Christian denominations, but not all, that the father, the son and the Holy Spirit all exist separately but together as a divine being. ===Colours=== The college colours of blue and gold were chosen by students to preserve the Marist tradition. Gold is the metal that never tarnishes, it is a symbol of God and love. Blue is associated with Mary, the mother of God who holds a special place in the college. The royal blue of the vest, jumpers and blazer also is symbolic of the morals and goals for the college. ==House structure== The College's pastoral care structure is based on a House system that consists of ten Houses, led by a Head of House (HoH) and two house captains. Within each house, tutors care for a horizontal house system, where each year is split into house tutors. Families generally belong to the same house. Students meet with their tutor each day for fifteen minutes, to carry out administrative duties and build a relationship with their peers. These houses are also the students sporting houses. The ten houses are: *Cannane House (aqua) \u2013 named after the first principal of Trinity *Carthage House (magenta) \u2013 named after St Carthage of Lismore, County Waterford, Ireland *Champagnat House (royal blue) \u2013 named after Marcellin Champagnat, the founder of the Marist brothers *Chanel House (red) \u2013 named after a principal of St Mary's College *D'Arcy House (gold) \u2013 named after the founder of the Presentation Sisters' Lismore congregation *Dennis House (green) \u2013 named after a teacher from Trinity *Doyle House (purple) \u2013 named after the first Bishop of Lismore, Jeremiah Joseph Doyle (1849\u20131909) *McColl House (black) \u2013 named after the first principal of St. Joseph's High *Nagle House (white) \u2013 named after the founder of the Presentation Sisters, Nano Nagle *Wilson House (orange) \u2013 named after the pioneer family of Lismore (William Wilson (1805\u20131886)) ==Facilities== Because of the ancient nature of the school, it appears as very unusual architecture with some buildings dating back to foundation and others being as recent as 2010.
