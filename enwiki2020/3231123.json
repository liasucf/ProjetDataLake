    "text": "In recreational mathematics and the theory of magic squares, a broken diagonal is a set of n cells forming two parallel diagonal lines in the square. Alternatively, these two lines can be thought of as wrapping around the boundaries of the square to form a single sequence. ==In pandiagonal magic squares== A magic square in which the broken diagonals have the same sum as the rows, columns, and diagonals is called a pandiagonal magic square... Examples of broken diagonals from the number square in the image are as follows: 3,12,14,5; 10,1,7,16; 10,13,7,4; 15,8,2,9; 15,12,2,5; and 6,13,11,4. 111x121px The fact that this square is a pandiagonal magic square can be verified by checking that all of its broken diagonals add up to the same constant: : 3+12+14+5=34 : 10+1+7+16=34 : 10+13+7+4=34 One way to visualize a broken diagonal is to imagine a \"ghost image\" of the panmagic square adjacent to the original: 111x121px111x121px The set of numbers {3, 12, 14, 5} of a broken diagonal, wrapped around the original square, can be seen starting with the first square of the ghost image and moving down to the left. ==In linear algebra== Broken diagonals are used in a formula to find the determinant of 3 by 3 matrices. For a 3 \u00d7 3 matrix A, its determinant is :\\begin{align} |A| = \\begin{vmatrix} a & b & c \\\\\\ d & e & f \\\\\\ g & h & i \\end{vmatrix} &= a\\,\\begin{vmatrix} \\Box & \\Box & \\Box \\\\\\ \\Box & e & f \\\\\\ \\Box & h & i \\end{vmatrix} - b\\,\\begin{vmatrix} \\Box & \\Box & \\Box \\\\\\ d & \\Box & f \\\\\\ g & \\Box & i \\end{vmatrix} + c\\,\\begin{vmatrix} \\Box & \\Box & \\Box \\\\\\ d & e & \\Box \\\\\\ g & h & \\Box \\end{vmatrix} \\\\\\\\[3pt] &= a\\,\\begin{vmatrix} e & f \\\\\\ h & i \\end{vmatrix} - b\\,\\begin{vmatrix} d & f \\\\\\ g & i \\end{vmatrix} + c\\,\\begin{vmatrix} d & e \\\\\\ g & h \\end{vmatrix} \\\\\\\\[3pt] &= aei + bfg + cdh - ceg - bdi - afh. \\end{align}title=Determinant|url=https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Determinant.html Here, bfg, cdh, bdi, and afh are broken diagonals of the matrix. In fact, broken diagonals are used in the calculation of the determinants of all matrices 3 \u00d7 3 or larger. This can be shown by using the matrix's minors to calculate the determinant. ==References== Category:Magic squares ",
