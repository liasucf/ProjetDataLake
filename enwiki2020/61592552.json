Talsorian Games's role-playing game Cyberpunk 2020. John Nephew, the founder of Atlas Games, would later recount that these adventures sold better than most d20 System books a decade later at the height of the d20 craze. ==Description== The characters are tasked with recovering something from a closely guarded biotech facility on a remote Pacific atoll. Although the characters have been provided with information such as maps of the facility and security patrol schedules, they discover that they have been misled, leading to unforeseen complications. ==Reception== In the September 1992 edition of Dragon, (Issue 185), Allen Varney found the adventure to be boringly predictable, saying \"You've seen it all 50 times before. Sorry, was I yawning? I didn't mean to be rude.\" ==Reviews== *Challenge #60 (May, 1992) ==References== Category:Cyberpunk (role-playing game) Category:Science fiction role-playing game adventures ",
