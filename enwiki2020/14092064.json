    "text": "Pyrenees is a steel inverted roller coaster at Parque Espana-Shima Spain Village in Shima, Mie, Japan. It opened in 1997 and was manufactured by Swiss company Bolliger & Mabillard. ==Ride experience== The train departs the station and immediately begins to ascend the 147.7-foot (45 m) lift hill. Once the train has crested the top of the lift hill, it banks to the right and drops at into a vertical loop. Exiting the vertical loop, the train then enters a zero-g roll, and then another vertical loop. Coming out of the second vertical loop, the train makes a high speed banked turn to the left and travels up into a cobra roll. Leaving the cobra roll, the train travels into a right hand helix which goes through the center of the second vertical loop. Pulling out of the helix, the train enters the mid-course brake run. Following the mid-course brake run, the train drops and enters a corkscrew which leads into a wide banked turn to the left. The train then travels over a small hill before making a right turn that leads into the final brake run. ==References== Category:Roller coasters in Japan Category:Roller coasters introduced in 1997 ",
