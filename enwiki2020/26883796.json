The journal published 14 issues per year in 2005 and 2006, but returned to a monthly frequency in 2007. An electronic version of the journal was launched in January 2012. Because of the advertising, web access was restricted to members only in 2012 to avoid direct-to-consumer advertising. Articles had been freely accessible since 2002. In 2013, paid subscribers were also allowed access. As the Journal is now published by SAGE, access is governed by that company's policies. All members of the Canadian Psychiatric Association receive a subscription as a membership benefit. == Abstracting and indexing == The journal is abstracted and indexed in Index Medicus/MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Science Citation Index, EBSCO, and ProQuest. According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2017 impact factor of 3.612, ranking it 30th out of 142 SSCI journals in the category \"Psychiatry\". This places it in the first quartile of Psychiatry journals. In the SCIE index, it is ranked 42 out of 142 (second quartile). ==Online archives== The complete archive of the journal from 1956 to the present is available online. Full-text articles had been freely accessible since 2002. However, in January 2012, online access was restricted for six months, except for members of the Canadian Psychiatric Association who get immediate online access. In 2013, subscribers were allowed immediate online access. == Notable articles == Examples of highly cited articles (>200 times) published in the journal are: * This review examined mechanisms of action of the atypical antipsychotic medications, emphasizing features of their pharmacology relevant to their profile of adverse effects. * This was a critical review of nosological issues related to bipolar disorder. It also proposed diagnostic criteria for bipolar spectrum disorders, making a unique contribution to the latter topic. * This review, by one of the developers of the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, examined literature concerned with alexithymia (an inability to identify and describe ones' emotions). The review summarized evidence that alexithymia reflects deficits in the cognitive processing and regulation of emotions. Implications for future research, and for psychotherapy, were identified. * This was a retrospective cohort study that evaluated mortality in a cohort with schizophrenia by linkage to a national mortality registry. A 20-fold increase in the risk of suicide was found, but elevated mortality due to other causes was also identified. Overall, the risk of mortality was doubled and it was estimated that life expectancy was diminished by approximately 20 years. * In this study, cholecystokinin-tetrapeptide (CCK-4) and placebo were administered to 11 panic disorder patients. CCK-4 (but not placebo) was found to induce panic attack identical to the spontaneous panic attacks that occur in people with panic disorder. ==See also== * List of psychiatry journals ==References== Category:Psychiatry journals Category:Multilingual journals Category:Monthly journals Category:Publications established in 1956 Category:Academic journals associated with learned and professional societies of Canada Category:SAGE Publishing academic journals ",
