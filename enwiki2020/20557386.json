Reactions to the September 11 attacks included condemnation from world leaders, other political and religious representatives and the international media, as well as numerous memorials and services all over the world. The attacks were widely condemned by the governments of the world, including those traditionally considered hostile to the United States, such as Cuba, Iran, Libya, and North Korea. However, in a few cases celebrations of the attacks were also reported, and some groups and individuals accused the United States in effect of bringing the attacks on itself. Many countries introduced anti-terrorism legislation and froze the bank accounts of businesses and individuals they suspected of having connections with al-Qaeda and its leader Osama bin Laden, the accused perpetrators of the attacks. ==United States== In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, the Bush administration declared a war on terrorism, with the stated goals of bringing Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda to justice and preventing the emergence of other terrorist networks. These goals were to be accomplished by means including economic and military sanctions against states perceived as harboring terrorists and increasing global surveillance and intelligence sharing. Within hours after the September 11 attacks, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld speculated on possible involvement by Saddam Hussein and ordered his aides to make plans for striking Iraq; although unfounded, the association contributed to public acceptance for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The second-biggest operation of the US Global War on Terrorism outside of the United States, and the largest directly connected to terrorism, was the overthrow of the Taliban rule from Afghanistan, by a US-led coalition. ===Muslim Americans=== In a Joint Statement by the American Muslim Alliance, American Muslim Council, Association of Muslim Scientists and Engineers, Association of Muslim Social Scientists, Council on American-Islamic Relations, Islamic Medical Association of North America, Islamic Circle of North America, Islamic Society of North America, Ministry of Imam W. Deen Mohammed, Muslim American Society and Muslim Public Affairs Council, stated: > American Muslims utterly condemn the vicious and cowardly acts of terrorism > against innocent civilians. We join with all Americans in calling for the > swift apprehension and punishment of the perpetrators. No political cause > could ever be assisted by such immoral acts. ===Leftist reactions=== According to Leftist intellectuals Michael Walzer, Leo Casey, Michael Kazin, James B. Rule, and Ann Snitow, writing in Dissent, one of the responses by the American left to the September 11 attacks was to blame American actions including the Gulf War, Sanctions against Iraq, support for Saudi Arabia, and support for Israel, for provoking the September 11 attack. Walzer later described the left's response to 9/11 as a \"radical failure.\" ===Controversial Christian American reactions=== Two days following the attacks, on the Christian television program The 700 Club, television evangelist Jerry Falwell called the event a punishment from God and laid the blame on \"paganists\", \"abortionists\", \"feminists\" and \"gays and lesbians\", claiming that they \"helped this happen\".

Bush for their statementsDavid John Marley, Pat Robertson: an American life (2007) p 273 and Falwell subsequently apologized. ==International reactions== After the attacks many governments and organizations in the western world and several pro-U.S. allies expressed shock and sympathy, and were supportive of burgeoning efforts to combat terrorism.

Yasser Arafat and nearly all the leaders of Palestinian National Authority (PNA) condemned the attacks and attempted to censure and discredit broadcasts and other Palestinian news reports justifying the attacks in America, with many newspapers, magazines, websites and wire services running photographs of Palestinian public celebrations. The PNA claimed such celebrations were not representative of the sentiments of the Palestinian people, and the Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo said the PNA would not allow \"a few kids\" to \"smear the real face of the Palestinians\". In an attempt to quell further reporting, Ahmed Abdel Rahman, Arafat's Cabinet secretary, said the Palestinian Authority could not \"guarantee the life\" of an Associated Press (AP) cameraman if footage he filmed of post-9/11 celebrations in Nablus was broadcast. Rahman's statement prompted a formal protest from the AP bureau chief, Dan Perry.Palestinian Authority has muzzled coverage of Palestinian celebrations' (MIDDLE EAST NEWSLINE) 'Israel to AP: Release film of Palestinian celebrations' (Jerusalem Post/The Associated Press) 'Bin-Laden Poster Seen at Gaza Rally' (The Associated Press).

Furthermore, she states that a man in a white T-shirt incited the children and gathered people together for the shot. The Panorama report, dated September 20, 2001, quotes Communications Professor Martin L\u00f6ffelholz explaining that in the images one sees jubilant Palestinian children and several adults but there is no indication that their pleasure is related to the attack. The woman seen cheering (Nawal Abdel Fatah) stated afterwards that she was offered cake if she celebrated on camera, and was frightened when she saw the pictures on television afterward. There was also rumour that the footage of some Palestinians celebrating the attacks was stock footage of Palestinian reactions to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.'The power of the TV- pictures, What is the truth?' by Lisa Erdmann (Der Spiegel) (Google Translated) , (translation original) \u2013 (source article) This rumour was proven false shortly afterwards, and CNN issued a statement to that effect.CNN statement about false claim it used old video , CNN.

The alleged Hezbollah \"spiritual mentor\" and Lebanese Shia cleric Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah condemned the attacks. * Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, stated: \"We are not ready to move our struggle outside the occupied Palestinian land. We are not prepared to open international fronts, however much we criticize the unfair American position.\" Yassin also stated: \"No doubt this is a result of injustice the U.S practices against the weak in the world.\" * Hezbollah condemned targeting civilians in the September 11 attacks.
