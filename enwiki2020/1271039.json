    "text": "Falernum and ice Falernum (pronounced ) is either a syrup liqueur or a nonalcoholic syrup from the Caribbean. It is best known for its use in tropical drinks. It contains flavors of ginger, lime, and almond, and most often also of cloves or allspice. It may be thought of as a spicier version of orgeat syrup. The form can be alcoholic (syrup liqueur) or nonalcoholic (syrup). Versions with alcohol are generally lower in proof (\u224515 ABV), adding rum and emphasizing the clove, ginger, or allspice flavoring aspects for use in mixing cocktails, typically tropical or tiki drinks. It is also enjoyed on the rocks. Depending on sugar content, the consistency is often thick and is therefore sometimes referred to as \"velvet falernum\" because of the feeling it leaves on one's tongue. Brands vary and the color can be white to light amber, and it may be clear or translucent. ==History== The origination of falernum may date back to the 18th century, when it was made as a punch in the areas around Barbados. Some disagreement exists over the origin of the name, and whether the earliest versions would have included the steeping of almonds. The same references also assert that earlier versions contained bitters such as wormwood. The inclusion of bitters historically would seem to be corroborated by a 1982 article appearing in The New York Times. In the literary magazine All the Year Round, owned by Charles Dickens Jr. at the time, an unnamed author wrote of falernum in 1892, describing it as \"a curious liqueur composed from rum and lime-juice\".Dickens, Charles, All the Year Round, \"Our Quarters in Barbados\", March 12, 1892, at p. 257, https://books.google.com/books?id=9DsBAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA257. The earliest known reference in bar manuals seems to be the 1930s. One producer claims his recipe dates to 1890, winning awards as early as 1923. ==Use in cocktails== Drinks using falernum include: *Better and Better *Captain's Blood Cocktail *Corn 'n Oil (Barbados) *Frosty Dawn *Key Cocktail *Mai Tai (not Trader Vic's) *Port Antonio Cocktail *Puka Punch *Royal Bermuda Cocktail *Rum Collins (some variations) *Bermuda Rum Swizzle *Saturn Cocktail *White Lion *Zombie (Don the Beachcomber's) * Trader Sam's Uh-Oa! ==See also== *Fassionola syrup * List of syrups *Orgeat syrup ==References== Category:Sugar substitutes Category:Liqueurs Category:Barbadian cuisine Category:Syrup Category:Drink mixers Category:Almonds ",
