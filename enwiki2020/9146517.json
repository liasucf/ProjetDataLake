Constantinos Charalambides was a Cypriot footballer, captain of Apoel Nicosia and the Cyprus National Team. Charalambides began his career at APOEL where he remained from 1997-2004 before moving to Greece for Panathinaikos from 2004\u20132007. During that time he enjoyed a one-year loan spell at PAOK in 2006. He also played in Germany for Carl Zeiss Jena before returning home to APOEL in 2008. His second spell with APOEL earned a total of 18 titles, 6 appearances in European competition group stages, and was part of APOEL's run to the quarter-finals of the 2012 UEFA Champions League. APOEL did not renew his contract at the end of the 2016 season and Charalambides stayed in Cyprus for AEK Larnakas. At the beginning of the current season, he was considered a reserve at AEK Larnakas and after participating in parties hosted by APOEL's president, AEK Larnaka terminated his contract. Charalambides made 93 appearances with the Cypriot national team, scoring 12 goals. ==Club career== ===APOEL=== He began his career in the 1998\u201399 season with Cypriot club APOEL where he became a regular, appearing 121 times, and helped lead them to two championship titles on 2002 and 2004. He also won one Cup in 1999 and two Super Cups in 2002 and 2004. ===Panathinaikos / PAOK=== He then signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with Panathinaikos in the middle the 2004\u201305 season. Charalambides would make a total of 44 league appearances for Panathinaikos achieving to participate in the Champions League Group stage in 2005. He was awarded as the best assist man in the Greek League for the year 2005-2006 but in the summer of 2007 the club chose not to renew his contract. In his final season with Panathinaikos, Charalambides spent the first six months of the season on loan to PAOK, where he made 16 league appearances and scored one goal. ===Carl Zeiss Jena=== In the summer of 2007, Charalambides spent time on trial at English Championship side Cardiff City but eventually signed with German club FC Carl Zeiss Jena, playing in the 2. Bundesliga for the 2007\u201308 season. In the first half of the 2007\u201308 season, Charalambides featured regularly for Carl Zeiss Jena, making 10 starts and 12 total appearances and scoring one goal, but in January 2008 he and the relegation- bound club agreed it was better for both the player and the club to part ways, and the contract was mutually terminated. ===APOEL=== Not long thereafter, APOEL managed to lure Charalambides back to Cyprus to again play for his former team, and on 27 January he signed a four-year contract with APOEL. Since then he won the 2007\u201308 Cypriot Cup, the 2008\u201309 Cypriot First Division and also two Cypriot Super Cups (2008 and 2009) with APOEL. He also appeared in five official 2009\u201310 UEFA Champions League group stage matches with APOEL. The next year he won the 2010\u201311 Cypriot First Division adding another championship title to his honours list. The following season, he appeared in nine 2011\u201312 UEFA Champions League matches for APOEL and provided three assists to his teammates, in the club's surprising run to the quarter-finals of the competition. The next season, he won again the 2012\u201313 Cypriot First Division, which was his 5th league title in his career with APOEL. During the 2013\u201314 season, he appeared in five 2013\u201314 UEFA Europa League group stage matches for APOEL and won all the titles in Cyprus, the Cypriot League, the Cypriot Cup and the Cypriot Super Cup. Charalambides made his only group stage appearance in APOEL's 2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League campaign on 17 September 2014, coming on as a 79th-minute substitute in his team's 1\u20130 defeat against FC Barcelona at Camp Nou. In the 2014\u201315 season, he managed to add two more titles to his collection, as APOEL won again both the Cypriot championship and the cup. On 15 May 2016, in the match which he lifted the 2015\u201316 Cypriot First Division trophy as APOEL captain, he announced that it was his farewell appearance to a club where he had spent and captained for his almost entire career, appearing in more than 400 matches in all competitions and winning 18 domestic titles. ===AEK Larnaca=== On 1 June 2016, Charalambides joined fellow Cypriot First Division club AEK Larnaca on a two-year contract.
