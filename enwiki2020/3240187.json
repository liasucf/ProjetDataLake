Retrieved: 17 July 2017. Its initial design featured an unusual \"stepless cockpit\" arrangement, much like those on most German World War II bombers designed during the war years from the He 111P onwards, with a streamlined, well-framed greenhouse canopy enclosing both the pilot and bombardier stations.Bowers 1989, p. 273. ==Operational history== The XA-21 was first tested with the streamlined cockpit but this configuration was found to restrict the pilot's forward vision, and the aircraft was rebuilt with a conventional (stepped) nose and cockpit structure.\"Swift Attack Bombers Race For Jobs In Army Air Corps.\" Popular Mechanics, June 1939. Although this change in the cockpit did not significantly affect performance, the XA-21 was not ordered into production.' The sole XA-21 had serial number 40-191. ==Operators== ; *United States Army Air Corps ==Specifications (XA-21)== In flight Front view ==See also== ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== * Bowers, Peter M.
