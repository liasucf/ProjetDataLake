    "text": "Lola Kenya Screen, or Lola Kenya Children's Screen is an audio-visual media festival and learning-by-doing mentorship for children and youth in eastern Africa. It encompasses film production, film criticism, cultural journalism, media literacy, marketing, and event planning and organisation. ==Origins== Lola Kenya Screen was established in October 2005 by arts and culture practitioner Ogova Ondego, who has been its Managing Trustee and Creative Director since then. The name Lola Kenya Screen is Bantu and means \"see or watch films in Kenya\". Lola Kenya Screen aims to seek, identify, nurture and promote creative talent among children and youth through hands-on skills development programmes in areas such as journalism, film-making, arts appreciation, and organisation and presentation of cultural and creative events. ==Objectives== The Memorandum and Articles of Association of Lola Kenya Screen are in Chapter 486 of the Laws of Kenya, under which Lola Kenya Screen is incorporated. Its main objectives are: *To make the means of film production accessible to emerging talents; *To build an audience for African films by encouraging culturally relevant, audience-sensitive films in local languages, cultures and reality; *To promote film skills and develop talent in Kenya; *To produce at least six films each year from film production workshops; *To collaborate with national and international partners in the training of young talents who wish to further their expertise in screenplay writing, cinematography, art department, sound, acting, directing, and producing. ==Programmes== ===Skills Development=== During the festival, children and youth serve on the film selection committee, programme preparation and presentation (Master of Ceremonies, MC), film jury, festival press (cultural journalism), and in the film-making workshop, which produces at least five short films for children and youth. *The Festival Press programme aims to raise the standards of creative and cultural journalism in eastern Africa. *The Production Workshop seeks to equip children and youth with the skills to make films. *The Programme Organisation and Presentation (MC) programme mentors participants in the organisation and presentation of events and programmes. *The Film Jury enables participants to develop critical appreciation of creative work in general and film in particular. The jury members, all of whom are children and youth, watch films and assign awards. * The Media Literacy programme develops understanding of the opportunities and dangers inherent in modern mass media and how to avoid problems by informed participation. Since August 2006, when Lola Kenya Screen opened her doors to the first group of participants, some 254 children and youth had by December 2011 passed through her. ===Other programmes=== ;Marketing This is the platform on which various stakeholders network, publicise and market values, products and services targeting children, youth and family during the festival. Docs for Kids, a programme for trainers of trainers of makers of documentary films for children and youth, and IPO-Eastern Africa, for instance, were launched here. This is also the entry point for international productions into eastern Africa, as many of the international films exhibited here are unlikely to be shown anywhere else in Africa, which has hardly any market for children and youth films. ;Schools outreach Lola Kenya Screen showcases films in educational institutions in and around Nairobi and helps to make pupils and students aware of the importance of mass media in modern societies. ;Community screening and mobile cinema Lola Kenya Screen collaborates with various partners to show films, conduct workshops and host seminars in communities in Nairobi and its environs. One such partner is Slum- TV, with whom Lola Kenya Screen reaches out to the public in the slums of Mathare, Huruma, Jericho and Kibera. ;Lola Kenya Screen film forum This is a monthly showcase of films from eastern Africa that has been held since December 15, 2005. Held on the last Monday of every month at the Goethe- Institut in Nairobi, the forum is a gathering of film students, filmmakers, film journalists, producers, art directors and others. Films are screened and participants hold discussions and explore other initiatives to advance film- making in the region. ==Film festival== The annual Lola Kenya Screen film festival takes place in the first full week of August. Since 2008 it has also hosted the Kids For Kids Festival-Africa (KFKF-A) competition for films made by children for children across Africa. The film festival focuses on films by children and youth, films by students, amateurs and professionals for children and youth, and films involving children and youth. During the festival, children (6- to 13-year-olds) and youth (14- to 25-year-olds) serve on the film selection committee, on the film jury, in programme preparation and presentation (MC), in the festival press (creative journalism), and in the practical film-making workshop that produces at least five short films for children and youth. The festival exhibits the best possible films, both local and international, for children, youth and family. It showcases films in all kinds of formats, categories and genres: short films; long films; children's and youth films; animation; African films; experimental films; creatively packaged music videos; television series and programmes; feature films; documentary films; public service announcements and commercials; student films; and computer games. ===Details=== During the inaugural event in 2006, participants under the guidance of Antonia Ringbom of Finland made a compilation of nine short cartoons that won the Africa Grand Prize for achievement in a film made by children at the 5th World Summit on Media for Children in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2007.
