    "text": "{| |} MF \u00d8isang is a car/passenger ferry running the route between Ris\u00f8r and \u00d8ysang across the S\u00f8ndeled fjord. Constructed in 1950, it is the oldest wooden-hulled ferry still operating in Norway. On a daily basis, the ferry serves as a connection for students to and from school. The ferry makes 4 daily crossings in the winter months, increasing to 7 daily trips in the summer months to coincide with the tourism season. As needed, it also docks at a bathing and recreation area on one of the islands east of Ris\u00f8r town. The journey across the fjord is part of the North Sea Cycle Route. The route was threatened with closure in the late 1990s, but after a local interest group had worked to keep the route going, the ferry was refitted in 2003. ==References== ==External links== * ** Ferry Schedule Category:1950 ships Category:Ships built in Norway Category:Ferries of Norway ",
