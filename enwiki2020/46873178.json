    "text": "This is a list of all own goals scored during FIFA Women's World Cup matches (not including qualification games). Nigeria and the United States have scored three own goals for their opponents, while Norway has benefited from four own goals. Of the 23 matches with own goals, the team scoring the own goal has won four times and drawn three times.As per statistical convention in football, matches decided in extra time are counted as wins and losses, while matches decided by penalty shoot-outs are counted as draws. The only player to score two own goals is Angie Ponce from Ecuador, scoring twice for Switzerland in 2015. She later scored Ecuador's first World Cup goals in the same match. ==List== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%;\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\"|Key |- !align=\"left\" scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#bbffbb\"| |align=\"left\"|Player's team won the match |- !align=\"left\" scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffff90\"| |align=\"left\"|Player's team drew the match |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\" |- !
