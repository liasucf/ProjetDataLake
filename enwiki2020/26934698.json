The program, founded in 2006, is a subsidized one-year program of study designed for lawyers practicing in the public or non-profit sector. It is open to those whose first law degree was earned from a law school outside the U.S. as well as American lawyers interested in pursuing careers in the international development field. Upon completion of the LL.M., foreign students are required to commit to 2 years further public service upon return to their home countries. The unique curricular scope of the program covers topics relevant to lawyers, judges and public officials in transitioning states, including a strong focus on rule of law reforms. The LL.M. program was cut by the University in response for a need to lower costs. The final class of LL.M. students will graduate in May 2020, with the program ending following their graduation. ==Post-graduation employment== According to ONU Law's official ABA-required disclosures, 81% of the 2018 graduating class was employed in full-time professional positions 10 months after graduation (71% in bar passage required or JD advantage positions).
