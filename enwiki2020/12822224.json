Brionne is in the region of Normandy of northern France. ==Population history== ==Notable sites and buildings== The keep of Brionne was built in the 11th century A.D. and was destroyed in the 18th century. The keep was of a Norman variety because of its square shape. The church of Saint Martin includes a tower that uses Romanesque and Gothic elements. The ground-level floor of the church is of a Romanesque style while the first-story floor is of a Gothic style. The church's door was made in the 18th century A.D.. The church's altar was designed by Guillaume de la Tremblaye in 1694 A.D.. The altar was originally intended to be used in the Chapel of the Bec Abbey. The cemetery and the church of Saint Denis were used for religious purposes until 1790 A.D.. The cemetery was used until both the church and the cemetery were damaged by bombs in The 2nd World War (1944). The church was later partially restored but the cemetery ceased to exist. The church now does serve as a gymnasium.Commune de Brionne, Patrimonie (French) ==See also== * Communes of the Eure department ==References== *INSEE ==External links== *Official site) (French) *Blog about Brionne (French) *Medieval past of Brionne reveals it at the heart of Normandy's turbulant history - with images English Image:Brionne Eglise Saint-Denis.jpg|Saint- Denis church Image:Brionne donjon2.jpg|Keep Image:Brionnedonjon.jpg|Keep Category:Communes of Eure ",
