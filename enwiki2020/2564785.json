    "text": "Jack and Jill was a British children's comics magazine published between 27 February 1954 and 29 June 1985, a run of approximately 1,640 issues. The title was derived from the nursery rhyme of the same title but the characters 'Jack and Jill of Buttercup Farm' were otherwise unrelated. 'Jack and Jill of Buttercup Farm' was the cover strip for many years, originally drawn by Hugh McNeill and later by Antonio Lupatelli. The stories of 'Jack and Jill' were related in rhyming couplets, as were a number of other early stories, although by the end of the 1970s the stories were written in normal prose form. Others were told in captions below the illustrations or text comics, a style of storytelling common to pre-war nursery comics such as Puck and Rainbow. ==Series published== * Harold Hare * Teddy and Cuddly * Fun in Toyland * Flipper the Skipper / Flipper the Jolly Penguin * Freddie Frog * Jerry, Don and Snooker * Pixie Pip * Gregory Grasshopper * Chalky the Blackboard Boy * Katie Country Mouse * Tiger Tim and the Bruin Boys * Fliptail the Otter, by Bernard Long * Douglas Dachshund * Joe, based on the BBC TV series * The Wombles, based on the BBC TV series * The Enchanted House * Snuggles the Koala Bear * Linda and Her Magic Bubble Mixture * Little Miss, based on the characters created by Roger Hargreaves * Walter Hottle-Bottle * The Magic Roundabout, based on the TV series * Moonie * Tommy Trouble * Pinky and Perky based on the TV series * Toad of Toad Hall, based on \"The Wind in the Willows\" story ==References== Category:1954 comics debuts Category:1985 comics endings Jack and Jill Jack and Jill Jack and Jill Category:Defunct British comics Category:Magazines established in 1954 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1985 Category:Comic strip duos Category:Fictional British people Category:Comics characters introduced in 1954 Category:Child characters in comics Category:British comics characters Category:Comics about women ",
