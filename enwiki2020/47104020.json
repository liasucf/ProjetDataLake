    "text": "Kasper Dolberg Rasmussen (; born 6 October 1997) is a Danish professional footballer who plays as a forward for French football club Nice and the Denmark national team. Dolberg made his senior debut at Silkeborg IF in May 2015. He joined Ajax in July 2015 and made his debut for the club in July 2016. He represented Denmark at under-16, under-17, under-19 and under-21 level before making his senior international debut in November 2016. In May 2020 Dolberg was voted as player of the year by the fans of his club OGC Nice. While at Ajax, he was named Dutch Football Talent of the year after his first season in the Eredivisie in 2017. ==Club career== ===Silkeborg IF=== On 17 May 2015, he made his senior debut for Silkeborg IF in a Danish Superliga game against Br\u00f8ndby IF, replacing Adeola Lanre Runsewe after 63 minutes in a 2\u20130 home defeat. ===Ajax=== On 5 January 2015, Ajax announced that 17-year-old Dolberg would join from Silkeborg IF in the summer, signing a three-year contract valid from summer 2015 until summer 2018. He had been spotted by Danish scout John Steen Olsen, the same scout who discovered players such as Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107, Viktor Fischer, and Christian Eriksen for the Dutch capital club. On 13 May 2016, Dolberg agreed to have his contract extended until 2021. On 26 July 2016, Dolberg scored his first goal in European competition on his competitive debut for Ajax, in a 1\u20131 Champions League qualification match against PAOK. He made his Eredivisie debut for the club on 7 August 2016 in a match against Sparta Rotterdam, coming on as a substitute for Mateo Cassierra. The following week he was in the starting line-up for the league match against Roda JC and he scored both of Ajax' goals in the 2\u20132 draw, his first goals in the Eredivisie. On 29 September 2016, Dolberg scored the only goal in a 1\u20130 victory over Standard Li\u00e8ge in a Europa League match. He scored another goal in his first 'Klassieker' against Ajax' great rival Feyenoord on 23 October 2016, securing a 1\u20131 draw away in Rotterdam. On 20 November 2016, he scored a first-half hat-trick in an Eredivisie match against NEC. This made him the youngest non-Dutch player ever to score a hattrick for Ajax. On 9 March 2017, Dolberg scored the equalizer in what ended in a 2\u20131 loss to F.C. Copenhagen in the round of 16 of the 2016\u201317 UEFA Europa League campaign, thus ending a club record eight-month period in which Copenhagen had not conceded any goals at their home ground at Parken Stadium since 20 August 2016. ===OGC Nice=== Dolberg signed for Nice on 29 August 2019 for a fee of 20.5 million Euros. ==International career== In November 2016, Dolberg received his first call-up to the senior Denmark squad for matches against Kazakhstan and Czech Republic. On 11 November 2016, he made his senior international debut, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 4\u20131 victory for Denmark over Kazakhstan. On 10 June 2017, in a 1\u20133 away win against Kazakhstan in the qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup, he came on as a substitute for Yussuf Poulsen after 68 minutes and scored his first international goal in the 81st minute. In May 2018 he was named in Denmark\u2019s preliminary 35-man squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. ==Personal life== On 16 September 2019, Dolberg reported to the police that his luxury watch at an estimated value of \u20ac70,000 was stolen. Following a police investigation, in which the police recovered a surveillance video showing the culprit stealing the watch, his teammate Lamine Diaby-Fadiga confessed to the crime ten days later. Diaby was later sacked by the club. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Europe !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division !Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals !Apps!!Goals |- ||Silkeborg IF||2014\u201315||Danish Superliga||3||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||3||0 |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Ajax||2016\u201317||rowspan=\"4\"|Eredivisie||29||16||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||16||7||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||47||23 |- |2017\u201318||23||6||3||3||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||30||9 |- |2018\u201319||25||11||4||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||9||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||38||12 |- |2019\u201320||1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0||1||1||3||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !78||33||9||4||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||30||7||1||1||118||45 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Nice||2019\u201320||rowspan=\"2\"|Ligue 1||23||11||3||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||26||11 |- |2020\u201321||5||2||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||5||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !28||13||3||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||0||0||0||0||31||13 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !109||46||12||4||0||0||30||7||1||1||152||58 |} ===International=== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Appearances and goals by national team and year |- !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=5|Denmark |2016||1||0 |- |2017||3||1 |- |2018||6||0 |- |2019||7||4 |- |2020||4||0 |- !colspan=2|Total!!21!!5 |} ===International goals=== :As of match played 15 October 2019.
