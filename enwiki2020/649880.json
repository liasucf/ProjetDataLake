It runs from KL Sentral, the main railway station of Kuala Lumpur to KLIA as well as its low-cost terminal, klia2. The line is one of the two services on the Express Rail Link (ERL) system, sharing the same tracks as the KLIA Ekspres. KLIA Transit stops at all stations along the line, whereas KLIA Ekspres runs an express, non-stop between KL Sentral and KLIA/klia2. The ERL is operated by Express Rail Link Sdn. Bhd. The line is one of the components of the Klang Valley Integrated Transit System. It is numbered and coloured Teal on official transit maps. ==Line information== ===Stations=== There are six stations served by KLIA Transit. They are, from north to south: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; color: black; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%\" |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" style=\"color:white\" |Station Code | Name | Platform Type | Notes |- | |KL Sentral |Terminus (Island) |Northern terminus.

The KLIA Ekspres side platforms are accessed from the KL City Air Terminal (KL CAT) while the KLIA Transit island platform is accessed from the main Transit Concourse at Level 1. At KLIA and klia2, both KLIA Ekspres and KLIA Transit use the same island platform, with each service serving only one side of the platform. There are plans for a future KLIA Transit station to be built at Bandar Malaysia by 2026. == History == The KLIA Transit began operations on 20 June 2002. Since then there has only been one major accident. ===Accidents=== On 24 August 2010, Express Rail Link suffered their first reported accident in which 3 passengers were injured. Two ERL trains collided at Kuala Lumpur Sentral. One of the trains involved was about to depart at 9.45pm for Kuala Lumpur International Airport while the other train, which was empty, ran into it from behind. From April 4 2020, due to the 2020 Malaysia movement control order, which resulted in a significant reduction in passenger flow, all ERL rail services will be suspended until the end of the control period. == Other information == ===Journey=== *Distance: 57 kilometres from KL Sentral to KLIA *Duration: 36 minutes *Train Frequency: Once every 15 minutes(peak hours), Once every half-hour(non-peak hours, weekends) *Departure Times: ::KL Sentral :::First train at 0533hrs :::Last train at 0003hrs ::KLIA :::First train at 0552hrs :::Last train at 0100hrs ===Fares=== contactless smart ticket front & back Fares depend on the direct train service and the distance travelled.
