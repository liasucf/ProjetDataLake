    "text": "Count of Yebes () is a hereditary title in the Peerage of Spain, granted in 1649 by Philip IV to Juan Esteban Imbrea, Lord of Yebes and Valdarachas, knight of the Order of Calatrava.Real Asociaci\u00f3n de Hidalgos de Espa\u00f1a, Elenco de Grandezas y T\u00edtulos Nobiliarios Espa\u00f1oles, Ediciones Hidalgu\u00eda, Vol. 50 (Madrid, 2018), pp. 1037-1038 The title was unofficially held by Imbrea's descendants in Genoa, who never paid the inheritance taxes in the peerage of Spain. Thus, the title became vacant for more than two centuries until it was rehabilitated in 1922 by Alfonso XIII to the most legitimate descendant, \u00c1lvaro de Figueroa, 1st Count of Romanones, who was Prime Minister of Spain in 1912. ==Counts of Yebes== #Juan Esteban Imbrea y Franquis, 1st Count of Yebes #? #? #? #? #? #\u00c1lvaro de Figueroa y Torres, 7th Count of Yebes #Eduardo de Figueroa y Alonso-Mart\u00ednez, 8th Count of Yebes #Carmen de Figueroa y Mu\u00f1oz, 9th Countess of Yebes #Jos\u00e9 Eduardo Tur de Montis y Figueroa, 10th Count of Yebes #Francisco de As\u00eds Tur de Montis y Figueroa, 11th Count of Yebes #Pedro Tur de Montis y Hornedo, 12th Count of Yebes ==See also== *Count of Velayos *Marquess of Villabr\u00e1gima *Marquess of San Dami\u00e1n ==References== Category:Counts of Spain Category:Lists of Spanish nobility ",
