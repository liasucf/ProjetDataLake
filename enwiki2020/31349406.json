Nuplazid is the trade name for Acadia's proprietary molecule, pimavanserin, a selective serotonin inverse agonist preferentially targeting 5-HT2a receptors. Acadia had partnered with Biovail in the late-stage clinical testing of the drug, which showed trial failures as of 2009. Acadia is running multiple Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials with pimavanserin in several central nervous system conditions: dementia-related psychosis, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia inadequate response, and schizophrenia negative symptoms. , Acadia was among several companies that licensed compounds from Genzyme's small-molecule compound library. == History == Acadia started in 1993 as Receptor Technologies, based in Winooski, Vermont. \\----\"Biotech\", continuation of article, p.

The company planned to conduct an Initial public offering (IPO) consisting of 31.6% of the company in 2001, with the intention of raising and listing on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol ACAD. At the time, Acadia and Allergan were collaborating on development of a treatment for glaucoma, and Allergan would retain a 6.3% ownership stake in Acadia after the IPO.
