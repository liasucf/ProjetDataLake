He scored nine goals in 21 gamesNot including the January 1973 exhibition match \"Old Europe\" vs. \"New Europe\", which marked the 1973 European Community expansion. Jensen started the game, scored a goal, and was substituted after an hour, as \"New Europe\" won 2\u20130. for the Denmark national football team from 1972 to 1980. ==Biography== Born in N\u00f8rresundby, Jensen started playing football for local team N\u00f8rresundby BK in the Denmark Series, the then fourth best division of Danish football. Playing as a Right sided Attacker, he made his debut for the Danish national team in May 1972, and scored a goal in the 1972 Summer Olympics qualification match against Romania. Before having ever played a Danish league game, he moved abroad in 1972 as he signed a professional contract with German club Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. At M\u00f6nchengladbach, he played alongside fellow Danish national team player Allan Simonsen in attack. He won the 1972\u201373 DFB-Pokal, 1974\u201375 UEFA Cup, and two Bundesliga championships in his four years at the club. After 44 goals in 125 league games, he earned a lucrative move to defending Spanish La Liga champions Real Madrid in 1976. He played three successful years at Real Madrid, winning the 1977\u201378 and 1978\u201379 La Liga championships. While in Madrid, he scored the 300th goal in the European competition for the club. He moved to the Netherlands in 1979, to play for defending Dutch Eredivisie champions Ajax Amsterdam of the coaches Cor Brom and Leo Beenhakker. He met in Amsterdam other Danish players like Frank Arnesen and S\u00f8ren Lerby (and two years later also for a very short period Jesper Olsen). The routined player had to work hard for his position in the team for the first time at the age of 30 years. The midfielder had much rivalry from Frank Arnesen, Dick Schoenaker and S\u00f8ren Lerby, which trio formed one of the strongest (attacking) midfields of Europe those years. Jensen started as centre forward, when central attacker Ray Clarke was sold. Thereafter he played at the wings, as wing attacker for a period. When Frank Arnesen had been injured a part of the 1979\u201380 season Jensen moved to the midfield, there playing his best matches for Ajax Amsterdam. In the season 1979\u201380 he won with Ajax the Dutch Eredivisie league championship and also the semi-finals of the European Cup tournament for champions were reached that season. He returned to Denmark in July 1981, to play for AGF Aarhus, before he moved back to N\u00f8rresundby and played his last games for N\u00f8rresundby BK. In 2006, Henning Jensen was named among the nominees for DBU's \"Denmark's All- Time Best Footballer\" award, alongside Preben Elkj\u00e6r Larsen, Brian Laudrup, Michael Laudrup, Morten Olsen, Peter Schmeichel, Allan Simonsen and Jon Dahl Tomasson. He died after a short illness from cancer. ==Honours== * DFB-Pokal: 1972\u201373 * UEFA Cup: 1974\u201375 * Bundesliga: 1974\u201375 and 1975\u201376 * Spanish La Liga: 1977\u201378 and 1978\u201379 * Dutch Eredivisie: 1979\u201380 ==References== ==External links== *Danish national team profile * Category:1949 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Danish footballers Category:Denmark international footballers Category:N\u00f8rresundby BK players Category:Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach players Category:Real Madrid CF players Category:AFC Ajax players Category:Aarhus Gymnastikforening players Category:Danish Superliga players Category:Bundesliga players Category:La Liga players Category:Eredivisie players Category:Danish expatriate footballers Category:Danish expatriate sportspeople in Germany Category:Expatriate footballers in Germany Category:Danish expatriate sportspeople in Spain Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Danish expatriate sportspeople in the Netherlands Category:Expatriate footballers in the Netherlands Category:People from N\u00f8rresundby Category:Association football forwards Category:UEFA Cup winning players Category:Deaths from cancer in Denmark ",
