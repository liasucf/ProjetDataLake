    "text": "Dennis M. Levi is a South African optometrist. He is professor of optometry and vision science and a professor of neuroscience at the School of Optometry of the University of California at Berkeley, in California in the United States. He is a former dean of the same school, an appointment he took up in 2001. He was previously the Cullen Distinguished Professor of Optometry on the faculty of the University of Houston, in Houston, Texas, where he also did his PhD. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Optometry. Levi has conducted significant research into amblyopia. Education: Levi was born on 27 March 1947 in East London, South Africa. There he attended Selborne Primary School and Selborne College. He received his diploma in Optometry in 1967 from the Witwatersrand School of Optometry, in Johannesburg, South Africa. After practicing Optometry in Johannesburg and Vereeniging in Gauteng Province, South Africa, he and his new bride, Marilyn moved to Houston, Texas where he earned the O.D. (Doctor of Optometry) in 1971, M.S. (Physiol. Optics) in 1973, and Ph.D. (Physiol. Optics) in 1977 from the University of Houston. Professional career: Levi started his academic career at the University of Houston in 1972 as an Instructor in Optometry and progressed through the ranks becoming Full Professor in 1982. He served as the Associate Dean for Research from 1990-2001 and was awarded the University\u2019s highest honor, Cullen Distinguished Professor in 1996. In 2001, he joined the University of California, Berkeley serving as the Dean of the School of Optometry until 2014. Awards and Honors: * American Optometry Foundation Research Fellowship \u2013 1972 * Garland W. Clay Award (2) from the American Academy of Optometry -1982,1983. * Sigma Xi Faculty Research Award, University of Houston - 1986 * Glenn Fry Award from the American Academy of Optometry \u2013 1987 * Fellow Optical Society of America - 1995 * Distinguished Cullen Professorship - 1996 (lifetime)- University of Houston * Charles F. Prentice Medal Award from the American Academy of Optometry - 2011 * Edgar D. Tillyer Award from the Optical Society of America - 2016 * A.R.V.O. (Association for Research n Vision & Ophthalmology) \u2013 Gold Fellow \u2013 2018 * A.R.V.O. \u2013 Distinguished Service Award \u2013 2018 Guinness World Record: Dr. Levi holds the Guinness World Record for the Highest Hyperacuity. In April 1984, he repeatedly identified the relative position of a thin bright green line with a precision of 0.85 seconds of arc seconds, equivalent to a displacement of some 6 mm at a distance of 1.6 km. Publications: As of August 2020, Levi has published approximately 300 scientific papers and two books. His work has been cited more than 22,000 times and he has an h-index of 75 (Google Scholar): His publications include: Levi, D.M., Harwerth, R.S. and Smith, E.L.
