    "text": "Kevin Cullis (born 1958) is an English former Association Football manager and convicted fraudster from Brierley Hill. ==Managerial career== Cullis' brief managerial career at the professional level came when he was appointed manager of Third Division Swansea City on 8 February 1996 by prospective new chairman Michael Thompson. He had never played nor coached in professional football and his only previous management experience was as the youth coach of non-league club Cradley Town, then of the West Midlands (Regional) League Premier Division, and based at Cradley in the Black Country. Cullis managed Swansea City for just one-and-a-half games: a 1\u20130 home defeat to Swindon Town and 45 minutes of an eventual 4-0 defeat at Blackpool. In the second match, which took place at Bloomfield Road on 13 February 1996, Cullis\u2019 planned half-time team talk was ignored as the players took control. Christian Edwards gave the team talk and game plan instead, and Cullis resigned shortly afterwards. ==Personal life== In April 2003, Cullis was jailed for nine months for fraud and deception at Wolverhampton Crown Court after falsely claiming to be a highly paid marketing consultant. He was jailed again, for a further nine months, at the same court in September 2004 for handling a stolen insurance certificate and using it with intent to deceive. ==Managerial statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Team !rowspan=\"2\"|Nat !rowspan=\"2\"|From !rowspan=\"2\"|To !colspan=\"5\"|Record |- !Games!!Won!!Drawn!!Lost!!Win % |- |Swansea City | |8 February 1996 |14 February 1996 |- |} ==References== Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:Swansea City A.F.C. managers Category:English football managers ",
