    "text": "\"We Didn't Start the Fire\" is a list song by American musician Billy Joel. Its lyrics include brief, rapid-fire allusions to more than 100 headline events between 1949, the year of Joel's birth, and 1989, when the song was released on his album Storm Front. The song was nominated for the Grammy Award for Record of the Year. The song was also a No. 1 hit in the United States in late 1989. == History == Joel got the idea for the song when he had just turned 40. He was in a recording studio and met a 21-year-old friend of Sean Lennon who said \"It's a terrible time to be 21!\" Joel replied to him, \"Yeah, I remember when I was 21 \u2013 I thought it was an awful time and we had Vietnam, and y'know, drug problems, and civil rights problems and everything seemed to be awful.\" The friend replied, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, but it's different for you. You were a kid in the fifties and everybody knows that nothing happened in the fifties\". Joel retorted, \"Wait a minute, didn't you hear of the Korean War or the Suez Canal Crisis?\" Joel later said those headlines formed the basic framework for the song. Cited by . Joel has also criticized the song on strictly musical grounds. In 1993, when discussing it with documentary filmmaker David Horn, Joel compared its melodic content unfavorably to his song \"The Longest Time\": \"Take a song like 'We Didn't Start the Fire.' It's really not much of a song ... If you take the melody by itself, terrible. Like a dentist drill.\" When asked if he deliberately intended to chronicle the Cold War with his songThe song describes events between 1949 (when the Soviet Union detonated their first atomic bomb and 1989 (when the Berlin Wall fell). he responded, \"It was just my luck that the Soviet Union decided to close down shop [soon after putting out the song]\", and that this span \"had a symmetry to it, it was 40 years\" that he had lived through. He was asked if he could do a follow-up about the next couple of years after the events that transpired in the original song, he commented \"No, I wrote one song already and I don't think it was really that good to begin with, melodically.\"Billy Joel Q&A;: Tell Us About 'We Didn't Start The Fire?' University of Oxford, May 5, 1994 \u2013 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx3T8pbDcms == Music video == A music video for the single was directed by Chris Bloum.Garcia, Alex S. Billy Joel \u2013 We didn't start the fire. MVDBase \u2013 Music Video Database. The video begins with a newly married couple entering their 1940s-style kitchen, and shows events in their domestic life over the next four decades, including the addition of children, their growth, and later, grandchildren, and the eventual passing of the family's father. The passage of time is also depicted by periodic redecoration and upgrades of the kitchen, while an unchanging Billy Joel looks on in the background. ==Historical events referenced== Though the lyrics are rapid-fire with several people and events mentioned in a single word each, there is widespread agreement on the meaning of the lyrics.

The lyric for each individual event is brief and the events are punctuated by the chorus and other lyrical elements. The following list includes longer, more descriptive names for clarity.

The band Guns 'n' Moses made a parody of the song called \"We Love Barney Fife\" that was played frequently on the Doctor Demento radio show, which not only paid tribute to The Andy Griffith Show, it also took advantage of the melody of the refrain being a suitable counterpoint for the Andy Griffith Show theme (\"The Fishin' Hole\"). The song was also parodied on the episode of the U.S. version of The Office where Ryan Howard starts a fire in the office building, and Dwight and Michael change the lyrics of the song to \"Ryan Started The Fire\". On a 2017 episode of The Goldbergs, Barry rehearses the song for his talent show, but manages to mess up the lyrics; eventually, when he performs it at the talent show, he adapts new lyrics to the song by referencing his high school experiences, which is very well received. In 1993, Paramount Pictures used a derivative of the song, called \"We Didn't Start the Series\" to advertise Star Trek: The Next Generation. The performers of the song are unknown.

He proceeds to sing the song but has forgotten almost all of the words and mumbles through it. Pop band Milo Greene performed a version of the song in June 2013 for The A.V. Club A.V. Undercover series. In 2015, Sky Sports released their own version of the song to advertise the upcoming 2015 Ashes series, with backing vocals and percussion provided by Elio Pace and his band. Pace has toured and recorded with Joel's original touring band. In the 2012 comedy film The Five-Year Engagement, during Tom and Violet's engagement party, Alex (played by Chris Pratt) sings a version of the song, including all of Tom's previous girlfriends and one-night stands. In 2014, Neil Cicierega released a mashup album, Mouth Silence. The 17th song, \"Space Monkey Mafia\", plays lyrics from \"We Didn't Start The Fire\" and R.E.M.'s \"It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\" on top of each other, modifying the lyrics of both songs so they sync up, and putting them over an original polka melody. Since the 2015\u201316 season, YouTuber Jim Daly created a song of each season's 92 clubs in the Premier League and English Football League to the tune of We Didn't Start The Fire, with the chorus 'Lots of teams in English football, from the Premier League down to those teams in League Two, lots of teams in English football, I'm gonna try to make it through the whole 92'.

Cultaholic later went on to release a full parody video. In 2020, various parodies of the song were released in response to the advent of the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, a version called Fortnite's Kinda Dying was created about the popular game Fortnite.
