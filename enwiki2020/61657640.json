The temple stands under the cavern of Takamiya where the old tombs existed. ==History== According to tradition, Kuroda Nagamasa tried to use the carve stone to build the Fukuoka Castle, but Kannon appeared in his dream and told him to stop construction. He later found out that a Kannon image was carved in the stone. He decided to stop working and built the hall of worship on the temple grounds. Once the temple was destroyed, however in 1693 the main hall was rebuilt by Tand\u014d Ch\u014dzen, the priest of Ch\u014den-ji in Ch\u016b\u014d-ku, Fukuoka. It was originally located in Kumade Village, Onga District what is now called Yahatanishi-ku, Kitaky\u016bsh\u016b. It belonged to Ry\u016bsh\u014d-ji in the same district, but was abandoned. Afterwards Tand\u014d took over the temple and relocated the chapel to a new site in the Terazuka district to the south of the castle. ==Anakannon== Anakannon (\u7a74\u89b3\u97f3) is an ancient circular tomb located southward on the right side of the hill on the K\u014dsh\u016b-ji temple grounds. The estimated diameter of the hill is approximately 20 metres. The main part is a double-chambered site stone chamber that opens southward, and is from the late Kofun period in the 6th century. The stone chamber is a made of huge rocks that are one of the largest megalithic walls in Fukuoka. Amit\u0101bha is carved in front of the back of stone chamber, and Kannon and Mahasthamaprapta are both on the left and right. The author and the production date are unknown, but it is commonly called Anakannon because of its form. There were many old burial mounds in the Terazuka area, but it was told that some of the stones were removed from the stone walls when Fukuoka Castle was built. ==The graves of forty-seven R\u014dnin== In 1935, Zenjir\u014d Kihara, a private investor, invested his private property and established the graves of forty-seven R\u014dnin on the temple grounds. It is a sense of purpose for health development of youth and promotion of national consciousness. It is the same style as at Sengaku-ji in Tokyo, of topographic arrangement, of grave markers etc. Each year on December 14, the temple holds a festival commemorating the 47 R\u014dnin. ==Gallery== File:Koshu-ji Sanmon 01.jpg|Sanmon File:Bell_tower_and_Main_Hall_of_Koshu-ji.jpg|Bell tower and Main Hall File:47_ronin_graves_at_Koshu-ji.jpg|47 R\u014dnin graves File:Anakannon 02.jpg|Anakannon File:Anakannon 03.jpg|Relief images of Kannon carved into one of the Hyakuzuka (\u767e\u585a) rocks ==Notes== ==External links== *HoteGuru Sightseeing Guide in Japanese (some English) Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1693 Category:Soto temples Category:Buddhist temples in Fukuoka Prefecture Category:Buildings and structures in Fukuoka Category:Tourist attractions in Fukuoka Category:1690s establishments in Japan Category:1693 establishments in Asia ",
