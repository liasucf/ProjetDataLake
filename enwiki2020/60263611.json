    "text": "K-117 is a state highway in the U.S. state of Kansas. K-117's southern terminus is at U.S. Route 36 (US-36) in Midway south of Herndon, and the northern terminus is a continuation as Nebraska Highway 17 (N-17) at the Nebraska border north of Herndon. K-117 was first designated as a state highway on May 26, 1937, to connect to the new highway that was constructed by the Nebraska Department of Transportation (NDOT). K-117's alignment has not changed since it was designated. ==Route description== K-117 begins at an intersection with US-36 in Midway and begins traveling north and after roughly crosses and unnamed creek. Approximately past the creek, the road crosses a BNSF Railway just east of Herndon. The highway continues north and after about intersects County Route 314 (CR-314) also known as Rural Secondary (RS-675). It continues northward for roughly another and reaches the Nebraska border where it continues as N-17. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2017, they determined that on average the traffic varied from 215 vehicles slightly north of Herndon to 265 vehicles south of Herndon. K-117 is not included in the National Highway System. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-117 doesn't connect to the National Highway System either. ==History== In 1936, the Nebraska Department of Transportation (NDOT) built a new state highway from US-6 in Culbertson, Nebraska southward to the Kansas border. In a January meeting of that same year, the KDOT approved that when NDOT completes the highway, a new highway would be built from US-36 northward to connect to the new highway. Then K-117 was assigned by the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) in a May 26, 1937 resolution, and its alignment has not changed since. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== *Kansas Department of Transportation State Map *KDOT: Historic State Maps 117 Category:Transportation in Rawlins County, Kansas ",
