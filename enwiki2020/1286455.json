The school is a part of the School District of Palm Beach County. == History == Original building The school opened as Forest Hill High School in 1959; it is situated next to the West Palm Beach Country Club and I-95 in the southwestern corner of the City of West Palm Beach on a compact tract. A larger building replaced the original structure on the same site in 2004. The school was first accredited in 1961. In the 1980s, the Palm Beach County School Board added the word Community to the names of all public high schools. Forest Hill is a public school for students in the local community, and for those coming from afar to the magnet programs held at the school. == Academics == The school's attendance boundaries encompass a culturally diverse area with a high percentage of non-native speakers of English. In order to expand the opportunities available to its student body, the school initiated many magnet programs: Information Technology, International Baccalaureate, Environmental Science, Engineering, Tourism and Hospitality and Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps. In 2008, the Tourism and Hospitality magnet program introduced a marketing club, DECA, into its program; and in 2009, the club opened up the school's first alternative breakfast cafe called Falcon Cafe, run by its members and officers. The school also offers English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) and Exceptional Student Education (ESE). The basic classes are: English, Math, Social Studies, Science, Foreign Language, Art, Culinary, Physical Education, Culinary, and Woodwork. == Athletics == * Football: Varsity & Junior Varsity Runner up 1986 & 1987 * Football Cheerleading: Varsity & Junior Varsity * Basketball Cheerleading: Varsity & Junior Varsity * Golf: Boys & Girls * Swimming: Boys & Girls * Boys Volleyball: Varsity & Junior Varsity * Girls Volleyball: Varsity & Junior Varsity * Bowling: Boys & Girls * Tennis: Boys & Girls * Baseball: Varsity & Junior Varsity * Cross Country: Boys & Girls * Track: Boys & Girls * Softball * Flag football * Boys Soccer: Varsity & Junior Varsity * Girls Soccer: Varsity & Junior Varsity * Boys Basketball: Varsity & Junior Varsity * Girls Basketball: Varsity & Junior Varsity * Boys Wrestling: Varsity & Junior Varsity * Girls Wrestling: Varsity & Junior Varsity The school ended their 37-game football losing streak on October 23, 2009.
