The team is a member of the Mid-American Conference East Division competing in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Bobcats have played their home games in the Convocation Center since 1973. ==History== Ohio University\u2019s women\u2019s basketball program began its unofficial debut in 1965. It was created by the Women\u2019s Sports and Recreation Department (WRA) chapter of Ohio University. The team, led by Bev Smith, competed for 8 years before they became a part of the Women\u2019s Intercollegiate Athletics (WICA) organization. This marked the beginning of funding from athletics as opposed to education. Upon its official debut, the women\u2019s basketball team played their first game in the 1973\u201374 season. The Bobcats have won three Mid-American Conference tournament titles in 1986, 1995, and 2015. They have been MAC regular season champions four times, most recently in the 2015\u201316 season. They have clinched a spot in the NCAA Women's Tournament three times, in which they have gone 0\u20133, most recently appearing in the 2014\u201315 season. The Bobcats most notable season came in 1985\u201386. The team went 24\u20132 in the regular season, with a 16\u20132 record in the MAC. They won their first MAC season and tournament titles, as well as setting eight school records that are still held as of 2016. Their coach, 23-year-old Amy Prichard, became the first Ohio head coach to be awarded the honor of the MAC Coach of the Year. The Bobcats\u2019 current head coach is Bob Boldon. Boldon played college basketball at Walsh University from 1993\u201397. After debuting during the 2013\u201314 season, Boldon\u2019s team posted a record of 9\u201320. During his second season at Ohio University, he led the Bobcats to their first winning season since the 2007\u201308 season. Boldon led the team to the MAC championship, clinching a spot in the 2015 NCAA tournament. The team lost in the first round to Arizona State, by a score of 74\u201355. In the 2018-19 season the Bobcat's won 30 games being the first team in Ohio history between both men and women's programs. ==Seasonal Results== as of 3/11/2020 {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%; text-align:center\" ! colspan=\"3\" | Mid-American Conference |- !
