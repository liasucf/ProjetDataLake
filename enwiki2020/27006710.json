    "text": "When the Daltons Rode is a 1940 American Western film directed by George Marshall and starring Randolph Scott, Kay Francis and Brian Donlevy. Based on the 1931 book of the same name by the late Emmett Dalton, the sole surviving gang member, and Jack Jungmeyer, Sr., the film also features a fictional family friend trying to dissuade the Dalton brothers from becoming outlaws. ==Plot== Law-abiding farmers, the Dalton brothers move to Kansas from Missouri to begin a new life. Bob Dalton meets lawyer Tod Jackson and persuades him to defend his kin Ben Dalton in a court case against a corrupt land development company. A melee erupts during the trial, and the Daltons have to shoot their way out of the courtroom. Cronies of the land developers and the press portray the brothers negatively. Ben is shot in the back. Unable to get by lawfully, the Daltons rob a stage coach and their reputation as dangerous outlaws spreads. Tod, meantime, has fallen in love with Bob Dalton's fiancee, Julie. He strongly urges the Daltons to change their ways, but they defy Bob and decide to pull one more bank job in Kansas. There Bob and Grat are killed, as are two other members of the gang. Emmett survives. ==Cast== * Randolph Scott as Tod Jackson * Kay Francis as Julie King * Brian Donlevy as Grat Dalton * George Bancroft as Caleb Winters * Broderick Crawford as Bob Dalton * Stuart Erwin as Ben Dalton * Andy Devine as Ozark Jones * Frank Albertson as Emmett Dalton * Mary Gordon as Ma Dalton * Harvey Stephens as Rigby * Edgar Dearing as Sheriff * Quen Ramsey as Clem Wilson * Dorothy Granger as Nancy * Robert McKenzie as Photographer * Fay McKenzie as Hannah * Walter Soderling as Judge Lucius Thorndown (Judge Swain in the credits) * Mary Ainslee as Minnie * Erville Alderson as Dist.
