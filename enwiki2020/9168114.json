    "text": "Ale\u0161 \u0160teger (born 31 May 1973) is a Slovene poet, writer, editor and literary critic. Ale\u0161 belongs to a generation of writers that started to publish right after the fall of Yugoslavia. His first poetry collection \u0160ahovnice ur (1995) was sold out in three weeks after publication and indicated a new generation of Slovenian artists and writers. \u0160tegers books have been translated into 16 languages and his poems appeared in internationally renowned magazines and newspapers as The New Yorker, Die Zeit, Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung, TLS and many others. Among other prizes and honours his English translation of Knjiga re\u010di (The Book of Things, BOA Editions, 2010) won two mayor U.S. translation awards (BTBA award and AATSEL). Ale\u0161 received the title Chevalier dans le ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the French State. He is a member of the Akademie der K\u00fcnste in Berlin. Besides writing and translating from German and Spanish Ale\u0161 is also the programme director of Beletrina academic Press that he co-funded (www.studentskazalozba.org). From 1995 to 2004 and from 2008 to present, he was the initiator and programme director of the international poetry festival Days of Poetry and Wine (www.stihoteka.si). He worked also as programme director of the Terminal 12 - programme strand at the Maribor 2012 European Capital of Culture. Since 2012 he is working on a performative writing project Written on Site, making one public writing performance each year. Among his editorial work, the most noticeable is a new revisited collection of poems by Edvard Kocbek published in 2004, which includes a number of Kocbek's unpublished poems as well as an insightful essay on Kocbek's poetic language written by \u0160teger. His editorial work also includes other major Slovenian poets, Gregor Strni\u0161a, Dane Zajc, Toma\u017e \u0160alamun and Niko Grafenauer. In 1998 \u0160teger won the Veronika Award for his poetry collection Ka\u0161mir and in 2008 he won the Ro\u017eanc Award, the highest prize for essays written in Slovene language, for Berlin. \u0160teger is a judge for the 2021 Griffin Poetry Prize. == Quotes == \u201cSimply one of the most enjoyable poets to read in Europe right now, Ale\u0161 \u0160teger is cultivated and often brilliant poet. He maintains an air of philosophical sophistication while imbuing his work with a laconic nature and aberrant minimalism that makes it distinct and vivid in the memory. A leading light in the rich Slovenian poetry community.\u201d 3:AM Magazine, Maintenant #45 \u201c\u0160teger focuses on things, a central concern of European philosophy ever since Husserl, and of European poetry since Rilke. \u0160teger takes an original approach to this question by not systematically pursuing the \u201cthing-in-itself\u201d and attempting to bring words as close as possible to it, as Francis Ponge did.\u201d Poetry Today, The Antioch Review, Volume 70, Number 1, 2012 about \u201cThe Book of Things\u201d \"Steger has a tremendous capacity for juxtaposition, and the poems offer a great many startlingly moments\u2026[His] flair is in not pausing at the virtuoso moment but brushing past as it drops.\" Rain Taxi \"\u2026the things described in this book are defamiliarized and here, often, Steger is at his best. The way he personifies an object, or the metaphor he uses, is never obvious, but it always makes complete sense.\" Three Percent Review, \"The Book of Things\" \"...a smart, startling, and wildly pleasurable book.\u201d Kenyon Review (online), \"The Book of Things\" Steger\u2019s efforts sometimes bring to mind such Western European figures as Francis Ponge and Craig Raine, who also sought to make household things look new and strange. Yet Steger brings a melancholy Central European sense of history- his objects tend to remember, or cause, great pain: \u201cIt pours, this poisonous, sweet force,\u201d Steger writes of \u201cSaliva,\u201d \u201cBetween teeth, when you spit your own little genocide.\u201d Publisher\u2019s Weekly, \u201cThe Book of Things\u201d It is a rare treat to have an English translation before the ink has dried on the original. By which I mean, a mere five years after the book\u2019s Slovenian publication, Brian Henry has brought these poems to life for those of us not lucky enough to read Slovenian. Henry\u2019s translations are impressive for sheer acrobatics.
