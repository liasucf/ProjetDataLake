    "text": "Emilio Taruffi (1633\u20131696) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period. He was a fellow-pupil with Carlo Cignani in the studio of Francesco Albani, then a pupil of the former. Active first at Bologna, in decorating the public hall, and next at Rome, where he resided three years, sometimes employed at Sant' Andrea della Valle and in private houses. He also conducted some altar-pieces, and that of San Pier Celestino, at the church of that name, yields to few of the same period. Maria Elena Panzacchi was one of his pupils. He was apparently assassinated. ==References== * Category:1633 births Category:1696 deaths Category:17th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:Bolognese painters Category:Italian Baroque painters ",
