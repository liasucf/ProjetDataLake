    "text": "The Owl House is an American animated fantasy television series created by Dana Terrace and produced by Disney Television Animation. It premiered on Disney Channel on January 10, 2020. In November 2019, the series was renewed for a second season prior to the series premiere. ==Plot== Luz Noceda is a teenage human girl who accidentally stumbles upon a portal to another world instead of going to Reality Check Camp, a juvenile detention summer camp located in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota. When on the Boiling Isles, which is made from the remains of a dead Titan, she befriends the rebellious witch Eda the Owl Lady and her adorable demon roommate named King. Despite not having magical abilities, Luz pursues her dream of becoming a witch by serving as Eda's apprentice at the Owl House and ultimately finds a new family in an unlikely setting. ==Characters== ===Main=== * Luz Noceda (voiced by Sarah- Nicole Robles) \u2013 A 14-year-old Dominican-American girl who ends up on the Boiling Isles and becomes both Eda's apprentice and a new exchange student at Hexside Academy. She often feels as though she doesn\u2019t fit in. Luz loves all things fantasy and magical, wanting to become a witch. She finds out that she can use magic by drawing glyphs that she sees within her environment and spell circles witches cast to do magic. She finally became an official student of Hexside, though she was saddened at first as she was only allowed to learn one type of magic at a time, and not combine different magic types. Later however, Luz, with the help of the detention track students, saves the school from a magic eating Greater Basilisk who had disguised herself as the Emperor's Coven inspector. Principal Bump was convinced that mixing magics isn't a bad thing, and therefore let the other trouble making students take more than one class, with Luz becoming the first student who is officially allowed to learn magic from all the tracks. According to Terrace, Luz is named after her Dominican- American roommate, Luz Batista, a story artist and consultant for the show. * Edalyn \"Eda\" Clawthorne (voiced by Wendie Malick) \u2013 The 40-somethingDana Terrace AMA on Reddit, self-proclaimed most powerful witch on the Boiling Isles, who is Luz's teacher. She is a wanted criminal for selling human items, not joining a coven, and stealing, among other things. Her nickname \"the Owl Lady\" comes from the fact that she was cursed to become an owl-like monster when she was younger by an unknown figure (later revealed to be her older sister Lilith). The curse can only be countered by a daily elixir, which is gradually losing its effect. In mid-season finale, the elixir has lost its effect altogether. It can no longer cure her, much to her shock and fear. Unlike most witches who join covens (other than the witches in the Emperor's Coven), she can use all types of magic. Just like Luz, she wanted to learn all the types of magic possible but wasn't able to due to Hexside's rules forbidding her to do so. To subvert this, she used her magic to create a secret hideout which is equipped with magical doors which act as shortcuts to help her navigate around the school and learn all magic types from all the other tracks undetected. * King (voiced by Alex Hirsch) \u2013 A small wolf-like demon with a skull-like head and Eda's roommate who is the self-proclaimed King of Demons. He spends much of the series being a feisty troublemaker. He is well aware of his shortcomings, but that does not stop him from trying to exert dominance. Upon meeting Luz, he starts off speaking to her like a servant, but slowly begins to treat her like a close friend and even begins to take on aspects of acting like a pet around her. He later admits that he begins to miss her whenever she is gone for long periods of time. Since then, he has become openly affectionate to her while also keeping his rambunctious attitude. ===Recurring=== * Camila Noceda (voiced by Elizabeth Grullon) \u2013 Luz's mother who sends her to summer camp to curb her overactive imagination. Unaware Luz is on the Boiling Isles, she continues to stay in contact with her via text messages. In \"Enchanting Grom Fright,\" it is revealed that she is getting letters about the summer camp from someone who is pretending to be Luz. She is Dominican-American, with the voice actor for Luz, Sarah-Nicole Robles, saying that she and Luz are a \"refreshing representation of a real Hispanic family.\" * Hooty (voiced by Alex Hirsch) \u2013 The witty house demon (as he is classified as in \"Hooty's Moving Hassle\" by the leader of the Demon Hunters and in \"Agony of a Witch\" by Lilith) of the titular house. Themed after a barn owl (with giant legs that he can walk around with when given the power to), he uses the owl-headed doorknocker to interact with the world around him by stretching his neck to allegedly infinite lengths; he tends to act surreal, awkward, and/or annoying, though this often results in comedic moments for the audience to view. * Willow Park (voiced by Tati Gabrielle) \u2013 A student at Hexside and Luz and Gus\u2019s friend who is skilled with plant magic. Originally, Willow was placed in the abomination track, due to her parents' wishes, until her use of plant magic caused her to be transferred to the plant track. She and Amity used to be close friends since childhood but due to Amity's parents not wanting to associate with her due to her lack of magic, Amity cut ties with her, causing great misery to both her and Amity. In \"Understanding Willow\", it is revealed that Willow lives with her two fathers. * Augustus \"Gus\" Porter (voiced by Issac Ryan Brown) \u2013 A student at Hexside and Luz and Willow\u2019s friend who is skilled in illusion magic and is part of the illusion track. He once was the president of a club called the Human Appreciation Society (H.A.S.), but he was removed from that position by Principal Bump after the detention room incident. His father Perry Porter works as a news reporter. * Amity Blight (voiced by Mae Whitman) \u2013 A top student at Hexside who is an abomination expert. She starts as Luz's main rival making fun of Willow for her apparent lack of magical talent. She eventually befriends Luz and develops feelings for her. Like Luz, she is a big fan of the novel series The Good Witch Azura. She and Willow used to be the closest of friends since childhood. However, her uptight and condescending parents told her to cut ties with Willow as she is far too weak to be a witch, and if she would not, they would, and they would ensure Willow would never attend school again. Amity was cowed to do so and extremely saddened that she had to hurt her only true friend in her life. She doesn't like Skara and Boscha as she finds them mean and cruel to people. She never considered those two her friends as she was told by her parents to befriend them, as they were very powerful witches. As of \"Wing It Like Witches\", she ended her \"friendship\" with Boscha because of her treatment of Willow and others. * Hieronymus Bump (voiced by Bumper Robinson) \u2013 The principal of Hexside School of Magic and Demonics who wears a demon-shaped hat over half his face. In the episode \"Adventures in the Elements,\" it was revealed that he was the young student responsible in defeating the opposing school, and helped build Hexside, as shown in its information pamphlet. After the events of \"The First Day\", he became more accepting of the other students' desire to learn more than one magic type after Luz and her new friends, the detention track students, saved the school from a deadly Greater Basilisk who tried to consume all the magic from the staff and students thanks to their mixed magic skills. Since that day, he made it official that students now have the choice to learn more than one magic type. * Lilith Clawthorne (voiced by Cissy Jones) \u2013 Eda's estranged older sister and, until the events of the episode \"Young Blood, Old Souls\", leader of the Emperor's Coven. She still cares for her sister, as she told Eda that the Emperor can cure her owl monster-type curse, and she therefore wants her to join the Emperor's Coven. In \"Agony of a Witch\", it is revealed that she is the one who cursed Eda to turn into the owl monster when they were young, as she was envious of her magical talent and immeasurable power. This led to Lilith's deal with Emperor Belos after she felt guilty for what she did to her sister. Following Luz's duel with Emperor Belos, Lilith betrays the Emperor to help Luz and uses her magic to split the curse with Eda. * Emperor Belos (voiced by Matthew Rhys) \u2013 A mysterious and sinister masked man who is the ruler of the Boiling Isles and the most powerful witch alive, to whom the Emperor's Coven serve personally. According to history, Emperor Belos got rid of the troublesome demons and witches that were affecting the Titan and arranged for the rest of the magic users to use their magic the right way. This led to him establishing different covens where those who don't join are sentenced to an irreversable petrification. Lilith joined the Emperor's Coven in order for Emperor Belos to honor her deal to cure Eda of her owl monster curse. When she finally caught Eda, Belos went back on his word with Lilith to cure Eda's curse. Belos plots to access the human world on the Day of Unity. ** Kikimora (voiced by Mela Lee) \u2013 The boss of Lilith and Emperor Belos' personal assistant. * Boscha (voiced by Eden Riegel) \u2013 A three- eyed witch and one of Amity's \"friends\" who is obsessed with Penstagram. She is part of the potions track. She is very condescending and bullies others based on their magical prowess. As of \"Wing It Like Witches\", which reveals that Boscha has a competitive nature during Grudgby season, she and Amity are no longer friends as Amity decided to stand up for her true friends. * Emira and Edric Blight (voiced by Erica Lindbeck and Ryan O'Flanagan) \u2013 Amity's older twin siblings and members of the illusion track. They are troublemakers who are always making fun of her. * Skara (voiced by Kimberly Brooks) \u2013 A witch and one of Amity's friends. She is part of the bard track. * Warden Wrath (voiced by Roger Craig Smith) \u2013 The monstrous and brutal prison warden running the Conformatorium where those who are different are imprisoned. He has a crush on Eda, who has always managed to evade his capture. * Abomination Professor (voiced by JB Blanc) \u2013 The teacher of the abomination track. He is carried around Hexside by his own abomination. * Tiny Nose (voiced by Dana Terrace) \u2013 A small round demon with a prominent nose, and a conspiracy theorist who has a thirst for destruction. At the end of \"Sense and Insensitivity\", she gets a book published. * Bat Queen (voiced by Isabella Rossellini) \u2013 A large bat-like palisman formerly owned by a giant, who takes care of her children and other forgotten and broken palismans. * Tibblet- Tibblie \"Tibbles\" Grimmhammer III (voiced by Parvesh Cheena) \u2013 A pig-like creature who is a night market stand owner and con artist. * The Demon Hunters \u2013 A group of humanoids who hunt wild demons. They were first seen trying to catch a transformed Hooty. In \"Escape of the Palisman\", the Demon Hunters are now working as animal control officers where they try to catch Eda's owl monster form. ** Patch (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson) \u2013 The leader of the Demon Hunters who wears an eyepatch. His name was revealed through the closed captioning. ** Tom (voiced by Fred Tatasciore) \u2013 Another member of the Demon Hunters. * Mattholomule (voiced by Jorge Diaz) \u2013 Luz and Gus's new rival and part of the Construction class. He's always in trouble at Hexside by getting detention. He became the new president of H.A.S. after Luz destroyed the detention room, which Gus took the blame for. * Perry Porter (voiced by Gary Anthony Williams) \u2013 A witch and the father of Gus. He is a reporter for BBN-HXN. ==Episodes== ===Season 1 (2020)=== The first letters of the episode titles for the first season spell out, \"A WITCH LOSES A TRUE WAY\". ===Shorts=== ====Look Hooo's Talking==== A series of shorts, modeled after the aftershow format, titled Look Hooo's Talking premiered on the official Disney Channel YouTube channel. The shorts, which are usually posted a day after an episode's airing but air right after its TV premiere, depict two live action owls named Horus Herashoo and Owlyvia Kim talking about the events of the most recent episode and pick apart some of the details that potentially will make an impact later in the show. At the end of each episode, the credits quickly scroll by, but when paused reveal the name of the \"crew\" which consists of names of the actual crew of the show, but with re-imagined bird name puns such as the creator, Dana Terrace, being renamed Danightingale Terrace. Starting with the episode \"Sense and Insensitivity\", the format retired. ====Owl Pellets==== Disney Channel began releasing a series of comedic shorts called Owl Pellets involving Luz, Eda, and King's antics with magic and the exploration of the Boiling Isles. ==Production== The Owl House was created by Dana Terrace, previously a storyboard artist for Gravity Falls and later a director on the 2017 DuckTales reboot. The series was set originally for a 2019 release, but it was delayed for a 2020 release. Terrace is the fourth woman to create a series for Disney Television Animation, after Pepper Ann with Sue Rose, Doc McStuffins with Chris Nee, and Star vs. the Forces of Evil with Daron Nefcy. The show is animated by Rough Draft Korea, Sunmin Image Pictures, and Sugarcube Animation. Terrace said that the visual style was inspired by paintings by Remedios Varo, John Bauer and Hieronymus Bosch, as well as Russian architecture. By December 2019, the show had 120 people working on the show, including those in the animation studios, and 50 staffers on the pre-production crew. Season 1 aired its 19th and final episode on August 29, 2020. On November 21, 2019, the show was renewed for a second season prior to the first season's debut. ===Music=== On July 19, 2019, Terrace announced that T. J. Hill composed the series' score. In January 10, 2020, Hill said that the score features \"interesting and experimental sounds that [he] had a ton of fun cooking up\". ===Marketing=== On June 10, 2019, the trailer premiered during the show's Annecy 2019 panel. It was later uploaded to Disney Channel's YouTube channel a day later. The show's main title sequence was released on July 19, 2019, during San Diego Comic-Con 2019. The show released a sneak peek and an official end credit sequence on October 4, 2019, during a panel at New York Comic Con 2019. ==Broadcast== The Owl House had its first international debut in Canada on January 12, 2020,, South Korea on May 23, 2020, Japan on July 23, 2020 and on April 13, 2020 in Latin America. It premiered in Southeast Asia in March 2020, and Disney Channel UK & Ireland on August 10, 2020 and will premiere on CITV in 2021. It premiered in Spain on October 4, 2020 with its second episode. It will also premiere in France, Rai Gulp Italy and in Netherlands in 2020. The entire first season will be added to Disney+ on October 30, 2020. ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== The Owl House has received a positive reception from critics. Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media said putting different elements together made the series quirky and likable. It was also described as well written and animated, and speculated that \"[the show] likely will be one you will want to watch alongside your older kids and tweens, giving you the opportunity to discuss these kinds of themes as they come up.\" LaughingPlace.coms critic praised the series for its unique visuals and voice acting, stating \"The performances fit together beautifully as the diversity in their delivery showcases the characters\u2019 unique roles in the Demon Realm.\" Colliders Dave Trumbore gave the series' first episode a 4-star rating, feeling that the episode \"[has] got a dark, yet darkly comic edge to the whole thing.\" The conservative evangelical Christian religious television network, called the Christian Broadcasting Network attacked the show, declaring it was part of a \"witch agenda to make witchcraft look positive,\" an assessment that a writer for The Mary Sue called \"hyperbolic,\" and stated that a \"rebellious Latina witch\" is, to those like CBN, \"probably the scariest thing,\" while stating that the show sounds like \"a ton of fun.\" While Kevin Johnson of The A.V. Club was critical of the series, stating that they were not \"buying the developments between Amity and Luz,\" and praised Eda's character, Ben Bertoli was more positive. He wrote that Terrace and those working on the job had done a great job creating a fantasy world, relatable characters, and predicted a \"big animation fandom.\" Additionally, Nick Venable wrote that fans of Gravity Falls and Steven Universe would love the series because the \"otherworld-ness of the Boiling Isle[s] immediately asserts itself\" while the show makes \"relationships feel genuine and tactile,\" following in the footsteps of those shows. At the same time, Colin Hickson of Comic Book Resources praised the series, while noting that the opening of the series would give \"any Gravity Falls fans a major sense of deja vu.\" ===LGBTQ+ representation=== During its series run, The Owl House dropped hints and subtext that several characters within the show are LGBTQ+. In the episode \"Understanding Willow\", Willow is shown to have two dads. Mitchell is a story artist for the show. Series creator Dana Terrace first hinted at an upcoming reveal on July 7, 2020, when responding to a fan who posted a still from a promotion for the upcoming episode \"Enchanting Grom Fright\" on Twitter. The image showed one of the characters in the show, Amity, putting her hands on the shoulders of Luz, the show's main protagonist, and looking into her eyes. Claiming \"there is no heterosexual explanation for this\", Terrace responded, \"there really isn't\". The episode, written by Molly Ostertag, aired on August 8, 2020, and revealed that Amity wanted to ask Luz to go with her to \"Grom,\" a version of prom. In previous episodes, Luz had shown interest in male characters but had begun to grow closer to Amity. Terrace confirmed on Twitter that the episode features a bisexual character, but didn't confirm whether this was Amity, Luz, or both, however as noted by Reiss Smith of PinkNews, many fans assumed this referred to Luz. The two girls represent Disney's first animated LGBT+ female regular characters. At the culmination of the episode, Luz and Amity dance together while casting spells to defeat a demon. The animation supervisor for the show, Spencer Wan, referred to their intimate dance, which he storyboarded with Hayley Foster, as \"the gay thing,\" saying it was his first opportunity to storyboard \"anything even remotely queer.\" The following day, he posted an animatic of the dance scene. In a tweet, Terrace described the challenges of putting LGBTQ+ characters in the show on Disney Channel due to restrictions, saying: \"In [development] I was very open about my intention to put queer kids in the main cast. [...] When we were greenlit I was told by certain Disney leadership that I could NOT represent any form of bi or gay relationship on the Channel.\" Disney later approved the inclusion of LGBTQ+ characters in the show. Additionally, Terrace stated that creating characters for the show helped her come out as bisexual in 2017, and hoped the characters would create \"positive vibes\" for people in the future and called the following episode \"Wing It Like Witches\" the \"next chapter.\" Later that night, Alex Hirsch, one of the voice actors, Terrace's partner, and the creator of another Disney Channel production, Gravity Falls, chimed in, stating that the show has \"explicitly queer\" animated characters and lamented the challenges of getting LGBTQ representation in his own show. Afterward, Hirsch referred to a still from the episode of Luz and Amity dancing, noting that if it had been attempted in 2012 it would have received an \"inappropriate for channel\" censor note from Disney calling to revise it. He concluded \"this time, Disney \u2013 you did good.\" The same day, PFLAG praised the LGBTQ visibility in the series, while GLAAD was excited by the \"LGBTQ-inclusive storytelling\" in the series. Apart from this, Eden Riegel, the voice actor for Boscha in the show, described Luz and Amity as \"explicitly queer leads in glorious love doing actual magic in a demon world.\" Also that day, Chris Nee, creator of Doc McStuffins, made some remarks about the show, loving the show's queer representation, and noting that she \"had to go to the mat to get my two mom episode of Doc,\" referring to the 2017 episode, \"The Emergency Plan,\" which featured a \"multiracial two-mom family, voiced by lesbian actors.\" On August 14, Terrace responded on Twitter to a Cartoon Brew story, by the site's associate editor, which emphasised within the headline that Disney executives had been opposed to the inclusion of queer characters on the show. She clarified that her push for queer characters like Luz and Amity in The Owl House had \"since been extremely supported\" by executives, and that she was \"excited for future shows.\" She added that while she would never be \"fully aligned with Disney as a company,\" she would not \"fully blast\" the executives who had fought for her. She agreed with an assessment that the article was clickbait. Owen Dennis of Infinity Train weighed in, calling the Cartoon Brew story an \"unnecessary hit piece\" which didn't recognize the progress the show had made. Alex Hirsch criticized the headline, stating it should have been titled \"first animated LGBTQ+ main characters break boundary for Disney,\" and argued that Cartoon Brew was \"skipping over the good news in the present to hunt for bad news in the past.\" He further stated that Disney TVA \"deserves props for its recent changes towards inclusion,\" noting that Disney previously had only a few scattered side characters who were gay. Cartoon Brew ultimately responded to Terrace's tweet, defending their piece, claiming that it \"clearly tells the entire story.\" The following day, the episode \"Wing It Like Witches\" aired on the Disney Channel. The following day, Deadline and CNN seemed to hint toward the conclusion that Luz is bisexual, with CNN calling her the \"first bisexual character to make a Disney debut on a television series.\" ET Canada and NBC News came to similar conclusions in their articles. Apart from these news outlets, an official Spanish-language Disney twitter account stated that Luz was bisexual. On August 19 2020, star Wendie Malick revealed that she was unaware that the series would feature LGBTQ+ characters until she was sent a script for an unknown episode, and said that it is \"a big move for Disney\". On August 29, the season one finale, \"Young Blood, Old Souls\" aired on the Disney Channel. In his review of the episode, Kevin Johnson of The A.V. Club said that the Luz/Amity relationship is \"deeply important and meaningful to the progress of LGTBQ+ portrayals on television,\" especially for those who are young, even as he stated that he found the \"narrative development\" of this development to be \"a bit hollow.\" Petrana Radulovic of Polygon contrasted Johnson's review with one that was more positive. She said that those who enjoy The Dragon Prince and She-Ra and the Princesses of Power would like The Owl House, saying it is a fun show that is more episodic, similar to Steven Universe and Gravity Falls. She also praised the dance sequence between Luz and Amity in Enchanting Grom Fright as \"ADORABLE and beautifully animated.\" On September 2, during a Reddit AMA, Dana Terrace confirmed that Amity is intended to be a lesbian and that Luz is bisexual. She also stated that the relationship between Amity and Luz will be explored in Season 2 and that Luz is \"oblivious to some things in front of her,\" including Amity's crush on her. In the same AMA, Terrace stated that Luz was Amity's first crush and that she was thrilled to see people connect to the show's characters, like Luz and Amity. == Notes == ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2020s American animated television series Category:2020 American television series debuts Category:2020s American horror comedy television series Category:American children's animated adventure television series Category:American children's animated comedy television series Category:American children's animated fantasy television series Category:Anime-influenced Western animated television series Category:Dark fantasy television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Disney Channel original programming Category:Television series by Disney Television Animation Category:Animated television series about teenagers Category:Television series about witchcraft Category:Bisexuality- related television series Category:LGBT-related animated series Category:2020s American LGBT-related comedy television series * Category:American children's animated horror television series ",
