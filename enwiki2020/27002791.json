    "text": "Parung is a town and district in Indonesia that is located in the southwestern suburb of South Jakarta but officially still within the area of the Regency of Bogor. Those who travel from Jakarta to Bogor through the western alternative road will have to pass Parung. It has a traditional market called Pasar Parung as its commercial centre. The market is situated exactly on both sides of the main road which inevitably causes daily traffic congestion. Pasar Parung is marked by a huge tree which is called Pohon Jublek by the locals. ==Villages== Parung is divided into 9 villages (desa): * Bojongindah * Bojongsempu * Cogreg * Iwul * Jabonmekar * Pamagersari * Parung * Waru * Warujaya ==References== ==External links== * Category:Districts of Bogor Regency ",
