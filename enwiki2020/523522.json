As High Representative, Ashton served as the EU's foreign policy chief. Despite being criticised by some, particularly at the time of her appointment and in the early stages of her term of office, for her limited previous experience of international diplomacy, Ashton subsequently won praise for her work as a negotiator in difficult international situations, in particular for her role in bringing Serbia and Kosovo to an agreement in April 2013 that normalised their ties, and in the P5+1 talks with Iran which led to the November 2013 Geneva interim agreement on the Iranian nuclear programme.

Profile: Baroness Ashton, EU's new foreign minister, The Daily Telegraph, 20 November 2009. ===European Union=== On 3 October 2008, Ashton was nominated by the UK to replace Peter Mandelson as the European Commissioner for Trade. Because European Commissioners may not engage in any other occupation during their term of office, whether gainful or not,Under Article 213 of the Treaty establishing the European Community as amended: Rome Treaty (TEC): PART IV Title I Chapter 1 Section 3: The Commission, Articles 211 to 219 she used the procedural device previously adopted in 1984 by Lord CockfieldPrime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, House of Common Debates volume 69 column 493W (12 December 1984) HANSARD and took a leave of absence from the House of Lords on 14 October 2008, retaining her peerage but not her seat.

Her appointment was agreed at a summit by 27 European Union leaders in Brussels. Having initially pushed for former British Prime Minister Tony Blair to become President of the European Council, Gordon Brown eventually relented on the condition that the post of High Representative be awarded to a Briton. Ashton's relative obscurity prior to her appointment prompted comment in the media. The Guardian newspaper reported that her appointment as High Representative had received a \"cautious welcome... from international relations experts\".Catherine Ashton: 'As trade commissioner she had a good reputation': British peer receives cautious welcome as EU foreign minister from international relations experts The Guardian, Friday 20 November 2009. The Economist described her as being a virtual unknown with paltry political experience, having no foreign-policy background and never having been elected to anything. The magazine credited her, however, with piloting the Lisbon Treaty through the House of Lords, handling the European Commission's Trade Portfolio without disagreement with her colleagues, and being suited to consensus-building.page12 The Economist, 28 November\u20134 December 2009. Critics predicted she would be out of her depth.

Daniel Hannan, a British Conservative MEP, complained that she had \"no background in trade issues at a time when the EU is engaged in critical negotiations with Canada, Korea and the WTO\". The Guardian quoted an anonymous Whitehall source as commenting \"Cathy just got lucky...The appointment of her and Herman Van Rompuy [as European Council president] was a complete disgrace. They are no more than garden gnomes.\" By contrast, former Home Secretary Charles Clarke said: \"I have seen Cathy in action. I have great respect for her. She is excellent at building good relations with people and a good negotiator\". Shami Chakrabarti, the director of Liberty, a human-rights pressure group, said: \"people underestimate Cathy at their peril. She is not a great big bruiser. She is a persuader and a charmer. That is the secret of her success.\"Lady Ashton: Principled, charming ... or just plain lucky The Guardian, 20 November 2009. Retrieved 20 March 2015. After a confirmation hearing by the Trade Committee of the European Parliament, Ashton was approved by the Parliament on 22 October 2008 by 538 to 40 votes, with 63 abstentions.

A senior French diplomat was quoted as saying, \"I tip my hat to her.... She truly played a decisive role\". The report continued that, after initially insisting on negotiating only with other foreign ministers, by the latter stages of the negotiations the Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif \"now... wanted to deal only with Lady Ashton\". Said a western diplomat, \"That the others agreed to this was significant. For China and Russia to be outside while she was in the room negotiating details was quite remarkable\".Spiegeleisen, Peter. \"Ashton no longer the diplomatic dilettante\".

Dialogue with political forces and society and the use of arguments is always better than the argument of force\".

Ashton responds: \"I didn't know \u2026 Gosh.\" \"So there is a stronger and stronger understanding that behind snipers it was not Yanukovych, it was somebody from the new coalition\", Paet says. Ashton replies: \"I think we do want to investigate. I didn't pick that up, that's interesting. Gosh\", she says.

The United Nations Committee Against Torture stated that the new law could prohibit sharing information on the human rights situation in Russia with the United Nations human rights organs.

The survey, carried out by lobbying and PR company Burson- Marsteller, asked 324 Brussels policy-makers to rate the European Commissioners with a grade of A to E (A being the highest). Ashton scored an E for her performance, the only Commissioner to receive a grade below D.Bruno Waterfield, \"Baroness Ashton bottom of class as she 'fails' first year in office\", The Daily Telegraph, 9 February 2011. In March 2012, Ashton was criticised by Israeli politicians for comparing the shooting of Jewish children in Toulouse with the situation in Gaza. Ashton told Palestinian youths at a UNRWA event, \"When we think of what happened in Toulouse today, when we remember what happened in Norway a year ago, when we know what is happening in Syria, when we see what is happening in Gaza and Sderot and in different parts of the world \u2013 we remember young people and children who lose their lives.\" After she was quoted in the press as not having mentioned the Israeli city of Sderot, Israeli politicians denounced her for equating the murder of three children and a rabbi in the shooting attack with the situation in Gaza. Her spokesman stated that her remark had been \"grossly distorted\" and that she had also referenced Israeli victims in Sderot, but this fact had been omitted from the original transcript. Lady Ashton and Russian President Vladimir Putin, 3 June 2013 In counterpoint to earlier criticism of Ashton for not travelling enough, in September 2012 the Daily Telegraph criticised her for not being present in Brussels for enough European Commission meetings, reporting that Ashton had missed 21 out of 32 regular weekly meetings held so far that year. To the paper's complaint that Ashton's absences were \"leaving Britain without a voice\" at such meetings, European diplomatic officials said that, under EU treaties, commissioners serve as representatives not of individual member countries but of the European interest. Ashton's staff also pointed to her personal involvement in nuclear negotiations with Iran as among the international responsibilities that had kept her away from Commission meetings. The Polish Minister for European and Economic Affairs, Mikolaj Dowgielewicz, stated in 2011 that criticism of Ashton was \"a lot of hot air\" and that \"she has an impossible job to do and she is doing it well. At the end of her time in office, people will be more positive about what she has done. She will leave a real legacy.\"Carroll, Dean.
