    "text": "Increasing methane emissions are a major contributor to the rising concentration of greenhouse gases in earth's atmosphere, and are responsible for up to one-third of near-term climate warming. During year 2019, about 360 million tons (60 percent) of methane were released globally through human activities, while natural sources contributed about 230 million tons (40 percent). Reducing methane emissions by capturing and utilizing the gas can produce simultaneous environmental and economic benefits. About one-third (33%) of anthropogenic emissions are from gas release during the extraction and delivery of fossil fuels; mostly due to gas venting and gas leaks. Animal agriculture is a similarly large source (30%); primarily due to enteric fermentation by ruminant livestock such as cattle and sheep. Human consumer waste flows, primarily those passing through landfills and wastewater treatment, have grown to become a third major source category (18%). Plant agriculture, including both food and biomass production, constitutes a fourth category (15%), with rice production being the largest single contributor. The world's wetlands contribute about three-quarters (75%) of the enduring natural sources of methane emissions. Emissions from near-surface fossil-fuel deposits (unrelated to human activity), volcanic activity, and emissions by termites account for much of the remainder. Contributions from the surviving wild populations of ruminant mammals are vastly overwhelmed by those of cattle, humans, and other livestock animals. ==Atmospheric concentration and warming influence== Globally averaged atmospheric CH4 and its annual growth rate GATM The atmospheric methane concentration is increasing and has exceeded 1860 parts per billion as of year 2019, equal to two-and-a-half times the pre- industrial level.Earth System Research Laboratory Global Monitoring Division, NOAA, May 5, 2019 The methane itself causes a direct radiative forcing that is second only to that of carbon dioxide. Due to interactions with oxygen compounds stimulated by sunlight, methane can also increase the atmospheric presence of shorter-lived ozone and water vapour, which are also potent warming gases that amplify methane's near-term warming influence in a mechanism that atmospheric researchers distinguish as indirect radiative forcing. When such interactions occur, longer-lived and less-potent carbon dioxide is also produced. Including both the direct and indirect forcings, the increase in atmospheric methane is responsible for about one-third of near- term climate warming. To compare the warming to that from carbon dioxide over a given time period, methane in the atmospheric has an estimated 20-year global warming potential (GWP) of 85, meaning that a ton of methane emitted into the atmosphere creates approximately 85 times the atmospheric warming as a ton of carbon dioxide over a period of 20 years.Myhre, G., D. Shindell, F.-M. Br\u00e9on, W. Collins, J. Fuglestvedt, J. Huang, D. Koch, J.-F. Lamarque, D. Lee, B. Mendoza, T. Nakajima, A. Robock, G. Stephens, T. Takemura and H.

Contribution of Working Group I to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Stocker, T.F., D. Qin, G.-K. Plattner, M. Tignor, S.K. Allen, J. Boschung, A. Nauels, Y. Xia, V. Bex and P.M. Midgley (eds.). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, USA. Anthropogenic and Natural Radiative Forcing On a 100-year timescale, the GWP is in the range of 28-34. Though methane causes far more heat to be trapped than the same mass of carbon dioxide, less than half of the emitted methane remains in the atmosphere after a decade. On average, carbon dioxide warms for a much longer time period assuming no change in rates of carbon sequestration. ==List of emission sources== Diagram showing the main sources of methane for the decade 2008-2017, produced by a global report on global methane emissions by the Global Carbon Project \"Methane global emissions from the five broad categories for the 2008\u20132017 decade for top-down inversion models and for bottom-up models and inventories (right dark coloured box plots). Abiogenic methane is stored in rocks and soil stems from the geologic processes that convert ancient biomass into fossil fuels. Biogenic methane is actively produced by microorganisms in a process called methanogenesis. Under certain conditions, the process mix responsible for a sample of methane may be deduced from the ratio of the isotopes of carbon, and through analysis methods similar to carbon dating. ===Anthropogenic=== Map of methane emissions from four source categories A comprehensive systems method from describing the sources of methane due to human society is known as anthropogenic metabolism. As of year 2020, the emission volumes from some sources remain more uncertain than others; due in part to localized emission spikes not captured by the limited global measurement capability. The time required for a methane emission to become well-mixed throughout earth's troposphere is about 1-2 years. {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center;\" |- ! Category !! Major Sources !!

Satellites have recently begun to come online with capability to measure methane and other more powerful greenhouse gases with improving resolution. The Tropomi instrument launched in year 2017 by the European Space Agency can measure methane, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, aerosol, and ozone concentrations in earth's troposphere at resolutions of several kilometers. The CLAIRE satellite launched in year 2016 by the Canadian firm GHGSat can resolve carbon dioxide and methane to as little as 50 meters, thus enabling its customers to pinpoint the source of emissions. ==National reduction policies== Global anthropogenic methane emissions from historical inventories and future Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) projections. China implemented regulations requiring coal plants to either capture methane emissions or convert methane into CO2 in 2010. According to a Nature Communications paper published in January 2019, methane emissions instead increased 50 percent between 2000 and 2015. In March 2020, Exxon called for stricter methane regulations, which would include detection and repair of leaks, minimization of venting and releases of unburned methane, and reporting requirements for companies. However in August 2020, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rescinded a prior tightening of methane emission rules for the U.S. oil and gas industry. ===By country=== Methane emissions for 2017

Each molecule of methane would be converted into , which has a far smaller impact on climate (99% less). Replacing all atmospheric methane with would reduce total greenhouse gas warming by approximately one-sixth. Zeolite is a crystalline material with a porous molecular structure. Powerful fans could push air through reactors of zeolite and catalysts to absorb the methane. The reactor could then be heated to form and release . At a carbon price of $500/ton, removing one ton of methane would earn $12,000. ==See also== *Global Methane Initiative *China United Coalbed Methane *CO2 emissions *Fugitive gas emissions *Climate change feedback ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Greenhouse gas emissions Category:Methane ",
