Inko-Tariah stated that unfolding developments in the state indicated that his services were no longer needed. On 12 February 2016, Commissioner of Finance, Fred Kpakol along with Accountant General Abere Dagogo were temporarily relieved of their duties. The suspension lasted until 15 February before being lifted following interventions by different political leaders. Governor Ezenwo Nyesom Wike also suspended Kelvin Wachukwu indefinitely from his post as Commissioner of Works. The reasons given included negligence, dereliction of duty and poor project supervision. Wachukwu was replaced by Bathuel Harrison Iheanyichukwu, who was officially sworn into the Cabinet on 9 May. On 31 August 2016, four commissioners, a special adviser and the Head of Service were handed a suspension of 3 months each for unstated reasons. The commissioners suspended from office were the Commissioner of Culture and Tourism Tonye Briggs-Oniyide, Commissioner of Finance Fred Kpakol, Commissioner of Sports Boma Iyaye and Commissioner of Chieftaincy and Community Affairs John Bazia. Others suspended included the Head of Service Rufus Godwins and Anugbum Onuoha, Special Adviser on Lands. Further reports, however, revealed that the Governor had taken his decision following an Executive Council meeting in August \"which the officials attended late\". They were later recalled to their various offices on 16 September that year. On 15 February 2017, Theophilus Odagme was dismissed from the office of Commissioner of Health. He was the second commissioner dismissed openly from the cabinet. On 22 June 2017, Wike fired Bathuel Harrison Iheanyichukwu from the post of Commissioner of Works, making him the second cabinet official in that ministry to be removed from office. A day after Harrison's abrupt removal, Commissioner of Information and Communications Austin Tam-George handed in his letter of resignation. The Executive Council was dissolved on 24 June 2017. ==See also== *Government of Rivers State *Timeline of the governorship of Ezenwo Nyesom Wike ==References== ==External links== * Category:2010s establishments in Rivers State Category:Cabinets established in 2015 Category:State executive councils of Nigeria Category:2015 politics in Rivers State Category:2016 politics in Rivers State executive council of Rivers Stateo Category:2010s disestablishments in Rivers State Category:2015 establishments in Nigeria Category:2017 disestablishments in Nigeria Category:Cabinets disestablished in 2017 ",
