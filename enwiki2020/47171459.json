The channel began broadcasting on 31 August 2013, with Petr Koliha as its first executive director. \u010cT D\u00e9\u010dko broadcasts from 6 am to 8 pm, and shares its frequency with cultural channel \u010cT art which uses the remaining hours. == History == The channel dedicated to young audience was a part of Petr Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's candidate project for the position of CEO of \u010cesk\u00e1 televize. In September 2012, executive director Petr Koliha, former artistic director of the Zl\u00edn Film Festival for Children and Youth, was appointed three months later as creative producer for children's work Barbara Johnson. Thanks to the transfer of children's and cultural programs to \u010cT: D and \u010cT art, the \u010cT2 program should focus more on educational and cognitive programs and strengthen Czech documentaries. Previously, the TV channel \u010cT :D was broadcast as \u010cT3. \u010cT3 aired from 1 January 1993 to 3 February 1994. \u010cesk\u00e1 televize gradually registered possible names and graphic design of the logo at the Industrial Property Office. Possible suggestions included \u010cT Juni, \u010cT D, \u010cT children, \u010cT Hi, \u010cT mini, mini \u010cT, \u010cT hele and selected \u010cT :D, which is to symbolize a smile. == Programming == The station is open daily from 6.00 am to 8.00 pm, the TV channel \u010cT art broadcasts on the same frequency between 8 pm and the second morning. \u010cT :D is intended for two audience groups, namely for children aged 4\u20138 (57% of broadcasts) and for children aged 8\u201315 (43% of broadcasts). === Future === \u010cesk\u00e1 televize stated that if \u010cT D\u00e9\u010dko and \u010cT art proved successful, the two channels would broadcast from separate frequencies and allowing them to broadcast 24-hours a day. ==Current Programing== *Annedroids (Anedroid\u010dka) *Apollo's Tail Tales (Apollo) *Fishtronaut *Paper Tales *Dino Dan *Dino Dana *Be Be Bears *Earth to Luna! *Pat & Mat *Peg + Cat *Shaun the Sheep *Sunny Bunnies *Tilly and Friends *Wissper *Zig & Sharko (Zig a \u0160harko) == Availability == Television broadcasts its program in multiplex 1a (which was created by extending the originally planned regional networks 7, 10, 20). From 9 October 2013 to 31 March 2018 it also spread its signal in the nationwide Multiplex 3, with the newly established Prima Krimi channel taking over. From 24 April 2018, \u010cT :D / art is available in Multiplex 1. On 29 March 2018 it broadcasts in high definition in the transition network 11. \u010cT :D/\u010cT art HD is also available via satellite, cable TV and IPTV. == Criticism == After launching the broadcast, the program \u010cT :D and, consequently, the sister program \u010cT art, which are broadcast on multiplex 1a, became a target of criticism due to the inability to tune this program.We don't tune \u010cT D\u00e9\u010dko, people complain. It's worth the cover\u010cT started broadcasting for kids, but people complain that the station will not be tuned The most frequent reasons are insufficient signal coverage or the necessary change in the antenna system.\u010cT D\u00e9\u010dko and Art can't even tune in because of antennas, technicians say Critics claim that the announced coverage of 80% of the territory of the Czech Republic by the multiplex 1a signal is unrealistic, and that even in areas where such coverage is already required, either a new antenna must be purchased, or the existing antenna must be redirected to a signal source, that again loses the signal from other Multiplexes.Thousands of hundreds of people don't even find D\u00e9\u010dko and Art. Maybe the channel has zero coverage in LiberecHow do you tune your \u010cT channel? No way, or you have to roof The Chair of the Association of Directors and Screenwriters Ljuba Wenceslas wrote a complaint to the chairman of the Czech Television Council, Milan Uhda, to explain the situation.The new channel of \u010cesk\u00e9 televize was not even tuned by its director Dvo\u0159\u00e1kExplain why people don't tune in with your news, \u010cT asks the directors == Broadcasting == === HD === High-definition (HD) broadcasting via satellite was started on 1 November 2016 using Astra 3B-capacities. ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Television in the Czech Republic Category:Television channels and stations established in 2013 Category:Children's television networks Category:Czech-language television stations Category:\u010cesk\u00e1 televize ",
