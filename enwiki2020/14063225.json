Also included are the corresponding Governors and Lieutenant Governors where applicable. Delaware was one of the 13 colonies of Great Britain that joined the American War of Independence. The General Assembly was formed at that time and has met since then under four state constitutions as indicated. ==Constitution of 1776== Under the Delaware Constitution of 1776 the General Assembly consisted of The Legislative Council and the House of Assembly. There were nine members of the Council, three from each county, and twenty-one members of the Assembly, seven from each county. All members were elected \"at-large\" from a multi-member district that included their entire county. Elections were held the first day of October, and terms began on the 20th day of October, lasting three years for the Council and one year for the House. Approximately one third of the Senate was elected every year. Sessions were generally held several times every year. {|class=wikitable style=\"width: 94%\" style=\"text- align: center;\" align=\"center\" |-bgcolor=#cccccc !colspan=12 style=\"background: #ccccff;\" |Delaware General Assembly 1776\u20131792 |- !Year !Assembly !President ! !Council Majority !Speaker ! !House Majority !Speaker |- |1776/77 |1st ||John McKinly Thomas McKean | ||no parties | |George Read | | |no parties | |John McKinly |- |1777/78 |2nd ||George Read Caesar Rodney | | |no parties | |George Read | | |no parties | |Samuel West |- |1778/79 |3rd ||Caesar Rodney | | |no parties | |Thomas Collins | | |no parties | |Samuel West |- |1779/80 |4th ||Caesar Rodney | | |no parties | |John Clowes | | |no parties | |Simon Kollock |- |1780/81 |5th ||Caesar Rodney | | |no parties | |Thomas Collins | | |no parties | |Benjamin Caton |- |1781/82 |6th ||Caesar Rodney John Dickinson | | |no parties | |Thomas Collins | | |no parties | |Simon Kollock |- |1782/83 |7th ||John Cook Nicholas Van Dyke | | |no parties | |John Cook | | |no parties | |Nicholas Van Dyke |- |1783/84 |8th ||Nicholas Van Dyke | | |no parties | |Caesar Rodney | | |no parties | |Robert Bryan |- |1784/85 |9th ||Nicholas Van Dyke | | |no parties | |Thomas McDonough | | |no parties | |Thomas Duff |- |1785/86 |10th ||Nicholas Van Dyke | | |no parties | |Thomas McDonough | | |no parties | |Thomas Duff |- |1786/87 |11th ||Thomas Collins | | |no parties | |George Craighead | | |no parties | |John Cook |- |1787/88 |12th ||Thomas Collins | | |no parties | |Thomas McDonough | | |no parties | |Thomas Rodney |- |1788/89 |13th ||Thomas Collins Jehu Davis Joshua Clayton | | |no parties | |George Mitchell | | |no parties | |Jehu Davis |- |1789/90 |14th ||Joshua Clayton | | |no parties | |George Mitchell | | |no parties | |Jehu Davis |- |1790/91 |15th ||Joshua Clayton | | |no parties | |George Mitchell | | |no parties | |Henry Latimer |- |1791/92 |16th ||Joshua Clayton | | |no parties | |George Mitchell | | |no parties | |Allan McLane |} ==Constitution of 1792== Under the Delaware Constitution of 1792 the General Assembly consisted of the Senate and the House of Representatives.
