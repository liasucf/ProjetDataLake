    "text": "KAJB, virtual channel 54 (UHF digital channel 36), is a UniM\u00e1s-affiliated television station serving El Centro, California and Yuma, Arizona, United States and Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico that is licensed to Calipatria, California. Owned by Calipatria Broadcasting Company, it is operated under a joint sales agreement (JSA) by Entravision Communications, making it a sister station to El Centro-licensed Univision affiliate KVYE (channel 7). The two stations share studios on North Imperial Avenue in El Centro and transmitter facilities atop Black Mountain. ==Digital television== ===Digital channels=== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

The station released its allocation and participated in the FCC second round elections, selecting UHF channel 36 for its digital allocation instead. After years of efforts to obtain Mexican coordination for the use of channel 36, KAJB was granted a construction permit to build digital facilities in August 2008, nearly nine years after requesting authorization, and began airing in March 2009. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 54, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition. ==References== ==External links== *UniM\u00e1s official site * * Category:Television channels and stations established in 2000 Category:UniM\u00e1s network affiliates Category:LATV affiliates Category:2000 establishments in California AJB AJB Category:Entravision Communications stations ",
