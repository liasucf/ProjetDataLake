    "text": "Arseniy Olegovich Protsyshyn (born 29 August 1995) is a Ukrainian professional footballer who plays as a right-back for SK Bischofshofen. ==Career== Protsyshyn began his career in Ukraine with UFC Dnipro and Metalurh Donetsk, featuring for both at youth level. He then moved to Vorskla Poltava, with whom he failed to make a first-team appearance but was an unused substitute on one occasion for a Ukrainian Cup victory away to Nyva Ternopil on 23 August 2014. Protsyshyn made subsequent moves to Sumy and Sokil Zolochiv prior to leaving Ukrainian football for Slovakia's Tepli\u010dka nad V\u00e1hom. He featured seven times towards the end of the 2015\u201316 2. Liga, including his debut versus Tatran Pre\u0161ov. Sumy of the Ukrainian First League resigned Protsyshyn in 2016. Fifteen appearances followed for Protsyshyn in his second spell with Sumy, before he left to spend the rest of 2016\u201317 with Rochyn Sosnivka. 2017 saw Protsyshyn sign for Polish IV liga side Cuiavia Inowroc\u0142aw. He netted seven goals in his first campaign. In the next season, he completed a loan up three divisions to play for Bytovia Byt\u00f3w in the second tier. Protsyshyn's first appearance came in a win away to Bruk-Bet Termalica Nieciecza, which preceded his opening goal for Bytovia Byt\u00f3w against GKS Tychy on 8 September 2018. Protsyshyn, after seventeen appearances for Bytovia, returned to his parent club in June 2019. On 31 July 2019, Protsyshyn terminated his contract with Cuiavia Inowroc\u0142aw. A serious injury prevented the defender from joining a new club, though FC Mynai of the Ukrainian First League allowed him to train with them during his rehabilitation period; with interest of a permanent contract. However, upon recovery, Protsyshyn rejoined Cuiavia Inowroc\u0142aw and subsequently scored three goals in eleven total matches in 2019\u201320. He cut short his contract in December 2019, departing his second stay early by two months. Protsyshyn, soon after, agreed a move to Austrian Regionalliga team SK Bischofshofen. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |+ Club statistics |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Vorskla Poltava |2014\u201315 |rowspan=\"1|Premier League |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Sumy |2014\u201315 |rowspan=\"1|First League |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Tepli\u010dka nad V\u00e1hom |2015\u201316 |rowspan=\"1|2.
