At the trailer launch of the film on 21 June 2017, producer said, \"NMA2 is different from NMA because it's another film altogether. It's a new film that features the same characters.\" \"Despite its connection to the previous one, NMA2 acts as a standalone film too\", she added.

We just got our sound engineering done from India, but everything else has been done by us\".

Director Nabeel Qureshi commented on this matter to Dawn Images, saying the film \"already received clearance by the censor board and\" released with no issues, \"then ban it a month later sets a really bad precedent.\" \"Also, the censor board issued the notification on a weekend so I couldn't even go to court to challenge immediately,\" he added, saying he will take the matter to the court anyway. However, the film was reviewed again and ban was lifted shortly on 7 October with no issues.
