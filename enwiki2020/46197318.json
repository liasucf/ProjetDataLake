She was born in Lede, in the county of Flanders, the daughter of Adrian Bette, knight, and Agnes de Merode de Rummen. Her cousin, Guillaume de Bette, 1st Marquess of Lede, was a knight of the Order of Santiago with links to the Habsburg court. As abbess she faced financial strains, which she attempted to meet by selling off part of the abbey's land. She also attempted to reform the monastery, which had acquired a reputation for loose discipline. She was not notably successful in either effort. In 1644 she commissioned a precious reliquary in Baroque style to house the relics of Saint Alena. This was probably paid for by her family. It is now in the parish church of Forest, Belgium.Bart Fransen, \"Recherches historiques / Historisch onderzoek\", Bulletin of the Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage, 32 (2006-2008), pp. 95-101. ==References== Category:1593 births Category:1666 deaths Category:Benedictine abbesses Category:Belgian Roman Catholic abbesses Category:Belgian Benedictines Category:Belgian nobility ",
