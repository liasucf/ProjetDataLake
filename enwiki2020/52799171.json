The building is listed as a protected monument in the Bavarian protected monuments list. == Description == The town hall is located in Gro\u00dfhadern in the Munich's district 20 of Hadern, at W\u00fcrmtalstra\u00dfe 126 in the north-west corner of the crossing of W\u00fcrmtalstra\u00dfe and Gro\u00dfhaderner Stra\u00dfe. It was built in 1930\u201431 according to the plans of Ludwig Zwingmann. This construction was meant to combine practicality and traditional building. The building served a twofold purpose from the beginning: the municipal chancery of Gro\u00dfhadern occupied only the ground floor, and in the upper floors were apartments. The three-story building with a rectangular floor plan is about 35 meters long and about 12 meters wide and has a hipped roof. The fa\u00e7ade looks more like an apartment house than a town hall. The official character of the building is emphasized by a bay tower carrying a spherical tower helmet with a weather vane. The ground floor of the narrow side is dominated by the two great gates of the Departement Gro\u00dfhadern of the volunteer fire department Munich (Munich Fire Department). A stone figure was placed between the two rows of windows on the upper floor. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Munich Category:City and town halls in Germany Category:Registered historic buildings and monuments in Bavaria ",
