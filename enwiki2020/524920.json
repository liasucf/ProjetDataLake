The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is . Epiglottal and pharyngeal consonants occur at the same place of articulation. Esling (2010) describes the sound covered by the term \"epiglottal plosive\" as an \"active closure by the aryepiglottic pharyngeal stricture mechanism\" - that is, a stop produced by the aryepiglottic folds within the pharynx.John Esling (2010) \"Phonetic Notation\", in Hardcastle, Laver & Gibbon (eds) The Handbook of Phonetic Sciences, 2nd ed., p 695. ==Features== The epiglottis is labelled as \"12\" in this diagram. Features of the epiglottal stop: *It has no defined phonation, although it is typically voiceless, which means it is produced without vibrations of the vocal cords. Voiced epiglottal \"stops\" tend toward being epiglottal flaps. ==Occurrence== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"2\" | Language !! Word !! IPA !! Meaning !!
