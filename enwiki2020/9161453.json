He made his break into the first team in 2003. However, he was mostly used as a substitute when starters were injured. After his loan to Inter Zapre\u0161i\u0107 in 2004\u201305, \u010cale became a starter for Dinamo, where he played until the end of the 2007\u201308 season. In May 2008, \u010cale was transferred to Trabzonspor for a fee of \u20ac2.5 million. He signed a four-year contract. Before the move, \u010cale called Davor Vugrinec and asked him about his experience with the club. Vugrinec talked very positively about the club, which \u010cale said contributed to his decision. He became Trabzonspor's 68th foreigner, and the second Croatian, after Davor Vugrinec. In his first season with Trabzonspor, \u010cale participated in 36 total matches and cemented his place as the starting left-back. \u010cale was the starting left-back for the Turkish Cup winning side in 2010, and also started in the 2010 Turkish Super Cup final against league champions Bursaspor. \u010cale received a yellow card in a three nil victory for the Black Sea-based Trabzonspor. On 19 July 2011, \u010cale's contract with Trabzonspor was terminated by mutual consent. \u010cale moved to German Bundesliga side VfL Wolfsburg but failed to become regular first team member. After almost two seasons of struggling, \u010cale finally left Wolfsburg in May 2013 and signed for Belgian club Waasland-Beveren. After two seasons for Waasland- Beveren, he left Belgium and signed for Olimpija Ljubljana. He left Ljubljana after only one season in summer of 2016. On 15 February 2017, after being free agent for more than half season he signed with Inter Zapre\u0161i\u0107 for the rest of the season. ==International career== \u010cale represented Croatia at youth level.
