Although Rokah landed some small acting roles, he first came to wider attention for his 2015 documentary film, Queen Mimi. The project was funded on Kickstarter. The subject of the documentary, Elizabeth 'Mimi' Haist, was a homeless woman living in a laundromat frequented by young, unknown actors and helping them do their laundry. Rokah decided to make a film about her. The film garnered substantial publicity while still in production when actor Zach Galifianakis, who had since become successful with The Hangover series, arranged to give her an apartment, which Renee Zellweger furnished. ===Films=== * Queen Mimi Documentary: \"Forced onto the streets in her 50s, Marie \u201cMimi\u201d Haist found \u201chome\u201d between two rows of washers at a Santa Monica laundromat.
