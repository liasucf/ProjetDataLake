Tom Johnston, who was then the Doobies' frontman, later recalled, \"I had been a fan of that song since it came out somewhere in the '60s. I just loved that song. So somewhere around '72 I started lobbying to get the band to do a cover of that. And I didn't get anywhere until '75. Then finally in 1975 we actually did it.\" Doobies member Jeff Baxter said of their recording, \"That song was like a dream come true for us. Every musician I've ever known has at some point wanted to achieve Motown's technically slick soul sound - it's so dynamic. We sat down to try to duplicate it, and to see if our version could emerge as a successful single.\" According to Doobies member Patrick Simmons, \"At first the band sounded like the Grateful Dead doing the Four Tops, but gradually it came together quite accurately.\"\"Doobie Brother Add Jazz Flavor\" The Robesonian December 11, 1975 p.6 Motown veteran Paul Riser was enlisted to arrange the track.Toledo Blade, May 25, 1975 p.24 Released as the lead single of Stampede on April 23, 1975, \"Take Me in Your Arms\" reached a United States Hot 100 peak of number 11 that June. \"Take Me in Your Arms\" gave the Doobie Brothers their only chart hit in France, where it reached number 37.
