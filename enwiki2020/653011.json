    "text": "Shiraz Naval Minwalla (born 2 January, 1972) is an Indian theoretical physicist and string theorist. He is a faculty member in the Department of Theoretical Physics at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai. Prior to his present position, he was a Harvard Junior Fellow and subsequently an Assistant Professor at Harvard University. ==Early life== Born in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India, in 1972, to a Parsi-Zoroastrian father (Naval) and a Muslim mother (Khadija), Minwalla graduated from Campion School, Mumbai in 1988 and then Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in 1995. He later moved to Princeton University to earn his Ph.D. under the guidance of Nathan Seiberg. ==Awards== Minwalla was awarded the Swarnajayanti Fellowship 2005-06 by the Department of Science & Technology, Government of India. He was awarded the ICTP Prize in 2010 and the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize for Science and Technology, the highest science award in India, in the physical sciences category in 2011.\"11 scientists selected for Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar award\" ibn live, 26 September 2011. He was awarded the Infosys Prize 2013 in the field of Physical Sciences by the Infosys Science Foundation. He was awarded the 2014 New Horizons in Physics Prize by the Fundamental Physics Prize for \"his pioneering contributions to the study of string theory and quantum field theory; and in particular his work on the connection between the equations of fluid dynamics and Albert Einstein's equations of general relativity.\" In 2016, The World Academy of Sciences awarded him the TWAS Prize in Physics. ==Notable contributions to the field== * Analysis of primary operators on AdS4 and AdS7 * Three-point functions in N=4 supersymmetric Yang\u2013Mills theory and AdS/CFT * Noncommutative perturbative dynamics (with Nathan Seiberg and Mark Van Raamsdonk) * Noncommutative solitons (with Andrew Strominger and Rajesh Gopakumar) * OM-theory (with Nathan Seiberg, Andrew Strominger and Rajesh Gopakumar) * Stringy interactions in pp-waves * Some insights about tachyon condensation * Dualities in supersymmetric gauge theories, in particular Chern-Simons-matter theories * Connections between hydrodynamics and AdS/CFT. ==Personal life== Shiraz Minwalla is married to Ananya Dasgupta. He has two children, a boy Spandan Minwalla and a girl Chinar Minwalla. ==Selected works== * ==References== ==External links== * *Shiraz Minwalla's articles in the INSPIRE-HEP database Category:21st-century Indian physicists Category:String theorists Category:Princeton University alumni Category:Harvard University faculty Category:Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur alumni Category:Living people Category:Indian theoretical physicists Category:Tata Institute of Fundamental Research faculty Category:Scientists from Mumbai Category:TWAS laureates Category:Parsi people from Mumbai Category:Parsi people Category:1972 births ",
