She led the final two K131 Science Events on the sea ice of McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. == Education == Robinson grew up in the Hawke's Bay Region and moved to Victoria University of Wellington to complete her MSc (2005) on tides beneath the McMurdo Ice Shelf with data collected during the ANDRILL project with Alex Pyne and Peter Barrett.Robinson, N.J., Williams, M.J.M., Barrett, P.J. and Pyne, A.R., 2010. Observations of flow and ice\u2010ocean interaction beneath the McMurdo Ice Shelf, Antarctica. Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, 115(C3). https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008JC005255 She then completed her PhD (2012) at the University of Otago under the supervision of Pat Langhorne. She now works as a research scientist at National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research. == Career and impact == Robinson's work has significant contribution to understanding the oceanic connection between ice shelf and sea ice regimes. This has required direct sub-ice observations of pressure-induced supercooling; multi-phase fluid flow; roughness and drag at the interface; and buoyancy-driven convection. She focuses on the creation, evolution and fate of supercooled water, and its potential to influence sea ice growth Robinson has led a number of field expeditions to the sea ice of McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. In 2015, she was awarded a prestigious Marsden grant, amounting to $300,000, to study ice roughness beneath ice shelf affected sea ice.https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid;=11540434 This resulted in two expeditions to McMurdo Sound.https://www.stuff.co.nz/science/98902415/measuring-antarcticas- unpredictable-sea-ice-to-help-understand-climate- changehttps://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid;=12170458 Her studies showed that new ice crystals could refreeze on the underside of sea ice and make the underside much rougher than under smooth melting ice.Robinson, N.J., Stevens, C.L. and McPhee, M.G., 2017. Observations of amplified roughness from crystal accretion in the sub\u2010ice ocean boundary layer. Geophysical Research Letters, 44(4), pp.1814-1822. This work used Antarctic infrastructure developed by Timothy Haskell. Robinson led the final expeditions using the \"K131\" Camp Haskell.https://scientists.org.nz/resources/Documents/NZSR/NZSR74(3).pdf The \"K131\" is an event designation assigned by Antarctica New Zealand. She has worked with the artist Gabby O'Connor when O'Connor participated in Robinson's 2017 field expedition. This resulted in an exhibition at the Otago Museum in 2018.https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2017/06/mystery-of-antarctic-sea- ice-investigated-by-science-and-art.html Shipping container on the McMurdo Sound sea ice. This is an oceanographic laboratory as part of K131 and has a hole in the floor through which the ocean is accessed. She is on the Council of the New Zealand Association of Scientists. == References == == External links == * Natalie Robinson's webpage * Natalie Robinson on Google scholar Category:Antarctic scientists Category:Women Antarctic scientists Category:Living people Category:New Zealand scientists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
