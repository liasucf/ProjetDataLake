What is safe is following what you believe is your destiny; what is more risky is selling out for money and power that takes you in another direction. *Don\u2019t live a deferred life plan \u2013 When considering career changes, we always find reasons to delay. But after making a change, most professionals wish they had done it sooner. *Surround yourself with a community of love - Professionals that are happiest at work often say it is because of their relationships with colleagues and clients. At business schools, We primarily practice analytical skills, not relationship building skills. However, don\u2019t forget the importance of a community of respect and friendship for personal and professional fulfillment and success. *Look not at the masses, but at the one - Impact is not about numbers, it's not about size. It is about improving the world one person, one soul, at a time. *Plant trees under whose shade you will never sit \u2013 Including unreachable goals to our lives add meaning to our life and energy to our work as they connect us with something bigger than ourselves. == Selected publications == Books, a selection: * Albion, Mark S., and Paul W.
