    "text": "The 1952 Quebec general election was held on July 16, 1952 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Union Nationale, led by Maurice Duplessis, won re-election, defeating the Quebec Liberal Party, led by Georges-\u00c9mile Lapalme. This was the fourth time (and the third in a row) that Duplessis led his party to a general election victory. The number of seats won by the Liberals, and their share of the popular vote, were considerably increased over the previous election in 1948. ==Results== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border- collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\" |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" !rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party !rowspan=\"2\"|Party leader !rowspan=\"2\"|# of candidates !colspan=\"3\"|Seats !colspan=\"3\"|Popular Vote |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" |align=\"center\"|1948 |align=\"center\"|Elected |align=\"center\"|% Change |align=\"center\"|# |align=\"center\"|% |align=\"center\"|% Change |Maurice Duplessis |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|82 !align=\"right\"|68 |align=\"right\"|-17.1% |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 50.50% |align=\"right\"|-0.7% | Georges-\u00c9mile Lapalme |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|8 !align=\"right\"|23 |align=\"right\"|+188% |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 45.77% |align=\"right\"|+12.6% |colspan=2|Other1 |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|2 !align=\"right\"|1 |align=\"right\"|-50% |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 3.73% |align=\"right\"|-9.9% |- |colspan=\"3\"|Total !align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|92 !align=\"right\"|92 !align=\"right\"|- !align=\"right\"| !align=\"right\"|100% |align=\"right\"| |- |} Note: 1 including results of Union des \u00c9lecteurs from previous election. ==See also== * List of Quebec premiers * Politics of Quebec * Timeline of Quebec history * List of Quebec political parties * 24th Legislative Assembly of Quebec Quebec general election Category:Elections in Quebec General election Quebec general election ",
