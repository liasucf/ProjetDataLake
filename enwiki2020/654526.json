An example of such a molecule is semagacestat. \u00c9lan is also studying other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease. \u00c9lan, in collaboration with Wyeth, is currently conducting a Phase III clinical trial for bapineuzumab, an experimental humanized monoclonal antibody with a targeted indication of immunotherapeutic treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This humanized monoclonal antibody is designed and engineered to clear the neurotoxic beta-amyloid peptide that accumulates in the brains of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Although initial results from an earlier Phase II clinical trial presented in July 2008 were inconclusive, \u00c9lan is hopeful that bapineuzumab will prove successful in the treatment of this disease.Elan, Wyeth\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Angst Builds as Rivals Fail Bloomberg, 20 July 2009 In autoimmune diseases, \u00c9lan\u2019s primary emphasis is studying cell trafficking to discover ways to provide disease-modifying therapies for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease.
