    "text": "The Argentine presidential election of 1880 was held on 12 April to choose the president of Argentina. Julio Argentino Roca was elected president. ==Background== A leader of the Conquest of the Desert, as well as of the suppression of Mitre's 1874 uprising and others, President Avellaneda had decided on General Julio Roca as his successor, early on. Memories of Mitre's defeat did not sit well with Buenos Aires separatists, and this faction nominated the Governor of Buenos Aires Province, Carlos Tejedor. Roca's 11 April 1880, selection by the electoral college was followed by Tejedor's armed insurrection, and though the latter was defeated, Mitre brokered negotiations between Tejedor's separatists and the national government. These negotiations eventually result in the Federalization of Buenos Aires in September, stabilizing the powerful province's position within Argentina.Todo Argentina: 1880 ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=19% ! colspan=2| Argentine Republic |- | Population | align=right| 2,640,000 |- | Voters | align=right| 52,800 |- | Turnout | align=right| 2% |} {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"50%\" |- !width=\"50%\"| Presidential Candidates !width=\"35%\"| Party !width=\"15%\"| Electoral Votes |-style=\"background:#cfc;\" | Julio Argentino Roca | National Autonomist Party | 155 |- | Carlos Tejedor | Independent | 70 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total voters | 225 |- | colspan=2| Did not vote | 3 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total | 228 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"50%\" |- !width=\"50%\"| Vice Presidential Candidates !width=\"35%\"| Party !width=\"15%\"| Electoral Votes |-style=\"background:#cfc;\" | Francisco Bernab\u00e9 Madero | National Autonomist Party | 151 |- | Saturnino Mar\u00eda Laspiur | Independent | 70 |- | Bernardo de Irigoyen | Independent | 3 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total voters | 224 |- | colspan=2| Did not vote | 4 |-style=\"background:#EAECF0;\" | colspan=2| Total | 228 |} ==Notes== ==References== * * * * Category:1880 elections in South America Category:1880 in Argentina 1880 ",
