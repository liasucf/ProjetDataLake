A swordsman of the Hokushin Itt\u014d-ry\u016b, Nait\u014d taught kendo to the Japanese Police force, and was also the first teacher at the Budo Senmon Gakko. He helped to create the Dai Nihon Teikoku Kendo Kata, a group that promulgated the practice of kendo in Japanese schools and universities under the auspices of the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai. Nait\u014d was a skilled exponent of the use of kiai in kendo, and it is recorded that he used this ability in a match with Takano Sazaburo. Despite not striking a single blow in the contest, and being hit repeatedly on the kote (wrist guard) and men (protective helmet), Nait\u014d was judged to have displayed a superior level of swordsmanship, because he was able to receive Takano's attacks without any sign of concern. ==References== Category:1862 births Category:1929 deaths Category:Japanese kendoka ",
