    "text": "The C&C; 29 is a series of Canadian sailboats, that was designed by Cuthbertson & Cassian as International Offshore Rule half-ton racers and first built in 1977. The design is now out of production.Sherwood, Richard M.: A Field Guide to Sailboats of North America, Second Edition, pages 200-201. Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. The boat was built by C&C; Yachts in Canada, with some built in the US as well. The design was likely derived from the C&C; 1/2 Ton of 1975. ==Design== The C&C; 29 is a small recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a masthead sloop rig, an internally-mounted spade-type rudder and a fixed fin keel. ==Operational history== In a review of the Mark II model, Michael McGoldrick wrote, \"This C&C; 29 which was introduced in the early 1980s should not be confused with the much larger 29 foot model of the 1970s. This boat has an overall length of 28\" 6\", so it would have to be described as a slightly smallish 29 footer. It was marketed as the successor to the C&C; 27 of the 1970s (which was really a 28 footer). While the C&C; 29 has a comfortable and attractive interior which includes a quarter berth, it was conceived as a serious club racer that would have a favourable rating under the MORC measurement rule (Midget Ocean Racing Club). It is a good looking 29 footer that comes with a T-shaped cockpit.\" ==Variants== C&C; 29 Mark I ;C&C; 29 :This model was introduced in 1977 and is sometimes referred to as the C&C; 29-1 or Mark 1.
