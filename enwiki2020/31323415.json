    "text": "The Henry Clay and Bock & Company Ltd. Cigar Factory is a historic industrial building in the Chambersburg neighborhood of Trenton, New Jersey. It was built in 1932 to house the hand production of fine cigars and is considered the most architecturally distinct industrial building in the city, having been designed in the Spanish Revival style to highlight the Cuban origins of the company. ==History== The company moved cigar production from Cuba to Trenton in 1932 after a strike at the Cuban factory, and in order to avoid high tariffs. Brands produced at the plant included Henry Clay, Bock, La Corona, and Village Brands, among others, with Winston Churchill counted a faithful customer. At its peak in the 1930s the company produced a quarter of the fine cigar market in the United States, with 3000 employees at the Trenton plant. The factory was closed in 1967 and production moved to Pennsylvania. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 12, 1979. The building was converted to apartments in the 1980s. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Mercer County, New Jersey ==References== Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in New Jersey Category:Mission Revival architecture in New Jersey Category:Industrial buildings completed in 1932 Category:Buildings and structures in Trenton, New Jersey Category:National Register of Historic Places in Trenton, New Jersey Category:Historic cigar factories Category:Tobacco buildings in the United States Category:New Jersey Register of Historic Places Category:1932 establishments in New Jersey ",
