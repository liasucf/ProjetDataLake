    "text": "' () is an abbreviation of \"virtual '\" (, meaning \"virtual girl incarnation\") or \"virtual ' self '\" (, meaning \"virtual girl self-incarnation\") in Japanese. Also spelled as \"'\". It means wearing an avatar of a cute girl, or acting a virtual girl in a virtual space such as VRChat, or acting as a virtual YouTuber or virtual idol. They may change the utterance to a beautiful girl by using a voice changer or devise their way to utter, or use their local voice alone with using a 3-D model or illustration of a beautiful young girl. For example, if an adult male is incarnated, he is called \"'\" (, \"incarnated guy\"). Now the word \"Babiniku\" is often used as ' (an incarnated man) despite originally wearing a cute avatar by myself.}} In this case, the \"incarnate\" means \"take the body (avatar)\", which is different from the \"incarnation\" of the Christian catechism. == Origin == In Japanese virtual YouTuber community, the performer is called ' (, \"soul\"), the character's picture or 3-D model is called ' (, \"flesh\" or \"body\"), and getting the picture or 3-D model is called ' (, \"incarnation\") in Japanese. The word \"incarnation\" is derived from what ' () said when she got a 3-D model of herself. In the virtual YouTuber community, soul and body are often the same gender. On the other hand, at the end of 2017, \"Virtual '-loli ' YouTuber '\" (, \"virtual '\"noja\" is the word of the end of the sentence, and represents an elder person. noja-loli means loli- hag.-lolita fox girl YouTuber guy\", abbreviation: '), which is female in body and male in soul and voice, became popular. She (he) revealed that her soul is male (guy) and showed that she can be a beautiful girl character even if she is male, while her appearance and voice remain male. There are also many virtual YouTubers and Babiniku VTubers who began to work after watching her videos. p.38-39 She created a sense of value that it didn't matter if the character was a guy inside as long as the character was cute. Going one step further, Babiniku is not only cute, but also enjoying the gap, which is the presence of a soul (performer) and gender mismatch, as one of their content as well. The difference between a normal virtual YouTuber and a babiniku virtual YouTuber is that there are many who admit to the existence of a soul. The difference between Nekama and Babiniku is also there are many who admit to gender mismatch. After the appearance of ', popularity of incarnation has subsided except for some movements such as ' (). At the end of May 2018, however, cartoonist ' () and illustrator ' () introduced a method of moving illustrations through live stream using software called FaceRig and Live2D, which quickly became popular among illustrators. With the help of the fact that many virtual YouTubers were originally illustrators, virtual YouTubers who declared themselves to be \"male in spirit\" eventually began to gather together and create a community.\u3002In June 2018, a live stream of \"Virtual ' Self ' One Night '\" (, \"Virtual-Girl-Self-Incarnation-Guys Girls Party, with One Night Werewolf\") was held, and the title of this movie became the etymology of babiniku. ' (, \"Magurona the Demon King\"), who participated in this live broadcast, is regarded as a leading figure among the Babiniku guys due to the high number of her subscribers to the channel and her cuteness. == \"Hell\" == The notion of \"hellish\" is often used to describe babiniku in a roundabout way. Actually, When Rimukoro, Maki-hitsuji, Magurona, and Natori Sana (She is a real female.) were asked \"What is Babiniku?\" in their interviews, and they all responded, \"It's hell\". The reasons for this are \"they transfer us paraphilia\", \"deep dark side\", and so on. p.47 According to Magurona, she titled \"Virtual-Girl-Self-Incarnation-Guys Girls Party\", which was originally meant to be \"a hellish content where guys who have painted themselves and transformed themselves into cute girls get together and enjoy\". Over time, the \"self\" fell out, and the meaning of \"a man taking on the body of a cute girl and acting it out\" appeared. (There is no feminization desire in Magurona's soul.) == Vocalization == It is difficult to convert an ordinary male voice into a female voice by instrumental manipulation alone. It's necessary to keep the female-like voice by using the falsetto or a mixed voice. and the smaller the change in pitch and formant in the voice changer, the more natural the female voice will be. In addition, there are also Babiniku VTubers, such as Takehana Nohto (), who speaks in female-like voices without using any voice changers. p.40 Not only the voice itself, but also the way to speak and intonation is involved in the femininity of the voice very much. == In television == In 8 January 2020, NHK Educational TV broadcast about Babiniku in \"Nehorin-Pahorin\". == Popular Babiniku VTubers == === Using voice changer === ; ' (, \"Magurona the Demon King\") or simply \"Magurona\" () : She is known as a male illustrator (ukyo_rst; ).
