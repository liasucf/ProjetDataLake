The Lebanese singer Elissa reproduced a song by Aida Chalhoub entitled \"Law Fiyeh\", and it became a success. However, some dispute did arise due to renewing this song, since the management office behind Elissa announced that the renewal of the song is in the memory of singer Salwa Al Katrib, in a reference to her as the original singer. Not only Elissa did not apologize for the mistake, but Elissa did refer to Aida in a television interview as \"[the] late singer Aida Chalhoub\", for which Aida also claims she did not receive any apology.\u0639\u0627\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0634\u0644\u0647\u0648\u0628 \"\u0644\u0627 \u0645\u0627\u0646\u0639 \u0645\u0646 \u063a\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0633\u0627 \"\u0644\u0648 \u0641\u064a\u064a\" \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0633\u0627\u0624\u0648\u0627 \u0644\u064a\" ==References== Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Lebanese female singers Category:Lebanese academics ",
