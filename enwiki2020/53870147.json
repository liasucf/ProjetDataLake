The exposition starts from the north rooms, apparently in 3 parallel blocks, each set in incremental height on the slope between the outer court and temple yard, with the rooms nearest to the temple twice in size of those closer to the outer court (verse 8), with the priests' kitchen at the western end (f; denoted by letter G in the temple plan). ===Verse 1=== : Then he brought me out into the outer court, by the way toward the north; and he brought me into the chamber which was opposite the separating courtyard, and which was opposite the building toward the north. NKJV * The vision was given on the 25th anniversary of Ezekiel's exile, \"April 28, 573 BCE\"; 14 years after the fall of Jerusalem and 12 years after the last messages of hope in chapter 39. Plans for \"the chambers all around\" had also been included in the designs for the first temple which King David had provided for his son Solomon. ===Verse 2=== : Facing the length, which was one hundred cubits (the width was fifty cubits), was the north door. NKJV * \"Cubit\" here is a \"long cubit\" or \"royal cubit\", about , as defined in Ezekiel 40:5. ===Verse 13=== : Then he said to me, \"The north chambers and the south chambers, which are opposite the separating courtyard, are the holy chambers where the priests who approach the Lord shall eat the most holy offerings. There they shall lay the most holy offerings\u2014the grain offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering\u2014for the place is holy.\" NKJV Cross reference: ; ; ; ; * The vestibules of the inner gates are sanctified for the preparation of the offerings: \"burnt, sin and guilt offerings\" (). The rooms have three main purposes: where the priests eat, where the priests store offerings in excess of the immediate requirements, and where the priests robe themselves for service of the altar. ==The overall dimensions (42:15\u201320)== This section resumes the original vision from as Ezekiel follows the angel measuring the outer wall of the temple area, which is the boundary of the sacred area according to verse 20. ==See also== *New Jerusalem Dead Sea Scroll *Solomon's Temple *Third Temple *Related Bible parts: Leviticus 1, Leviticus 2, Leviticus 3, Leviticus 4, Leviticus 5, Leviticus 6, Leviticus 7, 1 Kings 6, 2 Chronicles 3, Isaiah 2, Ezekiel 40, Ezekiel 44, Revelation 21 ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * * * * ==External links== ===Jewish=== *Ezekiel 42 Hebrew with Parallel English *Ezekiel 42 Hebrew with Rashi's Commentary ===Christian=== *Ezekiel 42 English Translation with Parallel Latin Vulgate 42 ",
