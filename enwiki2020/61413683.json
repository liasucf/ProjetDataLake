    "text": "West Beckwith Mountain is a prominent mountain summit in the West Elk Mountains range of the Rocky Mountains of North America. The peak is located in the West Elk Wilderness of Gunnison National Forest, about southwest of Crested Butte in Gunnison County, Colorado, United States. West Beckwith Mountain is a laccolith, formed when magma intruded into Mancos Shale some 30 million years ago. Since then, erosion has removed the softer, overlying sedimentary rock, exposing the more resistant igneous rock. West Beckwith Mountain is one of over a dozen laccoliths in the West Elk and adjacent Elk Mountains. ==Historical names== *West Beckwith Peak ==See also== *East Beckwith Mountain *List of Colorado mountain ranges ==References== ==External links== * Category:West Elk Mountains Category:Mountains of Gunnison County, Colorado Category:Gunnison National Forest Category:Mountains of Colorado Category:North American 3000 m summits ",
