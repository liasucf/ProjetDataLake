Second Battle of Maritsa) took place at the Maritsa River near the village of Chernomen (today Ormenio in Greece) on 26 September 1371 between Ottoman forces commanded by Lala \u015eahin Pasha and Evrenos, and Serbian forces commanded by King Vuka\u0161in Mrnjav\u010devi\u0107 and his brother Despot Jovan Uglje\u0161a.Jirecek, Konstantin. History of the Bulgarians, p. 382Fine, J. V. A. The Late Mediaeval Balkans, p. 379Stavrianos, L. S., The Balkans since 1453, p. 44Jirecek, Konstantin. Geschichte der Serben, pp. 437-438 ==Background== In 1354, the Ottomans acquired Gallipoli. From there, they expanded into Thrace, taking the important city of Adrianople in 1369. They reached the borders of Ugljesa's lands. Ugljesa realized the danger and tried to create a coalition against the Turks. His idea was to drive them out of Europe instead of trying to defend fortresses and cities. He failed to secure support from the Byzantines and the Bulgarians. Most of the Serbian lords were occupied fighting each other and didn't realize the extent of the danger. The only Serbian lord who supported Uglje\u0161a's ideas was his brother Vuka\u0161in. In the summer of 1371, Vuka\u0161in marched to Zeta, to support his relative \u0110ura\u0111 Bal\u0161i\u0107 in was against Nikola Altomanovi\u0107. His army was in Skadar, waiting for naval support from the Republic of Ragusa. Uglje\u0161a received information that the majority of Ottoman forces left Europe and marched to Anatolia. He decided it is a good time to execute his offensive plans and asked Vuka\u0161in for help. Vuka\u0161in left Skadar with his army and joined Uglje\u0161a. They marched against Adrianople. Fine, J. V. A. The Late Mediaeval Balkans, p. 379 ==Battle== The Christian army numbered 50,000\u201370,000 men. Despot Uglje\u0161a wanted to make a surprise attack on the Ottomans in their capital city, Edirne, while Murad I was in Asia Minor. The Ottoman army was much smaller, Byzantine Greek scholar Laonikos Chalkokondyles and different sources give the number of 800 up to 4,000 men,Donald MacGillivray Nicol, The Last Centuries of Byzantium, 1261-1453; Hart-Davis, 1972, p. 286. but due to superior tactics, by conducting a night raid on the Christian camp, \u015e\u00e2hin Pa\u015fa was able to defeat the Christian army and kill King Vuka\u0161in and despot Uglje\u0161a. Thousands of Christians were killed, and thousands drowned in the Maritsa river when they tried to flee. After the battle, the Maritsa ran scarlet with blood.Temperley, Harold William Vazeille. History of Serbia, H. Fertig, 1917, page 97. ==Aftermath== Parts of Macedonia and Thrace fell under Ottoman power after this battle. The battle was a part of the Ottoman campaign to conquer the Balkans and was preceded by the Ottoman capturing of Sozopol in modern Bulgaria and succeeded by the capture of the cities of Drama, Kav\u00e1la, and Serrai in modern Greece. The battle preceded the later 1389 Battle of Kosovo, and was one of many in the Serbian\u2013Turkish wars. ==See also== * List of military disasters ==Notes== ==References== * Rossos, Andrew, Macedonia and the Macedonians, Hoover Institution Press Publications, 2008. * Sedlar, Jean W., East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, 1000-1500, University of Washington Press, 1994. * Stavrianos, L.
