He was also drafted as a shortstop by baseball's St. Louis Cardinals in the 25th round of the 1973 MLB Draft. Jauron chose the NFL. He started at free safety as a rookie for the Lions. He was named to the 1975 Pro Bowl in his second season after leading the NFC in punt return average. Jauron played with the Lions for five seasons (1973-1977) and the Cincinnati Bengals for three seasons (1978-1980). He finished his playing career with 25 interceptions and two touchdowns. ==Coaching career== ===National Football League=== ====Assistant coach==== Jauron began his coaching career in the NFL in 1985 as the Buffalo Bills defensive backs coach. He was offered the position by Bills defensive coordinator Hank Bullough, who was the Bengals defensive coordinator when Jauron was a player. After one season with the Bills, Jauron was named the defensive backs coach for the Green Bay Packers. He worked with the team for eight seasons, serving under three different head coaches: Forrest Gregg, Lindy Infante, and Mike Holmgren. Jauron became the defensive coordinator for the expansion Jacksonville Jaguars in 1995 at the invitation of then-Jaguars head coach Tom Coughlin, whom he coached with at Green Bay. The Jaguars made the playoffs in three of Jauron's four seasons with the team, including an appearance in the 1996 AFC Championship Game. Following his first head-coaching job, Jauron served as the defensive coordinator for the Detroit Lions in 2004 and the first 11 games of the 2005 season before being named the team's interim head coach. ====Chicago Bears==== Jauron became the 12th head coach in Chicago Bears history on January 23, 1999, when he was hired to replace Dave Wannstedt, who was fired after two consecutive 4-12 seasons. Jauron coached the Bears for five seasons (1999-2003), finishing with a 35-45 regular season record and one playoff appearance. In his first two seasons, the Bears finished last in the NFC Central with 6-10 and 5-11 records. Jauron, however, led the greatest turnaround in team history during his third season. In their 13\u20133 2001 campaign, Chicago finished 8\u20130 in games decided by seven points or less, including back-to-back overtime victories. Jauron was named the 2001 AP Coach of the Year and became the third coach in team history to record at least 13 wins in a season, joining George Halas and Mike Ditka, and eventually joined by his successor Lovie Smith. Former Bears head coach Lovie Smith joined that group following the Bears' 13-3 regular season in 2006. After earning their first division title in 11 years, however, Chicago lost a home game to the Philadelphia Eagles, 33\u201319, in the NFC Divisional Playoffs. The Bears did not return to the playoffs under Jauron, finishing 4\u201312 and 7\u20139 in his last two seasons with the team. He was fired by the Bears after the 2003 season and replaced by Lovie Smith. ====Detroit Lions==== Jauron was then hired by the Detroit Lions as a defensive coordinator. He was promoted to interim head coach of the Lions on November 28, 2005, after the mid-season firing of Steve Mariucci. Detroit was 4\u20137 when Jauron took over and won only one of their last five games, finishing the season 5\u201311. Although Jauron was one of many candidates who interviewed for the head coaching position after the season, he was passed over for Rod Marinelli. ====Buffalo Bills==== Jauron was named the 14th head coach in Buffalo Bills history on January 23, 2006, following the resignation of Mike Mularkey. He led the Bills to three consecutive 7\u20139 records, finishing respectively third, second and fourth in the AFC East. In 2008 the team started 5\u20131, but ended the season on a 2\u20138 skid. Bills owner Ralph Wilson announced on December 30, 2008, that Jauron would be brought back for the 2009 season despite the expiration of his three-year contract. On the morning of Friday, September 4, 2009, Jauron fired his offensive coordinator, Turk Schonert, in a morning meeting before the regular season began. Two different viewpoints emerged, Jauron stating in a press conference the reason for his firing was a \"lack of productivity\", while Schonert claimed that Jauron told him that he \"had too many formations, too many plays\", and that he \"didn't simplify it to his liking.\" Schonert was replaced the same day by former Buffalo Bills quarterback and then quarterbacks coach Alex Van Pelt. After taking over, Van Pelt brought back the no-huddle offense, in the form of Jim Kelly's \"K-Gun\" offense that led the team to four straight Super Bowl appearances in the 1990s. On November 17, 2009, Jauron was fired by the Bills. ====Philadelphia Eagles==== On February 2, 2010, Jauron was hired by the Philadelphia Eagles as a senior assistant and defensive backs coach. ====Cleveland Browns==== On January 21, 2011, Jauron was named defensive coordinator by the Cleveland Browns. He replaced Rob Ryan, who then became defensive coordinator for the Dallas Cowboys. On January 18, 2013, newly hired head coach Rob Chudzinski hired Ray Horton instead of keeping Jauron.http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1490986-cleveland-browns-hire-ray- horton-to-be-new-defensive-coordinator ===Head coaching record=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"|Team !! rowspan=\"2\"|Year !! colspan=\"5\"|Regular season !! colspan=\"4\"|Postseason |- !Won!!Lost!!Ties!!Win %!!Finish!!
