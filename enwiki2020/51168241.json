Magnusson was Director- General of the Swedish National Defence Research Institute (FOA) from 1968 to 1974 and was one of the prominent figures of the Swedish nuclear weapons program. ==Career== Magnusson was born in Vreta Kloster parish, \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland County, Sweden, the son of station master Carl Magnusson and his wife Signe (n\u00e9e Samuelsson).

He was administrative director from 1941 to 1944 and prefect from 1944 to 1945 at the Military Physics Institute. The institute became the National Defence Research Institute (FOA) in 1945 with Magnusson as head of the department (FOA 2; general physics 1945\u201358 and FOA 4; nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry 1958\u201368) from 1945 to 1968. In 1945, Magnusson was given the task by the board of FOA to investigate what was known about the nuclear device that was recently dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was the start of the Swedish nuclear research. Magnusson became Director-General of FOA in 1968, a position he held until 1974. Magnusson was a member of the Swedish National Committee for Physics (Svenska nationalkommitt\u00e9n f\u00f6r fysik) from 1946 to 1970 and a member of the Atom Committee (Atomkommitt\u00e9n) from 1952. He was also a member of the Swedish Atomic Research Council (Statens r\u00e5d f\u00f6r atomforskning) from 1952 to 1965 and a delegate in atomic energy issues from 1956 to 1974 as well as in the Data Processing Delegation (Databehandlingsdelegationen) from 1966. He was a board member of the Defence Materiel Administration from 1968 to 1974, AB Atomenergi from 1969 to 1975 and the National Swedish Nuclear Power Inspection Board (Statens k\u00e4rnkraftinspektion) from 1974 to 1978. Magnusson became a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of War Sciences in 1949 and the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences in 1957 and honorary member of the Royal Swedish Society of Naval Sciences in 1971. ==Personal life== In 1933, Magnusson married Wera Ericsson (1908\u20132003), the daughter of office clerk Erik Ericsson and Emilia Johansson. He was the father of Bo (born 1938), Gunnel (born 1940), G\u00f6ran (born 1942) and Hans (born 1944).
