    "text": "Gettysburg was a town near the mouth of the Lyre River at the Strait of Juan de Fuca in Clallam County, in the U.S. state of Washington. The community was named after Robert N. Getty, a businessperson in the lumber industry. The 30-year-old Getty settled in the area in 1887 and built several structures that served a local logging boom. A post office called Gettysburgh was established in 1890, and remained in operation until 1926. A postmaster of Gettysburg, Ida M. Simmons, was in 1912 convicted of embezzling $814 from the government and served a \"unique\" sentence of one hour in prison. Gettysburg had a steamboat connection to Puget Sound cities. By 1976 it was reported that nothing had remained of the town except its name. ==References== ==External links== * * Gettysburg - Washington Ghost Town Category:Ghost towns in Washington (state) Category:Geography of Clallam County, Washington ",
