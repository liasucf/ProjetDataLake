    "text": "Hull York Medical School (HYMS) is a medical school in England which took its first intake of students in 2003. The school was opened as a part of the British Government's attempts to train more doctors, which also saw Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Peninsula Medical School and University of East Anglia Medical School open their doors. ==History== The early history of medical education in Hull and York goes back to the three following institutions: Hull Medical School (1831), York Medical Society (1832) and the York Medical School (1834). Notable doctors associated with the York school included John Hughlings Jackson (in whose honour the modern medical school building at the University of York is named), Daniel Hack Tuke, Thomas Laycock (physiologist), James Atkinson (surgeon), and Sir Jonathan Hutchinson. It is thought that the York school closed in the 1860s. The founding of a medical school as part of the University of Hull was considered in the Report of the Royal Commission on Medical Education 1965\u201368 (Todd Report) (published 1968), but the idea was thought not to be viable until the Humber Bridge was completed, as this would enable students to travel to placements in South Lincolnshire. ==Teaching== Allam Medical Building, Hull York Medical School, University of Hull campus The medical school has 156 places for 2018 and receives around 1,200 applications each year. Of the successful applicants each year, half are based at the University of Hull and the other half are based at the University of York for the first two years of their course. In 2017, the medical school was ranked 17th in the UK by The Guardian University Subject Guide and 17th by the Complete University Guide 2018. For 2019 these rankings fell to 30th and 26th respectively. applicants are required to sit the UCAT admissions test. Students spend the two years in phase one at their academic bases (either Hull or York). Phase two consists of rotation around York, Hull, Scunthorpe, Grimsby and Scarborough. In the final year of the course (phase three), students essentially take on the role of a 'junior' pre- registration house officer and are also able to carry out an 'elective' period overseas. This is a common feature in most UK medical curricula. The school's first international students began their studies in September 2006.
