    "text": "WOXY.com logo WOXY.com was a modern rock internet radio station based in Oxford, Ohio, and later Austin, Texas. WOXY.com relied mainly on its own website to reach its listeners. WOXY.com programming at one time was also available at lala.com and WVXU HD Radio. Originally transmitted solely from WOXY (FM) at 97.7 FM in Oxford, Ohio, the station went by the 97X moniker as well as the tag line \"the future of rock and roll.\" In 2004, WOXY became one of the first commercial radio stations in the United States to completely transition from terrestrial FM radio to broadcasting solely as an Internet radio station at WOXY.com. The station moved its studios from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Austin in 2009. In 2010, due to financial challenges, the station ended its online feed.Bishop, Lauren. WOXY.com shutting down, The Cincinnati Enquirer. March 23, 2010. On November 23, 2011, the station's remaining WOXY.com website and discussion forums were taken offline by owner Future Sounds. ==97X (1983\u20132004)== ===The birth of 97X=== Classic 97X logo In 1981 the station was purchased by Doug and Linda Balogh for $375,000. Soon after the station adopted the moniker \"97X.\" Based on feedback from focus groups of college students, the station switched to a modern rock format in September 1983, reportedly the sixth modern rock station in the country. The station benefited from a large youthful audience at adjacent Miami University as well as listeners in urban and suburban areas of Cincinnati and Dayton, but the majority of its broadcast area was rural.Bishop, Lauren. \"97X took flight from humble start\" The Cincinnati Enquirer April 30, 2004 WOXY's tagline, \"97X, Bam! The future of rock and roll,\" was quoted by Dustin Hoffman's character Raymond Babbitt in the 1988 film Rain Man. In 1988, Cincinnati magazine named 97X the best \"cutting edge\" radio station in the Cincinnati area. WOXY placed in the Rolling Stone reader's poll \"best radio station\" category four times between 1990 and 1995. Rolling Stone also recognized WOXY as one of ten \"stations that don't suck\" in 1998 and one of four \"last great independent\" radio stations in 2003.Bishop, Lauren. \"97X farewell\" The Cincinnati Enquirer May 10, 2004 ===Webcast (1998\u20132010)=== In 1998, WOXY began to experiment with webcasts, and listeners tuned in from around the world; the Internet listenership continued to grow. The station continued to broadcast online while building a website with message boards and information to create a community of modern rock. The station was also one of a number of stations offered in the Internet radio section of iTunes. ===End of FM broadcast=== In January 2004, the Baloghs sold the license to 97.7 FM to Dallas, Texas-based First Broadcasting Investment Partners for $5.6 million but retained the station's music library and 97X brand with the intention of continuing broadcasting as internet-only WOXY.com. 97X ended its terrestrial broadcasting on 97.7 FM on May 13, 2004.Eckberg, John. \"97X web station returns, thanks to pair of investors\", The Cincinnati Enquirer, June 17, 2004. The future of \"The Future of Rock and Roll\" was to be on the Internet, broadcasting exclusively from the WOXY.com website. The staff committed to staying with the WOXY.com venture worked feverishly over the following five months to secure funding and advertisers for what was at the time an unheard of business venture; an Internet-only commercial radio station. However, appropriate funding for the transition did not initially appear, so the station was forced to shut down operations on Thursday, May 13, 2004 and terminate its broadcast, not only via its 97.7 FM transmission, but also via WOXY.com. ==WOXY.com (2004\u20132010)== ===Background=== One day after 97X left the FM airwaves, on Friday, May 14, 2004, representatives of anonymous angel investors contacted the station staff, intent on funding the WOXY.com venture. After two months of legalities, on July 12, 2004, \"The Future of Rock and Roll\" resumed its WOXY.com broadcast. As a subtle nod to its 1983 FM debut (\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" by the Irish band U2), the first song played on the resumed WOXY.com broadcast was \"Orpheus\" by the Irish alternative rock band Ash. Because of the nature of the 97.7 FM sale to First Broadcasting out of Texas, \"The Future of Rock & Roll\" was able to continue broadcasting from the Oxford, Ohio building until a more touring musician friendly location could be found. In September 2004, WOXY.com operations were relocated to Cincinnati's Longworth Hall, a building at the intersection of three interstate highways and close to multiple concert venues. ===Publicity=== To herald its return to broadcasting, \"The Future of Rock & Roll\" relied on a viral campaign to be carried out by its loyal listeners. WOXY provided via its website, avatars, banners, buttons, PDF files, etc., all with the intention of getting the word out; \"The Future of Rock & Roll\" is back! The station also purchased some well placed ads in music oriented magazines. ===Programming=== The internet definitely allowed for more programming avenues and outlets than standard FM radio ever did. \"The Future of Rock and Roll\" continued to find innovative ways to program the station. *BAM! Modern Rock: Even with a new engine driving the music, \"The Future of Rock and Roll\" remained true to its roots; real DJs programming the music they choose from the Modern Rock library they have been building upon since the beginning. *WOXY Lounge Acts *WOXY Vintage: In 2005, \"The Future of Rock & Roll\" also looked fondly towards their past and launched a secondary stream of audio, WOXY Vintage.

Early \"Friends Of The Futurist\" episodes were broadcast under the original name, \"The Blogger Hour\". *The Waiting Room: An eclectic mix of folk and acoustic tunes from around the globe, hosted by \"one half of Drunk Country & The Woman of The House\", still presently alive on AndHow.FM from Mangaroa, New Zealand. ====Commercial ==== Most closely resembling the FM 'Future of Rock and Roll', WOXY.com, or WOXY (wox-IE) as it came to be known, sold banner ads on the pages of WOXY.com along with advertised sponsorship of some its mainstay programming to cover costs.

Accepting that their investor money was eroding faster than they hoped, \"The Future of Rock & Roll\" tried a new approach. ====Subscription-based ==== On February 6, 2006, WOXY.com announced it would be moving to a subscriber-based model.

Despite popularity with listeners, the station's capital was running out, and the costs to operate far exceeded any income from subscriptions, fund raising, or from Internet advertising.
