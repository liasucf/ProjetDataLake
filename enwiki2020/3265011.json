The rural district was formed by the Local Government Act 1894 from the part of the Stamford rural sanitary district in Rutland. At the same time, the remainder of Stamford RSD, which lay in Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire and the Soke of Peterborough became Uffington Rural District, Easton on the Hill Rural District and Barnack Rural District respectively.F A Youngs Jr., Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Vol II: Northern England, London, 1991 The rural district council's offices remained in Stamford, Lincolnshire, outside the district.
