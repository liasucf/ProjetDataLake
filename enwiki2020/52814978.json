    "text": "Old Chapel Hall, also known as Alumni Hall, is a historic building located on the campus of the University of Dubuque in Dubuque, Iowa, United States. The school started as a German Presbyterian Seminary in 1852. A period of expansion between 1904 and 1922 saw the institution become a liberal arts college called the Dubuque German College and Seminary. with This building was part of that expansion. Steffens Hall (no longer extant) was completed in 1907, and became the first building on the school's new campus. The chapel was added onto the rear of that building later the same year. It was a gift of the Frank Peters family from St. Louis. The red brick Gothic Revival structure features stone trim, paired lancet windows, a rose window, and a small open bell tower above the entrance. Religious services were held here until 1980 when Blades Chapel was completed. As part of that project Steffens Hall was torn down, except for the front arcade and porch, which makes the old chapel the oldest building on campus. A courtyard was created where the old building stood directly in front of the old chapel. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. ==References== Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1907 Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Iowa Category:University of Dubuque Category:Buildings and structures in Dubuque, Iowa Category:National Register of Historic Places in Dubuque, Iowa Category:Properties of religious function on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa Category:University and college buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa ",
