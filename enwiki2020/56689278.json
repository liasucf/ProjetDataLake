    "text": "Life, Liberty & Levin is an American political talk show hosted by conservative media personality Mark Levin and broadcast by Fox News. It premiered on February 25, 2018. Each week features an interview with a different guest for the full hour. In November 2017, Fox News announced that it had signed Levin for a weekend talk show to air on Sunday nights, beginning in February of 2018. The program explores \"the fundamental values and principles undergirding American society, culture, politics, and current events, and their relevance to the nation's future and everyday lives of citizens.\" Although most episodes have guests in-studio, Levin conducted interviews via video chat during the COVID-19 pandemic. Levin resumed in- person interviews on August 2, 2020, when he hosted Sean Hannity. == Episode list == {| class=\"toccolours\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse\" style=\"width:100%; text-align: center;\" |- style=\"text-align: center; background-color:#9DA8A2\" !style=\"width:10em;\"|Date !style=\"width:20em;\"|Guests |Description |- | 2018-02-25 | Walter E.
