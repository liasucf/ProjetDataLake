    "text": "Burning My Travels Clean is an album by Rocky Votolato. It was released on April 16, 2002 by the independent label Second Nature Recordings. The album incorporates a number of folk elements (the predominance of acoustic guitar, the use of fiddle, and lyrics centered on the loneliness or isolation of the singer and his impoverished background), but also contains clear strains of rock music. The major themes of the album include his relationship with his wife and his dedication to music. The album received very little press upon its release, going unmentioned by both the independent and mainstream music critic publications. ==Track listing== All tracks by Rocky Votolato # \"Crabtree And Evelyn\" \u2013 4:06 # \"Holding Onto Water\" \u2013 3:47 # \"October\" \u2013 3:03 # \"Like Silver\" \u2013 4:03 # \"Without Eyes Still Seeing\" \u2013 1:58 # \"Don't Walk Out On Me\" \u2013 4:27 # \"Treasure Chest\" \u2013 4:07 # \"Swallowing Swords\" \u2013 2:51 # \"Like A Mother\" \u2013 3:32 # \"Deep In The Earth\" \u2013 4:42 # \"I Remember Music\" \u2013 4:13 == Personnel == * Matt Bayles \u2013 Producer, Engineer * Ed Brooks \u2013 Mastering * Dan Dean \u2013 Drums, Art Direction, Design * Jeff Lopez \u2013 Photography * James Mendenhall \u2013 Piano * Kevin Suggs \u2013 Pedal Steel * Rosanne Thomas \u2013 Vocals (background) * Troy Tietjen \u2013 Assistant Engineer * Cody Votolato \u2013 Guitar (Electric) * Rocky Votolato \u2013 Guitar, Vocals * Seth Warren \u2013 Violin Category:2002 albums Category:Rocky Votolato albums ",
