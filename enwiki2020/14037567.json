    "text": "The Temporary Coordinating Commission of Confederated Independence Parties (, KTSSN) formed on 10 November 1912 in the Austrian Partition on the eve of World War One. It was an alliance of Polish political parties from Galicia in Austro-Hungary and their paramilitary wings existing in the form of legal Riflemen's Associations. Created in Vienna, KTSSN was later renamed as Komisja Skonfederowanych Stronnictw Niepodleg\u0142o\u015bciowych (KSSN, or the Commission of Confederated Independence Parties). On 1 December 1912 KTSSN chose J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski to head its military arm, based on Riflemen's Association (\"Strzelec\"). Its goal was to coordinate the pro-Polish independence activities and support Austro-Hungary in the expected war. In case of the war its aim was to create a unified government for the territories liberated from the Russian partition of Poland. It was created by the following parties: Polish Socialist Party, Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia, Zwi\u0105zek Patriot\u00f3w, Zwi\u0105zek Ch\u0142opski, Narodowy Zwi\u0105zek Ch\u0142opski, Polish People's Party (after 1913 PSL Lewica), National Workers' Union (until May 1914), Zwi\u0105zek Niepodleg\u0142o\u015bci (from May 1914 known as Organizacja Niepodleg\u0142o\u015bciowa Inteligencji). Its main activists were: J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, Ignacy Daszy\u0144ski, Witold Jodko-Narkiewicz, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski, Walery S\u0142awek, Hipolit \u015aliwi\u0144ski, and Leon Wasilewski. Commeettee's ties with the Austrian government and Anti- Russian policies were unpopular. In May 1914 KSSN some of the parties left KSSN; Riflemen's Association \"Strzelec\" also withdrew its support. On 16 August 1914 KSSN was replaced by the interim government of the re-emerging sovereign Poland, the Supreme National Committee (Naczelny Komitet Narodowy). ==Notes and references== Category:1912 establishments in Austria-Hungary Category:1914 disestablishments in Austria-Hungary Category:Political history of Poland Category:Polish independence organisations Category:Organizations established in 1912 Category:Organizations disestablished in 1914 ",
