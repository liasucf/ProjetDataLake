    "text": "George Edward Marston (19 March 1882 \u2013 22 November 1940) was an English artist who twice accompanied Sir Ernest Shackleton on expeditions to Antarctic, first from 1907\u201309 on the Nimrod expedition, and then later from 1914\u201317 on the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, which ended with the crew being marooned on Elephant Island. ==Early life== George Marston was born in Southsea (Portsmouth, England).http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world- records/england-and-wales- births-1837-2006?firstname=george&lastname;=marston&eventyear;=1882&eventyear;_offset=0&eventquarter;=2 He studied art at Regent Street Polytechnic (now the University of Westminster). ==Nimrod expedition== Marston was friends with two of Shackleton's sisters, and it was them that encouraged Martson to apply to join their brother's expedition to Antarctica aboard the Nimrod. During the Nimrod expedition, George helped to print the book Aurora Australis whilst stationed on Antarctica during the winter, contributing sketching and lithographs. ==Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition== George was one of the first members to sign up for this expedition, and one of the few to have worked alongside Shackleton before. Marston tended to be somewhat of a procrasinator when needed for necessary duties during the expedition, though he was liked for the most part by the crew. He would often yearn for his wife and children back home, which caused him to be rather moody. Because of these things, over the course of the journey Shackleton grew to dislike Marston.Lansing. pp. 50-51 While marooned on Elephant Island, some of Marston's oil paints were used to caulk the boat used by Shackleton to reach South Georgia. Some watercolours and oil paintings by Marston of the expedition (many painted on return from sketches) are held at the Scott Polar Research Institute. ==Burial== Marston is buried in the cemetery of St Bartholomew's at East Lyng, Somerset, England. http://www.gravestonephotos.com/public/gravedetails.php?grave=364597&scrwidth;=1258 ==References== == External links == * * * Category:19th-century English painters Category:19th-century male artists Category:20th-century English painters Category:1882 births Category:1940 deaths Category:Alumni of the Regent Street Polytechnic Category:English polar explorers Category:Explorers of Antarctica Category:Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition Category:People from Southsea ",
