    "text": "The next Madrilenian regional election will be held no later than Sunday, 28 May 2023, to elect the 12th Assembly of the Community of Madrid. All 132 seats in the Assembly will be up for election. ==Overview== ===Electoral system=== The Assembly of Madrid is the devolved, unicameral legislature of the autonomous community of Madrid, having legislative power in regional matters as defined by the Spanish Constitution and the Madrilenian Statute of Autonomy, as well as the ability to vote confidence in or withdraw it from a regional president. Voting for the Assembly is on the basis of universal suffrage, which comprises all nationals over eighteen, registered in the Community of Madrid and in full enjoyment of their political rights. Additionally, Madrilenians abroad are required to apply for voting before being permitted to vote, a system known as \"begged\" or expat vote (). All members of the Assembly of Madrid are elected using the D'Hondt method and a closed list proportional representation, with a threshold of five percent of valid votes\u2014which includes blank ballots\u2014being applied regionally. Parties not reaching the threshold are not taken into consideration for seat distribution. The Assembly is entitled to one member per each 50,000 inhabitants or fraction greater than 25,000. ===Election date=== The term of the Assembly of Madrid expires four years after the date of its previous election. Elections to the Assembly are fixed for the fourth Sunday of May every four years. The previous election was held on 26 May 2019, setting the election date for the Assembly on Sunday, 28 May 2023. The president has the prerogative to dissolve the Assembly of Madrid and call a snap election, provided that no motion of no confidence is in process, no nationwide election is due and some time requirements are met: namely, that dissolution does not occur either during the first legislative session or within the legislature's last year ahead of its scheduled expiry, nor before one year has elapsed since a previous dissolution. In the event of an investiture process failing to elect a regional president within a two-month period from the first ballot, the Assembly shall be automatically dissolved and a fresh election called. Any snap election held as a result of these circumstances will not alter the period to the next ordinary election, with elected deputies merely serving out what remains of their four-year terms. Throughout 2020, as a result of both the growing divisions between the two governing coalition partners and the perceived likelihood of a motion of no confidence being tabled by the opposition over D\u00edaz Ayuso's perceived mismanagement of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Community of Madrid, Ayuso considered calling a snap election in the region. A first attempt was reportedly aborted by her party's national leadership in June 2020, but in September it was reported that Ayuso intended for a regional election in Madrid to be held concurrently with the announced Catalan regional election by Catalan president Quim Torra, tentatively scheduled for some point in late 2020 or early 2021. Ayuso herself seemed to cast off such rumours through her Twitter account. ==Parliamentary status== The table below shows the status of the different parliamentary groups in the Assembly at the present time. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:96%; text- align:left;\" |+ Current parliamentary composition |- ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Groups ! rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Parties ! colspan=\"2\"| Legislators |- !

Parties and federations intending to form a coalition ahead of an election are required to inform the relevant Electoral Commission within ten days of the election call, whereas groupings of electors need to secure the signature of at least 0.5 percent of the electorate in the Community of Madrid, disallowing electors from signing for more than one list of candidates. Below is a list of the main parties and electoral alliances which will likely contest the election: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"line- height:1.35em; font-size:95%; text-align:left;\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"| Candidacy ! rowspan=\"2\"| Parties and alliances ! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"| Leading candidate ! rowspan=\"2\"| Ideology ! colspan=\"2\"| Previous result ! rowspan=\"2\"| ! rowspan=\"2\"| |- !

Where the fieldwork dates are unknown, the date of publication is given instead. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed with its background shaded in the leading party's colour. If a tie ensues, this is applied to the figures with the highest percentages. The \"Lead\" column on the right shows the percentage- point difference between the parties with the highest percentages in a given poll. When available, seat projections are also displayed below the voting estimates in a smaller font. 67 seats are required for an absolute majority in the Assembly of Madrid. {| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"text- align:center; font-size:95%; line-height:16px;\" |- style=\"height:42px; background-color:#E9E9E9\" ! style=\"width:250px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Polling firm/Commissioner ! style=\"width:125px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Fieldwork date ! style=\"width:50px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Sample size ! style=\"width:45px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Turnout ! style=\"width:35px;\"| PSOE ! style=\"width:35px;\"| PP ! style=\"width:35px;\"| Cs ! style=\"width:35px;\"| link=M\u00e1s Madrid ! style=\"width:35px;\"| Vox ! style=\"width:35px;\"| link=Unidas Podemos ! style=\"width:30px;\" rowspan=\"2\"| Lead |- ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| ! style=\"background:;\"| |- | SocioM\u00e9trica/El Espa\u00f1ol | 15\u201317 Oct 2020 | 1,310 |? | 25.9 | | 26.8 | 12.3 | 13.1 | 14.8 | 5.2 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 0.9 |- | Hamalgama M\u00e9trica/OKDiario | 9\u201312 Oct 2020 | 1,000 | 60.8 | 26.5 | | 32.8 | 10.3 | 12.4 | 10.2 | 5.6 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 6.3 |- | NC Report/La Raz\u00f3n | 5\u201310 Oct 2020 | 1,000 | 58.6 | 26.9 | | 33.1 | 12.3 | 12.1 | 8.7 | 5.4 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 6.2 |- | ElectoPanel/Electoman\u00eda | 1\u20139 Oct 2020 | 650 |? | 28.5 | | 33.7 | 9.2 | 12.7 | 9.1 | 5.1 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 5.2 |- | DYM/20 minutos | 5\u20137 Oct 2020 |? |? | | 28.5 | 24.3 | 13.9 | 14.0 | 12.7 | 5.1 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 4.2 |- | SyM Consulting | 2\u20134 Oct 2020 | 1,319 | 71.0 | 25.0 | | 27.7 | 9.1 | 14.2 | 16.2 | 5.8 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 2.7 |- | ElectoPanel/Electoman\u00eda | 2 Oct 2020 | 2,120 |? | 28.4 | | 33.4 | 10.0 | 10.8 | 9.8 | 6.5 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 5.0 |- | NC Report/La Raz\u00f3n | 8\u201312 Sep 2020 | 1,000 | 59.2 | 27.4 | | 28.4 | 14.0 | 13.0 | 9.4 | 5.9 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 1.0 |- | ElectoPanel/Electoman\u00eda | 31 Aug 2020 |? |? | 28.6 | | 30.9 | 11.3 | 9.5 | 10.9 | 7.2 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 2.3 |- | Sigma Dos/Telemadrid | 19\u201322 Jun 2020 | 1,600 |? | 29.5 | | 31.9 | 10.8 | 10.3 | 8.4 | 7.8 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 2.4 |- | ElectoPanel/Electoman\u00eda | 1 Apr\u201315 May 2020 |? |? | 28.5 | | 32.3 | 10.2 | 6.5 | 10.2 | 10.5 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 3.8 |- | Hamalgama M\u00e9trica/OKDiario | 8\u201311 May 2020 | 1,000 |? | 27.4 | | 29.9 | 13.9 | 10.8 | 9.8 | 6.6 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 2.5 |- | GAD3/ABC | 24\u201329 Apr 2020 | 1,006 |? | 27.9 | | 41.1 | 7.6 | 6.6 | 7.7 | 6.4 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 13.2 |- | SyM Consulting | 20\u201323 Apr 2020 | 1,236 | 74.4 | 24.7 | | 27.3 | 12.3 | 8.9 | 14.9 | 10.0 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 2.6 |- | ElectoPanel/Electoman\u00eda | 26\u201331 Mar 2020 | 800 |? | | 30.3 | 26.0 | 11.3 | 4.3 | 11.8 | 14.4 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 4.3 |- style=\"background:#EFEFEF;\" | November 2019 general election | 10 Nov 2019 | | 70.6 | | 26.9 | 24.9 | 9.1 | 5.7 | 18.3 | 13.0 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 2.0 |- | Celeste-Tel | 22\u201326 Jul 2019 | 1,000 | 65.0 | | 28.3 | 23.7 | 20.1 | 14.1 | 7.6 | 4.8 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 4.6 |- | NC Report/La Raz\u00f3n | 9\u201313 Jul 2019 | 900 | 60.7 | | 27.8 | 26.0 | 17.7 | 14.2 | 7.1 | 5.1 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 1.8 |- | colspan=\"11\" style=\"background:#A0A0A0\"| |- style=\"background:#EFEFEF;\" | 2019 regional election | 26 May 2019 | | 64.3 | | 27.3 | 22.2 | 19.4 | 14.7 | 8.9 | 5.6 | style=\"background:; color:white;\"| 5.1 |- | colspan=\"11\" style=\"background:#A0A0A0\"| |} ==References== ;Opinion poll sources ;Other Madrid 2020s ",
