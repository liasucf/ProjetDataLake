It formed the government after the 2015 election, with the member parties having worked together to win 7 of the 11 available seats in the National Assembly. Following the 2020 election, Team Unity increased its representation to 9 seats, winning a majority again and allowing it to form a government. ==Member parties== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
