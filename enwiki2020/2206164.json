    "text": "Wellington Cup race in New Zealand The racing of Thoroughbred horses (or gallopers, as they are also known) is a popular gaming and spectator sport and industry in New Zealand. ==History== Thoroughbred horse racing commenced soon after European settlement. The first totalisator machine in the world was installed at Ellerslie Racecourse in 1913, see Sir George Julius). Thoroughbred racing with the associated aspects such as horse breeding, training and care, race betting, race-day management and entertainment has gradually developed into an industry worth billions of dollars. The governing body is the New Zealand Thoroughbred Racing Incorporated. ==Race clubs and courses of New Zealand== Thoroughbred racing is held throughout New Zealand, including courses in some of the smaller centres. {| class = \"wikitable sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\"; style=\"border-collapse:collapse; font- size:100%;\" |- bgcolor=\"LightSteelBlue\" align=\"center\" ! width=\"100px\" | Club ! width=\"170px\" | Course, Town/city/province ! width=\"30px\" | Track ! width=\"30px\" | Direction ! width=\"30px\" | Straight ! width=\"150px\" | Notes |- | Ashburton RC || Ashburton, New Zealand || 1876m ||left-handed || 382m || |- | Auckland RC || Ellerslie Racecourse, Auckland || 1876m ||right-handed ||382m|| |- | Avondale JC || Avondale, Auckland || 1800m ||right-handed|| 450m || |- | Banks Peninsula RC|| Motukarara, Canterbury || 1800m ||left-handed ||400m|| |- | Beaumont RC || Wingatui, Dunedin (since 1987) || 2000m|| left- handed ||350m || Part of Gallop South |- | Cambridge RC || Te Rapa, Hamilton || 1800m || left-handed || 420m|| Owns training course/complex at Cambridge |- | Canterbury JC || Riccarton Park, Christchurch || 2400m || left-handed ||400m|| |- | Central Otago RC || Omakau || 1600m ||left-handed|| 300m|| Part of Gallop South |- | Counties RC || Pukekohe Park, Franklin ||1900m ||right- handed ||520m || |- | Dargaville RC || Awakino Point ||1600m ||left-handed || 350m|| 1 meeting per year, in November |- | Egmont RC || Hawera || 1822m||left-handed ||350m || |- | Feilding JC || Awapuni, Palmerston North || 1700m ||left-handed || 350m || Part of RACE |- | Foxton RC || Previously raced at Foxton, Horowhenua ||1811m || left-handed||349m ||Trials only.

Previously Linda Jones was the first to apply for an apprentice's licence and be turned down. She had ridden in a number of lady riders events over many years in New Zealand and overseas such as in Brazil, which highlighted that New Zealand and Australia were outliers in not allowing women to compete with male jockeys in professional races. The first win by a woman in New Zealand was visiting Canadian jockey Joan Phipps, at Te Awamutu in November 1977. Sue Day from Christchurch became the first New Zealand female jockey winner in a totalisator race against males on 22 July 1978 when she won with the Ned Thistoll-trained Jaws in the Waybrook Handicap at Timaru.https://www.horsetalk.co.nz/2018/07/13/sue-historic-day-40-years- racing-milestone/ Other female riders then included Joanne Hale, Vivienne Kaye (Awapuni), Joanne Lamond (Oamaru) and Cherie Saxon (Hastings).https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid;=3541362 Linda Jones' first win was on Big Bickies at Te Rapa and soon after Royal Petite was the first Open Handicap winner for a female jockey. Subsequent highlight wins for Linda were Lovaro in the Queen Elizabeth Handicap and Holy Toledo in the Wellington Derby on 22 January 1979 (possibly the first female jockey world-wide to win a Derby). Linda Jones was also the first female jockey to win a professional race against males at a registered meeting in Australia, winning aboard Pay The Purple in the Labour Day Cup at Doomben, Brisbane on May 7 1979.https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid;=12088993 Although there was resistance from some industry participants, the above female jockeys and those that followed competed with great skill and success. It is fair to say most of the gender-related barriers are now long gone.

In late February 2020 Lisa Allpress was the first female to win a thoroughbred race in Saudi Arabia on the horse Matmon at King Abdullah Aziz racetrack in Riyadh.https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse- racing/articles/238767/jockey-lisa-allpress-makes-history-in-saudi-arabia She was competing in the inaugural International Jockeys Challenge in which she competed with 14 other jockeys including 7 women. She won the very first race in the challange.

As well as those winning major races within New Zealand, locally owned and/or trained horses frequently go to Australia for racing campaigns or permanently due to the higher stake money in that country. Between 1882 and New Zealand- bred horses won Australia's Melbourne Cup 43 times. During the 2008-09 racing season 19 New Zealand-bred Thoroughbreds won 22 Group One races around the world.

On 30 August 2018, the Minister released the report (\"the Messara Report).https://www.dia.govt.nz/vwluResources/Racing-Report- August-2018/$file/Review-of-the-NZ-Racing-Industry-Report.pdf There was considerable media commentary regards the proposed closure of racetracks in smaller centres. During October 2018 feedback on the Messara Review was sought. In November 2018 a summary report of the submissions was compiled.https://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/Files/Racing- Review/$file/Racing-Review-submission-summary-report.pdf On 13 December 2018 the Minister for Racing announced a five-member Ministerial Advisory Committee to inform next steps on the Messara Review. Mr Peters appointed Dean McKenzie as Chair, supported by Committee members Bill Birnie, Liz Dawson, Kristy McDonald and Sir Peter Vela.https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/racing- ministerial-advisory-committee New Zealand Thoroughbred Racing's (NZTR) Venue Plan was released in January 2019. The Report recommended: * reducing the number of thoroughbred race tracks nationally from 48 to 27 by 2030. * racing licences not be allocated to Stratford, Blenheim, Wairoa, Reefton, Hokitika, Waimate, Winton, Dargaville, Thames and Wyndham in the 2019/20 racing season. * the Stratford Racing Club track close and its race meeting be held at the Pukekura Raceway in New Plymouth. Feedback on the document was sought, with nine regional meetings held and 75 written submissions received. NZTR chief executive Bernard Saundry said the NZTR board considered the feedback and decided the Wairoa, Blenheim and Reefton tracks would receive a reprieve, for the 2019\u201320 season at least. On 17 April 2019, the Minister for Racing announced that the New Zealand Government's Cabinet had agreed to the overall intent of the Messara Report and plans to implement reforms through two Bills to amend the Racing Act 2003. The first Bill, planned to be enacted by 1 July 2019, was to begin the process of structural reform and provide financial relief to the industry.https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/next-steps-racing- industry-reform On 20 June 2019 the Racing Reform Bill passed its third reading and final reading in Parliament.https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/racing-reform-bill-passes- third-reading On 5 December 2019 the Minister for Racing introduced the Racing Industry Bill as the Government's final legislative response to the recommendations of the Messara Report.https://www.dia.govt.nz/Racing-review It was reported in the media that the Bill extinguished the freehold property rights of local racing club owners who would be forced to sell their courses, money from any sales would not be used in that community but instead transferred to develop clubs in bigger centres elsewhere. ==See also== * New Zealand Racing Hall of Fame * New Zealand Horse of the Year * Auckland Cup Week * Wellington Racing Club * Glossary of Australian and New Zealand punting * List of Melbourne Cup winners * Thoroughbred racing in Australia * Harness racing in New Zealand ==References== ==External links== * N.Z.
