It is located on the Madam/Hatta Highway (E44) near the Oman\u2013United Arab Emirates border. == Description == A large village which has developed parallel to the E44, Sayh Mudayrah gives its name to a geological fault line linked to the Hatta fault zone. The village, located on an alluvial fan, is rich in soil, mineral and water resources and its fertile land has long encouraged settlement. It sits on a watershed between the east and west coasts of the UAE, which gives rise to the unusual wadi formation at Sinadil, which sees water flowing from the same spot both West towards the Persian Gulf and East towards the Indian Ocean. ==Gallery== File:Mudayrah.jpg|Road sign to Sayh Mudayrah, here given as 'Muzaira\u02bf' == References == Category:Populated places in the Emirate of Ajman Category:Enclaves and exclaves Category:United Arab Emirates geography stubs Category:Oman\u2013United Arab Emirates border crossings ",
