The collection included some five thousand folk materials relating to the Ainu and a further approximately two hundred objects relating to minority groups of the north, including the Nivkh, Uilta, Sami, and Inuit. The institution was also involved in the recording and transmission of Ainu- related intangible cultural heritage. The museum closed to make way for the new National Ainu Museum on 31 March 2018. ==See also== * Nibutani Ainu Culture Museum * Historical Museum of the Saru River * Hakodate City Museum of Northern Peoples ==References== ==External links== * Ainu Museum Category:Museums in Hokkaido Category:Shiraoi, Hokkaido Category:Museums established in 1984 Category:1984 establishments in Japan Category:Museums disestablished in 2018 Category:2018 disestablishments in Japan Category:Ainu Category:Ethnic museums ",
