He was the 12th and final daimy\u014d of Tsu Domain. ==Biography== Takakiyo was born in 1837 as the eldest son of the previous daimy\u014d of Tsu Domain, T\u014dd\u014d Takayuki; his mother was from the Hashimoto clan. In 1863, he was sent to Kyoto as the nominal head of the domain\u2019s forces sent to help suppress pro-sonn\u014d j\u014di rebels during the Tench\u016bgumi Incident. He was awarded with the ceremonial court rank of Captain of the Left Imperial Guards (\u5de6\u8fd1\u885b\u6a29\u5c11\u5c06) by the grateful Emperor K\u014dmei. At the start of the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, the samurai of the domain were divided between factions which supported the Shogunate, and those who supported the concept of K\u014dbu gattai; however, sentiment towards to shogunate was only lukewarm. During the Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi, forces of Tsu Domain initially supported the shogunate, but switched sides in the course of the battle, contributing strongly to the defeat of the pro-shogunate forces. Tsu Domain subsequently contributed forces to other battles of the Boshin War, including the Battle of Hakodate on the side of the new Meiji government. In 1868, Takakiyo was part of the guard to Emperor Meiji in his first pilgrimage to the Ise Grand Shrine. On June 28, 1871, Takayuki officially retired due to ill health, and Takakiyo became domain governor. However, with the abolition of the han system a month later, his position was abolished. His was subsequent granted the kazoku peerage title of hakushaku (count). He predeceased his father at the age of 53 in 1889. ==References== *Himeno, Junichi. \"Encounters With Foreign Photographers: The Introduction and Spread of Photography in Ky\u016bsh\u016b\".
