    "text": "Esquilino is the 15th rione of Rome, identified by the initials R. XV, and is Located within the Municipio I. It is named after the Esquiline Hill, one of the Seven Hills of Rome. Its coat of arms bears two figures: a tree and three green mountains, all on a silver background. It is a very cosmopolitan neighbourhood, with large numbers of immigrants from Asia and North Africa. == History == Esquilino is part of the historic center of Rome, where urbanization developed in ancient times. Along with Palatina, Collina and Suburana, the area was one of the four regiones established by Servius Tullius: until Emperor Augustus adopted a new administrative subdivision of the city, the region included the whole area that is part of the modern rione Monti. The territory of the modern rione Esquilino, however, has always been regarded as the frontier of the inner city. Initially at the edge of the Servian Wall, whose agger was located in the area, during the Imperial age the borough was inserted inside the Aurelian Walls, though remaining marginal in the city context: indeed, according to a probable etymology, the name comes from the Latin word esquiliae, meaning \"suburb\". Up until Augustan age, the area beyond the agger of the republican walls was a huge landfill, while another portion housed a cemetery for slaves and indigent people. Following to the urban reform pursued by Emperor Augustus, the polluted and pestilent areas were interred and the embankment of the ancient walls became a footway. In the area was also created a park, the Gardens of Maecenas, a complex of magnificent gardens which housed a tall tower where, according to Suetonius, Emperor Nero watched Rome burning. Until the late Imperial age, the borough became a favorite location of residential villas, called Horti. During the Middle Ages, the area came into possession of several orders and convents seated near Santa Maria Maggiore. Starting from the 17th century, a number of aristocratic villas were built in the territory of the rione, such as Villa Palombara, that used to house the famous Porta Alchemica which currently stands out in the garden of Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II. A relevant part of the ancient remains has been dismantled after the residential development of the area, starting from 1870, with the construction of new buildings destined to the clerical middle class. == Geography == The rione is located in the eastern part of the center of Rome. It was established in 1921, detaching a portion of Monti. ===Boundaries=== Northward, Esquilino borders with Castro Pretorio (R.

VII), from which is separated by Piazzale Labicano (Porta Maggiore). Southward, the rione borders with Quartiere Tuscolano (Q.
