He founded the town of Florence in Oneida County in 1832 and engaged in the lumber business. He was postmaster of Florence and was a member of the New York State Assembly in 1838.

He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1856 to the Thirty-fifth Congress and was appointed as a member of the metropolitan police commission on January 1, 1857. He was a presidential elector on the Republican tickets in 1860 and 1888, and was the president of the Brooklyn Park Commission from 1860 to 1882, where he was instrumental in securing funding and political support for Brooklyn's Prospect Park.
