    "text": "Usborne Publishing, often called Usborne Books, is a United Kingdom-based publisher of children's books. Founded by Peter Usborne in 1973, Usborne Publishing uses an in-house team of writers, editors and designers. One of its sales channels is Usborne Books at Home, a multi-level marketing operation founded in 1981. == Quicklinks == Quicklinks were first introduced in 2000 as a way to incorporate the internet into modern reading habits. Peter Usborne has been quoted in the trade magazine The Bookseller as saying: \"I initially thought that the internet would kill non-fiction, because teachers would tell children to use the internet to help with homework. But if you key in \u2018castles' [on a search engine], you get 900,000 possible websites. The internet is an inadequate resource for children.\" == See also == * List of UK children's book publishers == References == ==External links== * Official website of Usborne Publishing * Usborne Books at Home Category:Book publishing companies of the United Kingdom Category:Multi-level marketing companies ",
