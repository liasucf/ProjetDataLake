    "text": "Kerry v. Din, 576 U.S. 86 (2015), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court analyzed whether there is a constitutional right to live in the United States with one's spouse and whether procedural due process requires consular officials to give notice of reasons for denying a visa application. In Justice Anthony Kennedy's concurring opinion, the controlling opinion in this case,, slip op. at 1 (2015) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (noting that Justice Scalia's plurality opinion \"is not controlling\"); see also Marks v. United States, (holding that in plurality opinions, the narrowest concurring opinion is the controlling opinion). he wrote that notice requirements \u201c[do] not apply when, as in this case, a visa application is denied due to terrorism or national security concerns.\u201dDin, slip op. at 5-6 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Because the consular officials satisfied notice requirements, there was no need for the Court to address the constitutional question about the right to live with one's spouse.Din, slip op. at 6 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Writing for a plurality of the court, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that there is no constitutional right to live with one\u2019s spouse, and because Din was not denied \u201clife, liberty, or property,\u201d she was not entitled to due process.Din, slip op. at 15 (2015) (plurality opinion). Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a dissenting opinion in which he argued that Din was denied liberty without due process of law, and that there is a fundamental right for spouses to \u201clive together and to raise a family,\u201d which enjoys basic due process protections.Din, slip op. at 1-2 (plurality opinion). In the weeks following the announcement of the Court's decision, some analysts suggested the Justices' opinions in Kerry v. Din would foreshadow the outcome in Obergefell v. Hodges.See, e.g., Kevin Johnson, Opinion Analysis: Limited judicial review of consular officer visa decisions \u2013 foreshadowing the result in the same-sex marriage case? , (Jun. 15, 2015, 5:02 PM); Ruthann Robson, , Does Immigration Marriage Case Foreshadow Same-Sex Marriage Case? (Accessed June 15, 2015); Ian Millhiser, , Justice Scalia Turns Obscure Immigration Case Into A Proxy War Over Marriage Equality (Accessed June 29, 2015). ==Background== ===Immigration and Nationality Act visa requirements=== The Immigration and Nationality Act prohibits non-citizens from entering the United States without a visa.66 Stat. 163, as amended, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq. The Act allows individuals classified as \"immediate relatives\" of those living in the United States to apply for a visa at a United States Embassy or consular office. However, non-citizen \"immediate relatives\" are ineligible for admission into the United States if they provide \"material support to a terrorist organization\" or serve \"as a terrorist organization\u2019s representative.\"Din, slip op. at 2 (plurality opinion) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(3)(B)). ===Kanishka Berashk's visa application=== Fauzia Din arrived to the United States from Afghanistan as a refugee in the year 2000, and she became a naturalized citizen in 2007.Din, slip op. at 2-3 (plurality opinion). In 2006, she married Kanishka Berashk, who was a former civil servant in Afghanistan during the Taliban regime.Din, slip op. at 1, 3 (plurality opinion). Din filed paperwork to classify Berashk as an \"immediate relative,\" and Berashk filed a visa application to gain entry to the United States.Din, slip op. at 3 (plurality opinion). The United States Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan reviewed Berashk's application and conducted an interview but ultimately denied his visa application. A consular official informed Berashk he was ineligible for entry under the portion of the Immigration and Nationality Act that precludes admission for individuals with connections to terrorist organizations, but the official provided no further explanation for this determination. ===Initial legal challenges=== Because Berashk was an unadmitted, non-resident alien, he had no right of entry into the United States and could not challenge his denial of his visa application.Din, slip op. at 1 (plurality opinion) (citing Kleindienst v. Mandel, ). Consequently, Din filed suit in United States District Court, where she claimed the government denied her due process of law by depriving her of her \"constitutional right to live in the United States with her spouse\" and for denying her husband's visa application without adequate explanation. The District Court rejected Din's claims, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that Din had \"a protected liberty interest in marriage that entitled [her] to review of the denial of [her] spouse\u2019s visa.\"Din, slip op. at 1, 3 (plurality opinion) (citing Din v. Kerry, 718 F.3d 856, 860 (9th Cir. 2013)) (internal quotations omitted). The United States appealed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 2, 2014.Kerry v. Din, 135 S.Ct. 44 (2014). ==Judgment of the Court== In his dissenting opinion, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that the constitution protects \"the right of spouses to live together and to raise a family.\"Din, slip op. at 2-3 (Breyer, J., dissenting). In his plurality opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that there is no constitutional right to live in the United States with one's spouse.Din, slip op. at 1 (plurality opinion). He argued that under the Fifth Amendment's due process clause, citizens are only entitled to redress if they are denied \"life, liberty, or property.\" Din, slip op. at 3-4 (plurality opinion) (citing Swarthout v. Cooke, (per curiam)). Because visa applications have not historically been understood as \"life, liberty, or property,\" the denial of a visa application does not implicate Fifth Amendment due process protections.Din, slip op. at 4-5 (plurality opinion). Additionally, Justice Scalia rejected the argument that the denial of the visa application implicated a fundamental liberty interest.Din, slip op. at 6-11 (plurality opinion). Although Justice Scalia conceded that Loving v. Virginia and its progeny \u201cinvok[e] a fundamental right to marriage,\u201d the parties \u201cimplicitly concede that no such right has been infringed in this case.\u201dDin, slip op. at 7, 11\u201315 (plurality opinion). ===Justice Kennedy's concurring opinion=== In Justice Anthony Kennedy's opinion concurring in the judgment, he argued that the Court need not rule upon whether Din has a right to live with her spouse.Din, slip op. at 1-2 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Even if the Court assumed that Din did have a fundamental liberty interest in living with her spouse, \"the notice she received regarding her husband\u2019s visa denial satisfied due process.\"Din, slip op. at 1 (Kennedy, J., concurring). Justice Kennedy concluded that notice requirements \u201c[do] not apply when, as in this case, a visa application is denied due to terrorism or national security concerns.\u201dDin, slip op. at 5-6 Kennedy, J., concurring). ===Justice Breyer's dissenting opinion=== Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a dissent in which he argued that consular officials had denied Din due process by preventing her from living with her husband.Din, slip op. at 2-4 (Breyer, J., dissenting). He wrote that the Supreme Court \"has long recognized, the institution of marriage, which encompasses the right of spouses to live together and to raise a family, is central to human life, requires and enjoys community support, and plays a central role in most individuals\u2019 'orderly pursuit of happiness.'\"Din, slip op. at 2-3 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (citing Meyer v. Nebraska, ). Additionally, Justice Breyer argued that the notice provided to Berashk was inadequate, and was the equivalent of \"telling a criminal defendant only that he is accused of 'breaking the law.'\"Din, slip op. at 7-9 (Breyer, J., dissenting). ==Commentary and analysis== ===Reaction to the Court's decision=== In the weeks following the Court's decision, some analysts criticized the Court's ruling for focusing too much attention on \"social norms\" and not enough attention on the realities of the immigrant experience.See, e.g., Elizabeth Keyes, , Symposium on Kerry v. Din: Another Choiceless Choice (Accessed June 29, 2015). The Los Angeles Times' editorial board criticized the Court for allowing consular officials to deny a visa \"simply by asserting a vague connection to terrorism.\"Los Angeles Times Editorial Board, , The \"Terrorist\" Who Didn't Get A U.S. Visa (June 17, 2015). Others noted that the lack of a majority opinion meant that the case would likely have little precedential value in the future.See, e.g., Chuck Roth, , Symposium on Kerry v. Din: What Is the \"Holding\" of Kerry v. Din? (Accessed June 29, 2015). Because Justice Kennedy was the only Justice to not author a majority opinion from the February sitting, some commentators believed that he was initially assigned the role of writing an opinion for the majority of the Court, but three justices defected sometime after the assignment was made.Josh Blackman, Who Will Write The Remaining Three Opinions Since AMK (Probably) Lost Ayala Majority? (Accessed June 29, 2015). In June 2015, Nina Totenberg reported that Din was in the process of submitting further character evidence about her husband to the State Department so that officials can re-evaluate Berashk's visa application.Nina Totenberg, , High Court Sides With Government On Spousal Visa Denial (Accessed June 29, 2015). ===Speculation about Obergefell v. Hodges=== In light of the case's extensive discussion about fundamental rights associated with marriage, analysts suggested the Justices' views in Kerry v. Din would foreshadow the outcome of Court's upcoming decision in Obergefell v. Hodges.See, e.g., Kevin Johnson, Opinion Analysis: Limited judicial review of consular officer visa decisions \u2013 foreshadowing the result in the same-sex marriage case? , (Jun. 15, 2015, 5:02 PM); Ruthann Robson, , Does Immigration Marriage Case Foreshadow Same-Sex Marriage Case? (Accessed June 15, 2015). Some commentators even described the opinion as a \"proxy war\" for the debate in Obergefell.Ian Millhiser, , Justice Scalia Turns Obscure Immigration Case Into A Proxy War Over Marriage Equality (Accessed June 29, 2015). Other commentators opined that Justice Kennedy's narrow concurrence in Kerry v. Din was evidence he would ultimately write the majority opinion in Obergefell.Nicholas Datlowe, Former Taliban Civil Servant\u2019s Wife Not Entitled to Visa Denial Explanation, 83 1899 (June 16, 2015). When the Court ultimately released its decision in Obergefell, Justice Kennedy was the author of the majority's opinion, while Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Alito, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas all wrote dissenting opinions.Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.S. ___ (2015). == See also == * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 576 *List of United States Supreme Court cases *Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution *Loving v.
