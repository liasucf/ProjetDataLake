    "text": "The Condecoraci\u00f3n \"Miguel Hidalgo\" or Miguel Hidalgo Decoration forms part of the Mexican Honours System. It is the highest award that the United Mexican States can issue its citizens. It is awarded for eminent or distinguished merits; exemplar conduct or life's work; relevant services rendered unto the Nation or to Mankind; or heroic acts. There are very few records of it being awarded. ==Background== The award is named after Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla (1753-1811), Mexican Catholic priest and main leader of the Mexican War of Independence. In 1975, President Luis Echeverr\u00eda signed the decree establishing the Mexican Law of Prizes, Stimuli and Civil Rewards, which lists the awards issued by the Executive Branch of the Government of Mexico and established the Condecoraci\u00f3n \"Miguel Hidalgo\" as the nation's highest award to its own citizens. ==Description== The decoration consists of four classes: *Collar: **For heroic acts, difficult to repeat by a person of exemplary conduct; **For services rendered unto the Nation or to Humanity, of a transcendent and extremely beneficial nature. *Cross: **For eminent merits; **For outstandingly exemplar conduct; **For heroic acts or services rendered which would not merit a collar. *Band: **For distinguished merits; **For conduct so exemplary that it warrants making it public knowledge. *Plaque: **For merits not contemplated by the previous grades. ==Recipients== *Hilario Dur\u00e1n Herreros - Received the Band in 1978 for his contributions to the development of Mexico's Customs Regulations and Administrative Reform.http://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=4701910&fecha;=08/05/1978 *Jes\u00fas Silva Herzog - Received the Collar in 1979 for his contributions to Mexico's academic system y por ser un \"Libertador Econ\u00f3mico\"http://dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=4808284&fecha;=08/05/1979 *Ignacio T.
