    "text": "Ricky Howard Miller (born 13 March 1989) is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker; he last played for Port Vale. Miller spent time in the youth systems at Charlton Athletic and Woking, before making his senior debut with Stamford in September 2006. He went on to have brief spells with Cottesmore Amateurs, Bourne Town, Rothwell Town, Corby Town, Hitchin Town, Fleet Town, Spalding United, Boston United, Cambridge City, Aylesbury, Wealdstone, Hemel Hempstead Town, St Ives Town and Arlesey Town. In his fourth spell with Stamford, at the end of the 2012\u201313 season, he scored the winning goal in the Northern Premier League Division One South play-off final. Miller then found success during his second spell at Boston United, and was named as the Conference North Player of the Year for the 2013\u201314 season after scoring 24 goals in 40 league matches. He signed with Luton Town in June 2014, entering the Football League at the age of 25. Miller was loaned to Dover Athletic for part of the 2014\u201315 season, before joining the club permanently in June 2015. He scored 45 goals in 46 appearances in the 2016\u201317 season and was named as the National League Player of the Year. Miller returned to the Football League after signing a three-year contract with Peterborough United in May 2017. He joined Mansfield Town on loan in January 2018, and was sold on to Port Vale in June 2018. He left Vale 12 months into his two-year deal after his contract was terminated by mutual consent. In December 2015, Miller was found not guilty on assault charges following an incident in April 2015, which caused Luton Town to cancel his contract. He was convicted of drink driving in 2006 and 2009, and convicted of failing to provide a blood sample in June 2018. ==Career== ===Early career=== Born in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, Miller began his career with Charlton Athletic's youth academy. He later joined the Woking youth system, before signing for Stamford in September 2006. Miller made his debut on 19 September as a late substitute in the club's 2\u20131 home defeat to Lincoln United in an FA Cup first qualifying round replay. He joined Leicestershire Senior League Division One team Cottesmore Amateurs on dual terms, scoring twice on his debut, a 6\u20134 away defeat to Ashby Ivanhoe on 23 September. He then linked up with Bourne Town, again on a dual basis, making his debut on 18 October in a 4\u20130 home United Counties League defeat to Boston Town. Miller then agreed dual terms with Rothwell Town, spending the latter half of the season with the club and scoring his first senior hat-trick in their 3\u20130 Southern League Division One Midlands home victory over Bromsgrove Rovers on 6 March 2007. Although offered terms by Stamford for the 2007\u201308 season, Miller instead chose to join Corby Town. He signed for Cambridge City in January 2010, after manager Gary Roberts was impressed with his record of 14 goals for Stamford in the first half of the 2009\u201310 season. Gordon Bartlett signed Miller for Wealdstone in October 2011 to play alongside target man forward Richard Jolly. He won a contract with former club Corby Town in August 2012, after scoring six goals during a pre-season trial. ===Return to Stamford and Boston United=== Miller re-signed for Stamford for a fourth spell during the 2012\u201313 season and scored the winning goal in the play-off final against Chasetown to help the club win promotion to the Northern Premier League Premier Division. He then re-signed for Conference North club Boston United in June 2013, and finished 2013\u201314 with 46 appearances and 28 goals, as the club narrowly missed out on the play-offs with a sixth-place finish. He was named as the Conference North Player of the Year and was also named in the Team of the Year. ===Luton Town=== On 25 June 2014, Miller signed a one-year contract with League Two club Luton Town on a free transfer from Boston. On 2 September 2014, he joined Conference Premier team Dover Athletic on loan, before being recalled just over a month later after scoring five goals in ten appearances. Miller made his debut for Luton the following day in a 2\u20131 away victory over Hartlepool United. He scored his first goal for the club in a 4\u20132 FA Cup victory over Newport County, and this was followed up with his first Football League goal in the following match, a 1\u20130 win at home to Tranmere Rovers. Miller finished the 2014\u201315 season with 15 appearances and two goals for Luton. ===Dover Athletic=== On 30 June 2015, Miller joined Dover Athletic permanently on a two-year contract, following his release by Luton. His first goal for Dover came on 11 August in a 3\u20132 victory over Kidderminster Harriers at the Crabble Athletic Ground. In the space of a week, Miller scored in three consecutive matches in November, before scoring five goals in three matches from December to January. He scored the equaliser in a 1\u20131 draw away to Kidderminster Harriers on 23 April, a result that confirmed Dover's place in the play-offs. Miller played in both legs of Dover's play-off semi-final defeat to Forest Green Rovers, which finished 2\u20131 on aggregate, despite him scoring the opening goal in the second leg to level the tie. He finished the 2015\u201316 season with 22 goals in 54 appearances. Miller made his first appearance of 2016\u201317 on the opening day of the season in a 0\u20130 away draw with Wrexham. In the following match, he scored his first goal of the season with a penalty in the first half, but was sent off four minutes into the second half, as Dover conceded four second-half goals and were beaten 4\u20131 by Boreham Wood. Miller returned to the team for a 4\u20132 away victory over Eastleigh on 16 August, in which he scored Dover's fourth goal, having entered the match as a 78th-minute substitute. He scored a hat-trick for Dover in a 4\u20133 home win over Forest Green Rovers on 10 September, before scoring ten goals in five matches in October, including four goals in a 6\u20131 victory at home to Braintree Town. This was followed by ten goals in seven matches from November to December, which included a hat-trick in a 3\u20132 win away to Solihull Moors. Miller scored two further hat-tricks in wins over Eastleigh and Barrow, and was named as the National League Player of the Year for 2016\u201317, in which he scored 45 goals from 46 appearances. Upon receiving the award, Miller said \"I was hung out to dry by Luton and I lost my home and relationship \u2013 I was ready to quit football. I'm so grateful to the gaffer, Jake, Jim and my team-mates for showing faith in me\". Despite his exploits, Dover narrowly missed out on a play-off place. After the end of the season, he was named as Dover's Player of the Season. ===Peterborough United=== On 3 May 2017, Miller signed for League One club Peterborough United on a three-year contract. A week after signing, chairman Darragh MacAnthony said the club had received a \u00a3250,000 bid for the player before his contract had even officially began. Director of football Barry Fry said he had inquired after Miller in January, but his phone calls were ignored by Dover. However, shortly before his contract was due to begin, Miller was handed a six-match ban by The Football Association for a 'biting incident' relating to his time at Dover Athletic. Miller issued a statement to provide some context for the ban via the Peterborough United website, stating he was being \"held in a headlock\" and resorted to biting as he was \"unable to breathe\". He was transfer-listed after failing to score in his first 13 matches, and MacAnthony said Miller was \"driving me mad\" after turning down moves to five different clubs in favour of a move to a club closer to his home that did not meet Peterborough's valuation. On 31 January 2018, he joined League Two club Mansfield Town on loan until the end of 2017\u201318 season. He scored one goal from eight substitute appearances, as Mansfield finished in eighth place in the table. Upon his return to London Road, Miller was transfer-listed by new manager Steve Evans, who had signed him on loan at Mansfield earlier in the year. ===Port Vale=== On 22 June 2018, Miller signed for League Two club Port Vale on a two-year contract for an undisclosed fee. Manager Neil Aspin had previously tried to sign him at F.C. Halifax Town and Gateshead. He was unable to play in the club's 2018\u201319 pre-season friendlies because of an unresolved disciplinary issue with The Football Association. He scored a goal and won a penalty on his debut on the opening day of the new season on 4 August, helping the \"Valiants\" to record a 3\u20130 victory over Cambridge United at Vale Park. His strike \u2013 a direct free-kick which he also won himself \u2013 was listed in the Daily Mail as the League Two goal of the weekend. However he was dropped after failing to score in the rest of the month, though impressed coach Lee Nogan with his performances off the bench, who said Miller just needed to rebuild his confidence following the goal drought. Aspin then switched to a 3\u20134\u20133 / 5\u20134\u20131 formation, leaving Miller to compete with Ben Whitfield for a place at wide midfield. Miller fell out of first-team contention by November, leaving Aspin to comment that \"you have to be perfectly honest, he has not done the job at the moment that I brought him to do and, like I say, he has to do better.\" He was recalled to the first-team on 19 January, following an injury to Tom Pope, and scored his second league goal for the club to secure a 1\u20130 win at Crawley Town. However he was shown a straight red card in a 1\u20130 home defeat to Carlisle United seven days later. An injury to Pope saw new manager John Askey return Miller to the starting eleven on 9 March, and he doubled his league tally for the season with both Vale goals in a 2\u20131 win over promotion-chasing Mansfield Town; his performance saw him named on the EFL team of the week. He ended the campaign with six goals in 22 starts and 13 substitute appearances. His contract was terminated by mutual consent on 27 June, and the club refused to comment on the reasons behind his departure. Miller wrote on Twitter that he was \"Sorry I didn't fulfill my potential but I've found the last two years very difficult. I hope I leave you with some good memories.\" He later wrote that he suffered a mental breakdown at the club, saying that he \"couldn\u2019t confide in my manager or teammates my only defence mechanism was to act, touch and pretend I didn\u2019t care\". Aldershot Town manager Danny Searle attempted to sign him in January 2020 and again in July 2020. ==Style of play== Miller is a goal scoring striker with a high work-rate, and has been compared to Kevin Phillips by former Luton manager John Still for his ability to capitalize on chances around the box. ==Personal life== Miller was convicted of drink driving in 2006, and again in 2009. On 27 April 2015, Miller and his Luton Town teammate Shaun Whalley were both arrested by Bedfordshire Police in connection with an alleged assault following the club's end of season awards night. Both were released on bail, but were suspended by the club pending a police inquiry. He later had his Luton contract terminated following his arrest. On 3 June 2015, Miller was charged with five offences in connection to the assault. On 8 December 2015, Miller was found not guilty and was cleared of the charges. On 5 November 2017, Miller was arrested and later charged with assaulting a police officer, using threatening behaviour and failing to provide a specimen. On 11 June 2018, the charge of assault was dropped, though he was handed a 42-month driving ban after pleading guilty to failing to provide a blood sample. ==Career statistics== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|FA Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |Boston United |2008\u201309 |Northern Premier League Premier Division |12||6||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||12||6 |- |Cambridge City |2009\u201310 |Southern League Premier Division |2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||1||0||3||0 |- |rowspan=3|Aylesbury |2010\u201311 |Southern League Division One Central |29||12||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||3||0||32||12 |- |2011\u201312 |Southern League Division One Central |5||3||1||1||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||6||4 |- !colspan=2|Total !34!!15!!1!!1!!colspan=2|\u2014!!3!!0!!38!!16 |- |Wealdstone |2011\u201312 |Isthmian League Premier Division |3||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||2||0||5||0 |- |Hemel Hempstead Town (loan) |2011\u201312 |Southern League Premier Division |2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||2||0 |- |Corby Town |2012\u201313 |Conference North |4||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||4||0 |- |Arlesey Town |2012\u201313 |Southern League Premier Division |4||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||2||1||6||1 |- |Boston United |2013\u201314 |Conference North |40||24||2||2||colspan=2|\u2014||4||2||46||28 |- |Luton Town |2014\u201315 |League Two |12||1||3||1||0||0||0||0||15||2 |- |Dover Athletic (loan) |2014\u201315 |Conference Premier |10||5||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||10||5 |- |rowspan=3|Dover Athletic |2015\u201316 |National League |45||20||2||0||colspan=2|\u2014||7||2||54||22 |- |2016\u201317 |National League |41||40||3||4||colspan=2|\u2014||2||1||46||45 |- !colspan=2|Total !96!!65!!5!!4!!colspan=2|\u2014!!9!!3!!110!!72 |- |Peterborough United |2017\u201318 |League One |10||0||1||0||0||0||2||0||13||0 |- |Mansfield Town (loan) |2017\u201318 |League Two |8||1||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||8||1 |- |Port Vale |2018\u201319 |League Two |28||4||1||0||1||0||5||2||35||6 |- !colspan=3|Career total !255!!116!!13!!8!!1!!0!!28!!8!!297!!132 |} ==Honours== Stamford *Northern Premier League Division One South play-offs: 2012\u201313 Individual *Conference North Player of the Year: 2013\u201314 *Conference North Team of the Year: 2013\u201314 *National League Player of the Year: 2016\u201317 *National League Team of the Year: 2016\u201317 *Dover Athletic Player of the Season: 2016\u201317 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:People from Hatfield, Hertfordshire Category:Footballers from Hertfordshire Category:Association football forwards Category:Charlton Athletic F.C. players Category:Woking F.C. players Category:Stamford A.F.C. players Category:Cottesmore Amateurs F.C. players Category:Bourne Town F.C. players Category:Rothwell Town F.C. players Category:Corby Town F.C. players Category:Hitchin Town F.C. players Category:Fleet Town F.C. players Category:Spalding United F.C. players Category:Boston United F.C. players Category:Cambridge City F.C. players Category:Aylesbury F.C. players Category:Wealdstone F.C. players Category:Hemel Hempstead Town F.C. players Category:St Ives Town F.C. players Category:Arlesey Town F.C. players Category:Luton Town F.C. players Category:Dover Athletic F.C. players Category:Peterborough United F.C. players Category:Mansfield Town F.C. players Category:Port Vale F.C. players Category:Northern Premier League players Category:Southern Football League players Category:Isthmian League players Category:National League (English football) players Category:English Football League players ",
