    "text": "Croydon Football Club is an English semi-professional football club based in Croydon, London. Until 2006, they played in the Isthmian League, but lost their place in that league as part of the 2006 re-structuring of non-league football, and now play in the . They play at Croydon Sports Arena in South Norwood. The club was founded in 1953 as Croydon Amateurs. ==History== The club was founded in 1953 as Croydon Amateurs FC and its original players came from some of the stronger clubs playing in local football. The club was specially formed to play at the Croydon Arena (still its home today) when it was officially opened in 1953. The team made its debut at the Arena against Malden Town on Saturday 5 September 1953, winning 4-3. The club spent their first ten years in the Surrey Senior League but whilst failing to win the championship (thrice finishing runners-up), evolved into one of that competition's strongest teams. In 1963\u201364, they joined the Spartan League, winning the league title at the first attempt in their only season in the competition. 1964 saw them join the Athenian League where they spent the next ten years, winning the Second Division title in 1965\u201366, suffering relegation four years later and then gaining two successive promotions to the Premier Division as runners-up to Herne Bay (1970\u201371) and Harlow Town (1971\u201372) under the managership of Jimmy Rose. Rose's departure to Dulwich Hamlet saw a mass player exodus and a season of struggle ensued. 1973 saw the suffix Amateurs dropped due to the impending changes to the status of players and a year later, under the management of Ted Shepherd, election to the expanding Isthmian League. Two seasons later, after an unbeaten 1975\u201376 campaign, the club gained promotion to the Isthmian's top division \u2013 initially titled Division One but then retitled the Premier Division where they spent twelve seasons before relegation to the First Division in 1989. An FA Cup run in the 1979-80 season led to a home draw in the 2nd round to Football League opposition in the shape of Division Three Millwall. The tie was switched to be played at Selhurst Park and in front of almost 10,000 people the Croydon team, captained by Alec Jackson held their League opponents to a 1-1 draw thanks to a Rod Ward goal. The replay three days later could not separate the two sides after 90 minutes with Constable scoring twice for Croydon, but Millwall eventually winning the match narrowly 3-2 after extra time. A further relegation followed in 1994, but following Ken Jarvie taking over as Chairman / Manager and internal reorganisation, they were promoted back to Division One within two seasons. The club's first Isthmian League title \u2013 champions of Division One followed in 2000, before relegation two years later.

Jan 2020 The non-league scene was reorganised at the end of the 2005\u201306 season and this restructuring saw them placed in the Kent League where following a third-place finish in 2006\u201307, the club finished in mid- table the second two seasons. 2008\u201309 culminated with success in the Kent League Cup after a penalty shootout win over Erith Town. The Croydon team lifting the 2009 Kent League Cup. That turned out to be the club's final Kent League fixture as they shuffled sideways into the Combined Counties League (a competition which evolved from the Surrey Senior League) for the 2009\u201310 season. This is effectively back where they spent their first ten years and there is long-term rebuilding underway - the first three seasons in the CCFL saw them finish lower midway. For the 2014-15 season, the club was switched to the Southern Counties East League (formerly the Kent League). The club also runs a successful youth programme, a midweek Under 18 team playing in Ryman Youth League, a second under 18 team playing in the new Combined Counties league and a Sunday team who play in the Croydon Municipal league. In their first season the Sunday side were promoted and won the Leonard Vase Cup (2012\u201313) Recent players to have graduated from the youth programme include Danny Mills, Lee Brown and Stefan Payne. ==Nickname== The club's nickname \"The Trams\" was adopted around 2000 when the Tramlink system opened, running round the back of the ground, Arena being the closest stop less than two minutes walk from the turnstiles.Croydon FC Flysouth Bysouth ==Ground== Croydon FC supporters flags in the main stand at Croydon Sports Arena.
