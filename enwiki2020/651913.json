    "text": "In Singapore, a co-curricular activity (CCA), previously known as an extracurricular activity (ECA), is a non-academic activity that all students, regardless of nationality, must participate in. Co-curricular activities are responsible for the holistic growth of the child. This policy was introduced by the Ministry of Education (MOE).https://beta.moe.gov.sg/programmes/cca/ ==Structure of the CCA programme== CCA's choices vary widely from school to school, although schools at each education level are required to conform to national standards prescribed for that level. Basically education is imparted at three different levels of age. In kindergarten a small learns to being social, etiquette and first time enters the world without parents. At primary level learning ability goes at an upper edge child needs to learn higher degree of emotions, teacher student relations, sharing, caring and most important build trust on self to be a good boy or girl concept. Co-curricular activities includes all those activities which needs mind, heart and hand coordination. Playing in groups indoor or outdoor games, solving puzzles, collages, drawing, dancing, singing, mimicry, knitting, cooking and level goes on ascend as the child grows. In primary schools focus should be on the synchronisation and coordination of basic skills of a child. A child needs to stand still before learning football. In primary schools, Brownies are likened to Junior Girl Guides. In secondary schools, CCAs are treated more seriously. Students are required to pick at least one Core CCA to join at Secondary One. Belonging to a Core CCA is compulsory, and the students may choose a second CCA if they wish. If the student excels and achieves results in their CCA, 1 to 2 'O' Level points are removed from the examination aggregate (a lower aggregate indicates better marks) at the end of the fourth/fifth year. Although the marks are few, it is believed by many that they may make a difference when the students are considered for the most popular post- secondary educational institutions. For example, one minimum prerequisite for admission to the Raffles Institution at Year Five, via the 'O' Levels, is an already perfect score with the maximum of 4 points removed. ==Structure of typical CCAs== CCAs are held outside of curriculum hours and the activities partaken depend on the nature of the particular CCA. For example, uniformed groups do foot drills and team-building exercises. Many alumni return to their alma mater after graduation to help impart what they have learned to their juniors. Some do so within a formal framework, such within the uniformed groups (where ex-cadets are appointed as cadet officers) or as part of the Voluntary Adult Leader scheme (for those above age 20). Others do so on a casual basis. ==Competitions== Many CCA-related competitions are held in Singapore, creating a competitive environment which provide CCA groups an objective to work towards. The Ministry of Education organises competitions for competitive sports at the zonal and national level, respectively the yearly Zonal and National Schools Competitions. MOE also organises the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) for the Aesthetics CCAs. ==List of CCAs== ===Student associations=== *Prefectorial Board *Students' Council *The Peer Support Board *The Junior and Senior Leaders Board *The Civics Tutorial Council / Monitor / Class Leaders' Council *The House Committee *Technology Student Association (TSA) *National Education Ambassadors *Key Club *Student Congress *Environment Councillors ===Sports and games=== *Aikido *Archery *Badminton *Basketball *Bowling *Canoe Polo *Climbing *Cricket *Cross Country *Fencing *Field Hockeys *Flatwater Canoe/Kayak Racing *Floorball *Football *Fun Go Kart Club (Only offered in ITE CW) *Golf (only offered in some schools) *Gymnastics **Artistic Gymnastics **Rhythmic Gymnastics **Trampoline Gymnastics *Hockey *Handball (played with a club) *Netball *Outdoor Adventure (usually in polytechnics) *Rugby *Sailing *Sepak Takraw *Shooting **Air Pistol **Air Rifle *Skipping *Softball *Sports Invention Club *Squash *Swimming *Table Tennis *Taekwondo *Tchoukball *Tennis *Track and Field *Ultimate (Frisbee) *Volleyball *Waterpolo *Wushu ===Uniformed groups=== *Boys' Brigade *Girls' Brigade *Girl Guides Singapore (GG) *Brownies *Military Band *National Cadet Corps (NCC) *National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC) *National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) *Red Cross Youth (RCY) *Singapore Scout Association (SSA) *St. John Ambulance Brigade (SJAB) ===Performing arts=== *Angklung Ensemble *Bands **Brass Band **Concert Band **Display Band **Marching Band **Military Band **Symphonic Band **Wind Band *Chinese Orchestra *Chinese Drama *Choir *Dance Clubs **Chinese Dance **Indian Dance **International Dance **Malay Dance **Modern Dance *English Drama *Gamelan *General Music *Guitar Ensemble *Guzheng Ensemble *Handbell Ensemble *Harmonica and Keyboard Ensemble *Harp Ensemble *Indian Orchestra *Percussion Band *Piano Ensemble *Orchestra *String Ensemble *Violin Note that Band may either count as a uniformed group or a performing arts group. ===Clubs and societies=== *Advanced Mathematics Club *AVA Club (Audio and Visual Aid) *Art Club *Astronomy Club *Cabin Club (with Singapore Children's Society) *Comics Club *Chess Club *Chinese Cultural Club *Chinese Calligraphy Club *Computer Club *Culinary Club (One school only) *Debate Club *Drama Club *English Calligraphy Club *Entrepreneurship Club *Environment Club *First Aid Club *Future Problem Solving Programme *Game Designing Club *Gardening Club *Green Club *Guitar Club *Infocomm Club *Interact Club *Innovation Programme *Indian Cultural Society *Inventions Club *Research Programme *Language Club *Library Club *Mathematics Club *Media Club *Mind Sports Club *Multimedia Club *Outdoor Activities Club (OAC/ODAC) *Philatelic Club *Philosophy Club *Photography Club *Photoshop Club *Robotics Club *Science Club *Singapore Youth Flying Club (SYFC) *Scrabble Society *Tactics Club *Tamil Literary, Drama and Debate Society (TLDDS) *Video Animation Club *World Scholar's Cup (WSC) In some schools, instead of separate clubs for Language, Debate and Drama (and even Culture), these domains are grouped under the heading of Language Debate and Drama Societies, an example of which is the English Literary Drama and Debate Society (ELDDS). ==References== ==External Links== *MOE CCAB Homepage Category:Education in Singapore ",
