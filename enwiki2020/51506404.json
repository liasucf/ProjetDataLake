    "text": "The 2016 clown sightings were reports of people disguised as evil clowns in incongruous settings, such as near forests and schools. The incidents were reported in the United States, Canada, and subsequently in other countries and territories from August 2016. The sightings were first reported in Green Bay, Wisconsin in what turned out to be a marketing stunt for a horror film. The phenomenon later spread to many other cities in the US, most notably South Carolina where a 9-year-old boy told his mother that two suspicious males dressed as clowns tried to lure him into the nearby woods. By mid-October 2016, clown sightings and attacks had been reported in nearly all U.S. states, 9 out of 13 provinces and territories of Canada, and 18 other countries. Prior to the spate of incidents in 2016, numerous sightings of people dressed as clowns in odd or incongruous settings have occurred throughout the world since 2013. The proliferation of videos and images of these precursor sightings spread through social media posts and viral sharing of the content, most notably from DM Pranks, an Italian YouTube channel. ==Scope, timeline and effects of sightings== ===Precursor sightings=== One possible precursor event was the 2013 sightings of a \"creepy clown\" in Northampton, England. The Northampton clown sightings, which were in the town during September and October 2013, were the work of three local filmmakers Alex Powell, Elliot Simpson, and Luke Ubanski. The clown shared similar looks to Pennywise the Dancing Clown from Stephen King's book It. The trio started a Facebook page for the so-called \"Northampton clown\" and were using the appearances to drive traffic to the page. In March 2014, Matteo Moroni from Perugia, Italy, owner of the YouTube channel DM Pranks, began dressing up as an evil clown and terrifying unsuspecting passersby, with his videos racking up hundreds of millions of views. A rash of sightings appeared in California, USA in October 2014, which centered around the \"Wasco clown\", and primarily occurred in the Wasco, California area with photos appearing on social media. A person in clown attire was spotted in a cemetery in Chicago, Illinois in July 2015. This occurrence involved two residents who spotted the \"creepy clown\" scaling the gate at the Rosehill Cemetery late at night. After the clown entered the cemetery, they turned to face the residents and began waving slowly as they made a video recording. After waving for a few seconds, the clown ran into a dark wooded area and was not seen again. Police investigation of the sighting did not lead to any arrests. ===2016 sightings and effects=== The 2016 clown phenomenon began in Green Bay, Wisconsin in early August. Five pictures of a creepy clown roaming a vacant parking lot under a bridge in downtown Green Bay at night started going viral on August 1, 2016. A Facebook page was created shortly after claiming the clown was named \"Gags.\" In the days that followed, the pictures ended up being discussed on numerous news outlets including Fox News, USA Today and The Young Turks. Suspicions of the character being related to a horror film were confirmed when a Wisconsin filmmaker announced the pictures were a marketing stunt for a then unreleased short film titled \"Gags.\" A feature film was produced based on the short film and premiered in 2018 with a wide release planned for September 2019. After the Wisconsin incident, numerous other incidents started popping up across the United States, most notably in Greenville, South Carolina at the end of August 2016. In early October 2016, further incidents were reported in Canada and the first occurrences in the United Kingdom and Australia. British communities were described as \"horrified\" and pressure had been placed on police resources. Throughout this time, Internet social media sites received numerous postings related to the phenomenon.

While there were no widespread \"purge\" attacks as threatened, a family from Florida were attacked on October 31, 2016 by a group of approximately 20 people in clown masks (and masks styled after The Purge movie).

Meder is an Abington, PA-based professional clown who provides entertainment for children.

The exact nature of these threats has not been made public. Such threats on social media have also affected two grade schools in Alabama, Auburn University, Fairborn High School, Columbus, Ohio, some Las Vegas area schools, and many more around the country. ==Critical analysis== Explanations include that some clown sightings were promotional stunts for Rob Zombie's 31 or Andr\u00e9s Muschietti's 2017 film adaptation of Stephen King's novel It, both of which feature one or more characters dressed as clowns. Author and folklorist Benjamin Radford, who wrote the non-fiction book Bad Clowns, said that the craze could be an example of the \"snowball effect\", where rumor and legitimate concerns mix with the human penchant for a good story. The Verge dismissed the sightings as a case of mass hysteria, stating that a fear of clowns (which is common in children and adults) may be an underlying cause. Vox likewise claimed that \"The Great Clown Panic of 2016 has been perpetuated by pretty much everyone except actual clowns.\" ==See also== * Bin Laden sightings in the United States * Evil clown * Elvis sightings * Spring-heeled Jack ==References== Category:2010s fads and trends Clown sightings Clown sightings Clown sightings Clown sightings Clown sightings Clown sightings Category:Clowns Category:Mass hysteria Category:Postmodernism Category:Urban legends ",
