His works include more than 40 buildings, most of them churches, built between 1835 and 1878, and spread along the Vardar and Morava Valley, with an extension of his works found in Bosnia and Herzegovina as well.Journal Balkanologie by Bernard Lory, December 2002, retrieved 3-4-2018 ==Origin== Damyanov is often included in histories of the Bulgarian and Serbian architectural literature, but his biography does not reveal existence of specific national motivation behind his works.\"Damjanov is regularly included in histories of Serbian architecture as one of the first architects of the \u201cSerbo-Byzantine style.\u201d However, careful study of the biographies and the legacy of traditional master builders rarely reveals the existence of a national motivation behind their works. Not surprisingly, it has been possible to praise Andreja Damjanov as a great \u201cBulgarian master\u201d in Bulgarian architectural literature and as a \u201cMacedonian master\u201d in the Macedonian literature.\" Roumen Dontchev Daskalov, Diana Mishkova, Tchavdar Marinov, Alexander Vezenkov, Entangled Histories of the Balkans - Volume Four: Concepts, Approaches, and (Self-)Representations, Balkan Studies Library, BRILL, 2017, , p. 488. Today he is also described as a \u201cMacedonian master\u201d in North Macedonia, but Macedonian identity was inchoate at that time.\"Until the late 19th century both outside observers and those Bulgaro-Macedonians who had an ethnic consciousness believed that their group, which is now two separate nationalities, comprised a single people, the Bulgarians. Thus the reader should ignore references to ethnic Macedonians in the Middle ages which appear in some modern works. In the Middle ages and into the 19th century, the term \u2018Macedonian\u2019 was used entirely in reference to a geographical region. anyone who lived within its confines, regardless of nationality could be called a Macedonian...Nevertheless, the absence of a national consciousness in the past is no grounds to reject the Macedonians as a nationality today.\" \"The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century,\" John Van Antwerp Fine, University of Michigan Press, 1991, , pp. 36\u201337.
