A serpentine path leads to the top, approximately above sea level, with a panoramic view of the Vistula River and the city. ==History== Ko\u015bciuszko Mound, 1930s Ko\u015bciuszko Mound (video) It was completed in November 1823. The location selected for the monument was the natural Blessed Bronis\u0142awa Hill (), also known as Sikornik, situated in the western part of Krak\u00f3w's Zwierzyniec District. Ko\u015bciuszko Mound is one of Krak\u00f3w's four memorial mounds, consisting of two prehistoric mounds, Krakus Mound and Wanda Mound, and two modern ones, Pi\u0142sudski Mound and Ko\u015bciuszko Mound. The founding ceremony of the Ko\u015bciuszko Mound took place on 16 October 1820. The construction was financed by donations from Poles living in all territories of Poland under foreign occupation. For three years, people of all ages and class voluntarily constructed the mound to the height of . Work was supervised by a Committee for the Construction of the Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko Monument. At the base of the mound, the Founding Act was deposited in a glass and marble case. At the top, a granite boulder, brought from the Tatra Mountains, was placed, bearing the inscription \"Ko\u015bciuszce\" (To Ko\u015bciuszko). Inside the mound, urns were buried with soil from the Polish and American battlefields where Ko\u015bciuszko fought. In 1860, on the 30th anniversary of the Polish November Uprising, the top of the mound was crowned with a boulder (545 kg) of granite from Tatra mountains which had engraved upon it: TO KO\u015aCIUSZKO. Initially, the grounds around Ko\u015bciuszko Mound were planned to be turned into a colony settlement for the peasant families that fought alongside Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko in the uprising of 1794. In the late 1830s, those families began to settle at the foothills of Ko\u015bciuszko Mound, but the process came to a halt when Austrian authorities decided to turn this area into a part of city's fortification. Between 1850 and 1854, the Austrian authorities built a brick citadel around the mound and began using it as a strategic lookout. As compensation for an earlier historical church that had been demolished, a neo-Gothic chapel of Blessed Bronis\u0142awa was also built. However, the Austrian fortifications, including the gateway and the southwestern rampart and entrenchment were eventually dismantled following World War II, between 1945 and 1956. Next to the mound there is a museum devoted to Ko\u015bciuszko, that displays artefacts and mementoes of his life and achievements. In 1997, heavy rains eroded the mound, thus threatening its existence. It went through a restoration process from 1999 till 2003 in which state-of-the-art technology and modern materials were used. The mound was equipped with a drainage system and a new waterproofing membrane. Ko\u015bciuszko Mound inspired Count Paul Strzelecki, Polish patriot and Australian explorer, to name the highest mountain in Australia Mount Kosciuszko, because of its perceived resemblance to the Ko\u015bciuszko Mound in Krak\u00f3w.Mt Kosciuszko.
