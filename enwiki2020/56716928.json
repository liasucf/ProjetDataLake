    "text": "Uovo Fine Art Storage (stylized as UOVO) is a New York City-based art storage space provider that specializes in safeguarding high-value fine art, fashion, interior design, and archival collections.. The company operates three facilities in the New York City area and stored in its facilities are numerous notable works of art and memorabilia from the fine art, music, entertainment and fashion industries. == History == Uovo was established in January 2013 by Steven Guttman, an art collector and real-estate developer, and Steve Novenstein. The company is named after uovo, the Italian word for egg. In 2006, Guttman opened his first fine art storage facility in the Bronx, New York on the top two floors of a building owned by his other business, Storage Deluxe. Guttman founded Uovo because he felt the demand for art storage far exceeded the capacity at the Bronx facility, and because he believed he could improve on existing art-storage options with a facility purpose-built to receive and protect fine art. In early 2013, Uovo announced that it would build its first purpose-built art storage facility in Long Island City, Queens. The pair of buildings on 22nd Street which make up the 280,000-square- foot facility near Queens Plaza opened in 2014. The facility built from the ground-up features about 500 storage spaces and private viewing rooms, strict security, as well as advanced cataloging and indexing. The company offers suites customized for individual collections, workspaces for curators and conservators, as well as specialized transportation services for artwork. In December 2014, Uovo purchased a warehouse facility in Orangeburg, New York. The 106,141-square-foot facility located at 33 Kings Highway sits on a thirteen-acre lot. In February 2017, the company opened its third facility, the second in Rockland County. The renovated 140,000-square-feet facility sits on a 9-acre property located at 100 Bradley Parkway in Blauvelt, a subdivision of Orangetown, New York. As of 2015, Steve Novenstein serves as chief executive of Uovo. Guttman, the founder of the company, serves as chairman. A notable client is the Rubin Museum of Art in New York which utilizes Uovo\u2019s facilities as an auxiliary storage space for its collections. Although Uovo does not often disclose the items stored in its facilities, but as of 2016, one large collection known to be stored there is the works of the fashion designer Oscar de la Renta. Designs spanning decades of work are housed, cataloged and sometimes showcased at Uovo, allowing archivist of De la Renta\u2019s work to access and peruse the collection when necessary. Uovo also stores the collections of others in the fashion industry such as Hamish Bowles and PVH Corp., which owns Calvin Klein Inc. and the Tommy Hilfiger Group. == References == == External links == * Category:Companies based in Queens, New York Category:2013 establishments in New York City Category:Art museums in New York City Category:Art galleries in Queens, New York Category:Storage companies Category:Conservation and restoration companies ",
