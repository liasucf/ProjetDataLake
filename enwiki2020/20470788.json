The village consists of approximately 200 homes, and total population of approximately 1500 as of 2008. It is situated on the bank of a canal that originates from the Barrage Qadirabad Colony. Most of the land suffers from seepage which make it unsuitable for cultivation.

Presently the village is surrounded on all sides with fish farms. The village forms an artificial peninsula. Thatha Shamsa is bounded by rivers and canals. The major canal that originates from Chenab River at Qadirabad barragein the west of the village.
