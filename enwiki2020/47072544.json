Golden State broke their franchise record of 28 road wins in a season which they set in 2014\u201315; they ended the season with 34, passing the same mid-1990s Chicago Bulls team led by Michael Jordan for the most road wins in NBA history. The team became the first in NBA history to go the entire regular- season without back-to-back losses and without losing to the same team twice. Steve Kerr was named Coach of the Year, the third coach in Warriors history to win the award. Stephen Curry was named Most Valuable Player for a second successive season and is the first unanimous winner in NBA history.

Also, with this 11th straight road victory, the Warriors set a new franchise-record for the longest road winning streak in their history. Golden State's 131\u2013123 win on December 8 over the Pacers in Indianapolis improved their road record to 13\u20130, the best such start to a season in NBA history.

This was also the earliest a team had clinched a playoff spot in February since the 1987\u201388 Los Angeles Lakers (although the season started almost two weeks earlier than the season did within their respective calendar years). In this game Stephen Curry also broke the single season three-point record (286), a record that he himself held, by making his 287th and 288th three-pointers of the season as two of his 12 three-pointers of the game, tying the single game NBA three- point record (jointly holding it with Kobe Bryant and Donyell Marshall). ====March==== On March 3, the Warriors tied the 1995\u20131996 Chicago Bulls for the longest regular-season home-game winning streak in NBA history (44 games), with a 121\u2013106 victory at home against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

On May 26, Stephen Curry, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson were named to the 2015\u201316 All-NBA Team, the first time three Warriors have earned the accolade since the 1955\u201356 season when Neil Johnston, Paul Arizin, and Jack George were selected.

The Warriors were led by their bench, with Shaun Livingston scoring a team-high 20 points. The 35-point bench advantage (45\u201310) the Warriors had over the Cavs is the largest by any team in the Finals in the last 50 years. The Warriors won Game 2 by a blowout 110\u201377, to go up 2\u20130 in the series. Golden State won the first 2 games by a combined 48 points, the largest point-differential through first 2 games in NBA Finals history. After Golden State lost Game 3 by a blowout 90\u2013120, they came back in Game 4 to win 108\u201397, to take a 3\u20131 series lead. The Warriors made 17 three-pointers, an NBA record for a single Finals game. The Warriors' win in Game 4 was their 88th of the season, which broke the 1995\u201396 Chicago Bulls record of 87 for most wins in an NBA season (regular-season and postseason combined). Late in the fourth quarter of Game 4, Draymond Green and LeBron James got into a scuffle. Green was retroactively charged with a Flagrant Foul 1 for swiping James in the groin and received a one-game suspension for Game 5, after accumulating his fourth flagrant foul point in the playoffs, and James was given a technical foul for taunting Green. The Cavaliers capitalized on Green's absence by beating the Warriors in Game 5 by a score of 112\u201397. After serving his suspension, Green returned to play in Game 6. Game 6 was played on June 16, exactly one year after Golden State won Game 6 of the 2015 NBA Finals, which was also played in Cleveland. Unlike in the 2015 NBA Finals, however, the Warriors failed to clinch the title in Game 6. The Warriors were outscored 11\u201331 by the Cavaliers in the first quarter, and Cleveland never relinquished their lead as Golden State lost 101\u2013115. This was only the second time in 105 games this season (regular-season and postseason) that the Warriors lost at least two games in a row. The loss evened the series at three games apiece, forcing a Game 7, the first Game 7 in an NBA Finals appearance in Golden State franchise history. During the fourth quarter of Game 6, Stephen Curry, who set the record for most three-pointers in an NBA Finals series during the game (28), fouled out with his sixth personal foul. Curry angrily responded by throwing his mouthguard into the stands and hit a fan, which resulted in a technical foul and the first ejection of his career. It was the first time in 20 years that a player had been ejected from an NBA Finals game. After the game, Curry received a $25,000 fine for his actions, but was not suspended for Game 7. Warriors head coach Steve Kerr also received a $25,000 fine for his criticism of the officiating, which he felt was biased against Curry, in the post-game press conference. On June 19, 2016, Golden State lost Game 7 by a score of 89\u201393, becoming the first team in NBA history to squander a 3\u20131 lead in the NBA Finals. They also became the first team in NBA history to overcome a 1\u20133 deficit and lose a 3\u20131 lead in the same playoffs. The Warriors are the 11th team in NBA history to lose a 3\u20131 series lead and just the fourth team in NBA history to lose an NBA Finals' Game 7 on their home court. The loss marked the first time since Steve Kerr became head coach that the Warriors had lost three straight games. Golden State became the first team in NBA history to finish with the same number of regular-season and postseason losses (9). They also became the first team in NBA history with 69 or more regular season wins that failed to win the NBA Championship. ==Records== :See also: NBA regular season records and NBA post-season records.
