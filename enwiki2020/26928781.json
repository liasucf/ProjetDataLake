He was son of David Ross and Carmen Edwards Ossandon; both were of British ancestry.

He participated in the trades of the bank of the Edwards family. He was private agent in London of the Government Junta of Iquique in 1891. He was plenipotentiary minister in Great Britain in February 1892. Ross moved to Pichilemu around 1890 and bought some land in the town. In San Fernando, in September 1885, he bought some property from Francisco Torrealba, on a site that was located at the Pichilemu beach. He constructed the Ross Hotel with a European-style design, assigning Evaristo Merino as its administrator. He promoted Pichilemu in cities such as Santiago de Chile. He later constructed the Ross Casino and the Ross Park. They used materials such as stone from Italy, Oregon pine from the United States, and Portland cement.
