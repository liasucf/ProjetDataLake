    "text": "The Province of Magdeburg () was a province of the Free State of Prussia within Nazi Germany from 1944\u201345. The provincial capital was Magdeburg. The province was created on 1 July 1944 out of Regierungsbezirk Magdeburg, a government region from the former Province of Saxony. The province was occupied by American troops after the conquest of Magdeburg in April 1945 during World War II. After the territory was transferred from American to Soviet control, it was merged with Halle-Merseburg and Anhalt to recreate the Province of Saxony, later renamed the Province of Saxony-Anhalt and ultimately the Federal State of Saxony-Anhalt. ==Districts in 1945== ===Regierungsbezirk Magdeburg=== ;Urban districts # Aschersleben # Burg bei Magdeburg # Halberstadt # Magdeburg # Quedlinburg # Salzwedel # Stendal ;Rural districts #Calbe a./S. #Gardelegen #Haldensleben #Jerichow I (seat: Burg bei Magdeburg) #Jerichow II (seat: Genthin) #Oschersleben (Bode) #Osterburg #Quedlinburg #Salzwedel #Stendal #Wanzleben #Wernigerode #Wolmirstedt ==Notes== Category:1944 establishments in Germany Category:States and territories established in 1944 Category:1945 disestablishments in Germany Category:States and territories disestablished in 1945 Province of Magdeburg Category:Provinces of Prussia Category:Former states and territories of Saxony-Anhalt ",
