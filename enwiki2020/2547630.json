They have a son named Tyler and a daughter named Summer. ==Early life== Terenzi was born in Natick, Massachusetts, United States, to Italian-American parents Peter and Antoinette. At the age of 3 his grandmother began training him at her dance studio. At the age of seven he learned how to play piano at his mother's church by teaching himself. He also learned to play guitar himself after his father gave him a guitar for Christmas. At the age of 12 he began to act and host a Boston-based TV show called 'Studio A.T.V.'. Terenzi moved to Florida with a friend named Damion with little funds. ==Natural== After arriving in Florida Terenzi took on various jobs including a stint as a bouncer at the House of Blues in Orlando. Terenzi eventually befriended an actor named Ben Bledsoe. In 1999 the pair soon teamed up with Michael Johnson, Patrick King, and later Josh Horn to form the boy band Natural. The band created a buzz in the Orlando area eventually attracting attention from boy band mogul Lou Pearlman. Signed with Transcontinental Records they released their first single \"Put Your Arms Around Me\" in 2001. The single peaked at #12 in the German charts. With American success lacking the group continued to release in Germany. Their debut album \"Keep it Natural\" peaked at #2 in the German charts. By 2004 they had released 2 albums and 9 singles. In 2002 Terenzi met German pop singer Sarah Connor. The couple began a relationship covertly despite Pearlman's wishes. Pearlman had rules for his boy bands: \"No facial hair, no girlfriends, and no drinking in public.\" In 2004, Connor became pregnant and the couple was soon engaged. No longer able to keep the relationship secret, Pearlman wanted to replace Terenzi in the band. However, the other members refused and Natural disbanded after their final tour in 2004. ==Solo career== Terenzi originally intended to form a new band after Natural, named 'Jaded Rose'. However he and the other members had creative differences and his solo career was put on hold until 2005. Together with Connor he participated in a one off reality show for German TV. The series was called 'Sarah and Marc in Love' and followed their private lives, planning their wedding, and the recording of both their albums. Terenzi's first solo single was titled 'Heat Between the Sheets' which reached the #40 in the German charts. His follow-up single 'Love to be loved by you' peaked at #3 on the German charts. The single was a song he played at the wedding ceremony, and thus had a huge audience. It became his signature song. Terenzi released another single, 'Can't breathe without you' as well as an album titled 'Awesome' which peaked at #8. To support the album he embarked on a tour of the same name during 2006. After the tour Terenzi released a new single, \"You complete my soul\" on October 6, 2006. It debuted at #35 on the German charts. Despite this second album has yet to be released. In 2007, after almost two years without an album release Terenzi left a note for his fans indicating he was still pursuing a musical career, \"I know it has been along time since you have heard something new from me. Its only because I have been searching for a while to find out who I really am. Just because you have not heard anything from me recently does not mean that I have stopped working. There is still a lot to come.\" ===2008: Terenzi=== On May 7, 2008 Terenzi announced via his official MySpace that he had formed a new band, \"It is true that I am forming a new band. A project that is more edgy and modern. We plan on taking the new music to a whole new level. music that both my old fans and new fans will like, that is why I will form a new band. We don't know what the name of the project should be but if you have any Ideas let us know. you never know maybe we pick a name you give us. The members that will always be a part of this new band are Myself, Benny Richter and Michael Johnson (Natural). We are bringing a whole lot more edge to our music and are busy working in the studio right now. We have really big plans for this year so get ready for a crazy journey.\" On May 21 it was announced Terenzi and his wife would participate in an eight part reality show titled, Sarah and Marc in Love on ProSieben in Germany.
