    "text": "Ishola Oyenusi ( ? - 8 September 1971) popularly known as Dr. Ishola was a Nigerian notorious armed robber in his time who was active during the 1970s. His modus operandi was carjackings, bank robberies and heists committed during hold-ups. OldNaija confirmed that doctor Oyenusi, as he was called, was not a doctor by profession but adopted the title for the fun of it. The evidence lies in a confession he made a few minutes before his execution. He confessed that his parents were not capable of furthering his secondary school education and that was what forced him into robbery. So without having a secondary school education, Oyenusi by no way could have been a medical doctor. ==Trial and execution== Oyenusi together with six other members of his gang were executed on 8 September 1971 by a combined police and armed forces firing brigade. His execution was caught on film. ==See also== * Lawrence Anini ==Notes== ==References== * Category:1971 deaths Category:Executed Nigerian people Category:Year of birth missing Category:20th-century executions by Nigeria Category:Nigerian bank robbers Category:20th-century criminals Category:Filmed executions ",
