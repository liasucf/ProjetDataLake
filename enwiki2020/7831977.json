Charlot the Acrobat, a Serbo-Croatian language version of Charlie Chaplin's name in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) were a seminal Serbian new wave/post-punk band from Belgrade. Short-lived but extremely influential, in addition to being one of the most important acts of the Yugoslav new wave scene, the three piece left an indelible mark on the entire music scene of former Yugoslavia. Spawning from the progressive/hard rock group Limunovo Drvo (; trans. Lemon Tree), founded in 1977 by guitarist and vocalist Milan Mladenovi\u0107 and guitarist Dragomir Mihajlovi\u0107 \"Gagi\", after several lineup changes, moved towards new wave music, with the arrival of bassist and vocalist Du\u0161an Koji\u0107 \"Koja\" and drummer Ivan Vdovi\u0107 \"VD\". After performing as an opening act for Pankrti in April 1980, Mihajlovi\u0107 left the band and the remaining three members changed their name to \u0160arlo Akrobata, after a Yugoslav nickname for actor Charlie Chaplin. Subsequently, the trio recorded four tracks which were released on the 1981 compilation album Paket aran\u017eman, now considered to be one of the most influential releases in the history of former Yugoslav rock music. During 1981, the band released their debut album Bistriji ili tuplji \u010dovek biva kad..., after which, owing to irreconcilable differences between the band members, the band ceased to exist. The album received critical recognition and is regarded as one of the most notable albums of former Yugoslav rock music. After the band disbandment, Mladenovi\u0107 with Vdovi\u0107 and Mihajlovi\u0107 formed Katarina II, which changed its name to Ekatarina Velika after the departure of the latter two, and Koji\u0107 formed Disciplina Ki\u010dme, changing its name to Disciplin A Kitschme in 1995. In 1992, Ivan Vdovi\u0107 died of AIDS, followed by Milan Mladenovi\u0107's death from pancreatic cancer in 1994. == History == ===Background: Limunovo Drvo=== In 1978, Milan Mladenovi\u0107 (guitar, vocals) and Gagi Mihajlovi\u0107 (guitar) formed the progressive/hard rock band Limunovo Drvo, with bassist Goran \"Maksa\" Kovin\u010di\u0107 and drummer Du\u0161an \"D\u017eind\u017eer\" Dejanovi\u0107. The lineup did not last long and the band experienced frequent personnel changes, including bassist Mikica Stefanovi\u0107 as well as Kovin\u010di\u0107's and Dejanovi\u0107's respective returns. Despite never achieving stable lineup, the band still managed to string together a bit of an active presence on Belgrade's underground music scene, performing at the \u017darkovo and \u017deleznik guitar festivals, at Novi Beograd's Blok 45, the Belgrade Youth Center, as well as staging two solo concerts at the SKC. During this period, the band also recorded a few demo tracks at the famous JM Sound Studio in Zagreb owned by Janko \"Truli\" Mlinari\u0107 and Petko Kantardijev. Still, Limunovo Drvo never managed to put out an official release although they were reportedly close to recording an album for Suzy Records, only to break apart before that could be realized. Songs performed by Limunovo Drvo include \"Da li se se\u0107ate?\" (\"Do you remember?\", \"Sedmi krug\" (\"The Seventh Circle\", \"Oko moje glave\" (\"All Around My Head\"), \"Limunovo drvo\" (\"The Lemon Tree\"), \"Ne veruj\" (\"Do Not Believe\") and \"Gubitak (Ne\u0161to u nama)\" (\"The Loss (Something Within Us)\"). At the end of Mladenovi\u0107's and Mihajlovi\u0107's creative wits, the two were joined by Du\u0161an \"Koja\" Koji\u0107 (bass, vocals) \u2014 who had previously played with a number of underground Belgrade bands in addition to moving in alternative and punk circles gathered around the SKC where he used to conduct public forum debates related to new wave music \u2014 as well as Ivan Vdovi\u0107 \"VD\" (drums, backing vocals), a drummer with a background in jazz music who performed with numerous Belgrade bands including BG5 and Suncokret. Furthermore, Koji\u0107 and Mladenovi\u0107 had previously played in a band Izvan Vremena, having their first performance in 1978. The addition of a new rhythm section brought a change in their musical orientations through adopting a new musical direction inspired by the emerging punk rock and new wave scenes. Upon his arrival in Limunovo Drvo, Koji\u0107 also brought along his and Milan's mutual friend Nenad \"Kele\" Krasavac who became the band's unofficial manager. In April 1980, the new Limunovo Drvo lineup opened for Pankrti at Belgrade SKC, performing a set of new and rearranged older songs, after which guitarist Mihajlovi\u0107 decided to leave the band and the remaining members decided to continue working as a trio, changing the name to \u0160arlo Akrobata. In June 1980, the band performed at a series of multiple acts free concerts, mostly featuring the newly formed new wave and punk bands, organized at the Belgrade SKC under the supervision of Neboj\u0161a Pajki\u0107, after which, \u0160arlo Akrobata (labeled as Akrobata \u0160arlo), along with Elektri\u010dni Orgazam and Idoli were recognized by the D\u017euboks critic Mom\u010dilo Rajin as \"one of the most exciting new acts\".\". Rajin stated that Vdovi\u0107's drum playing style was \"reminiscent of Stewart Copeland of The Police\", Koji\u0107 bass playing as \"a true example of simplicity and bareness to the essence of playing his instrument\", and Mladenovi\u0107 as \"matured into a true band leader\". Soon after, the three bands were labeled by the music critics as the core of the emerging scene, consisting of the newly formed Belgrade punk rock and new wave bands centered on SKC, which they called the \"Belgrade Alternative Scene\" or \"BAS\". During November, with the performance of the song \"Ona se budi\" the band competed at Subotica Festival Omladina, the event where the representatives of both the Belgrade and Zagreb new wave scene had met for the first time, claiming second jury prize behind Film. === Paket aran\u017eman === By the Subotica performance, during autumn 1980, the band had already made their first recordings, the songs \"Ona se budi\" (\"She is Rousing\"), \"Oko moje glave\" (\"All Around My Head\"), \"Niko kao ja\" (\"No One Like Me\") and \"Mali \u010dovek\" (\"Little Man\") at the Belgrade Druga Maca studio, owned by the former Indexi keyboard player Enco Lesi\u0107, who had also made recordings of the other two \"BAS\" bands, Idoli and Elektri\u010dni Orgazam. Eventually, in coordination with Lesi\u0107 and Idoli manager Dragan Papi\u0107, the Jugoton executive editor Sini\u0161a \u0160karica came up with an idea of releasing the recordings of three bands in a compilation album, rather than releasing separate maxi singles. During the recording sessions of the three bands, the Druga Maca studio was visited by the young PGP RTB television directors, Boris Miljkovi\u0107 and Branimir Dimitrijevi\u0107 \"Tucko\", who were at the time working together on the Rokenroler (Rockenroller) television show, and in the following couple of weeks, they recorded several music videos for the songs of the three bands, all featuring the same style: a minimalist barren white chroma key scenery surrounding the band members. The recorded music videos, including the video for the song \"Niko kao ja\", appeared in the third episode of the Rokenroler show, originally broadcast on New Year's Eve 1981 on R, being the debut television appearance of the three Belgrade new wave acts, as well as the first presentation of the Belgrade new wave bands to a nationwide audience outside. The show became the most notable of all the Rokenroler episodes as well as the most notable work of the two directors. The show also marked one of the first serious attempts of introducing the mainstream music video in Yugoslav media. Following the show's broadcast, in January 1981, The D\u017euboks magazine journalist Neboj\u0161a Mir\u010detovi\u0107, in the text \"The Ultimate Breakup with the Apathetic Seventies\", in the context of the unreleased material promoted by the music videos, stated that the show marked the \"beginning of a rainbow at the end of which we would find a jar full of beautiful music waiting for the record labels to release it\". During following month, in the same magazine, Ivica Vdovi\u0107 was polled by the readers as the 10th best drummer, and Du\u0161an Koji\u0107 as the 9th best bassist of the year 1980. Despite the intended release during the late-1980, due to the lack of vinyl material, the omnibus compilation album featuring the debut recordings of \u0160arlo Akrobata, along with the recordings of Elektri\u010dni Orgazam and Idoli, Paket aran\u017eman (Package Deal), was released in February 1981 by Jugoton. Despite the fact that initially all three bands were not content with the release itself, especially the album production, owing to the technical limitations of the studio itself, the half- year delay during which the three bands had evolved musically, the release proved to be one of the most influential albums in the history of Yugoslav rock music. The album received positive critical reaction, with the D\u017euboks magazine critic Mom\u010dilo Rajin, in his review of the album, comparing the release with notability of the Grupa 220, Bijelo Dugme, Prljavo Kazali\u0161te and Pankrti debut album releases.\"Rajin\" The album was not a commercial success, initially being sold in about 10.000 copies with the 20.000 being sold with the subsequent reissues. However, the songs from the release, including \"Ona se budi\" and \"Niko kao ja\", were listed on the greatest Yugoslav rock songs lists on several occasions. The release of Paket aran\u017eman was soon followed by the release of the Mi\u0161a Radivojevi\u0107 movie De\u010dko koji obe\u0107ava (Promising Boy), for which the band recorded three songs, with Goran Vejvoda on guitar and the actor Aleksandar Ber\u010dek on lead vocals, which appeared on the movie soundtrack. The recorded songs, for which the music was written by Koji\u0107 and the lyrics by the screenplay writer Neboj\u0161a Pajki\u0107, were performed in the movie by the fictional musical group VIS Dobri De\u010daci (The Good Boys), with Koji\u0107 acting the guitar player role, Vdovi\u0107 the drummer role and Ber\u010dek the lead vocalist and film's starring role. The songs \"Slobodan\" (a popular Serbian name, literally means \"free\"), \"Balada o tvrdim grudima\" (\"The Ballad of Hard Breasts\") and \"Depresija\" (\"Depression), however, were never officially released. In March of the same year, \u0160arlo Akrobata participated the Pozdrav iz Beograda (Greetings from Belgrade) concert organized in Zagreb as a promotion of the Belgrade new wave scene, and a live promotion of Paket aran\u017eman, on which the band also promoted their debut single \"Mali \u010dovek\", with \"Ona se budi\" as the single B-side, released prior to the event. === Bistriji ili tuplji \u010dovek biva kad... === In April 1981, the band entered the studio in order to record their debut studio album, which was intended to be released through PGP RTB. However, during the recording sessions at the PGP RTB Studio 5, the musical editors of the record label, the composer Aleksandar Pilipenko and Bojan Hreljac, formerly the bassist of Korni Grupa, after visiting the studio during the recording of one of the experimental tracks, the label decided to drop the release. Even though the original band's musical directions were based on a combination of punk rock and white reggae music, the outcome of the album recording sessions proved turned out to be as experimental as possible, with the British new wave styles being combined with reggae, punk sound backed with dub effects. The recording sessions were based on a kind of a system where Mladenovi\u0107 and Koji\u0107 would bring fresh raw ideas and Vdovi\u0107 would modify and shape them. Mladenovi\u0107 was into poetic and melodic aspect of the whole thing while Koji\u0107, inspired by Jimi Hendrix style of playing, was turned to minimal lyrics and aggressive music which can be recognized on different tracks on the album and their work in general. Eventually, in July 1981, after purchasing the recordings from PGP RTB, the debut album Bistriji ili tuplji \u010dovek biva kad... (Brighter or Dumber a Man Gets When...), was released by Jugoton. The material featured guest appearances by Goran Vejvoda, Gagi Mihajlovi\u0107, Jurij Novoseli\u0107 \"Kuzma\" from the band Film and Dejan Kosti\u0107 from Grupa I. The producer of the album was signed as Akpi\u0111oto (misspelled on the album cover as Akti\u0111oto) which represents a combination of names of the real producers: Akrobata (the band), Pile (the nickname of Mile Mileti\u0107), \u0110or\u0111e (\u0110or\u0111e Petrovi\u0107) and Toni (Toni Jurij, a recording engineer from Ljubljana who was an expert on dub techniques). The album front cover was designed by the band themselves with Goran Vejvoda (who also designed the Paket aran\u017eman cover), the front cover featuring the band with their backs turned and facing a boy to create a kind of a notion of a mirror,Vesi\u0107 (director), 2008 with the band members also contributing with their own drawings on the inner sleeve: Mladenovi\u0107's drawing of his girlfriend, Koji\u0107 drew a two scene caricature and added the text from Politikin Zabavnik from an article about the \"acrobatic ladles\" to the Vdovi\u0107's drawing. The title of the album was taken from the Vasa Pelagi\u0107 book Narodni u\u010ditelj (The Folk Teacher), from which the song lyrics for the highly experimental track \"Pazite na decu I\" (\"Take Care Of The Children I\") were also taken. Beside the experimental \"Pazite na decu I\" and \"Ljubavna pesma\", the album featured the rearranged songs from the Limunovo Drvo period, along with the new material, and the entire written material and arrangements were credited to \u0160arlo Akrobata, rather than the individual band members themselves. However, the fact that the album did not feature the hit songs from Paket aran\u017eman like \"Ona se budi\" or \"Niko kao ja\", which the band considered as repetition of old material, affected the album and sales, with the album being sold in about 10.000 copies without another repressing by Jugoton. Like with the case of Paket aran\u017eman, despite not being commercially successful, the album proved to be one of the most significant albums released in the history of Yugoslav rock music, according to a number of musicians and critics, and was also featured on the greatest Yugoslav rock albums list.Antoni\u0107, \u0160trbac, 1998 === Album promotion and breakup === Following the album recording sessions, on May 15, 1981, with the Croatian new wave band Haustor, the band performed as an opening act for the Gang of Four at the Music Biennale Zagreb festival. It was intended that both bands were to open the Gang of Four concert in Ljubljana, but the performance was canceled. At that time, the professional and, consequently, private relations within the group had not been very well among its members, mostly because of the different views on the future directions of the band. Vdovi\u0107 insisted on bringing in the band Goran Vejvoda and possibly even Vejvoda's girlfriend at the time Dragana \u0160ari\u0107, both of which the members of his side project Announda Rouge. Mladenovi\u0107 was mostly receptive to the idea, also wanted to add a keyboard player and Vejvoda was one of the rare young musicians in Belgrade at the time who owned a Casio VL-2 synthesizer, whereas Koji\u0107 vehemently objected to it, feeling the current lineup still had much more to offer. Koji\u0107 would later state, in the 2006 documentary about Ekatarina Velika, Kao da je bilo nekad, that the normal relations and communication in \u0160arlo Akrobata lasted only about six months. According to Koji\u0107, the band was also reluctant to promote the album with much touring as the writing had already been on the wall since the trio barely tolerated each other at this point, knowing for some time they would soon split apart. The band were also to release a new double A-side single \"Bes\" (\"Anger\") / \"Prevaren\" (\"Fooled\"), the former being an original version of the dub remix featured on the debut album and the latter being a power pop track version of a Limunovo Drvo track, which were recorded during the album recording sessions, but it was never released. In the Autumn of 1981, they got the \"Smeli cvet\" award for music by Socialistic Youth Of Yugoslavia, after which the band embarked on a previously booked tour of Poland, during which they also had an unplanned jam improvising session with some of the British jazz performers at the Warsaw jazz festival. Upon returning to Yugoslavia, the band performed at a farewell show Ljubljana in October 1981, which, along with the Music Biennale Zagreb festival performance, proved to be the highest attending \u0160arlo Akrobata concert (circa 1.000 people), after which they disbanded. === Post-breakup === By the time \u0160arlo Akrobata disbanded, Koji\u0107 had already had several rehearsals with the band's manager Nenad Krasavac \"Kele\", who was also the drummer of the Belgrade punk rock band Urbana Gerila, as a duo under the name of Disciplina Ki\u010dme, featuring himself on bass guitar and Krasavac on drums. Following the disbandment, Milan Mladenovi\u0107 with Gagi Mihajlovi\u0107 on guitar, Du\u0161an Dejanovi\u0107 on drums, and Zoran \"\u0160vaba\" Radomirovi\u0107 on bass guitar, formed the band Katarina II, soon to be joined by the keyboard player Margita Stefanovi\u0107. During the following year, Katarina II drummer Du\u0161an Dejanovi\u0107 left the band in order to join Disciplina Ki\u010dme, and was replaced by Ivica Vdovi\u0107 \"VD\". In 1983, Disciplina Ki\u010dme with the drummer Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107 released their debut album Svi\u0111a mi se da ti ne bude prijatno (I Find Your Discomfort Appealing), featuring the tracks \"Mozak\" (\"Brain\") and \"Pe\u010dati\" (\"Stamps\"), originally performed by \u0160arlo Akrobata, but never officially released. The following year, Katarina II released their debut album Katarina II, after which both Mihajlovi\u0107 and Vdovi\u0107 left the band and the rest of the lineup changed the name to Ekatarina Velika. Both Disciplina Ki\u010dme and Ekatarina Velika would release a series of critically and moderately commercially successful albums throughout the 1980s. The rivalry between the two bands heated up with the Disciplina Ki\u010dme drummer Sr\u0111an Todorovi\u0107 joining Ekatarina Velika in 1987. During the same year, Disciplina Ki\u010dme released the EP De\u010dija pesma (Children Song), featuring six different versions of the title track, which featured the lyrics \"Nije dobro Bijelo Dugme; Nije dobra Katarina; \u0160ta je dobro; \u0160ta nam treba; Ki\u010dme, Ki\u010dme Disciplina\") (\"Bijelo Dugme is no good; And neither is Katarina; What is good?; What we need?; Ki\u010dme, Ki\u010dme Disciplina\"). One of the versions featured the guest appearance by Vdovi\u0107, who had been working with Du Du A and Heroji after leaving Katarina II, on rhythm machine. In 1989, Vdovi\u0107 formed the band DDT with the former Urbana Gerila member Sr\u0111an Markovi\u0107 \"\u0110ile\" (vocals) and former Profili Profili member Miodrag Stojanovi\u0107 \"\u010ceza\" (rhythm machine). On September 23, 1992, Ivan Vdovi\u0107, being the first officially registered HIV positive person in former Yugoslavia, died of AIDS at the age of 32. In 1991, Jugoton rereleased Paket aran\u017eman on compact disc, becoming one of the first CD releases in former Yugoslavia. The following year, with the outbreak of the Yugoslav wars, Mladenovi\u0107 participated the antiwar project Rimtutituki, and Koji\u0107 moved to London where, after performing in various bands, revived Discpilina Ki\u010dme with an alternative band name Disciplin A Kitschme, releasing several albums, featuring the rerecorded English language versions of Disciplina Ki\u010dme songs along with new material, and achieved a cult status. After releasing two albums with Ekatarina Velika, in 1994, Mladenovi\u0107 moved to Brazil where, with his friend and musical collaborator, Mitar Suboti\u0107, as Angel's Breath, released their eponymous album, recorded with a lineup of Brazilian musicians. Upon his return, on August 24, 1994, Ekatarina Velika played what would turn out to be their last show at the Pjesma Mediterana festival in Budva, as the next day Mladenovi\u0107 was held in a hospital, and was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. On November 5, 1994, Milan Mladenovi\u0107 died in Belgrade at the age of 36. Koji\u0107 continued performing with the London lineup of Disciplin A Kitschme until 2003 when he moved back to Belgrade. In 2002, the actress and director Sonja Savi\u0107 recorded an independent documentary movie \u0160arlo te gleda (Charlot is Watching You), dedicated to the late \u0160arlo Akrobata drummer Ivan Vdovi\u0107, which covered the story of \u0160arlo Akrobata and other bands from the Belgrade scene of the 1980s. The following year, Igor Mirkovi\u0107 released a book and directed a movie on the entire former Yugoslav new wave scene entitled Sretno dijete (Happy Child), which featured the story on \u0160arlo Akrobata, however, Koji\u0107 refused to participate in the film, dissatisfied with the fact that bands like Bijelo Dugme, a progressive rock band which switched to playing new wave music with the genre popularity, were included in the storyline. In 2005, Koji\u0107 reformed a new Belgrade lineup of Disciplin A Kitschme and resumed discography and touring activities. In 2007, Croatia Records, the successor of Jugoton, released a box set entitled Paket Aran\u017eman featuring a remastered edition of the album, packed with the \u0160arlo Akrobata and Elektri\u010dni orgazam debut albums. == Musical style == During the progressive/hard rock period of Limunovo Drvo, Milan Mladenovi\u0107 had already discovered the British new wave bands XTC and The Stranglers, a musical preference he discovered to be sharing with Du\u0161an Koji\u0107 \"Koja\", upon whose arrival in Limunovo Drvo, the band moved towards punk rock and new wave. Another new arrival which influenced the new musical orientation of Limunovo Drvo was the drummer Ivica Vdovi\u0107 \"VD\", who was more of a jazz musical background than rock, being a fan of jazz, jazz fusion, swing and be- bop,Vukojevi\u0107, Pajki\u0107, 1981 and Frank Zappa. During the earliest period of \u0160arlo Akrobata, the band sounded like a punk rock band rather than a new wave band, which changed with their ambition for a more minimal instrumentation.Lukovi\u0107, 1980 During this second period, the band embraced reggae, ska and punk funk, with the Gang of Four debut album Entertainment! and Joe Jackson debut Look Sharp! being a major influence, as documented on the compilation album Paket aran\u017eman. In an interview, Koji\u0107 also listed James Chance and the Contortions, The Pop Group, Public Image Limited, Miles Davis and Jimi Hendrix among the band favorites. After the Paket aran\u017eman period, the band moved towards making further experimentation which was marked as an \"organized chaos\" by Vdovi\u0107, in which Vdovi\u0107's playing open forms allowed the connection of Koji\u0107's raw and aggressive treatment of the bass guitar as a solo instrument and Mladenovi\u0107 melodic guitar and vocal style.Vesi\u0107, 2008 Mladenovi\u0107 would later state that he was the force in the band which could organize in a coherent whole the sounds coming from the unrestrained bass and drums, part of which owing to the necessity to play and sing most of the time, which affected his playing style. This period was documented on the band's debut and only studio album Bistriji ili tuplji \u010dovek biva kad.... Following the debut track on the album, the Stranglers and Magazine-influenced waltz intro \"\u0160arlo je ne\u017ean\", the album\u2019s second track \"Pazite na decu\" featured the band members unexpectedly entering the studio with a few associates and switching their instruments, with Mladenovi\u0107 on drums and vocals, Vdovi\u0107 playing guitar, Koji\u0107 playing the goblet drum and shouting, Dejan Kosti\u0107 of Du Du A on bass, and Goran Vejvoda on guitar. Another highly experimental track was \"Ljubavna pesma\" which was an improvisation recorded in a single take, the practice also used in the track \"\u010covek\", featuring the exclamation \"Dru\u017eino\" (\"Camaradery\") as a tribute to the band Buldo\u017eer, in which the band wanted to play as fast as possible, resulting in the most aggressive track on the album. The album also featured the rearranged songs from the Limunovo Drvo period, \"Fenomen\", \"Sad se jasno vidi\", \"Rano izjutra\", which were rearranged to a raw punk sound, and the melodic \"Samo ponekad\", which featured an oriental solo at the end of the track. Their fondness for ska music was continued on the release with the track \"O, O, O\", featuring a guest saxophone solo by Jurij Novoseli\u0107 \"Kuzma\" from the band Film. \"O, O, O\" featured dub music influences which were also found in the tracks \"Bes\" and \"Problem\", the latter featuring effects made by the collision of microphones, the placing of nylon bags over the microphones and stopping the tapes with an intense echo. The album also featured the power pop songs \"Ja \u017eelim jako\" and \"Pazite na decu II\" influenced by the British power pop scene. == Legacy == \u0160arlo Akrobata songs have been covered by various artists. In 1995, the Slovenian group 2227 recorded the single \"\u0160arlo budi ne\u017ean\" (\"\u0160arlo, Be Gentle\") as a tribute to the band. In 1998, the Serbian punk rock band D\u017eukele performed live a cover version of the song \"Fenomen\" (\"Phenomenon\"), released on the Punk You All various artists compilation. In 1999, the Serbian punk rock band Plejboj, on the various artists cover album Korak napred 2 koraka nazad (A Step Forward 2 Steps Backwards), recorded a cover version of the song \"Sad se jasno vidi\" (\"Now It Is Clearly Visible\"). In 2009, the Serbian actor and musician Nikola Pejakovi\u0107 \"Kolja\" covered the song \"Samo ponekad\" and released it as a digital download single for his second studio album Kolja. In 2013, Serbian guitarist Miroslav Tadi\u0107 recorded an instrumental version of \"Ona se budi\" on his album Mirina. In 2002, on the Milan Mladenovi\u0107 tribute album Kao da je bilo nekad... (Posve\u0107eno Milanu Mladenovi\u0107u) (As If It Had Happened Sometime... (Dedicated To Milan Mladenovi\u0107)) appeared several covers of \u0160arlo Akrobata songs. The Serbian punk rock band Novembar recorded a cover version of the song \"O, o, o\", former Haustor frontman Darko Rundek covered the song \"Ona se budi\", and the alternative rock band VROOM covered the song \"Problem\". In 2003, on the Milan Mladenovi\u0107 tribute concert in Zagreb, the Elektri\u010dni Orgazam frontman Sr\u0111an Gojkovi\u0107 performed the songs \"Fenomen\", \"Samo ponekad\" (\"Just Occasionally\") and \"O, o, o\", all of which appeared on the live Milan Mladenovi\u0107 tribute album Jako dobar tatoo!. In 1998, in the book YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike (YU 100: The Best Albums Of Yugoslav Pop And Rock Music), the album Bistriji ili tuplji \u010dovek biva kad... was ranked No. 11. In the same book Paket aran\u017eman appeared on the second place. In 2015, Bistiriji ili tuplji \u010dovek biva kad... was pronounced the second on the list of 100 greatest Yugoslav album, published by Croatian edition of Rolling Stone. On the same list, Paket aran\u017eman was ranked No. 38.
