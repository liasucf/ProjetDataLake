It was suspended in September after the outbreak of World War II. ==Overview== World War II broke out early into this season. Shortly after war was declared, most competitions, including the Football League, were abandoned as the country's attention turned to the war effort. A few leagues, such as the Northern League, did manage to complete a season, but more than half of the teams were unable to fulfil all their fixtures and resigned. Blackpool sat at the top the First Division table at the time the abandonment occurred.Football Statistics Archive The FA Cup Extra-Preliminary Round was played, but with hostilities declared before replays took place, that competition too was abandoned. Entry fees received for the 1939\u201340 Cup were honoured for the next Cup in 1945\u201346. Many footballers signed up to fight in the war and as a result many teams were depleted, and fielded guest players instead. Regional league competitions were set up. Appearances in these tournaments do not count in players' official records. The FA Cup was resumed for the 1945\u201346 season and The Football League for the 1946\u201347 season. ==Honours== ===Wartime=== After the abandonment of the football programme, the league was split into ten mini regional leagues. A national cup competition was also held. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Competition !Winner |- |Midland League||Wolverhampton Wanderers |- |West League||Stoke City |- |North-East League||Huddersfield Town |- |North-West League||Bury |- |South League 'A'||Arsenal |- |South League 'B'||Queens Park Rangers |- |South League 'C'||Tottenham Hotspur |- |South League 'D'||Crystal Palace |- |South-West League||Plymouth Argyle |- |East Midland League||Chesterfield |- |Football League War Cup||West Ham United |} ==League tables== ===League West=== ===League South A=== ===League South B=== ===League South C=== ===League South D=== ===League South-West=== ===League East Midlands=== ===League Midlands=== ==See also== *England national football team results (unofficial matches) ==References== * Category:Wartime seasons in English football ",
