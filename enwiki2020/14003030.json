Industries connected with Muirhead include coal and fire clay mining, brickmaking and distilling. The New Statistical Account of 1845 reported 40 persons in 9 families at Muirhead. Growth in the village followed the opening of The Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway in 1831. Following the First World War a cenotaph was built in 1923 at Muirhead. A primary school, St. Barbara's on Elmira Road, was opened in August 1933. ==Current Village== The suburb has a variety of shops including a Co-operative Food, newsagents, award-winning butcher, stationers and plenty of take-away food shops.
