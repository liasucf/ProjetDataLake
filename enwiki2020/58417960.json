    "text": "Winter in the Air is the seventh studio album and second Christmas album by David Archuleta, released on November 2, 2018. ==Background and promotion== Archuleta started work on the album in January, while the weather was still cold in his new hometown of Nashville. In an interview with Radio.com, Archuleta revealed that he wanted to write \"one of each kind of Christmas song\" meaning they had to either be fun, spiritual, or wintry. This led to the creation of \"Christmas Every Day,\" \"He Is Born,\" and the title track, \"Winter in the Air.\" The album was supported with a Winter in the Air Tour that began November 26 in Los Angeles and ran through December 21 in Richfield, Utah. ==Track listing== #\"Christmas Every Day\" [Writer(s): David Archuleta, Cason Cooley, Dave Barnes] #\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\" #\"Mary's Boy Child\" #\"Some Children See Him\" #\"Holly Jolly Christmas\" #\"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel\" #\"He Is Born\" [Writer(s): Archuleta, Cooley, Isabeau Miller] #\"White Christmas\" #\"Mary, Did You Know?\" #\"Winter in the Air\" [Writer(s): Archuleta, Jeremy Bose, Cindy Morgan] #\"In the Bleak Midwinter\" #\"Glorious\" [Writer(s): Stephanie Mabey] #\"The Christmas Song\" (Bonus Track) #\"Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays\" (Bonus Track) #\"Still, Still, Still (A capella)\" [Bonus Track] ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:2018 Christmas albums Category:David Archuleta albums Category:Christmas albums by American artists Category:Pop Christmas albums ",
