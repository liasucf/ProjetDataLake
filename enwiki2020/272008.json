    "text": "Flores is the capital of the Pet\u00e9n Department, Guatemala's landlocked, northernmost department. The population is 13,700 (2003). Flores is the seat of the municipality of Flores (population 22,600). Its Catedral Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Los Remedios y San Pablo Itz\u00e1 is the cathedral episcopal see of the Apostolic Vicariate of El Pet\u00e9n (formerly a territorial prelature). Catedral Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Los Remedios y San Pablo Itz\u00e1 The old part of the city is located on an island on Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, connected to the mainland by a short causeway. On the mainland is the suburb Santa Elena and, to the West, the contiguous municipality of San Benito. == History == In Pre-Columbian times, Flores was the Maya city of Nojpet\u00e9n. === Nojpet\u00e9n === View of Flores from Lake Peten Itza, Pet\u00e9n The Itza left the Yucat\u00e1n region in the 13th century and built the city later known as Tayasal as their capital. They called it Nojpet\u00e9n, (noj peten, literally \"Great Island\" in the Itza language).Reina 1966, p. 20. The Spanish called it Tayasal, possibly derived from ta Itza, or \"Place of the Itza\".Rice 2009, p. 43. It was here, on the island of Flores on the shore of Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, that the last independent Maya state held out against the Spanish conquerors. In 1541, Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s came to the island, en route to Honduras, but needed to move on and did not try to conquer it. The Spanish did not manage to conquer the island until 1697, when they marched in, attacked via boats, and destroyed it. Those who could flee did so, and many Itz\u00e1 people hid in the jungle for years. From the ruins of Nojpet\u00e9n arose the modern city of Flores. The modern city can thus be regarded as the second oldest continuously inhabited settlement in the Americas, after Cholula. == Transportation == Flores is served by Mundo Maya International Airport. Several international flights land here but most stop first at Guatemala City's La Aurora International Airport. The Island is also very well connected by bus, with many companies running overnight buses to Guatemala City. == Gallery == === Flores in the 19th century === The first photographs ever made from Flores were those taken by engineer Claudio Urrutia in 1897, when he was in charge of the Guatemala-Mexico Border Commission.
