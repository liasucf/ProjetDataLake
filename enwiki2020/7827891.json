    "text": "Something About You is the third studio album by the recording artist Angela Bofill, released in 1981. This was her first direct release through Arista Records, with Narada Michael Walden as producer and Clive Davis as executive. Between the releases of Angel of the Night and Something About You, Bofill left GRP Records and joined Arista, which distributed GRP at the time, hoping to expand on her crossover success. In spite of the controversies surrounding Bofill and GRP, the album managed to sell, but with less success than her first two albums. In 2002, Something About You was digitally remastered and re-released on Arista Records with extra tracks. ==Track listing== #\"Something About You\" #\"Break It To Me Gently\" #\"On and On\" #\"Tropical Love\" #\"You Should Know By Now\" #\"Only Love\" #\"Holdin' Out For Love\" #\"Stop, Look, Listen (To Your Heart)\" #\"I Do Love You\" #\"Three Blind Mice\" #\"Time To Say Goodbye\" ===Bonus tracks released with the 2002 remastered edition=== #\"Never Wanna Be Without Your Love - (with Narada Michael Walden)\" #\"Esperando Al Amor\" Produced by Dave Grusin & Larry Rosen #\"Love Light\" Produced by Dave Grusin & Larry Rosen #\"Rhythm Of Your Mind\" ==Personnel== *Angela Bofill: lead and backing vocals *Narada Michael Walden - drums, piano *Randy Jackson, Rusty Allen - bass guitar *Corrado Rustici, Earl Klugh, Joaquin Lievano - guitar *Tower of Power - horns *Paulinho Da Costa - percussion *Frank Martin - keyboards, synthesizer, Rhodes piano *Patrick Cowley, Greg Levias - synthesizer *Marc Russo - saxophone *Wayne Wallace - trombone *Greg Adams, Mic Gillette - trumpet *Larry Schneider - flute *Andy Narell - steel drums *Jim Gilstrap, John Lehman, Myrna Matthews, Scherrie Payne, Vicki Randle - backing vocals *Michael Gibbs - conductor, string arrangements *Clive Davis - executive producer ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! colspan=\"3\"| Chart positions |- style=\"font- size:smaller;\" ! style=\"width:40px;\"| US ! style=\"width:40px;\"| US R&B; ! style=\"width:40px;\"| Jazz Albums |- | 1982 | 61(1981) | 13 | 4 |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! rowspan=\"2\"| Single !
