    "text": "Trem da Alegria (Train of Happiness) was a children's musical band based in Brazil. During their tenure from 1984 to 1992, they released eight albums whose total sales surpassed six million copies. The band started in 1984 with Luciano Nassyn and Patricia Marx, recording the album Clube da Crian\u00e7a with Xuxa and Carequinha. The duo's boom came with the album Carossel da Esperan\u00e7a and the hit single \"\u00c9 de Chocolate\". Trem da Alegria's \"members were 'recruited by advertising agencies'\". In 1985, after Juninho Bill joined the band, they recorded their first album, Trem da Alegria do Clube da Crian\u00e7a, which featured guest performers Lucinha Lins (\"Dona Felicidade\") and The Fevers (\"Uni, Duni, Te\"). Trem was among Brazil's top-selling artists during 1987, along with Xuxa and Jairzinho e Simony. ==Members== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" |- !! style=\"background-color: #CCCCCC;\" colspan=\"4\"|Originais |- !! style=\"background-color: #CCCCCC;\"|Members !! style=\"background-color: #CCCCCC;\"|Year !! style=\"background-color: #CCCCCC;\"|Entrance order |- |- | Luciano Nassyn || 1985\u201388 || First formation |- | Patricia Marx || 1985\u201387 || First formation |- | Juninho Bill || 1985\u201392 || First formation |- | Vanessa Delduque || 1986\u201388 || Second formation |- !! style=\"background-color: #CCCCCC;\" colspan=\"4\"|Others |- !! style=\"background- color: #CCCCCC;\"|Member !! style=\"background-color: #CCCCCC;\"|Year !! style=\"background-color: #CCCCCC;\"|Replaced |- |- | Fab\u00edola Braga || 1987 || Patr\u00edcia Marx |- | Amanda Acosta || 1988\u201392 || Fab\u00edola Braga |- | Rubinho Cabrera || 1989\u201392 || Luciano Nassyn |- | Ricky Bueno || 1991 || |- !! style=\"background-color: #CCCCCC;\" colspan=\"4\"|New Generation |- !! style=\"background-color: #CCCCCC;\"|Member !! style=\"background-color: #CCCCCC;\"|Year !! style=\"background-color: #CCCCCC;\"|Entrance order |- |- | Jo\u00e3o Augusto Matos || 2002\u201305 || First formation |- | B\u00e1rbara L\u00edvia || 2002\u201305 || First formation |- | Caroline Sayuri || 2002\u201305 || First formation |- | Yago Piemonte || 2002\u201305 || First formation |- |} == See also == *Turma do Bal\u00e3o M\u00e1gico == References == Category:Musical groups established in 1984 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1992 Category:Brazilian pop music groups Category:Child musical groups Category:RCA Records artists ",
