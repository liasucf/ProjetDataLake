    "text": "Assai tranquillo, in B minor, is a work written for cello and piano by Felix Mendelssohn. The piece was composed on 25 July 1835 on a journey from D\u00fcsseldorf to Leipzig. Mendelssohn dedicated it to the cellist Julius Rietz, who was the composer's assistant Kapellmeister in D\u00fcsseldorf. The piece, whose parts serenely weave together, passing the melody and the running eighth notes back and forth, was likely left incomplete, as it ends with a pause on the dominant, an F\u266f. The piece was not published until 1962, when a reproduction of the facsimile was included in Reinhold Sietz's article Das Stammbuch von Julius Rietz, and was first recorded by Hyperion Records on their recording of Mendelssohn's complete works for cello and piano. ==References== ==External links== * Performance by Julian Arp and Caspar Frantz on Youtube Category:Chamber music by Felix Mendelssohn Category:Compositions for cello and piano Category:Unfinished musical compositions Category:1835 compositions Category:Compositions in B minor ",
