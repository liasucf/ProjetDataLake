He won a bronze medal in the 20 mile walk at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica, which was his last international tournament. Read continued competing domestically for another 18 years, retiring at the age 52. He won 18 national titles, placing second thrice and third four times. On 29 August 1968 Read married Megan Ann Crafar in Whangarei; they had three daughters and a son. After moving to New Plymouth, he founded New Zealand\u2019s first race walking club.
