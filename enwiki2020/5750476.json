Furthermore, there is a special media section included for web access, albums, a short biography and videos. The two videos are for the songs \"Evil eye\" off The Action is Go and the title track \"King of the Road\". *The last track, \"Freedom of Choice\", is a cover of the song originally sung by Devo. *\"Blue Tile Fever\" is a song about skateboarding in a swimming pool made famous by the Z-Boys during the water shortage in California in the 1970s. The goal was to skate up and over the blue tiles around the top of the pool. It also hints that the Z-Boys were the coolest kids around and the \"crowd splits wherever they go\". *The van on the cover is a 1960s Ford Econoline van. Custom van culture features heavily in many of the songs on the album. *\"Invisible\" by Danko Jones (from the album \"Sleep is the Enemy\") with guest vocals by John Garcia (Hermano, ex-Kyuss) is based on the Fu Manchu song \"Hell on wheels\" from the album King of the Road. *\"Frieda und die Bomben\" by Beatsteaks is based on the song \"Hell on wheels\". *The title track \"King of the Road\" was used as the intro music on the radio show Loveline for about 3 years starting in late 2000. ==References== Category:2000 albums Category:Fu Manchu (band) albums Category:Mammoth Records albums Category:Albums produced by Joe Barresi ",
