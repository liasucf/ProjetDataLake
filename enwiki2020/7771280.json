    "text": "\"When A Child Is Born\" is a popular Christmas song. The original melody was \"Soleado\", a tune from 1974 by Ciro Dammicco (alias Zacar), composer for Italy's Daniel Sentacruz Ensemble, and Dario Baldan Bembo. The tune was based on Damicco's earlier tune \"Le rose blu\" published in 1972. The English language lyrics were written a few years later by Fred Jay (Friedrich Alex Jacobson IPI number 00015195204, who wrote many hits for Boney M such as Rasputin and Ma Baker). They do not make specific mention of Christmas. Fred Jay's lyrics have been sung by many artists, most successfully by Johnny Mathis in 1976, whose version was the Christmas number one in the UK. ==Performances== \"Soleado\" is used in the 1975 Argentinean film Nazareno Cruz y el lobo (The Love of the Wolf), and it is credited as \"Theme From the Motion Picture 'The Love of the Wolf'\" on Mathis's album Johnny Mathis Sings the Movie Greats (CBS). Artists who have performed the song include: *ACM Gospel Choir in their 2008 Mail on Sunday giveaway CD Christmas with the Choir *Boney M. in their 1981 Christmas Album *Bing Crosby included in his album Beautiful Memories (1976) *Cissy Houston *Lutricia McNeal who reached the UK top twenty in 1998 *G4 *Matt Monro *Judy Collins in her 1987 album Trust Your Heart *Kamahl *Kenny Rogers *Sarah Brightman in her 2008 holiday CD A Winter Symphony *Charlotte Church in her 2000 holiday CD Dream a Dream *Tarja Turunen *The Moody Blues in their 2003 album December *Willie Nelson *Paulini *Il Divo, in their 2005 album The Christmas Collection. ===English covers=== *Michael Holm (Germany) (also see below).

Entitled \"When A Child Is Born (Soleado)\" with B-side as \"Every Time You Touch Me (I Get High)\", it became Johnny Mathis' sole number one single in the UK Singles Chart, spending three weeks at the top of the chart in December 1976, including the coveted Christmas number one slot, and selling 885,000 copies. In the US, it appeared in the Record World survey in both the Christmas seasons of 1976 and 1977, reaching a maximum position of No. 123, and racking up 10 chart weeks. In addition, Mathis re-recorded the song as a duet with Gladys Knight and the Pips. This version reached Record World No. 137 during the Christmas season of 1980, and the UK Singles Chart at No. 79. ==Language versions== *In 1974, the melody was sung with Spanish lyrics by Manolo Otero and entitled \"Todo el tiempo del mundo\" (translation: All The Time Of The World). *The same melody was used with German lyrics by Michael Holm in \"Tr\u00e4nen l\u00fcgen nicht\" (translation: Tears Don't Lie) in 1974. In German, the song is totally unrelated to Christmas. The singer asks a guy to reconsider breaking up with his girl because her tears don't lie. **The Michael Holm version of \"Tears Don't Lie\", with the Fred Jay lyrics performed in English, was a minor hit in the US, reaching #53 on Billboard's Hot 100, #7 on Billboard's Easy Listening Top 50. The tune was used for Mark 'Oh's 1995 dance hit, also called \"Tears Don't Lie\". *In 1975 the melody was used with French language lyrics, written by Henri Dijan and sung by Mireille Mathieu \"\" (translation: \"We can't go on living without our saying farewell\"). The lyrics completely changed to a story about a 16-year-old girl whose love was denied by the boys father, whose son was expected to marry a better woman after his education and military service. *It was sung with Hungarian lyrics by Zsuzsa Cserh\u00e1ti \"\u00c9des kisfiam\" (\"My sweet son\"). In 1975 Iv\u00e1n Brad\u00e1nyi wrote the lyrics of this song for Cserh\u00e1ti after her son was born. *Turkish star [Nese Karabocek] sang this beautiful song with Turkish language lyrics.
