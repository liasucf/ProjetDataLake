He succeeded his father as king in 1628. At the same time, he appointed his uncle Outey as regent, assuming the title uprayorach (\u17a7\u1797\u1799\u17c4\u179a\u17b6\u1787), the title usually borne by kings who had abdicated but retained executive powers. Ponhea To was betrothed to his half-sister Ang Vathi, however, Ang Vathi later married Outey. In 1630, he fell deeply in love with Ang Vathi while on a visit to Angkor. The lovers eloped but both were killed by Outey's foreign mercenaries in Khsach Kandal. ==References== * Chroniques Royales du Cambodge de 1594 \u00e0 1677. \u00c9cole fran\u00e7aise d'Extr\u00eame Orient.
