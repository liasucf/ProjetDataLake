    "text": "Clifford Forsythe (25 August 1929 \u2013 27 April 2000) was a Northern Ireland Ulster Unionist Party politician. He was Member of Parliament for South Antrim from 1983 to his death. ==Early life== He was a footballer with Derry City and Linfield Football Clubs. He won several footballing medals, and was described as a 'fine, speedy winger'. ==Career== He had previously been Mayor of Newtownabbey Borough Council, and was also a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly from 1982 to 1986. He also once served as the President of the Northern Ireland Institute of Plumbing. Forsythe was the constituency election agent for Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux, and later won the same seat, albeit with a reduced majority, in 1983. In his paper Quangopus Government published by the Ulster Unionist Party in June 1992, Forsythe \u2013 as the then UUP Spokesman on Local Government \u2013 argued for devolution of responsibility to locally elected representatives. In 1996, Forsythe survived an attempt to deselect him as an MP. ==Political views== Like Molyneaux, Forsythe opposed the Good Friday Agreement and supported proposals for a Northern Ireland-wide administrative assembly/regional council (with powers broadly analogous to the National Assembly for Wales) to administer legislation and public services that were, at that time, administered by Northern Ireland Office Ministers, civil servants and quangos. On more than one occasion, Forsythe claimed that his experience \u2013 both in the 1982\u201386 Northern Ireland Assembly and as a Past Vice-Chairman of the Ulster Monday Club \u2013 led him to conclude that the unimplemented 1979 Conservative General Election Manifesto commitment to administrative devolution in Northern Ireland offered the way forward for Northern Ireland. He was an active member of the House of Commons' Social Security Select Committee from 1991\u20131997, and the Environment, Transport and the Regions Select Committee from 1997 until his death in 2000. Shortly before his death, Forsythe criticised the Government for its failure to tackle social security fraud by paramilitary groups. He argued that air travel between Great Britain and Northern Ireland should be exempt from air passenger duty, on the basis that the tax unfairly disadvantaged Northern Ireland compared with the rest of the United Kingdom given the limited alternative means of travelling between Belfast and London. ==References== == External links == * Category:1929 births Category:2000 deaths Category:Linfield F.C. players Category:Derry City F.C. players Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for County Antrim constituencies (since 1922) Category:Northern Ireland MPAs 1982\u20131986 Category:Ulster Unionist Party members of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom Category:Mayors of Newtownabbey Category:Members of Newtownabbey Borough Council Category:UK MPs 1983\u20131987 Category:UK MPs 1987\u20131992 Category:UK MPs 1992\u20131997 Category:UK MPs 1997\u20132001 Category:People who died in office Category:Association footballers not categorized by position Category:Association footballers from Northern Ireland ",
