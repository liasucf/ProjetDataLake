### ProjetDataLake

## Projet Description: 

This code was made for the Big Data Management - Data Lake projet for the Master Data Mining of University Lyon 2 in 2022. 
The code has the creation of Intra, Inter and Global Metada for the textual corpus of a wikipedia dataset.
Also we deal with stocking this information into a MongoDB and Neo4j databases. 

This code is written on python with the help of some standard libraries. 

## How to Run: 

The main code is separate into three files: metadata_mongodb.py , metadata_neo4j.py and 
The metadata_mongodb.py file is reponsable for creating the Intra-metada and stocking in a MongoDB database, and also
doing some simple text analysis.
The metadata_neo4j.py file is reponsable for creating the Inter-metada and stocking in a Neo4j database.
