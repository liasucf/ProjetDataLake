It was the sixth university to be established in Central EuropePrague (1348), Krak\u00f3w (1364), Vienna (1365), P\u00e9cs (1367), Heidelberg (1386), Cologne (1388) and, although it closed in 1798 before being re-established in 1919, it is now one of the largest universities in Germany with more than 48,000 students. The University of Cologne is a German Excellence University. ==History== First building of the new university ===1388\u20131798=== The University of Cologne was established in 1388 as the fourth university in the Holy Roman Empire, after the Charles University of Prague (1348), the University of Vienna (1365) and the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg (1386). The charter was signed by Pope Urban VI. The university began teaching on 6 January 1389. In 1798, the university was abolished by the French, who had invaded Cologne in 1794, because under the new French constitution, many universities were abolished all over France. The last rector Ferdinand Franz Wallraf was able to preserve the university's Great Seal, now once more in use. ===1919\u2013today=== Main building, by architect Adolf Abel, 1934 In 1919, the Prussian government endorsed a decision by the Cologne City Council to re-establish the university. This was considered to be a replacement for the loss of the University of Strasbourg on the west bank of the Rhine, which contemporaneously reverted to France with the rest of Alsace. On 29 May 1919, the Cologne Mayor Konrad Adenauer signed the charter of the modern university. At that point, the new university was located in Neustadt-S\u00fcd, but relocated to its current campus in Lindenthal on 2 November 1934. The old premises are now being used for the Cologne University of Applied Sciences. Initially, the university was composed of the Faculty of Business, Economics and Social Sciences (successor to the Institutes of Commerce and of Communal and Social Administration) and the Faculty of Medicine (successor to the Academy of Medicine). In 1920, the Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Arts were added, from which latter the School of Mathematics and Natural Sciences was split off in 1955 to form a separate Faculty. In 1980, the two Cologne departments of the Rhineland School of Education were attached to the university as the Faculties of Education and of Special Education. In 1988, the university became a founding member of the Community of European Management Schools and International Companies (CEMS), today's Global Alliance in Management Education. The University is a leader in the area of economics and is regularly placed in top positions for law and business, both for national and international rankings. ==Organization== mensa (the university canteen) The University of Cologne is a statutory corporation (K\u00f6rperschaft des \u00f6ffentlichen Rechts), operated by the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia. ===Faculties=== The university is divided into six faculties, which together offer 200 fields of study. The faculties are those of Management, Economics and Social Sciences, Law, Medicine (with the affiliated University clinic), Arts, Mathematics and Natural Sciences and Human Sciences. {| class=wikitable |- !faculty !students |- |20px Faculty of Management, Economics and Social Sciences ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|ca. 10,000 |- |20px Faculty of Law||style=\"text-align:right;\"|ca. 5,000 |- |15px Faculty of Medicine with University Hospital of Cologne||style=\"text-align:right;\"|ca. 3,200 |- |15px Faculty of Arts and Humanities||style=\"text-align:right;\"|ca. 16,500 |- |15px Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences||style=\"text-align:right;\"|ca. 7,500 |- | Faculty of Human Sciences||style=\"text-align:right;\"|ca. 2,800 |} ===Rectors=== Axel Freimuth, 2007 On 24 November 2004, the physicist Axel Freimuth was elected as Rector of the University.
