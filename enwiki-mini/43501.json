    "text": "Edith Stein (religious name Teresia Benedicta a Cruce ; also known as St. Edith Stein or St. Teresia Benedicta of the Cross; 12 October 1891 \u2013 9 August 1942) was a German Jewish philosopher who converted to Catholicism and became a Discalced Carmelite nun. She is canonized as a martyr and saint of the Catholic Church, and she is one of six co-patron saints of Europe. She was born into an observant Jewish family, but had become an atheist by her teenage years. Moved by the tragedies of World War I, in 1915 she took lessons to become a nursing assistant and worked in an infectious diseases hospital. After completing her doctoral thesis at the University of Freiburg in 1916, she obtained an assistantship there. From reading the works of the reformer of the Carmelite Order, Teresa of \u00c1vila, she was drawn to the Catholic faith. She was baptized on 1 January 1922 into the Catholic Church. At that point, she wanted to become a Discalced Carmelite nun, but was dissuaded by her spiritual mentors. She then taught at a Catholic school of education in Speyer. As a result of the requirement of an \"Aryan certificate\" for civil servants promulgated by the Nazi government in April 1933 as part of its Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, she had to quit her teaching position. Edith Stein was admitted as a postulant to the Discalced Carmelite monastery in Cologne on 15th October, on the feast of Saint Teresa of Avila, and received the religious habitas a novice in April 1934, taking the religious name Teresia Benedicta of the Cross. In 1938, she and her sister Rosa, by then also a convert and an extern sister (tertiaries of the Order, who would handle the community\u2032s needs outside the monastery), were sent to the Carmelite monastery in Echt, Netherlands, for their safety. Despite the Nazi invasion of that state in 1940, they remained undisturbed until they were arrested by the Nazis on 2 August 1942 and sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where they died in the gas chamber on 9 August 1942. ==Early life== Stein was born in Breslau (now Wroc\u0142aw, Poland), Lower Silesia, into an observant Jewish family. She was the youngest of 11 children and was born on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Hebrew calendar, which combined to make her a favorite of her mother. She was a very gifted child who enjoyed learning, in a home where her mother encouraged critical thinking, and she greatly admired her mother's strong religious faith. By her teenage years, however, Stein had become an atheist. Though her father died while she was young, her widowed mother was determined to give her children a thorough education and consequently sent Stein to study at the University of Breslau (also known as \"Schlesische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit\u00e4t\"). ==Academic career== In April 1913 Stein arrived at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in order to study for the summer semester with Edmund Husserl. By the end of the summer she had decided to pursue her doctoral degree in philosophy under Husserl and chose empathy as her thesis topic. Her studies were interrupted in July 1914 because of the outbreak of World War I. She then served as a volunteer wartime Red Cross nurse in an infectious diseases hospital at M\u00e4risch-Weisskirchen in 1915. In 1916, Stein moved to the University of Freiburg in order to complete her dissertation on Empathy.Elisa Magr\u00ec, Dermot Moran (eds.), Empathy, Sociality, and Personhood: Essays on Edith Stein's Phenomenological Investigations, Springer, 2018, p. 12. Shortly before receiving her degree from Freiburg she agreed to become Husserl's assistant there. Her dissertation entitled Das Einf\u00fchlungsproblem in seiner historischen Entwicklung und in ph\u00e4nomenologischer BetrachtungEdith Stein \u2013 History of Women Philosophers and Scientists (The Empathy Problem as it Developed Historically and Considered Phenomenologically) was awarded a doctorate in philosophy with the summa cum laude honor. Stein then became a member of the faculty at Freiburg, where she worked until 1918 as a teaching assistant to Husserl, who had transferred to that institution. The University of G\u00f6ttingen rejected her habilitation thesis in 1919. Although Stein passed her doctoral examination with distinction, her attempts to habilitate failed due to the fact that Stein was a woman. Her rejected habilitation thesis, Beitr\u00e4ge zur philosophischen Begr\u00fcndung der Psychologie und der Geisteswissenschaften (Contributions to the Philosophical Foundations of Psychology and the Human Sciences), was published in the Jahrbuch f\u00fcr Philosophie und ph\u00e4nomenologische Forschung in 1922. While Stein had earlier contacts with Catholicism, it was her reading of the autobiography of the mystic Teresa of \u00c1vila during summer holidays in Bad Bergzabern in 1921 that prompted her conversion and eventually the desire to seek the life of a Discalced Carmelite. Baptized on 1 January 1922, and dissuaded by her spiritual advisers from immediately seeking entry to the enclosed and hidden life of a Carmelite nun, Stein obtained a position to teach at the Dominican nuns' school in Speyer from 1923 to 1931. While there, Stein translated Thomas Aquinas' De Veritate (Of Truth) into German, familiarized herself with Catholic philosophy in general, and tried to bridge the phenomenology of her former teacher, Husserl, to Thomism. She visited Husserl and Heidegger at Freiburg in April 1929, the same month that Heidegger gave a speech to Husserl on his 70th birthday. In 1932 she became a lecturer at the Catholic Church- affiliated Institute for Scientific Pedagogy in M\u00fcnster, but antisemitic legislation passed by the Nazi government forced her to resign the post in 1933. In a letter to Pope Pius XI, she denounced the Nazi regime and asked the Pope to openly denounce the regime \"to put a stop to this abuse of Christ's name.\" Her letter received no answer, and it is not known for certain whether the Pope ever read it. However, in 1937 the Pope issued an encyclical written in German, Mit brennender Sorge (With Burning Anxiety), in which he criticized Nazism, listed violations of the Concordat between Germany and the Church of 1933, and condemned antisemitism. ==Discalced Carmelite nun and martyr== Stein entered the Discalced Carmelite monastery St. Maria vom Frieden (Our Lady of Peace) in Cologne-Lindenthal in 1933 and took the religious name Teresia Benedicta a Cruce (Teresia Benedicta of the Cross). In Cologne she wrote her metaphysical book Endliches und ewiges Sein (Finite and Eternal Being), which attempted to combine the philosophies of St. Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus and Husserl. To avoid the growing Nazi threat, the Order transferred Edith and her sister, Rosa, who was also a convert and an extern sister of the Carmel, to the Discalced Carmelite monastery in Echt, Netherlands. There she wrote Studie \u00fcber Joannes a Cruce: Kreuzeswissenschaft (\"Studies on John of the Cross: The Science of the Cross\"). In her testament of 9 June 1939https://www.haaretz.com/.premium-this-day-jewish-convert- beatified-1.5246811 she wrote: \"I beg the Lord to take my life and my death \u2026 for all concerns of the sacred hearts of Jesus and Mary and the holy church, especially for the preservation of our holy order, in particular the Carmelite monasteries of Cologne and Echt, as atonement for the unbelief of the Jewish People, and that the Lord will be received by his own people and his kingdom shall come in glory, for the salvation of Germany and the peace of the world, at last for my loved ones, living or dead, and for all God gave to me: that none of them shall go astray.\" Stein's move to Echt prompted her to be more devout and even more observant of the Carmelite rule. After having her teaching position revoked by the implementation of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, Stein quickly eased back into the role of instructor at the convent in Echt, teaching both fellow sisters and students within the community Latin and philosophy.Mosley, J. (2006). The Ultimate Sacrifice. In Edith Stein: Modern Saint and Martyr (pp. 43-52). Mahwah, N.J.: HiddenSpring. Even prior to the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, Stein believed she would not survive the war, going so far as to write the Prioress to request her permission to \"allow [Stein] to offer [her]self to the heart of Jesus as a sacrifice of atonement for true peace\" and made a will. Her fellow sisters would later recount how Stein began \"quietly training herself for life in a concentration camp, by enduring cold and hunger\" after the Nazi invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940. Ultimately, she would not be safe in the Netherlands. The Dutch Bishops' Conference had a public statement read in all churches across the nation on 20 July 1942 condemning Nazi racism. In a retaliatory response on 26 July 1942 the Reichskommissar of the Netherlands, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, ordered the arrest of all Jewish converts who had previously been spared. Along with two hundred and forty-three baptized Jews living in the Netherlands, Stein was arrested by the SS on 2 August 1942. Stein and her sister Rosa were imprisoned at the concentration camps of Amersfoort and Westerbork before being deported to Auschwitz. A Dutch official at Westerbork was so impressed by her sense of faith and calm, he offered her an escape plan. Stein vehemently refused his assistance, stating: \"If somebody intervened at this point and took away [her] chance to share in the fate of [her] brothers and sisters, that would be utter annihilation.\" On 7 August 1942, early in the morning, 987 Jews were deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp. It was probably on 9 August that Sister Teresia Benedicta of the Cross, her sister, and many more of her people were killed in a mass gas chamber. ==Legacy and veneration== Stein was beatified as a martyr on 1 May 1987 in Cologne, Germany, by Pope John Paul II and then canonized by him 11 years later on 11 October 1998 in Vatican City. The miracle that was the basis for her canonization is the cure of Benedicta McCarthy, a little girl who had swallowed a large amount of paracetamol (acetaminophen), which causes hepatic necrosis. The young girl's father, Emmanuel Charles McCarthy, a priest of the Melkite Greek Catholic Church, immediately called together relatives and prayed for Teresia's intercession. Shortly thereafter the nurses in the intensive care unit saw her sit up, completely healthy. Ronald Kleinman, a pediatric specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who treated the girl, testified about her recovery to Church tribunals, stating: \"I was willing to say that it was miraculous.\" McCarthy would later attend Sr. Teresia Benedicta's canonization. Teresia Benedicta of the Cross is one of the six patron saints of Europe, together with Benedict of Nursia, Cyril and Methodius, Bridget of Sweden, and Catherine of Siena. Today there are many schools named in tribute to her, for example in Darmstadt, Germany, Hengelo, Netherlands, and Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Also named for her are a women's dormitory at the University of T\u00fcbingen and a classroom building at The College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. The philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre published a book in 2006 titled Edith Stein: A Philosophical Prologue, 1913\u20131922, in which he contrasted her living of her own personal philosophy with Martin Heidegger, whose actions during the Nazi era, according to MacIntyre, suggested a \"bifurcation of personality.\" Playwright Arthur Giron wrote Edith Stein, a play that was inspired by Stein's life. It was produced at the Pittsburgh Public Theater in 1988. In 1995, Hungarian film director M\u00e1rta M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros made a movie about the life and death of Edith Stein with the title A hetedik szoba (The Seventh Room/Chamber), starring Maia Morgenstern. In 1999, a memorial statue by German sculptor Bert Gerresheim was dedicated in Cologne, Germany. The statue comprises three different views of Stein reflecting her Jewish and Christian faith, and a pile of empty shoes representing the victims of the holocaust. In 2007, Stein's life and work was dramatised in the novel Winter Under Water (Picador, London) by author James Hopkin. In 2008, a memorial Stolperstein () was placed near Stein's childhood home at 38 ul. Nowowiejska (formerly the Michaelisstrasse) in Wroc\u0142aw. In 2009 her bust was installed at the Walhalla Memorial near Regensburg, Germany. In June 2009 the International Association for the Study of the Philosophy of Edith Stein (IASPES) was founded, and held its first international conference at Maynooth University, Ireland, in order to advance the philosophical writings of Stein. On 6 June 2014, the 70th anniversary of D-Day, a bell dedicated to her was named by Prince Charles at Bayeux Cathedral. Also in 2014, the book Edith Stein and Regina Jonas: Religious Visionaries in the Time of the Death Camps, by Emily Leah Silverman, was published. ==Controversy as to the cause of her murder== The beatification of St. Teresia Benedicta as a martyr generated criticism. Critics argued that she was murdered because she was Jewish by birth, rather than for her Catholic faith,Abraham Foxman, Leon Klenicki (October 1998). \"The Canonization of Edith Stein: An Unnecessary Problem\" , Anti-Defamation League. and that, in the words of Daniel Polish, the beatification seemed to \"carry the tacit message encouraging conversionary activities\" because \"official discussion of the beatification seemed to make a point of conjoining Stein's Catholic faith with her death with 'fellow Jews' in Auschwitz.\"Thomas A. Idinopulos (Spring 1998). \"The Unnecessary Problem of Edith Stein\". Journal of Ecumenical Studies. The position of the Catholic Church is that St. Teresia Benedicta also died because of the Dutch episcopacy's public condemnation of Nazi racism in 1942; in other words, that she died because of the moral teaching of the Church and is thus a true martyr. ==Gallery== File:PikiWiki Israel 28182 Memorial to Saint Edith Stein in Stella Maris chur.JPG|Memorial to Edith Stein in Stella Maris Monastery, Haifa, Israel File:Plum Edith Stein und Maximilian Kolbe.JPG|The Martyrdom of Edith Stein depicted in a stained glass work by AliA, in Kassel, Germany File:Praha edith stein.JPG|Memorial to Edith Stein in Prague, Czech Republic File:Edith-Stein-Tafel.jpg|Edith Stein in a relief by Heinrich Schreiber in the Church of Our Lady in Wittenberg, Germany File:Bergzabern Edith-Stein Secretum-meum-mihi.jpg|Sculpture near her baptismal church in Bad Bergzabern with her answer, '''' File:Bad Bergzabern- St Martin-36-Edith Stein-2019-gje.jpg|Icon in her baptismal church in Bad Bergzabern File:Stolperstein K\u00f6ln, Edith Stein (D\u00fcrener Stra\u00dfe 89).jpg|alt=Stolperstein for Edith Stein.| Stolperstein] for Edith Stein ==Writings translated into English== * Life in a Jewish Family: Her Unfinished Autobiographical Account, translated by Sister Josephine Koeppel, O.C.D., from The Collected Works of Edith Stein, Volume 1, ICS Publications, 1986 * On the Problem of Empathy, translated by Waltraut Stein, from The Collected Works of Edith Stein, Volume 3, ICS Publications, 1989 * Essays on Woman, translated by Freda Mary Oben, 1996 * The Hidden Life, translated by Sister Josephine Koeppel, O.C.D., 1993 * The Science of the Cross, translated by Sister Josephine Koeppel, O.C.D.
