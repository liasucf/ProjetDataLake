    "text": "Group process consultation consists of activities designed to increase group awareness and understanding, so that the group or organization can take steps to improve the way that its members work together. The consultant or trainer observes the interactions between members of the organization in the normal flow of work and in the conduct of meetings. The trainer or consultant then provides feedback to members of the organization or group to help them learn to identify the attitudes and behaviors that help or hinder the group's success, and to take steps to improve the way the group functions.
