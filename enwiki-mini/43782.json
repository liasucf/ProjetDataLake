The mountainous spine which separates the east and west coasts of Scotland can be seen. D\u00e1l Riata or D\u00e1l Riada (also Dalriada) () was a Gaelic kingdom that encompassed the western seaboard of Scotland and the north-eastern corner of Ireland, on each side of the North Channel. At its height in the 6th and 7th centuries, it covered what is now Argyll (\"Coast of the Gaels\") in Scotland and part of County Antrim in Northern Ireland.Clancy, Thomas Owen, \"Philosopher King: Nechtan mac Der Ilei,\" SHR 83 (2004): 135\u2013149 After a period of expansion, D\u00e1l Riata eventually became associated with the Gaelic Kingdom of Alba. Oxford Companion to Scottish History p. 161\u2013162, edited by Michael Lynch, Oxford University Press. . In Argyll, it consisted of four main kindreds, each with their own chief: Cen\u00e9l nGabr\u00e1in (based in Kintyre), Cen\u00e9l n\u00d3engusa (based on Islay), Cen\u00e9l Loairn (who gave their name to the district of Lorn) and Cen\u00e9l Comgaill (who gave their name to Cowal). The hillfort of Dunadd is believed to have been its capital. Other royal forts included Dunollie, Dunaverty and Dunseverick. Within D\u00e1l Riata was the important monastery of Iona, which played a key role in the spread of Celtic Christianity throughout northern Britain, and in the development of insular art. Iona was a centre of learning and produced many important manuscripts. D\u00e1l Riata had a strong seafaring culture and a large naval fleet. D\u00e1l Riata is said to have been founded by the legendary king Fergus M\u00f3r (Fergus the Great) in the 5th century. The kingdom reached its height under \u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in (). During his reign D\u00e1l Riata's power and influence grew; it carried out naval expeditions to Orkney and the Isle of Man, and assaults on the Brittonic kingdom of Strathclyde and Anglian kingdom of Bernicia. However, King \u00c6thelfrith of Bernicia checked its growth at the Battle of Degsastan in 603. Serious defeats in Ireland and Scotland during the reign of Domnall Brecc (died 642) ended D\u00e1l Riata's \"golden age\", and the kingdom became a client of Northumbria for a time. In the 730s the Pictish king \u00d3engus I led campaigns against D\u00e1l Riata and brought it under Pictish overlordship by 741. There is disagreement over the fate of the kingdom from the late 8th century onwards. Some scholars have seen no revival of D\u00e1l Riatan power after the long period of foreign domination ( to ), while others have seen a revival under \u00c1ed Find (736\u2013778). Some even claim that the D\u00e1l Riata usurped the kingship of Fortriu. From 795 onward there were sporadic Viking raids in D\u00e1l Riata. In the following century, there may have been a merger of the D\u00e1l Riatan and Pictish crowns. Some sources say Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn (Kenneth MacAlpin) was king of D\u00e1l Riata before becoming king of the Picts in 843, following a disastrous defeat of the Picts by Vikings.Smyth, and Bannerman, Scottish Takeover, present this case, arguing that Pictish kings from Ciniod son of Uuredech and Caustant\u00edn onwards were descendants of Fergus mac Echdach and Feradach, son of Selbach mac Ferchair. Broun's Pictish Kings offers an alternative reconstruction, and one which has attracted considerable support, e.g. Clancy, \"Iona in the kingdom of the Picts: a note\", Woolf, Pictland to Alba, pp 57\u201367. The kingdom's independence ended sometime after, as it merged with Pictland to form the Kingdom of Alba. Latin sources often referred to the inhabitants of D\u00e1l Riata as Scots (Scoti), a name originally used by Roman and Greek writers for the Irish Gaels who raided and colonized Roman Britain. Later, it came to refer to Gaels, whether from Ireland or elsewhere.Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, p. 159\u2013160, considers whether the Latin terms Scotti and Atacotti refer to the confederations in Ulster and Leinster respectively. The etymology of Scotti, and its Gaelic roots, if any, are uncertain. The term in late Classical sources is either specifically linked to raiders from Ireland, or is geographically ambiguous. In sharp contrast, no clear reference pointing to Scotti in Scotland in the Roman period has been found. Despite several references listing different combinations of Picti, Scotti, Hiberni, Attecotti and Saxons together as later Roman Britain's archetypal enemies, it is worth noting that 'Scotti' and 'Hiberni' are never listed together, confirming that they were then, as they were later, alternative names for the Irish or confederations of the Irish. Regardless of the original sense, or its modern popularity, to use the term \"Scot\" in this context invites confusion. They are referred to herein as Gaels or as D\u00e1l Riatans.See 1066 And All That, p. 5, for a parody of the confusion the word \"Scot\" engenders in this context. ==Name== The name ' is derived from Old Irish. ', from Proto-Celtic *d\u0101lom, means 'portion' or 'share' (as in 'a portion of land'); Riata or Riada is believed to be a personal name.Bede, HE, Book I, Chapter 1. Thus, the name refers to \"Riada's portion\" of territory in the area. The Dalradian geological series, a term coined by Archibald Geikie in 1891, was named after D\u00e1l Riata because its outcrop has a similar geographical reach to that of the former kingdom. ==People, land and sea== Ulster and the Hebrides D\u00e1l Riata spanned the North Channel and included parts of western Scotland and northeastern Ireland. In Scotland, it corresponded roughly to Argyll (from Airer Go\u00eddel, \"coast of the Gaels\") and later grew to include Skye. In Ireland, it took in the northeast of County Antrim, roughly corresponding to the baronies of Cary and Glenarm.Boyd, Hugh Alexander. Irish Dalriada. The Glynns: Journal of The Glens of Antrim Historical Society. Volume 76 (1978). The modern human landscape of D\u00e1l Riata differs a great deal from that of the first millennium. Most people today live in settlements far larger than anything known in early times, while some areas, such as Kilmartin, and many of the islands, such as Islay and Tiree, may well have had as many inhabitants as they do today. Many of the small settlements have now disappeared, so that the countryside is far emptier than was formerly the case, and many areas that were formerly farmed are now abandoned. Even the physical landscape is not entirely as it was: sea-levels have changed, and the combination of erosion and silting will have considerably altered the shape of the coast in some places, while the natural accumulation of peat and man-made changes from peat-cutting have altered inland landscapes.See McDonald, Kingdom of the Isles, pp.10\u201320, for a short discussion of the geography of D\u00e1l Riata in Scotland. As was normal at the time, subsistence farming was the occupation of most people. Oats and barley were the main cereal crops. Pastoralism was especially important, and transhumance (the seasonal movement of people with their livestock between fixed summer and winter pastures) was the practice in many places. Some areas, most notably Islay, were especially fertile, and good grazing would have been available all year round, just as it was in Ireland. Tiree was famed in later times for its oats and barley, while smaller, uninhabited islands were used to keep sheep. The area, until lately, was notable for its inshore fisheries, and for plentiful shellfish, therefore seafood is likely to have been an important part of the diet.Campbell, Saints and Sea-kings, pp. 22\u201329; Foster, Picts, Gaels and Scots, pp. 49\u201359. The Senchus fer n-Alban lists three main kin groups in D\u00e1l Riata in Scotland, with a fourth being added later:The Senchus is translated in Bannerman, Studies, pp. 47\u201349; previously published in Celtica, vols. 7 (1966) \u2013 9 (1971); earlier translations in Anderson, ESSH, vol. 1, pp. cl\u2013cliii and Skene, Chronicles of the Picts and Scots. * The Cen\u00e9l nGabr\u00e1in (kindred of Gabr\u00e1n) in Kintyre, who claimed descent from Gabr\u00e1n mac Domangairt. * The Cen\u00e9l n\u00d3engusa (kindred of \u00d3engus) in Islay and Jura, who claimed descent from \u00d3engus M\u00f3r mac Eirc. * The Cen\u00e9l Loairn (kindred of Loarn) in Lorne, perhaps also Mull and Ardnamurchan, who claimed descent from Loarn mac Eirc.Broun, \"\"D\u00e1l Riata\", notes that the Senchus treats the Cen\u00e9l Loairn differently. In fact, it lists the three (actually four) thirds of the Cen\u00e9l Loairn as the Cen\u00e9l Shalaig (or Cen\u00e9l Fergusa Shalaig), Cen\u00e9l Cathbath, Cen\u00e9l nEchdach and Cen\u00e9l Muiredaig. Even the compiler of the Senchus doubts whether their eponymous founders Fergus Shalaig, Cathbad, Eochaid and Muiredach were all sons of Loarn mac Eirc. * The Cen\u00e9l Comgaill (kindred of Comgall) in Cowal and Bute, a later addition, who claimed descent from Comgall mac Domangairt.Bannerman, Studies, p. 110, dates the separation of the Cen\u00e9l Comgaill from the Cen\u00e9l nGabr\u00e1in to around 700. They may have expanded eastwards into Strathearn during the 8th century.Clancy, Thomas Owen, \"Philosopher King: Nechtan mac Der Ilei,\" SHR 83 (2004): 135\u2013149 The Senchus does not list any kindreds in Ireland, but does list an apparently very minor kindred called Cen\u00e9l Chonchride in Islay descended from another son of Erc, Fergus Becc. Another kindred, Cen\u00e9l B\u00e1et\u00e1in of Morvern (later Clan MacInnes), branched off from Cen\u00e9l Loairn about the same time that Cen\u00e9l Comgaill separated from its parent kindred. The Morvern district was formerly known as Kinelvadon, after the Cen\u00e9l B\u00e1et\u00e1in.Watson, Celtic Place-names of Scotland, p. 122. The Cen\u00e9l Loairn may have been the largest of the \"three kindreds\", as the Senchus reports it being divided further into Cen\u00e9l Shalaig, Cen\u00e9l Cathbath, Cen\u00e9l nEchdach, Cen\u00e9l Murerdaig. Among the Cen\u00e9l Loairn it also lists the Airg\u00edalla, although whether this should be understood as being Irish settlers or simply another tribe to whom the label was applied is unclear. Bannerman proposes a tie to the U\u00ed Macc Uais.Bannerman, Studies, pp. 115\u2013118. See also Bannerman, Studies, pp. 120 & 122, noting that the Tripartite Life of Saint Patrick appears to refer to a \"Cen\u00e9l n\u00d3engusa\" in Antrim. The meaning of Airg\u00edalla 'hostage givers' adds to the uncertainty, although it must be observed that only one grouping in Ireland was apparently given this name and it is therefore very rare, perhaps supporting the Ui Macc Uais hypothesis. There is no reason to suppose that this is a complete or accurate list.The Annals of Ulster, s.a. 670, refer to the return of the genus Gartnaith, i.e. the Cen\u00e9l Gartnait, from Ireland to Skye. This Gartnait is presumed to be a son of \u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabra\u00edn: see Broun, \"D\u00e1l Riata\". Bannerman, Studies, pp. 92\u201394, identifies this Gartnait as a son of \u00c1ed\u00e1n, whom he sees as the same person as Gartnait, king of the Picts. No such son is named by Adomn\u00e1n, in the annals, or by the Senchus. See also Adomn\u00e1n, Life, II, 22, and note 258, where a certain Ioan mac Conaill mac Domnaill is said to have belonged to \"the royal lineage of Cen\u00e9l nGabr\u00e1in\". See also the discussion of the Cen\u00e9l Loairn above. Four sites in D\u00e1l Riata may have had royal associations: Dunadd, Dunollie, Dunaverty and Tarbert.L. Alcock, \"Early historic fortifications in Scotland\", in Guilbert (ed) 1981, pp. 150-180. Among them, Dunadd appears to have been the most important. It has been partly excavated, and weapons, quern-stones and many moulds for the manufacture of jewellery were found in addition to fortifications. Other high- status material included glassware and wine amphorae from Gaul, and in larger quantities than found elsewhere in Britain and Ireland. Lesser centres included Dun Ollaigh, seat of the Cen\u00e9l Loairn kings, and Dunaverty, at the southern end of Kintyre, in the lands of the Cen\u00e9l nGabr\u00e1in.Bannerman, Studies, pp. 111\u2013118; Campbell, Saints and Sea-kings, pp. 17\u201328; Foster, Picts, Gaels and Scots, pp. 65\u201368. The main royal centre in Ireland appears to have been at Dunseverick (D\u00fan Sebuirge).T. M. Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland (2000), pp. 57\u201361. D\u00e1l Riata had a strong seafaring culture.Marcus, G. J. The Conquest of the North Atlantic. Boydell & Brewer, 2007 [1980]. p.21 It was an archipelago with many islands and peninsulas. This, and the difficulty of overland travel, meant that travel by sea was the easiest means of moving any distance. As well as long distance trade, local trade must also have been significant.See Adomn\u00e1n, Life, note 72, where a trading fleet of 50 ships is mentioned; see also Bannerman, Studies, pp. 148\u2013154 for an analysis of Adomn\u00e1n's reports, and those in the annals, dealing with maritime matters. Currachs were probably the most common seagoing craft, and on inland waters dugouts and coracles were used. Large timber ships, called \"long ships\", perhaps similar to the Viking ships of the same name, are attested to in a variety of sources.Adomn\u00e1n, Life, note 297; Foster, Picts, Gaels and Scots, pp. 99\u2013100. D\u00e1l Riata had a large war fleet manned by skilled sailors, capable of undertaking far-reaching expeditions. It had an organized system for manning the fleet. Houses were grouped into twenties for the purpose of naval recruitment, with each group having to provide a quota of 28 oarsmen.Duffy, Se\u00e1n. Medieval Ireland: An Encyclopedia. Routledge, 2005. p.586 ==Religion and art== 9th-century St Martin's Cross on Iona. Saint Matthew, folio 28v in the Book of Kells No written accounts exist for pre-Christian D\u00e1l Riata, and the earliest known records come from the chroniclers of Iona and Irish monasteries. Adomn\u00e1n's Life of St Columba implies a Christian D\u00e1l Riata.Markus, \"Iona\"; Markus, \"Conversion\". Whether this is true cannot be known. The figure of Columba looms large in any history of Christianity in D\u00e1l Riata. Adomn\u00e1n's Life, although useful as a record, was not intended to serve as history, but rather as hagiography. Because the writing of the lives of the saints in Adomn\u00e1n's day had not reached the stylised formulas of the High Middle Ages, the Life contains a great deal of historically valuable information. It is also a vital linguistic source indicating the distribution of Gaelic and P-Celtic placenames in northern Scotland by the end of the 7th century. It famously notes Columba's need for a translator when conversing with an individual on Skye.As well as Sharpe's translation of Adomn\u00e1n's Life of St Columba, Broun & Clancy (eds.), Spes Scotorum, is essential reading on Columba, Iona and Scotland. This evidence of a non-Gaelic language is supported by a sprinkling of P-Celtic placenames on the remote mainland opposite the island.W.F.H. Nicolaisen, Scottish Placenames: Their study and significance (1976). Columba's founding Iona within the bounds of D\u00e1l Riata ensured that the kingdom would be of great importance in the spread of Christianity in northern Britain, not only to Pictland, but also to Northumbria, via Lindisfarne, to Mercia, and beyond. Although the monastery of Iona belonged to the Cen\u00e9l Conaill of the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, and not to D\u00e1l Riata, it had close ties to the Cen\u00e9l nGabr\u00e1in, ties which may make the annals less than entirely impartial.See, for example, Broun, \"D\u00e1l Riata\"; for the evidence of place-names as an indicator of Ionan influence, see Taylor, \"Iona abbots\". If Iona was the greatest religious centre in D\u00e1l Riata, it was far from unique. Lismore, in the territory of the Cen\u00e9l Loairn, was sufficiently important for the death of its abbots to be recorded with some frequency. Applecross, probably in Pictish territory for most of the period, and Kingarth on Bute are also known to have been monastic sites, and many smaller sites, such as on Eigg and Tiree, are known from the annals.Clancy, \"Church institutions\". In Ireland, Armoy was the main ecclesiastical centre in early times, associated with Saint Patrick and with Saint Olc\u00e1n, said to have been first bishop at Armoy. An important early centre, Armoy later declined, overshadowed by the monasteries at Movilla (Newtownards) and Bangor.Charles- Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, pp. 58\u201360. As well as their primary spiritual importance, the political significance of religious centres cannot be dismissed. The prestige of being associated with the saintly founder was of no small importance. Monasteries represented a source of wealth as well as prestige. Additionally, the learning and literacy found in monasteries served as useful tools for ambitious kings.Foster, Picts, Gaels and Scots, pp. 42\u201344, 94\u201395 & 104\u2013106. The illuminated manuscript Book of Kells was probably at least begun at Iona, although not by Columba as legend has it, as it dates from about 800 (it may have been commissioned to mark the bicentennial of Columba's death in 597). Whether it was or not, Iona was certainly important in the formation of Insular art, which combined Mediterranean, Anglo-Saxon, Celtic and Pictish elements into a style of which the book of Kells is a late example. For other arts, a number of sculptures remain to give an impression of D\u00e1l Riatan work. The St. Martin's Cross on Iona is the best-preserved high cross, probably inspired by Northumbrian free-standing crosses, such as the Ruthwell Cross, although a similar cross exists in Ireland (Ahenny, County Tipperary). The Kildalton Cross on Islay is similar. A sculpted slab at Ardchattan appears to show strong Pictish influences, while the Dupplin Cross, it has been argued, shows that influences also moved in the opposite direction. Fine Hiberno-Saxon metalwork such as penannular brooches is believed to have been created at Dunadd.Laing & Laing, The Picts and the Scots, pp 136\u2013137, deals with D\u00e1l Riatan arts at greater length; see also Ritchie, \"Culture: Picto-Celtic\". In addition to the monastic sites, a considerable number of churches are attested, not only from archaeological evidence, but also from the evidence of place-names. The element \"kil\", from Gaelic cill, can be shown in many cases to be associated with early churches, such as at Kilmartin by Dunadd.Markus, \"Religious life\". ==History== ===Origins=== Footprint (replicaRevealed: carved footprint marking Scotland's birth is a replica, The Herald, 22 September 2007.) used in king-making ceremonies, Dunadd The Duan Albanach (Song of the Scots) tells that the three sons of Erc\u2014Fergus M\u00f3r, Loarn and \u00d3engus\u2014conquered Alba (Scotland) in around 500. Bede offers a different, and probably older, account wherein D\u00e1l Riata was conquered by Irish Gaels led by a certain Reuda. Old Irish d\u00e1l means 'portion' or 'share', and is usually followed by the name of an eponymous founder. Bede's tale may come from the same root as the Irish tales of Cairpre Riata and his brothers, the S\u00edl Conairi (sons/descendants of Conaire M\u00f3r / Conaire C\u00f3em).Bannerman,Studies, pp. 122\u2013124. The story of D\u00e1l Riata moves from foundation myth to something nearer to history with the reports of the death of Comgall mac Domangairt around 540 and of his brother Gabr\u00e1n around 560.Annals of Ulster, death of Comgall s.a. 538, also s.a. 542, s.a. 545, death of Gabr\u00e1n s.a. 558, s.a. 560. The version of history in the Duan Albanach was long accepted, although it is preceded by the purely fictional tale of Albanus and Brutus conquering Britain. The presence of Gaelic in Scotland was seen as the result of either a large-scale migration from Ireland,See Mackie, A History of Scotland, pp. 18\u201319. Neither Smyth nor Laing & Laing accept the migration theory without reservation. or a takeover by Irish Gaelic elites. However, this theory is no longer universally accepted. In his academic paper Were the Scots Irish?, archaeologist Dr Ewan Campbell says that there is no archaeological or placename evidence of a migration or takeover.Campbell, Ewan. \"Were the Scots Irish?\" in Antiquity No. 75 (2001). pp. 285\u2013292. This lack of archaeological evidence was previously noted by Professor Leslie Alcock. Archaeological evidence shows that Argyll was different from Ireland, before and after the supposed migration, but that it also formed part of the Irish Sea province with Ireland, being easily distinguished from the rest of Scotland.Campbell, Saints and Sea-kings, pp. 8\u201315; Foster, Picts, Gaels and Scots, pp. 9\u201310; Broun, \"D\u00e1l Riata\"; Clancy, \"Ireland\"; Forsyth, \"Origins\", pp. 13\u201317. Campbell suggests that Argyll and Antrim formed a \"maritime province\", united by the sea and isolated from the rest of Scotland by the mountainous ridge called the Druim Alban. This allowed a shared language to be maintained through the centuries; Argyll remained Gaelic-speaking while the rest of Scotland was either Pictish or Brittonic- speaking. Campbell argues that the medieval accounts were a kind of dynastic propaganda, constructed to bolster a dynasty's claim to the throne and to bolster D\u00e1l Riata claims to territory in Antrim. This view of the medieval accounts is shared by other historians. However D\u00e1l Riata came to be, the time in which it arose was one of great instability in Ulster, following the Ulaid's loss of territory (including the ancient centre of Emain Macha) to the Airg\u00edalla and the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. Whether the two parts of D\u00e1l Riata had long been united, or whether a conquest in the 4th century or early 5th century, either of Antrim from Argyll, or vice versa, in line with myth, is not known. \"The thriving of Dalriada\", pp. 47\u201350, notes that a conquest of Irish D\u00e1l Riata from Scotland, in the period after the fall of Emain Macha, fits the facts as well as any other hypothesis. Linguistic and genealogical evidence associates ancestors of the D\u00e1l Riata with the prehistoric Iverni and Darini, suggesting kinship with the Ulaid and a number of shadowy kingdoms in distant Munster. The Robogdii have also been suggested as ancestral.see O'Rahilly's historical model Ultimately, the D\u00e1l Riata, according to the earliest genealogies, are descendants of Deda mac Sin, a prehistoric king or deity of the \u00c9rainn. ===Druimm Cete to Mag Rath=== Map of D\u00e1l Riata at its height, c. 580\u2013600. Pictish regions are marked in yellow. By the mid 6th-century, the D\u00e1l Riata in Scotland came under serious threat from Bridei I, king of the Picts, whilst the Irish portion faced hostility from the D\u00e1l nAraidi of Ulaid, resulting in them seeking the aid of the Irish Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill. D\u00e1l Riata reached its greatest extent in the reign of \u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in, who was said to have been consecrated by Columba,Adomn\u00e1n, Life of St Columba, Book III, Chapter 6. who \u00c1ed\u00e1n granted the island of Iona off the coast of Scotland. Columba, who was also a Cen\u00e9l Conaill prince, negotiated an alliance between D\u00e1l Riata and the Cen\u00e9l Conaill, who were the ruling dynasty of the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, in 575 at the Convention of Druimm Cete near Limavady. In attendance were Columba, \u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in, and \u00c1ed mac Ainmuirech, king of the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill and High King of Ireland. What was actually discussed at Druimm Cete is the matter of debate with various suggestions provided that it was: to determine the constitutional status of both parts of D\u00e1l Riata; to determine the status of Irish D\u00e1l Riata only with it having its own king; that D\u00e1l Riata was to become independent of the High King of Ireland; that the Ireland part of D\u00e1l Riata would pay tribute to the High King and support him with land forces, and that the Scotland part would be independent but support the High King with its fleet when needed; the removal of D\u00e1l Riata from Ulaid's overlordship, allowing it to concentrate on extending its Scottish domain. What is certain is that both parties had the D\u00e1l nAraidi as a common foe. This pact between the D\u00e1l Riata and Cen\u00e9l Conaill was successful, first in defeating B\u00e1etan mac Cairill, king of the D\u00e1l nAraidi, then in allowing \u00c1ed\u00e1n to campaign widely against his neighbours, as far afield as Orkney and lands of the Maeatae, on the River Forth. \u00c1ed\u00e1n appears to have been very successful in extending his power, until he faced the Bernician king \u00c6thelfrith at Degsastan . \u00c6thelfrith's brother was among the dead, but \u00c1ed\u00e1n was defeated, and the Bernician kings continued their advances in southern Scotland. \u00c1ed\u00e1n died aged about 70. D\u00e1l Riata did expand to include Skye, possibly conquered by \u00c1ed\u00e1n's son Gartnait. It has been suggested that Fiachnae mac B\u00e1et\u00e1in (died 626), D\u00e1l nAraidi over-king of Ulaid, was overlord of both parts of D\u00e1l Riata. Fiachnae campaigned against the Northumbrians, and besieged Bamburgh, and the D\u00e1l Riatans are thought to have fought in this campaign.For B\u00e1etan and Fiachnae see Byrne, Irish Kings and High-Kings, pp. 109\u2013112, and \u00d3 Cr\u00f3in\u00edn, Early Medieval Ireland, pp. 48\u201352. In 629 the D\u00e1l Riata suffered significant loses at the battle of Fid Euin where the D\u00e1l nAraidi, led by Congal C\u00e1ech mac Scandl\u00e1in, killed the D\u00e1l Riata king as well as three grandsons of \u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in. It is suggested to have been an achievement that D\u00e1l Riata itself survived this battle. That same year the Cen\u00e9l Conaill defeated Congal C\u00e1ech at the battle of D\u00fan Ceithirn. D\u00e1l Riata remained allied with the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill until the reign of Domnall Brecc, who was persuaded by the king of D\u00e1l nAraidi, Congal C\u00e1ech, to renounce this alliance. In an attempt to have himself installed as High King of Ireland, Congal made alliances with D\u00e1l Riata and Strathclyde, which resulted in the disastrous Battle of Magh Rath in 637, which saw Congal slain by High King Domnall mac \u00c1edo of the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill and resulted in Irish D\u00e1l Riata losing possession of its Scottish lands. A battle had also taken place at sea at Sailt\u00edr, off Kintyre, in 637. This defeat was then attributed as divine retribution for Domnall Brecc turning his back on his prior alliance.See Cumm\u00e9ne's \"Life of Columba\" quoted in Sharpe's edition of Adomn\u00e1n, Book III, Chapter 5, and notes 360, 362. Domnall Brecc's policy appears to have died with him in 642, at his final, and fatal, defeat by Eugein map Beli of Strathclyde at Strathcarron, for as late as the 730s, armies and fleets from D\u00e1l Riata fought alongside the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill.Byrne, Irish Kings and High-Kings, p. 114; Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 728. This defeat shattered the power of D\u00e1l Riata as well as that of D\u00e1l nAraidi, allowing the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill to become the dominant force in the north of Ireland. By the 10th-century, the Irish lands of D\u00e1l Riata were under the control of the U\u00ed Tuirtri, and their clients, the Fir L\u00ed. ===Mag Rath to the Pictish Conquest=== It has been proposed that some of the more obscure kings of D\u00e1l Riata mentioned in the Annals of Ulster, such as Fiannamail ua D\u00fanchado and Donncoirce, may have been kings of Irish D\u00e1l Riata.See Bannerman, \"Scottish Takeover\", pp. 76\u201377. If Charles-Edwards and Byrne are correct as to the loss of lands in Antrim after Mag Rath, it not obvious how Bannerman's thesis can be accommodated. The after-effect of the Battle of Moira (Mag Rath) in regards to Scottish D\u00e1l Riata appears to have resulted in it becoming tributary to Northumbrian kings, which lasted until the Pictish king Bruide mac Bili defeated Ecgfrith of Northumbria at Dun Nechtain in 685. It is not certain that this subjection ended in 685, although this is usually assumed to be the case.Adomn\u00e1n, Life of St Columba, notes 360, 362; Broun, \"D\u00e1l Riata\"; Smyth, Warlords and Holy Men, pp. 116\u2013118; Sharpe, \"The thriving of Dalriada\", pp. 60\u201361. However, it appears that Eadberht Eating made some effort to stop the Picts under \u00d3engus mac Fergusa crushing D\u00e1l Riata in 740. Whether this means that the tributary relationship had not ended in 685, or if Eadberht sought only to prevent the growth of Pictish power, is unclear.Continuation of Bede's Ecclesiastical History (trans. Sellar), s.a. 740; Historia Regum Anglorum of Symeon of Durham, s.a. 740; also the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, manuscript D, which reports the burning of York, see also 741. Since it has been thought that D\u00e1l Riata swallowed Pictland to create the Kingdom of Alba, the later history of D\u00e1l Riata has tended to be seen as a prelude to future triumphs.The titles alone of John Bannerman's \"The Scottish Takeover of Pictland\" and Richard Sharpe's \"The thriving of Dalriada\" tell their own story. The annals make it clear that the Cen\u00e9l Gabra\u00edn lost any earlier monopoly of royal power in the late 7th century and in the 8th, when Cen\u00e9l Loairn kings such as Ferchar Fota, his son Selbach, and grandsons D\u00fangal and Muiredach are found contesting for the kingship of D\u00e1l Riata. The long period of instability in D\u00e1l Riata was only ended by the conquest of the kingdom by \u00d3engus mac Fergusa, king of the Picts, in the 730s. After a third campaign by \u00d3engus in 741, D\u00e1l Riata then disappears from the Irish records for a generation. ===The last century=== \u00c1ed Find may appear in 768, fighting against the Pictish king of Fortriu.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 768: \"A battle in Foirtriu between Aed and Cinaed.\" It is assumed that \u00c1ed Find is the \"Aedh\" in question, but cf. the Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 763\u2014corresponding with anno 768 in the Annals of Ulster\u2014where it is reported: \"A battle was fought between the Leinstermen themselves, namely, between Cinaech, son of Flann, and Aedh, at Foirtrinn, where Aedh was slain.\" At his death in 778 \u00c1ed Find is called \"king of D\u00e1l Riata\", as is his brother Fergus mac Echdach in 781.Dates from the Annals of Ulster. The Annals of the Four Masters report the deaths of Abbots of Lismore, but nothing of D\u00e1l Riata except reports of the death of \u00c1ed, s.a. 771, and of his brother Fergus, s.a. 778. The Annals of Ulster say that a certain Donncoirche, \"king of D\u00e1l Riata\" died in 792, and there the record ends. Any number of theories have been advanced to fill the missing generations, none of which are founded on any very solid evidence.See the discussion in Broun, \"Pictish Kings\", where another theory is advanced. A number of kings are named in the Duan Albanach, and in royal genealogies, but these are rather less reliable than we might wish. The obvious conclusion is that whoever ruled the petty kingdoms of D\u00e1l Riata after its defeat and conquest in the 730s, only \u00c1ed Find and his brother Fergus drew the least attention of the chroniclers in Iona and Ireland. This argues very strongly for Alex Woolf's conclusion that \u00d3engus mac Fergusa \"effectively destroyed the kingdom\".Woolf, \"Ungus (Onuist), son of Uurguist.\" It is unlikely that D\u00e1l Riata was ruled directly by Pictish kings, but it is argued that Domnall, son of Caustant\u00edn mac Fergusa, was king of D\u00e1l Riata from 811 to 835. He was apparently followed by the last named king of D\u00e1l Riata \u00c1ed mac Boanta, who was killed in the great Pictish defeat of 839 at the hands of the Vikings.Broun, \"Pictish Kings\", passim; Clancy, \"Caustant\u00edn son of Fergus (Uurguist).\" In the 9th century, the Picts were becoming Gaelicized, and it is suggested that there was a merger of the D\u00e1l Riatan and Pictish kingships.Harris, Bob. Scotland: The Making and Unmaking of the Nation, c.1100\u20131707. Dundee University Press, 2006, p.3 Traditionally, this is attributed to Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn (Kenneth MacAlpin), who became king of the Picts in about 843. Some sources say that Cin\u00e1ed was king of D\u00e1l Riata for two years before this. Under the House of Alpin, D\u00e1l Riata and Pictland merged to form the Kingdom of Alba or Scotland.Woolf, Alex. From Pictland to Alba, 789-1070. Edinburgh University Press, 2007. pp.95\u201396 ===From D\u00e1l Riata to the Innse Gall=== If the Vikings had a great impact on Pictland and in Ireland, in D\u00e1l Riata, as in Northumbria, they appear to have entirely replaced the existing kingdom with a new entity. In the case of D\u00e1l Riata, this was to be known as the kingdom of the Sudreys, traditionally founded by Ketil Flatnose (Caitill Find in Gaelic) in the middle of the 9th century. The Frankish Annales Bertiniani may record the conquest of the Inner Hebrides, the seaward part of D\u00e1l Riata, by Vikings in 847.Woolf, Pictland to Alba, pp. 99\u2013100 & 286\u2013289; Anderson, Early Sources, p. 277. Alex Woolf has suggested that there occurred a formal division of D\u00e1l Riata between the Norse-Gaelic U\u00ed \u00cdmair and the natives, like those divisions that took place elsewhere in Ireland and Britain, with the Norse controlling most of the islands, and the Gaels controlling the Scottish coast and the more southerly islands. In turn, Woolf suggests that this gave rise to the terms Airer Gaedel and Innse Gall, respectively \"the coast of the Gaels\" and the \"Islands of the foreigners\".Alex Woolf, \"Age of Sea-Kings\", pp. 94\u201395. ===Under the House of Alpin=== Woolf has further demonstrated that, by the time of Malcolm II, the leading cenela of D\u00e1l Riata had moved from the southwest of the region (north of the Firths) to the north, east, and northeast, with Cenel Loairn moving up the Great Glen to occupy Moray, the former and sometimes still Fortriu, one branch of Cenel nGabhrain occupying the district known as Gowrie and another the district of Fife, Cenel nOengusa giving its name to Circinn as Angus, Cenel Comgaill occupying Strathearn, and another lesser known kindred, Cenel Conaing, probably moving to Mar.Woolf, Alex. From Pictland to Alba, pp. 226\u2013230 == In fiction == In Rosemary Sutcliff's 1965 novel The Mark of the Horse Lord, the D\u00e1l Riada undergo an internal struggle for control of royal succession, and an external conflict to defend their frontiers against the Caledones. In Rosemary Sutcliff's historical adventure novel The Eagle of the Ninth (1954), a young Roman officer searches to recover the lost Roman eagle standard of his father's legion in the northern part of Great Britain. The story is based on the Ninth Spanish Legion's supposed disappearance in the Scottish Highlands near the end of the Roman occupation. The novel was adapted by Jeremy Brock into the film The Eagle (2011). In the Kushiel novels (a series, beginning with Kushiel's Dart, 2001), by Jacqueline Carey, the Dalriada of the Kingdom of Alba figure prominently in a Royal marriage and subsequent alliance with France (known in the series as \"Terre d'Ange\"). In Julian May's Saga of Pliocene Exile series, the non-born Aiken Drum's homeworld is an ethnic Scottish planet called Dalriada. In the Lost Girl television series, the pub where the Light Fae and the Dark Fae mingle is called the Dal Riata; named after the ancient kingdom. In Jules Watson's Dalriada Trilogy (2006\u20132008), three centuries are chronicled during the time of the Roman Invasion of Britain. A feature length fantasy film previously named Dalriata's King, later named The Gaelic King was made in Scotland, with a story based loosely on the first king of the Scots. It was released to home media in 2017.http://www.fellowshipfilm.com/ D\u00e1l Riata is a playable nation in Paradox Interactive's 4X video game Crusader Kings II. At the earliest start date, 769 with the Charlemagne DLC, they are an Irish Catholic independent petty kingdom ruled by \u00c1ed Find, comprising the Hebrides and Argyll. The game will also use D\u00e1l Riata to refer to the Duchy of the Isles whenever the realm's top liege is Irish Dalriada is the name of a Hungarian folk metal band: Dalriada. ==See also== *List of Kings of D\u00e1l Riata *Duan Albanach *Senchus fer n-Alban *Prehistoric Scotland *Irish-Scots *Early history of Ireland *D\u00e1irine *Scotland in the Early Middle Ages *Early Christian Ireland *Origins of the Kingdom of Alba *Scotland in the High Middle Ages *Early Medieval Ireland 800-1166 *Petrosomatoglyph ==Notes== ==References== * Adomn\u00e1n, Life of St Columba, tr. & ed.
