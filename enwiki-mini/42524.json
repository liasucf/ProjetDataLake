At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Severus and Rufinus (or, less frequently, year 1076 Ab urbe condita). The denomination 323 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. == Events == === By place === ==== Roman Empire ==== * Emperor Constantine the Great defeats the invading Goths and Sarmatians north of the Danube in Dacia, and claims the title of Sarmaticus Maximus. ==== China ==== * Crown Prince Jin Mingdi succeeds Jin Yuandi as emperor of the Eastern Jin Dynasty. === By topic === ====Religion==== * The poetic work Banquet (Thalia) by the Libyan-born Egyptian Christian priest Arius, age 73, expresses the doctrine that Jesus of Nazareth was not of the same substance as God but rather had a finite nature. As ascetic he leads a Christian community near Alexandria and comes under suspicion of heresy. Arius writes to his former schoolmate Eusebius, bishop of Nicomedia, asking for support. Eusebius writes to other bishops, and when Arius is condemned in September, Eusebius gives him safe haven, and sponsors a synod at Bithynia in October, which nullifies Arius's excommunication (see Council of Nicaea, 325 AD). == Births == * Constans I, Roman Emperor (approximate date) == Deaths == * January 3 - Jin Yuandi, emperor of the Jin Dynasty (b. 276) * Zhang Bin, Chinese strategist of the Jie state Later Zhao == References == ",
