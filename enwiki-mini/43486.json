    "text": "Moulin Rouge (, ; ) is a cabaret in Paris, France. The original house, which burned down in 1915, was co-founded in 1889 by Charles Zidler and Joseph Oller, who also owned the Paris Olympia. Close to Montmartre in the Paris district of Pigalle on Boulevard de Clichy in the 18th arrondissement, it is marked by the red windmill on its roof. The closest m\u00e9tro station is Blanche. Moulin Rouge is best known as the birthplace of the modern form of the can-can dance. Originally introduced as a seductive dance by the courtesans who operated from the site, the can-can dance revue evolved into a form of entertainment of its own and led to the introduction of cabarets across Europe. Today, the Moulin Rouge is a tourist attraction, offering musical dance entertainment for visitors from around the world. The club's decor still contains much of the romance of fin de si\u00e8cle France. ==History== ===Creation and early success=== The Moulin Rouge in 1900 The Belle \u00c9poque was a period of peace and optimism marked by industrial progress, and a particularly rich cultural exuberance was about at the opening of the Moulin Rouge. The Expositions Universelles of 1889 and 1900 are symbols of this period. The Eiffel Tower was also constructed in 1889, epitomising the spirit of progress along with the culturally transgressive cabaret. Japonism, an artistic movement inspired by the Orient, with Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec as its most brilliant disciple, was also at its height. Montmartre, which, at the heart of an increasingly vast and impersonal Paris, retained a bohemian village atmosphere; festivities and artists mixed, with pleasure and beauty as their values. On 6 October 1889, the Moulin Rouge opened in the Jardin de Paris, at the foot of the Montmartre hill. Its creator Joseph Oller and his Manager Charles Zidler were formidable businessmen who understood the public's tastes. The aim was to allow the very rich to come and 'slum it' in a fashionable district, Montmartre. The extravagant setting \u2013 the garden was adorned with a gigantic elephant \u2013 allowed people from all walks of life to mix. Workers, residents of the Place Blanche, artists, the middle classes, businessmen, elegant women, and foreigners passing through Paris rubbed shoulders. Nicknamed \"The First Palace of Women\" by Oller and Zidler, the cabaret quickly became a great success. The Moulin Rouge in Autochrome Lumi\u00e8re color, 1914, before the 1915 fire The ingredients for its success: * A revolutionary architecture for the auditorium that allowed rapid changes of d\u00e9cor and where everyone could mix; * Festive champagne evenings where people danced and were entertained thanks to amusing acts that changed regularly, such as the P\u00e9tomane; * A new dance inspired by the quadrille which becomes more and more popular: The Can-can, danced to a furious rhythm by dancers in titillating costumes; * Famous dancers whom history still remembers: la Goulue, Jane Avril, la M\u00f4me Fromage, Grille d'Egout, Nini Pattes en l'Air, Yvette Guilbert, Valentin le d\u00e9soss\u00e9, and the clown Cha-U-Kao; * A place loved by artists, including Toulouse-Lautrec whose posters and paintings secured rapid and international fame for the Moulin Rouge. Toulouse-Lautrec and Mr Tremolada, Zidler's assistant and Moulin-Rouge manager, Paris, 1892 ===Greatest moments=== * The early years of the Moulin Rouge are marked by extravagant shows, inspired by the circus, and attractions that are still famous such as P\u00e9tomane. Concert-dances are organised every day at 10pm. * 1886\u20131910: Footit and Chocolat, a comic act of a white, authoritarian clown and a black, long- suffering Auguste, are very popular and often appear on the Moulin Rouge poster. * 19 April 1890: 1st review, \"Circassiens et Circassiennes\". * 26 October 1890: His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VII, who on a private visit to Paris, booked a table to see this quadrille whose reputation had already crossed the Channel. Recognising him, La Goulue, with her leg in the air and her head in her skirts, spontaneously called out \"Hey, Wales, the champagne's on you!\". * 1891: La Goulue: Toulouse-Lautrec's first poster for the Moulin Rouge. * 1893: The \"Bal des Quat'z'Arts\" caused a scandal with its procession of a nude Cleopatra surrounded by young naked women. Brooklyn Museum - At the Moulin Rouge, La Goulue and her Sister (Au Moulin Rouge, La Goulue et sa s\u0153ur) 1892 - Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec * 12 November 1897: The Moulin Rouge closed its doors for the first time for the funeral of its manager and cofounder, Charles Zidler. Yvette Guilbert paid him homage saying, \"You have the knack of creating popular pleasure, in the finest sense of the word, of entertaining crowds with subtlety, according to the status of those to be entertained\". * 1900: visitors from around the world, attracted by the Universal Exhibition, flock to the \"Moulin Rouch\". This gave Paris a reputation as a city of decadent pleasure. In many other countries imitation \"Moulin Rouges\" and \"Montmartres\" sprang up. ===Operetta and grand shows=== Priority ticket for the S.A. du Th\u00e9atre-Concert du Moulin-Rouge, issued 15 February 1904 * January 1903: the Moulin Rouge reopened after renovation and improvement work carried out by \u00c9douard Niermans, the most \"Parisian\" architect of the Belle \u00c9poque (amongst other works he designed the brasserie Mollard, the Casino de Paris, the Folies Berg\u00e8re in Paris, the Palace H\u00f4tel in Ostend in Belgium, the rebuilding of the H\u00f4tel du Palais in Biarritz, and the creation of the Hotel Negresco on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice). First aperitif concert, where the elite of the fashionable world met for dinner and a show in a setting more beautiful and comfortable than any that existed elsewhere. * Until the First World War, the Moulin Rouge became a real temple of operetta. Further successful shows follow: Voluptata, La Feuille de Vigne, le R\u00eave d'Egypte, Tais-toi tu m'affoles and many others, each with a more evocative title than the last. * 3 January 1907: during the show le R\u00eave d'Egypte, Colette exchanged kisses that showed her links with the Duchess of Morny. Deemed to be scandalous, the show was banned. * 29 July 1907: first appearance of Mistinguett on stage at the Moulin Rouge in the Revue de la Femme. Her talent was immediately obvious. The following year she had a huge success with Max Dearly in la Valse chaloup\u00e9e. * Mistinguett was born in poverty and had an undeniably quick wit. She wanted to build her own life and said \"the poor suburbs, it's not enough just to want to get out. I had a talent: life. All the rest remains to be done, to be thought about. I couldn't allow myself just to be a beautiful animal, I had to think of everything\". A peerless businesswoman, she first listened carefully then captivated. She lived wholly for her art, and toured Europe and the United States. * 9 April 1910: A former lady-in-waiting to the Empress Eug\u00e9nie attended a showing of the Revue Amoureuse at the Moulin Rouge. She was so enchanted by the faithful recreation of the ceremony for the return of the troops from Italy that she could not stop herself from calling out \"Long Live the Empress!\" * 27 February 1915: the Moulin Rouge was destroyed by fire. * 1921: The rebuilt Moulin Rouge reopened. ===Mistinguett years=== Mistinguett at the Moulin Rouge * After World War I, Francis Salabert took charge of the Moulin Rouge. A businessman rather than a showman, he gave Jacques-Charles, the leading impresario of the time, the task of reinvigorating the cabaret. The Moulin Rouge took off again, thanks to stars such as Mistinguett, Jeanne Aubert, and Maurice Chevalier, and gave the first showing in Paris of American revues with the Hoffmann Girls. * In 1923, composer and conductor Rapha\u00ebl Beretta, who directed the Folies Berg\u00e8res, the Olympia and the Casino de Paris, proposed to rebuild the music hall of the Moulin Rouge in a large construction. The mill rose in the middle of the facade supported by a round part decorated at the top with oval dormers. * Gesmar, aged 20, became set designer. His drawings and models will always be associated with the image of the Moulin Rouge. * Jacques-Charles and Mistinguett were the originators of: ** 1925 : la Revue Mistinguett ** 1926 : \u00c7a c'est Paris ** 1928 : Paris qui tourne * An incident occurred during the 1927 show when female dancers were meant to pop out of huge multi-tiered artificial cakes covered in real frosting. When the girls descended to the stage, the soles of their high heels got doused in cake cream which proved extremely slippery and caused them to constantly slip and fall on stage, ruining the whole show.https://www.pariscityvision.com/en/paris-by- night/moulin-rouge/big-times-big-names-moulin-rouge \"Big Times and Big Names at the Moulin Rouge,\" article on pariscityvision.com * At the Moulin Rouge, Mistinguett created many enduring songs, including \"Valencia\", \"\u00c7a c'est Paris\", both by Jose Padilla, \"Il m'a vue nue\", \"On m' suit\", \"La Java de Doudoune\", the latter with Jean Gabin. ===After Mistinguett=== Vu (magazine) N\u00b077 Adelaide Hall star of Blackbirds at the Moulin Rouge * 1929: Mistinguett retires from the stage and leaves the Moulin Rouge. * After her departure, the ballroom is transformed into the most ultra-modern Night Club of the time. * June \u2013 August 1929: the revue Lew Leslie's Blackbirds, starring jazz singer and Broadway star Adelaide Hall,Chapters 10 & 11, Underneath A Harlem Moon ... the Harlem to Paris Years of Adelaide Hall by Iain Cameron Williams.

The intensive prostitution during the occupation made way for the Loi de Marthe Richard (1946), which closed the bordellos and reduced stage shows to dancing events. The shows went on during the German occupation. * 1944: a few days after the liberation of Paris, Edith Piaf, who had been a frequent performer at German Forces social and bordello gatherings during the Second World War, and had been considered a traitor by many, performs again at the Moulin Rouge, with Yves Montand, a newcomer chosen to appear with her. ===Renewal=== * 22 June 1951: Georges France, called Jo France, founder of the Balajo (rue de Lappe, Paris), acquires the Moulin Rouge and starts major renovation work. He gives architects Pierre Devinoy, Bernard de La Tour d\u2019Auvergne and Marion Tournon- Branly the task of improving and fitting out the new auditorium. The d\u00e9cor envisaged by Jo France and largely realized by Henri Mah\u00e9, one of the most fashionable designers of the day, has lasted and is still in place. * The evening dances, the acts, and the famous French cancan are back at the Moulin Rouge. * 19 May 1953: the 25th \"Bal des Petits Lits Blancs\", organised by the novelist Guy des Cars, takes place at the Moulin Rouge in the presence of the French President, Vincent Auriol, and it includes, for the first time on a European stage, Bing Crosby. The evening attracts 1,200 artists and stars from around the world, including Josephine Baker who sings \"J'ai deux amours\". * Between 1951 and 1960, a succession of famous artists appears: Luis Mariano, Charles Tr\u00e9net, Charles Aznavour, Line Renaud, Bourvil, Fernand Raynaud, Lena Horne. * 1955: Jo France transfers the Moulin Rouge to the brothers Joseph and Louis Cl\u00e9rico who already own Le Lido.
