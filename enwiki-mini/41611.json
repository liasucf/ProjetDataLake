    "text": "Quadrature may refer to: In signal processing: *Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), a modulation method of using both an (in-phase) carrier wave and a 'quadrature' carrier wave that is 90\u00b0 out of phase with the main, or in- phase, carrier *Quadrature phase, oscillations that are said to be in quadrature if they are separated in phase by 90\u00b0 (\u03c0/2, or \u03bb/4) *Quadrature filter, the analytic signal of a real-valued filter *Quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK), a phase-shift keying of using four quadrate points on the constellation diagram, equispaced around a circle In mathematics: * Quadrature (mathematics), drawing a square with the same area as a given plane figure (squaring) or computing that area ** Quadrature of the circle * Numerical integration is often called 'numerical quadrature' or simply 'quadrature' ** Gaussian quadrature, a special case of numerical integration * Formerly, a synonym for \"integral\" ** Integral ** Antiderivative In physics: * In Optical phase space, quadratures are operators which represent the real and imaginary parts of the complex amplitude; see also in-phase and quadrature components In astronomy: * Quadrature (astronomy), the position of a body (moon or planet) such that its elongation is 90\u00b0 or 270\u00b0; i.e. the body-earth-sun angle is 90\u00b0 Quadrature may also refer to: * Quadrature encoder, a device that detects mechanical position changes and direction of movement *Illusionistic ceiling painting, sometimes called quadrature after the Italian term, quadratura * La_Quadrature_du_Net (Squaring of the Net in French), a French advocacy group that promotes digital rights and freedoms of citizens ",
