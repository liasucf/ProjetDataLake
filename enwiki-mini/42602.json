    "text": "TAT-12/13 is a ring cable system consisting of the 12th and 13th consortia transatlantic telephone cables, in operation from 1996, initially carrying 2 \u00d7 5 Gbit/s. This was the first TAT cable to use a ring structure, involving two stretches of cable across the ocean floor, which explains why two numbers (12 and 13) were used. All later cables also use a ring structure, but only use one number (TAT-14 etc.). The cable connected between Long Island (at Shirley, New York), USA; Green Hill, Rhode Island, USA; Porthcurno, UK; Bude, UK; and Penmarch, France.\"The TAT-12/13 Cable Network\", IEEE Communications Magazine, February 1996, Volume 34, Number 2 The cable was constructed for US$740 million and was supplied jointly by AT&T; Submarine Systems, Inc (now TE Subcom owned by TE Connectivity), STC Submarine Systems (acquired by Alcatel- Lucent) and Alcatel Submarcom. Ring switching equipment was provided by the Toshiba Corporation in each of the four cable stations. The cables in this system were the first on the trans-Atlantic route to make use of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers. The TAT-12/13 consortia removed the cable from normal commercial service on 31 December 2008. ==Footnotes== ==Sources== * Category:Infrastructure completed in 1996 Category:Transatlantic communications cables Category:France\u2013United Kingdom relations Category:France\u2013United States relations Category:United Kingdom\u2013United States relations ",
