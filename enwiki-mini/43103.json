It was published by Eidos Interactive, and developed by Pyro Studios. It features 20 missions. The view is isometric with tactical gameplay. A Sega Mega Drive/Genesis version of Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines, with the first 5 missions, was also made by Russian homebrew programmers, but lacked sound and certain other features of the PC version. ===Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty=== Commandos: Beyond the Call of Duty, a set of new Commandos missions issued as a standalone game, was released on 31 March 1999. Despite it being much shorter than Behind Enemy Lines, it is a much more difficult game containing levels on a far greater scale to the extent of being comparable to those that were to be seen in Commandos 2. It has 8 missions, with locations including Yugoslavia and Greece. ===Commandos 2: Men of Courage=== A full sequel, released in 2001, was rebuilt with a 3D engine, more interactive environments, more skills for the commandos, and new characters. Like its predecessor, it drew heavily from war films and titled its levels in reference to such films as \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" and \"Saving Private Ryan\". The game received even greater praise. Several new characters were added to the series in this sequel: A thief called Paul \"Lupin\" Toledo, a dog called Whiskey and Wilson, a shot down pilot claiming to be from the Light Brigade. ===Commandos 3: Destination Berlin=== This is the third sequel in the series and was released in October 2003. In this game the mouse wheel can be used to rotate the player's vantage point. It was the first in the series to use a true 3D engine. However, the game has been criticized for its short missions and lack of hotkeys. ===Commandos: Strike Force=== Released during the first months of 2006, this game marks a diversion from the first three games. Although the missions are set up in a similar fashion (several different objectives, some to be achieved through stealth, others through use of force) and in most occasions the player is allowed to change between different characters, this is the first game in the series to apply a first-person perspective, like many Medal of Honor or Call of Duty games than to earlier entries of the series. The game attracted an overwhelmingly negative reaction, especially from fans of the earlier games in the series who saw this as a massive modification, concurrent with a great reduction in the series' trademark difficulty. Similarly, it was promoted as mixing elements of strategy from the past games with traditional first-person shooter game-play but instead only hinted them and whilst being predominantly action oriented. As a result, both critics and fans felt it did little to distance itself from the recent flood of similar games. ==Music== The first Commandos game was composed by David Garcia-Morales In\u00e9s and other subsequent titles were done by Mateo Pascual. Each of the five soundtrack are made available on iTunes and Amazon. ==Mods== Following the discontinuation of the series by Pyro Studios, a couple of mods have been developed by fans. Commandos: Strike in Narrow Path is a stand-alone expansion for Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines containing 9 missions and was released initially in 2010. Commandos 2: Destination Paris tweaks the gameplay of Commandos 2: Men Of Courage and adds over 100 missions to the base game. ==Reception== ==Future== According to sources in the game industry, the series was bought by Kalypso Media. They plan to publish new Commandos games.We\u2019re getting a new Commandos game and a remaster ==See also== *Robin Hood: The Legend of Sherwood *Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines *Commandos 2: Men of Courage *Commandos 3: Destination Berlin *Desperados: Wanted Dead or Alive *Desperados 2: Cooper's Revenge *Desperados III *Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun *Star Trek: Away Team ==References== Category:Eidos Interactive games Category:Real-time tactics video games Category:Stealth video games Category:Video game franchises Category:Video games developed in Spain Category:Video games with isometric graphics Category:World War II video games Category:Video game franchises introduced in 1998 ",
