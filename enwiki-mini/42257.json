Among the variants are: * * * * The closest English pronunciation to the original Korean would be , but the final vowel is checked and cannot occur word-final in English. modernity; ), is a South Korean multinational automotive manufacturer headquartered in Seoul. Hyundai Motor Company was founded in 1967 and, along with its 32.8 percent owned subsidiary, Kia Motors, and its 100 percent owned luxury subsidiary, Genesis Motor, and electric vehicle subsidiary, Ioniq, altogether comprise the Hyundai Motor Group. Hyundai operates the world's largest integrated automobile manufacturing facility in Ulsan, South Korea which has an annual production capacity of 1.6 million units. The company employs about 75,000 people worldwide. Hyundai vehicles are sold in 193 countries through some 5,000 dealerships and showrooms. ==History== The world's largest automobile manufacturing plant in Ulsan, South Korea, produces over 1.6 million vehicles annually. Chung Ju-Yung founded the Hyundai Engineering and Construction Company in 1947. Hyundai Motor Company was later established in 1967, and the company's first model, the Cortina, was released in cooperation with Ford Motor Company in 1968. When Hyundai wanted to develop their own car, they hired George Turnbull in February 1974, the former Managing Director of Austin Morris at British Leyland. He in turn hired five other top British car engineers. They were Kenneth Barnett body design, engineers John Simpson and Edward Chapman, John Crosthwaite ex-BRM as chassis engineer and Peter Slater as chief development engineer.The Times (1974-07-09)The Sunday Times 'Business News' (1974-07-14)Motor Report International (1974-07-18)The Engineer (1975-01-30) In 1975, the Pony, the first South Korean car, was released, with styling by Giorgio Giugiaro of ItalDesign and powertrain technology provided by Japan's Mitsubishi Motors. Exports began in the following year to Ecuador and soon thereafter to the Benelux countries. Hyundai entered the British market in 1982, selling 2993 cars in their first year there. In 1984, Hyundai began exporting the Pony to Canada, but not to the United States, as the Pony would not pass emissions standards there. Canadian sales greatly exceeded expectations, and it was at one point the top-selling car on the Canadian market. In 1985, the one millionth Hyundai car was built. In 1986, Hyundai began to sell cars in the United States, and the Excel was nominated as \"Best Product #10\" by Fortune magazine, largely because of its affordability. The company began to produce models with its own technology in 1988, beginning with the midsize Sonata. In the spring of 1990, aggregate production of Hyundai automobiles reached the four million mark. In 1991, the company succeeded in developing its first proprietary gasoline engine, the four- cylinder Alpha, and also its own transmission, thus paving the way for technological independence. In 1996, Hyundai Motor India Limited was established with a production plant in Irungattukottai near Chennai, India. In 1998, Hyundai began to overhaul its image in an attempt to establish itself as a world-class brand. Chung Ju Yung transferred leadership of Hyundai Motor to his son, Chung Mong Koo, in 1999. Hyundai's parent company, Hyundai Motor Group, invested heavily in the quality, design, manufacturing, and long-term research of its vehicles. It added a 10-year or warranty to cars sold in the United States and launched an aggressive marketing campaign. Hyundai Motor Group chairman Chung Mong Koo (right) sitting next to South Korean president Park Geun-hye in 2013. In 2004, Hyundai was ranked second in \"initial quality\" in a survey/study by J.D. Power and Associates. Hyundai is now one of the top 100 most valuable brands worldwide. Since 2002, Hyundai has also been one of the worldwide official sponsors of the FIFA World Cup. In 2006, the South Korean government initiated an investigation of Chung Mong Koo's practices as head of Hyundai, suspecting him of corruption. On 28 April 2006, Chung was arrested, and charged for embezzlement of 100 billion South Korean won (US$106 million). As a result, Hyundai vice chairman and CEO, Kim Dong-jin, replaced him as head of the company. On 30 September 2011, Yang Seung Suk announced his retirement as CEO of Hyundai Motor Co. In the interim replacement period, Chung Mong-koo and Kim Eok-jo will divide the duties of the CEO position. In 2014, Hyundai started an initiative to focus on improving vehicle dynamics in its vehicles and hired Albert Biermann, former Vice President of Engineering at BMW M to direct chassis development for Hyundai vehicles; stating \"The company intends to become a technical leader in ride and handling, producing vehicles that lead their respective segments for driver engagement.\" ===Research and development=== Hyundai has six research and development centers, located in South Korea (three offices), Germany, Japan and India. Additionally, a center in California develops designs for the United States. Hyundai has made an app with augmented reality, showing users how to operate and maintain vehicles. ===Business=== In 1998, after a shake-up in the South Korean auto industry caused by overambitious expansion and the Asian financial crisis, Hyundai acquired the majority of rival Kia Motors. Hyundai owns 33.88% of Kia. In 2000, the company established a strategic alliance with DaimlerChrysler and severed its partnership with the Hyundai Group. In 2001, the Daimler-Hyundai Truck Corporation was formed. In 2004, however, DaimlerChrysler divested its interest in the company by selling its 10.5% stake for $900 million. Hyundai has invested in manufacturing plants in North America, India, the Czech Republic, Russia, China and Turkey as well as research and development centers in Europe, Asia, North America and the Pacific Rim. In 2004, Hyundai Motor Company had $57.2 billion in sales in South Korea making it the country's second largest corporation, or chaebol. Worldwide sales in 2005 reached 2,533,695 units, an 11 percent increase over the previous year. In 2011, Hyundai sold 4.05 million cars worldwide and the Hyundai Motor Group was the world's fourth largest automaker behind GM, Volkswagen and Toyota. Hyundai vehicles are sold in 193 countries through some 5,000 dealerships. ===Board of directors=== As of 16 May 2020:https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/company/ir/corporate- information/bod/board-of-directors Hyundai Board * Chung Eui-sun (chairman), chairman of Hyundai Motors * Won Hee Lee, president and CEO of Hyundai Motors * Albert Biermann, president of R&D; * Eon Tae Ha, president of domestic production * Sang-Hyun Kim, CFO of Hyundai Motors * Eun Soo Choi, president of the Daejon High Court * Dong Kyu Lee, secretary-general of the Fair Trade Commission (South Korea) * Byung Kook Lee, Commissioner of the Seoul Regional Tax Office * Chi-Won Yoon, CEO of UBS Asia-Pacific * Eugene Ohr, former partner at Capital Group Companies International * Sang-Seung Yi, chairman of the Korea Academic Society of Industrial Organization ==Design emphasis== In 2006, Hyundai hired Thomas B\u00fcrkle as head of the company's design center in Russelsheim, Germany. B\u00fcrkle had previously worked for BMW, having designed the BMW 3 Series (E46), and the BMW 6 Series (E63). Hyundai's current design philosophy is known as Fluidic Sculpture, which is heavily inspired by nature. ==Regional operations== ===North America=== ====United States==== Hyundai Motor America began selling cars in the United States on 20 February 1986, with a single model, the Hyundai Excel, which was offered in a variety of trims and body styles. That year, Hyundai set a record of selling the most automobiles in its first year of business in the United States compared to any other car brand; total sales in 1986 were 168,882. Initially well received, the Excel's faults soon became apparent; cost-cutting measures caused reliability to suffer. With an increasingly poor reputation for quality, Hyundai sales plummeted, and many dealerships either earned their profits on repairs or abandoned the product. At one point, Hyundai became the butt of many jokes (i.e. Hyundai stands for \"Hope you understand nothing's driveable and inexpensive\") and even made David Letterman's Top Ten Hilarious Mischief Night Pranks to Play in Space: No.8 \u2013 Paste a \"Hyundai\" logo on the main control panel. In response, Hyundai began investing heavily in the quality, design, manufacturing, and long-term research of its vehicles. It added free maintenance for the first 2 years or 24,000 miles for all its new cars sold, starting with the 1992 model year. It also added a 10-year or powertrain warranty (known as the Hyundai Advantage) to its vehicles sold in the United States. By 2004, sales had dramatically increased, and the reputation of Hyundai cars improved. In 2004, Hyundai tied with Honda for initial brand quality in a survey/study from J.D. Power and Associates, for having 102 problems per 1000 vehicles. This made Hyundai second in the industry, only behind Toyota, for initial vehicle quality. The company continued this tradition by placing third overall in J.D. Power's 2006 Initial Quality Survey, behind only Porsche and Lexus. Hyundai is ranked number 4 in World's Most Admired Companies under the motor vehicles section of CNN, after BMW (Bayerische Motoren Werke), Volkswagen and Daimler in 2011. Hyundai continues to invest heavily in its American operations as its cars grow in popularity. In 1990, Hyundai established the Hyundai Design Center in Fountain Valley, California. The center moved to a new $30 million facility in Irvine, California, in 2003, and was renamed the Hyundai Kia Motors Design and Technical Center. Besides the design studio, the facility also housed Hyundai America Technical Center, Inc. (HATCI, established in 1986), a subsidiary responsible for all engineering activities in the U.S. for Hyundai. Hyundai America Technical Center moved to its new , $117 million headquarters in Superior Township, Michigan (near Ann Arbor) in 2005. Later that same year, HATCI announced that it would be expanding its technical operations in Michigan and hiring 600 additional engineers and other technical employees over a period of five years. The center also has employees in California and Alabama. Hyundai incorporated a new manufacturing facility, Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, in April 2002. The new plant in Montgomery, Alabama, was completed during 2004, at a cost of $1.7 billion. Production started in May 2005. It employed more than 3,000 workers in 2012. Currently, the plant assembles the Hyundai Elantra, the Hyundai Sonata, and the Hyundai Theta engine. It is Hyundai's second attempt at producing cars in North America since Hyundai Auto Canada Inc.'s plant in Quebec closed in 1993. Hyundai America Technical Center completed construction of its Hyundai/Kia proving ground in California City, California, in 2004. The facility is located in the Mojave Desert and features a oval track, a Vehicle Dynamics Area, a vehicle- handling course inside the oval track, a paved hill road, and several special surface roads. A complex featuring offices and indoor testing areas is located on the premises as well. The facility was built at a cost of $50 million. An aerial view can be found here. In 2003, Consumer Reports, based on complaints about 2002 model new cars that in general are less than one year usage, ranked Hyundai's reliability tied with Honda's; however, J.D. Power and Associates put Hyundai's 2002 vehicles below the industry average according to its annual Initial Quality Survey, which looks at problems in the first 90 days of ownership. In 2006, J.D. Power and Associates' quality ranking, overall the Hyundai brand ranked 3rd, just behind Porsche and Lexus, and beating longtime rival Toyota. But Hyundai's ranking fell to twelfth in 2007. However, in 2009, Hyundai was the Highest Ranked Non-Premium Nameplate in the J.D. Power and Associates Initial Quality Study.Hyundai is the Highest Ranked Non-Premium Nameplate in the J.D.

The Canadian Pony differed from its European counterparts by having 8 km/h bumpers, sealed-beam headlights, side marker lamps, and slightly different instrumentation and interor trim. Sales projections for 1984 called for 5,000 Ponys, but actual sales were closer to 25,000, making the Pony one of Canada's best selling cars that year. A lesser known model, also sold in Canada, was the Hyundai Stellar. Both models were available until 1987, when they were replaced by the Excel. In 1989, Hyundai Auto Canada Inc. opened a stamping and assembly plant in Bromont, Quebec, employing 800. The plant cost $387.7 million, with Quebec and Canadian federal government subsidies of $131 million. The plant was designed to manufacture approximately 2000 Hyundai Sonatas per week. Subsequently, Chrysler and Hyundai considered a joint venture that would have Chrysler rebranding the Sonata manufactured at Bromont \u2013 only to later announce the deal had failed. The Bromont plant was operational for four years before it closed \u2013 with Hyundai's sales unable to support the plant. With boost in sales in 2009, Hyundai Auto Canada Inc. is currently planning to build a new plant in Canada and resume production in Canada. Hyundai subsequently sold the plant, which was eventually purchased by Olymbec inc, a Quebec real estate developer. Hyundai is the No.1 import car brand in Canada without a local plant. Sales over 100,000 cars-per-year mark in 2012. ====Mexico==== Hyundai Motor M\u00e9xico entered the Mexican market in 2014 with the Hyundai Grand i10, the Hyundai Elantra, and the Hyundai ix35.

This car, the first product of the new \"Projeto HB\" (Hyundai Brazil), is built at a new Hyundai factory in Brazil, located in Piracicaba, S\u00e3o Paulo. The HB20 is of very similar size to the Hyundai i20, launched in other parts of the world in 2008. Hyundai vehicles have also been produced in Brazil at a plant located in An\u00e1polis, Goi\u00e1s. Production here started with the HR model in 2007, and continued with the Tucson in 2010, the HD78 truck in 2011, and the ix35 in 2013. ===Asia=== ====China==== THAAD. Hyundai cars, including those made by Hyundai's affiliate, Kia Motors, sold well in China until 2016, when sales fell by half, marking the start of a slump that continued into 2019, when the company announced plans to cut jobs in the region. Hyundai is currently working with its Chinese partner Beijing Automobile Industry Holding Co. to develop an electric car for sale only in China. In September 2011, it was announced that Korean celebrity Lee Min Ho, who is popular in China, will promote Hyundai's new 'Veloster' in China. Hyundai and its sister company, Kia, are losing market share because of their over-reliance on sedans, poor brand images and local Chinese automakers compete with price competitive SUVs. =====Beijing Hyundai===== A joint venture with Beijing Automotive Group, Beijing Hyundai Motor manufactures many Hyundai vehicles, as well as a few models which are exclusive to the Chinese market. This company sold 700,000 passenger cars in 2010. 855,995 car sales in 2012.Hyundai sells 1M cars in China joongangdaily.com, (2011-01-03) Beijing Hyundai has 3 assembly plants, each 300,000 unit annual capacity in NE Beijing outskirts.

Ltd. ====India==== Hyundai's manufacturing plant at Irungattukottai near Sriperumbudur, Chennai, India. Hyundai Motor India Limited is currently the second largest auto exporter from India. It is making India the global manufacturing base for small cars. Hyundai sells several models in India, the most popular being the Santro Xing, i10, Hyundai EON and the i20. On 3 September 2013, Hyundai launched its much-awaited car, Grand i10 in petrol and diesel variants.

In June, 2017, The Competition Commission of India imposed \u20b987 crore ($13.6 million) penalty for unfair business practices with respect to providing discounts for cars. ====Japan==== Despite having growing sales worldwide, Hyundai struggled in Japan, having sold only 15,095 passenger cars from 2001 to 2009. Following an announcement in November 2009, Hyundai pulled their passenger car division out of the Japanese market and focused on their commercial vehicle division instead. The company said that it is possible for them to come back to Japan fully if market conditions continue to improve. Currently the only Hyundai vehicle available in Japan is the Hyundai Universe bus. According to the newspaper The Chosun Ilbo, the reason for Hyundai's failure in the car market was due to the company's inability to recognize the value of small cars due to parking spaces. For instance, actor Bae Yong-joon was hired to endorse the mid-sized Sonata in Japan to appeal to the mature housewives who watch Winter Sonata. The marketing campaign backfired, as large sedans are driven primarily by middle-aged men, while housewives prefer compact cars. In addition, the Sonata was priced too similarly to its Japanese rivals, which resulted in poor sales. But, Hyundai Nexo appeared in G20 Energy Ministerial 2019. ====Philippines==== Hyundai entered the country in the early 1990s, selling the Hyundai Grace van and the Hyundai Excel for the Filipino market. Hyundai Asia Resources, Inc.

As well as vans, trucks and buses such as the Hyundai H350, Hyundai H100 vans, Hyundai County, Hyundai Super Aero City and Hyundai Universe buses, Hyundai Xcient, Hyundai Mighty II and Hyundai Trago trucks. Cars previously sold by Hyundai in the country include the, Hyundai Sonata, Hyundai Genesis Coupe, Hyundai Veracruz, Hyundai Getz, Hyundai i20, Hyundai i10, Hyundai Matrix, and the Hyundai Eon. which was also assembled locally in the country. Recently, the company expects further sales to be boosted by its Hyundai Modern Jeepneys with the implementation of the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program. HARI targets to sell more modern jeepneys as the government pushes for the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program to replace the ageing Jeepneys. In January 2020, HARI launched the Hyundai HD50S Class 3 modern jeepney. In the same month, the company delivered the initial batch of Hyundai HD50S Class 2 modern jeepneys to the Public Transport Alliance of Gensan. The said group ordered 300 units of modern jeepneys from HARI. Their current lineup for the modern PUVs (Public Utility Vehicles) include the: Hyundai Class-1 Modern Jeepney (based on the Hyundai H100), Hyundai Forma Novus Class-2 Modern Jeepney, and the recent Hyundai HD50S Class 3 modern jeepney (based on the Hyundai Mighty II). Light commercial vehicles remain one of HARI's key sources of growth, growing by 50.2% from 5,119 units sold last year to 7,690 units this year. This growth has been attributed to the sales of the Kona, Santa Fe, and the H100. HARI sold a total of 3,163 units in December 2019 from 3,074-unit sales in the same month in 2018. The overall growth was supported by the 8.51-percent increase in sales of passenger cars last month, selling a total of 1,645 units compared to December 2018's sales of 1,516 units. Hyundai's sales of passenger cars in the Philippine market declined by 33 percent to 967 units in January 2020 from 1,443 units a year ago. Light commercial vehicle sales likewise fell by 19.9 percent to 1,053 units last January from 1,315 units sold in the same month of 2019. This is due to the 2020 Taal Volcano eruption and the COVID-19 pandemic. ====Indonesia==== In November 2019, Hyundai announced that it is building the first Southeast Asian car plant located in Indonesia. ====Turkey==== In September 1997, Hyundai opened a manufacturing plant in Turkey, located in \u0130zmit, Kocaeli Province.

Since 2006, the factory has also been assembling the Hyundai Porter, County, Aero Town and the HD 500 commercial vehicles. In June 2008, Hyundai started the construction of a new manufacturing plant in Saint Petersburg with a planned yearly capacity of 100,000 cars, that will eventually be increased to 200,000 units. It started mass production in January 2011, with two models: the Hyundai Solaris and the Kia Rio. ===Africa=== ====Southern Africa==== In Botswana, the assembly of Hyundai Accent, Sonata, and Elantra models was undertaken by the Motor Company of Botswana at their Gaborone plant, since February 1993, in the form of complete knock-down kits.

The test vehicle was 1991 MY Scoupe FFV. Since March, 1992, in Seoul, Korea, through at least November 1993, field trials of several FFVs had been performed over more than 30,000 miles. The Hyundai Sonata Hybrid uses a lightweight lithium polymer battery. The first pure electric car developed by Hyundai was the Sonata Electric Vehicle in 1991. The car started as a Sonata sedan based model. Hyundai later produced electric vehicles utilizing the Excel, Grace, Accent, Atos and Kia Sportage platforms. Hyundai planned to have six electric vehicles available for testing by the end of 1992. The company was using batteries from Ovonic Battery Company Inc. in Troy, Michigan. The Excel and the Sonata were the two different models on which the electric vehicles were based. The vehicles were scheduled to likely be tested in the United States and in Korea. The new hybrid-electric FGV-1 was unveiled at the Seoul Motor Show in 1995. The car featured full-time electric drive technology. The 1995 Hyundai FGV-1 was the result of Hyundai's first experiments with hybrid propulsion systems in 1994. Hyundai produced its second generation hybrid-electric vehicle in 1999.

Eriksson later drove the car to fifth place in New Zealand and fourth in Australia. In 2001, Hyundai debuted a new evolution of the Accent WRC, which was intended to improve reliability, but the performance of the car was still not good enough to challenge the four big teams (Ford, Mitsubishi, Peugeot and Subaru). However, at the season-ending Rally GB, the team achieved their best result with McRae finishing fourth and Eriksson sixth.
