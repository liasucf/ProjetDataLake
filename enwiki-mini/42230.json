    "text": "The Hotel Chelsea \u2013 also called the Chelsea Hotel, or simply the Chelsea \u2013 is a hotel in Manhattan, New York City, built between 1883 and 1885. The 250-unit hotel is located at 222 West 23rd Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, in the neighborhood of Chelsea. It has been the home of numerous writers, musicians, artists and actors. Though the Chelsea no longer accepts new long- term residents, the building is still home to many who lived there before the change in policy. Arthur C. Clarke wrote 2001: A Space Odyssey while staying at the Chelsea,\"Famous residents of the Chelsea Hotel\", The Telegraph (London), August 2, 2011 and poets Allen Ginsberg and Gregory Corso chose it as a place for philosophical and artistic exchange. It is also known as the place where the writer Dylan Thomas was staying in room 205 when he became ill and died several days later, in a local hospital, of pneumonia on November 9, 1953, and where Nancy Spungen, girlfriend of Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols, was found stabbed to death on October 12, 1978. Arthur Miller wrote a short piece, \"The Chelsea Affect\", describing life at the Chelsea Hotel in the early 1960s.Miller, Arthur, \"The Chelsea Affect\", Granta #78: \"Bad Company\", Summer 2002 The building has been a designated New York City landmark since 1966, and on the National Register of Historic Places since 1977. and Accompanying three photos, exterior, from 1977 == History == A close-up of the hotel's signage Built between 1884 and 1885 and opened for initial occupation in 1884,, p. 70, p. 181 the twelve-story red-brick building that is now the Hotel Chelsea was one of the city's first private apartment cooperatives.Regier, Hilda. \"Chelsea Hotel\" in , p.210 It was designed by Philip Hubert p. 151 of the firm of Hubert, Pirrson & Company in a style that has been described variously as Queen Anne Revival and Victorian Gothic. Among its distinctive features are the delicate, flower-ornamented iron balconies on its facade, which were constructed by J.B. and J.M. Cornell and its grand staircase, which extends upward twelve floors. Generally, this staircase is only accessible to registered guests, although the hotel does offer monthly tours to others. At the time of its construction, the building was the tallest in New York. Hubert and Pirsson had created a \"Hubert Home Club\" in 1880 for \"The Rembrandt,\" a six-story building on West 57th Street intended as housing for artists. This early cooperative building had rental units to help defray costs, and also provided servants as part of the building staff. The success of this model led to other \"Hubert Home Clubs,\" and the Chelsea was one of them. Initially successful, its surrounding neighborhood constituted the center of New York's theater district., p.153 However, within a few years the combination of economic stresses, the suspicions of New York's middle class about apartment living, the opening up of Upper Manhattan and the plentiful supply of houses there, and the relocation of the city's theater district bankrupted the Chelsea. The building reopened as a hotel in 1905, which was later managed by Knott Hotels and resident manager A. R. Walty. After the hotel went bankrupt, it was purchased in 1939 by Joseph Gross, Julius Krauss, and David Bard, and these partners managed the hotel together until the early 1970s. Stanley Bard,\"Stanley Bard, Former Owner and Manager of The Chelsea Hotel, Dies at 82\" by Ed Hamilton, chelseahotelblog.com, February 14, 2017 David Bard's son, became manager after Gross and Krauss' deaths. On June 18, 2007, the hotel's board of directors ousted Bard as the hotel's manager. Dr. Marlene Krauss, the daughter of Julius Krauss, and David Elder, the grandson of Joseph Gross and the son of playwright and screenwriter Lonne Elder III, replaced Stanley Bard with the management company BD Hotels NY; that firm has since been terminated as well. The hotel was sold to real estate developer Joseph Chetrit for $80 million in 2011 and stopped taking reservations for new guests, to begin renovations. Long-time residents were allowed to remain in the building, some of them protected by state rent regulations. The renovations prompted complaints to the city by the remaining tenants of health hazards caused by the construction. The city's Building Department investigated these complaints and found no major violations.\"DOB finds no major violations in Hotel Chelsea renovation\" The Real Deal (October 27, 2011) In November 2011, the management ordered all of the hotel's many artworks taken off the walls, supposedly for their protection and cataloging, a move which some tenants interpreted as a step towards forcing them out as well. In 2013, Ed Scheetz became the Chelsea Hotel's new owner after buying back five properties from Chetrit and David Bistricer.\"A New View at Chelsea Hotel\" The Wall Street Journal (August 27, 2013)The Real Deal: \"King & Grove reneges on Hotel Chelsea eviction vow: Tenants\" September 17, 2013 Located in the Chelsea since 1930 is the restaurant El Quijote which was owned by the same family until 2017 when it was sold to the new owner of the hotel.
