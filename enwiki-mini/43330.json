    "text": "The Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) is a recreational diving membership and diver training organization founded in 1966 by John Cronin and Ralph Erickson. Cronin was originally a NAUI instructor who decided to form his own organization with Erickson, and to break diver training down into several modular courses instead of the single universal course then prevalent. PADI courses range from entry level to relatively advanced recreational diver certification, several specialized diving skills courses, usually connected with specific equipment or conditions, some diving related informational courses and a range of recreational diving instructor certifications. They also offer various technical diving courses. As of January 2019, PADI is reported to have issued 27 million scuba certifications. == Ownership History == In 1966, PADI was founded by John Cronin and Ralph Erickson. On 9 August 2012, Lincolnshire Management and Providence Equity Partners jointly acquired PADI from Seidler Equity Partners. In 2015, Providence Equity Partners acquired majority stake of PADI from Lincolnshire Management. In 2017, Providence Equity Partners LLC sold PADI to Canadian investment firm Altas Partners and French private equity firm Florac for 700 million USD, through an entity called Mandarinfish Holding. == Membership == In 2019, PADI reported it had a membership of over 137,000 professional members and 6,600 dive centers, and had awarded more than 27,000,000 diving certifications internationally. PADI operates in 186 countries and territories. Membership is heavily weighted toward males, but in 2016, the organization experienced a growth of 1.1% in female certifications. Women accounted for 37.2% of all certifications during 2016. The organization hosts Women's Dive Day events across the globe in an effort to increase awareness of women divers. ==Training system== PADI courses are performance-based diver training programs, and at the introductory level emphasize practical knowledge, safety and motor skills. The basics of diving physics and physiology are introduced during entry level programs. The details of these concepts are left for later courses when they are necessary for the required competences of the specific training. These practices fall within current modern learning philosophies and receive regular updates via peer review. The PADI training system is composed of modules with standardized learning objectives divided into theory and practical skills development. Each module is a stand-alone course for which certification is provided to the participant on successful completion of the course. Theory is mainly conveyed by way of self-study using books or digital training using PADI eLearning. All study options are supplemented with video and, in most cases, live instruction to help the participant visualize what they have read. Confirmation of the student diver's level of mastery in standardized knowledge review sessions is carried out by a scuba instructor. The instructor utilizes both written tests and live observation during actual dives to verify a student's knowledge and skills. Practical skills are obtained through confined water training (pools or relatively shallow water) and performance evaluations in open water. ===Dive Experiences=== * Discover Scuba Diving \u2013 An introductory diving experience under the direct supervision of an instructor in controlled conditions. * PADI Seal Team (Age 8 and above) * PADI Bubble Maker (Age 8 and above) * Skin Diver (Snorkeling) * Discover Rebreather \u2013 An introductory confined water experience using a recreational or technical rebreather under the direct supervision of a PADI Rebreather or Tec CCR Instructor. * Discover Tec \u2013 An introductory confined water experience using technical backmount or sidemount equipment. ===Certification Levels=== * Junior Scuba Diver (Age 10 to 14) * Scuba Diver \u2013 subset of the PADI Open Water Diver course, must dive under the direct supervision of a PADI Professional * Junior Open Water Diver (Age 10 to 14) * Open Water Diver * Adventure Diver \u2013 exposure to three elective scuba experiences. * Advanced Open Water Diver \u2013 expanded scuba skills through \"adventure\" dive experience: a \"deep\" dive (18\u201330m), an underwater navigation dive and three electives from a large choice. * Rescue Diver \u2013 Basic skills in stress management, self rescue and buddy rescue for recreational diving. * Master Scuba Diver \u2013 recognition of selected set of certifications and experience: Advanced Open Water Diver, Rescue Diver, 5 elective specialties and 50 logged dives. *Divemaster *Open Water Scuba Instructor *Assistant Instructor *Specialty Instructor *Master Scuba Diver Trainer *IDC Staff Instructor *Master Instructor *Course Director Recreational specialty coursesFull Face Mask Diver - learning how to use a full face mask * Altitude Diver \u2013 open water diving where the surface is 300 meters (1,000 feet) or more above sea level.

Since 2009, PADI and the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) have maintained a mutual support partnership. PADI is a member of the United States Recreational Scuba Training Council (RSTC). ===Other countries=== In Canada, PADI sponsors the Scouts Canada Scuba Program. Recognitions and equivalencies has been established between PADI and Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Mondiale des Activit\u00e9s Subaquatiques, the Colombian Navy, and F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise d'\u00c9tudes et de Sports Sous-Marins (FFESSM). PADI is also a registered training organisation in Australia. As of 2012, PADI rescue diver and divemaster programs are included on the United Kingdom's Health and Safety Executive list of approved diving qualifications. Those PADI courses aligning with standards published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for \u2018Recreational diving services\u2019 were audited by the European Underwater Federation (EUF) Certification Body in 2004 and 2009, and were certified at both times as complying with these standards. PADI is a member of the following member councils of the World Recreational Scuba Training Council \u2013 the RSTC Canada, the RSTC Europe and the C-Card Council (Japan). ===Citations in professional literature=== PADI's instructional methodology is cited in EDUCAUSE's 2012 book, Game Changers: Education and Information Technologies regarding badges as \u201ca symbol or indicator of an accomplishment, skill, quality, or interest. From the Boy and Girl Scouts to PADI diving instruction, to the more recently popular geolocation game Foursquare, badges have been successfully used to set goals, motivate behaviors, represent achievements, and communicate success in many contexts.\u201d PADI's environmental emphasis is cited in the 2007 book, New Frontiers in Marine Tourism, in its section, Dive Tourism, Sustainable Tourism and Social Responsibility: A Growing Agenda \u2013 Environmental management and education: the case of PADI, (Chapter Seven). \u201cPADI, as well as other diver certification organisations and individual businesses, has put significant resources into conservation and developed public awareness programmes\u201d. New Frontiers in Marine Tourism also cites in the section entitled Student Scholarships and Social Responsibility: A Growing Agenda for PADI, that \u201cThe PADI Scholarship programme \u2026 is a good example of the way that various disparate parts of an industry, each with limited resources, can pool their efforts to help more people from developing countries to enter the diving profession\u2026 PADI recognises that good relations with the involvement of local people is essential both to business development and to environmental protection. The scholarship scheme makes entry into the dive business more possible for some students who have the backing of their dive centre.\u201d ==PADI Travel== In 2018, PADI launched PADI Travel, an online dive travel resource and booking platform for dive resort and liveaboard packages. ==Criticism== In 2006, PADI was severely criticized by a Coroner's court in the United Kingdom for providing what experts regarded as short and insufficient training. Although PADI training standards differ from those formerly prevalent in the United Kingdom under the BSAC system, PADI training standards are consistent with World Recreational Scuba Training Council standards. ==Project AWARE== In 1989, PADI founded Project AWARE to help conserve underwater environments. In 1992, Project AWARE Foundation became a registered nonprofit organization with an environmental mission and purpose. PADI continues to partner with Project AWARE, supporting the organization with in-kind services, donations through its processes and connection to the PADI network of divers, dive professionals and dive centers. Project AWARE information has been integrated in most courses and divers are offered the chance to exchange their normal certification card for an AWARE-certification card by making a donation to the program when sending in their application for a new certification. ==Affiliate companies== * Emergency First Response provides CPR and First Aid training both for the lay person and in the workplace. * Current Publishing Corporation develops marine science programs for high school and upper level educational facilities. * Diving Science and Technology Corporation (DSAT) is the development arm for the Recreational Dive Planner and PADI's Tec-Rec program. ==See also== * ==References== ==External links== * * Sport Diver magazine: United Kingdom edition and North American edition \u2013 The official magazine of PADI Category:Companies established in 1966 Category:Underwater diving training organizations ",
