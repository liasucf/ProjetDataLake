    "text": "In telecommunications, a pulse link repeater (PLR) is a device that interfaces concatenated E and M signaling paths. A PLR converts a ground, received from the E lead of one signal path, to \u221248 VDC, which is applied to the M lead of the concatenated signal path. In many commercial carrier systems, the channel bank cards or modules have a \"PLR\" option that permits the direct concatenation of E&M; signaling paths, without the need for separate PLR equipment. ==References== Category:Telecommunications equipment ",
