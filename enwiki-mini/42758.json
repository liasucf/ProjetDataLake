    "text": "Late 16th-century (Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period) depiction of Murasaki Shikibu, by Kan\u014d Takanobu was a Japanese novelist, poet and lady-in-waiting at the Imperial court during the Heian period. She is best known as the author of The Tale of Genji, widely considered to be the world's first novel, written in Japanese between about 1000 and 1012. Murasaki Shikibu is a descriptive name; her personal name is unknown, but she may have been , who was mentioned in a 1007 court diary as an imperial lady-in-waiting. Heian women were traditionally excluded from learning Chinese, the written language of government, but Murasaki, raised in her erudite father's household, showed a precocious aptitude for the Chinese classics and managed to acquire fluency. She married in her mid-to late twenties and gave birth to a daughter before her husband died, two years after they were married. It is uncertain when she began to write The Tale of Genji, but it was probably while she was married or shortly after she was widowed. In about 1005, she was invited to serve as a lady-in-waiting to Empress Sh\u014dshi at the Imperial court by Fujiwara no Michinaga, probably because of her reputation as a writer. She continued to write during her service, adding scenes from court life to her work. After five or six years, she left court and retired with Sh\u014dshi to the Lake Biwa region. Scholars differ on the year of her death; although most agree on 1014, others have suggested she was alive in 1031. Murasaki wrote The Diary of Lady Murasaki, a volume of poetry, and The Tale of Genji. Within a decade of its completion, Genji was distributed throughout the provinces; within a century it was recognized as a classic of Japanese literature and had become a subject of scholarly criticism. Early in the 20th century her work was translated; a six-volume English translation was completed in 1933. Scholars continue to recognize the importance of her work, which reflects Heian court society at its peak. Since the 13th century her works have been illustrated by Japanese artists and well-known ukiyo-e woodblock masters. ==Early life== Murasaki Shikibu was born c. 973Bowring believes her date of birth most likely to have been 973; Mulhern places it somewhere between 970 and 978, and Waley claims it was 978. See Bowring (2004), 4; Mulhern (1994), 257; Waley (1960), vii. in Heian-ky\u014d, Japan, into the northern Fujiwara clan descending from Fujiwara no Yoshifusa, the first 9th-century Fujiwara regent.Shirane (2008b), 293 The Fujiwara clan dominated court politics until the end of the 11th century through strategic marriages of their daughters into the imperial family and the use of regencies. In the late 10th century and early 11th century, Michinaga, the so-called Mido Kampaku, arranged his four daughters into marriages with emperors, giving him unprecedented power. Murasaki's great- grandfather, Fujiwara no Kanesuke, had been in the top tier of the aristocracy, but her branch of the family gradually lost power and by the time of Murasaki's birth was at the middle to lower ranks of the Heian aristocracy\u2014the level of provincial governors.Shirane (1987), 215 The lower ranks of the nobility were typically posted away from court to undesirable positions in the provinces, exiled from the centralized power and court in Kyoto. Despite the loss of status, the family had a reputation among the literati through Murasaki's paternal great-grandfather and grandfather, both of whom were well-known poets. Her great-grandfather, Fujiwara no Kanesuke, had fifty-six poems included in thirteen of the Twenty-one Imperial Anthologies,Chokusen Sakusha Burui \u52c5\u64b0\u4f5c\u8005\u90e8\u985e the Collections of Thirty-six Poets and the Yamato Monogatari (Tales of Yamato).Mulhern (1994), 257\u2013258 Her great- grandfather and grandfather both had been friendly with Ki no Tsurayuki, who became notable for popularizing verse written in Japanese.Bowring (2004), 4 Her father, Fujiwara no Tametoki, attended the State Academy (Daigaku-ry\u014d)Inge (1990), 9 and became a well-respected scholar of Chinese classics and poetry; his own verse was anthologized.Mulhern (1991), 79 He entered public service around 968 as a minor official and was given a governorship in 996, staying in service until about 1018.Adolphson (2007), 111 Murasaki's mother was descended from the same branch of northern Fujiwara as Tametoki. The couple had three children, a son and two daughters. In the Heian era the use of names, insofar as they were recorded, did not follow a modern pattern. A court lady, as well as being known by the title of her own position, if any, took a name referring to the rank or title of a male relative. Thus \"Shikibu\" is not a modern surname, but refers to Shikibu-sh\u014d, the Ministry of Ceremonials where Murasaki's father was a functionary. \"Murasaki\", an additional name possibly derived from the color violet associated with wisteria, the meaning of the word fuji (an element of her clan name), may have been bestowed on her at court in reference to the name she herself had given to the main female character in \"Genji\". Michinaga mentions the names of several ladies-in- waiting in a 1007 diary entry; one, Fujiwara no Takako (Ky\u014dshi), may be Murasaki's personal name.Seven women were named in the entry, with the actual names of four women known. Of the remaining three women, one was not a Fujiwara, one held a high rank and therefore had to be older, leaving the possibility that the third, Fujiwara no Takako, was Murasaki. See Tsunoda (1963), 1\u201327 In Heian-era Japan, husbands and wives kept separate households; children were raised with their mothers, although the patrilineal system was still followed.Ueno (2009), 254 Murasaki was unconventional because she lived in her father's household, most likely on Teramachi Street in Kyoto, with her younger brother Nobunori. Their mother died, perhaps in childbirth, when they were quite young. Murasaki had at least three half-siblings raised with their mothers; she was very close to one sister who died in her twenties.Shirane (1987), 218Puette (1983), 50\u201351Green, Michelle. \"Kyoto Celebrates a 1000-Year Love Affair\". (December 31, 2008). The New York Times. Retrieved August 9, 2011 Murasaki was born at a period when Japan was becoming more isolated, after missions to China had ended and a stronger national culture was emerging.Bowring (1996), xii In the 9th and 10th centuries, Japanese gradually became a written language through the development of kana, a syllabary based on abbreviations of Chinese characters. In Murasaki's lifetime, men continued to write formally in Chinese, but kana became the written language of intimacy and of noblewomen, setting the foundation for unique forms of Japanese literature.Reischauer (1999), 29\u201329 Chinese was taught to Murasaki's brother as preparation for a career in government, and during her childhood, living in her father's household, she learned and became proficient in classical Chinese. In her diary she wrote, \"When my brother ... was a young boy learning the Chinese classics, I was in the habit of listening to him and I became unusually proficient at understanding those passages that he found too difficult to understand and memorize. Father, a most learned man, was always regretting the fact: 'Just my luck,' he would say, 'What a pity she was not born a man!qtd in Bowring (2004), 11\u201312 With her brother she studied Chinese literature, and she probably also received instruction in more traditional subjects such as music, calligraphy and Japanese poetry. Murasaki's education was unorthodox. Louis Perez explains in The History of Japan that \"Women ... were thought to be incapable of real intelligence and therefore were not educated in Chinese.\"Perez (1998), 21 Murasaki was aware that others saw her as \"pretentious, awkward, difficult to approach, prickly, too fond of her tales, haughty, prone to versifying, disdainful, cantankerous and scornful\".qtd in Inge (1990), 9 Asian literature scholar Thomas Inge believes she had \"a forceful personality that seldom won her friends.\" ==Marriage== Aristocratic Heian women lived restricted and secluded lives, allowed to speak to men only when they were close relatives or household members. Murasaki's autobiographical poetry shows that she socialized with women but had limited contact with men other than her father and brother; she often exchanged poetry with women but never with men. Unlike most noblewomen of her status, however, she did not marry on reaching puberty; instead she stayed in her father's household until her mid-twenties or perhaps even to her early thirties.Knapp, Bettina. \"Lady Murasaki's The Tale of the Genji\". Symposium. (1992). (46). In 996 when her father was posted to a four-year governorship in Echizen Province, Murasaki went with him, although it was uncommon for a noblewoman of the period to travel such a distance that could take as long as five days.Mulhern (1991), 83\u201385 She returned to Kyoto, probably in 998, to marry her father's friend Fujiwara no Nobutaka (c. 950 \u2013 c. 1001), a much older second cousin. Descended from the same branch of the Fujiwara clan, he was a court functionary and bureaucrat at the Ministry of Ceremonials, with a reputation for dressing extravagantly and as a talented dancer. In his late forties at the time of their marriage, he had multiple households with an unknown number of wives and offspring. Gregarious and well-known at court, he was involved in numerous romantic relationships that may have continued after his marriage to Murasaki. As was customary, she would have remained in her father's household where her husband would have visited her. Nobutaka had been granted more than one governorship, and by the time of his marriage to Murasaki he was probably quite wealthy. Accounts of their marriage vary: Richard Bowring writes that the marriage was happy, but Japanese literature scholar Haruo Shirane sees indications in her poems that she resented her husband. The couple's daughter, Kenshi (Kataiko), was born in 999. Two years later Nobutaka died during a cholera epidemic. As a married woman Murasaki would have had servants to run the household and care for her daughter, giving her ample leisure time. She enjoyed reading and had access to romances (monogatari) such as The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter and The Tales of Ise. Scholars believe she may have started writing The Tale of Genji before her husband's death; it is known she was writing after she was widowed, perhaps in a state of grief. In her diary she describes her feelings after her husband's death: \"I felt depressed and confused. For some years I had existed from day to day in listless fashion ... doing little more than registering the passage of time ... The thought of my continuing loneliness was quite unbearable\".qtd in Mulhern (1991), 84 According to legend, Murasaki retreated to Ishiyama-dera at Lake Biwa, where she was inspired to write The Tale of Genji on an August night while looking at the moon. Although scholars dismiss the factual basis of the story of her retreat, Japanese artists often depicted her at Ishiyama Temple staring at the moon for inspiration. She may have been commissioned to write the story and may have known an exiled courtier in a similar position to her hero Prince Genji. Murasaki would have distributed newly written chapters of Genji to friends who in turn would have re-copied them and passed them on. By this practice the story became known and she gained a reputation as an author.Mulhern (1994), 258\u2013259 In her early to mid-thirties, she became a lady-in-waiting (ny\u014db\u014d) at court, most likely because of her reputation as an author. Chieko Mulhern writes in Japanese Women Writers, a Biocritical Sourcebook that scholars have wondered why Murasaki made such a move at a comparatively late period in her life. Her diary evidences that she exchanged poetry with Michinaga after her husband's death, leading to speculation that the two may have been lovers. Bowring sees no evidence that she was brought to court as Michinaga's concubine, although he did bring her to court without following official channels. Mulhern thinks Michinaga wanted to have Murasaki at court to educate his daughter Sh\u014dshi.Bowring (2004), 4; Mulhern (1994), 259 ==Court life== Tosa-school mid- to late 17th-century yamato-e of Heian courtiers by Tosa Mitsuoki, shows women dressed in j\u016bnihitoe and with floor- length hair. Heian culture and court life reached a peak early in the 11th century. The population of Kyoto grew to around 100,000 as the nobility became increasingly isolated at the Heian Palace in government posts and court service.Lockard (2008), 292 Courtiers became overly refined with little to do, insulated from reality, preoccupied with the minutiae of court life, turning to artistic endeavors.Henshall (1999), 24\u201325 Emotions were commonly expressed through the artistic use of textiles, fragrances, calligraphy, colored paper, poetry, and layering of clothing in pleasing color combinations\u2014according to mood and season. Those who showed an inability to follow conventional aesthetics quickly lost popularity, particularly at court. Popular pastimes for Heian noblewomen\u2014who adhered to rigid fashions of floor-length hair, whitened skin and blackened teeth\u2014included having love affairs, writing poetry and keeping diaries. The literature that Heian court women wrote is recognized as some of the earliest and among the best literature written in Japanese canon. ===Rival courts and women poets=== When in 995 Michinaga's two brothers Fujiwara no Michitaka and Fujiwara no Michikane died leaving the regency vacant, Michinaga quickly won a power struggle against his nephew Fujiwara no Korechika (brother to Teishi, Emperor Ichij\u014d's wife), and, aided by his sister Senshi, he assumed power. Teishi had supported her brother Korechika, who was discredited and banished from court in 996 following a scandal involving his shooting at the retired Emperor Kazan, causing her to lose power.Shively and McCullough (1999), 67\u201369 Four years later Michinaga sent Sh\u014dshi, his eldest daughter, to Emperor Ichij\u014d's harem when she was about 12.McCullough (1990), 201 A year after placing Sh\u014dshi in the imperial harem, in an effort to undermine Teishi's influence and increase Sh\u014dshi's standing, Michinaga had her named Empress although Teishi already held the title. As historian Donald Shively explains, \"Michinaga shocked even his admirers by arranging for the unprecedented appointment of Teishi (or Sadako) and Sh\u014dshi as concurrent empresses of the same emperor, Teishi holding the usual title of \"Lustrous Heir-bearer\" k\u014dg\u014d and Sh\u014dshi that of \"Inner Palatine\" (ch\u016bg\u016b), a toponymically derived equivalent coined for the occasion\". About five years later, Michinaga brought Murasaki to Sh\u014dshi's court, in a position that Bowring describes as a companion-tutor.Bowring (1996), xiv Women of high status lived in seclusion at court and, through strategic marriages, were used to gain political power for their families. In the case of Sh\u014dshi and other such marriages to members of the imperial clan, it enabled the woman's clan to exercise influence over the emperor\u2014this was how Michinaga, and other Fujiwara Regents, achieved their power. Despite their seclusion, some women wielded considerable influence, often achieved through competitive salons, dependent on the quality of those attending.Bowring (1996), xv\u2013xvii Ichij\u014d's mother and Michinaga's sister, Senshi, had an influential salon, and Michinaga probably wanted Sh\u014dshi to surround herself with skilled women such as Murasaki to build a rival salon. Sh\u014dshi was 16 to 19 when Murasaki joined her court.According to Mulhern Sh\u014dshi was 19 when Murasaki arrived; Waley states she was 16. See Mulhern (1994), 259 and Waley (1960), vii According to Arthur Waley, Sh\u014dshi was a serious-minded young lady, whose living arrangements were divided between her father's household and her court at the Imperial Palace.Waley (1960), vii She gathered around her talented women writers such as Izumi Shikibu and Akazome Emon\u2014the author of an early vernacular history, The Tale of Flowering Fortunes.Mulhern (1994), 156 The rivalry that existed among the women is evident in Murasaki's diary, where she wrote disparagingly of Izumi: \"Izumi Shikibu is an amusing letter-writer; but there is something not very satisfactory about her. She has a gift for dashing off informal compositions in a careless running-hand; but in poetry she needs either an interesting subject or some classic model to imitate. Indeed it does not seem to me that in herself she is really a poet at all.\"Waley (1960), xii Sei Sh\u014dnagon, author of The Pillow Book, had been in service as lady-in-waiting to Teishi when Sh\u014dshi came to court; it is possible that Murasaki was invited to Sh\u014dshi's court as a rival to Sh\u014dnagon. Teishi died in 1001, before Murasaki entered service with Sh\u014dshi, so the two writers were not there concurrently, but Murasaki, who wrote about Sh\u014dnagon in her diary, certainly knew of her, and to an extent was influenced by her.Keene (1999), 414\u2013415 Sh\u014dnagon's The Pillow Book may have been commissioned as a type of propaganda to highlight Teishi's court, known for its educated ladies- in-waiting. Japanese literature scholar Joshua Mostow believes Michinaga provided Murasaki to Sh\u014dshi as an equally or better educated woman, so as to showcase Sh\u014dshi's court in a similar manner.Mostow (2001), 130 The two writers had different temperaments: Sh\u014dnagon was witty, clever, and outspoken; Murasaki was withdrawn and sensitive. Entries in Murasaki's diary show that the two may not have been on good terms. Murasaki wrote, \"Sei Sh\u014dnagon ... was dreadfully conceited. She thought herself so clever, littered her writing with Chinese characters, [which] left a great deal to be desired.\"qtd in Keene (1999), 414 Keene thinks that Murasaki's impression of Sh\u014dnagon could have been influenced by Sh\u014dshi and the women at her court because Sh\u014dnagon served Sh\u014dshi's rival empress. Furthermore, he believes Murasaki was brought to court to write Genji in response to Sh\u014dnagon's popular Pillow Book. Murasaki contrasted herself to Sh\u014dnagon in a variety of ways. She denigrated the pillow book genre and, unlike Sh\u014dnagon who flaunted her knowledge of Chinese, Murasaki pretended to not know the language, regarding it as pretentious and affected. ===\"The Lady of the Chronicles\"=== Although the popularity of the Chinese language diminished in the late Heian era, Chinese ballads continued to be popular, including those written by Bai Juyi. Murasaki taught Chinese to Sh\u014dshi who was interested in Chinese art and Juyi's ballads. Upon becoming Empress, Sh\u014dshi installed screens decorated with Chinese script, causing outrage because written Chinese was considered the language of men, far removed from the women's quarters.Adolphson (2007), 110, 119 The study of Chinese was thought to be unladylike and went against the notion that only men should have access to the literature. Women were supposed to read and write only in Japanese, which separated them through language from government and the power structure. Murasaki, with her unconventional classical Chinese education, was one of the few women available to teach Sh\u014dshi classical Chinese.Adolphson (2007), 110 Bowring writes it was \"almost subversive\" that Murasaki knew Chinese and taught the language to Sh\u014dshi.Bowring (2004), 11 Murasaki, who was reticent about her Chinese education, held the lessons between the two women in secret, writing in her diary, \"Since last summer ... very secretly, in odd moments when there happened to be no one about, I have been reading with Her Majesty ... There has of course been no question of formal lessons ... I have thought it best to say nothing about the matter to anybody.\"qtd in Waley (1960), ix\u2013x Murasaki probably earned an ambiguous nickname, \"The Lady of the Chronicles\" (Nihongi no tsubone), for teaching Sh\u014dshi Chinese literature. A lady-in-waiting who disliked Murasaki accused her of flaunting her knowledge of Chinese and began calling her \"The Lady of the Chronicles\"\u2014an allusion to the classic Chronicles of Japan\u2014after an incident in which chapters from Genji were read aloud to the Emperor and his courtiers, one of whom remarked that the author showed a high level of education. Murasaki wrote in her diary, \"How utterly ridiculous! Would I, who hesitate to reveal my learning to my women at home, ever think of doing so at court?\"qtd in Mostow (2001), 133 Although the nickname was apparently meant to be disparaging, Mulhern believes Murasaki was flattered by it. The attitude toward the Chinese language was contradictory. In Teishi's court, Chinese had been flaunted and considered a symbol of imperial rule and superiority. Yet, in Sh\u014dshi's salon there was a great deal of hostility towards the language\u2014perhaps owing to political expedience during a period when Chinese began to be rejected in favor of Japanese\u2014even though Sh\u014dshi herself was a student of the language. The hostility may have affected Murasaki and her opinion of the court, and forced her to hide her knowledge of Chinese. Unlike Sh\u014dnagon, who was both ostentatious and flirtatious, as well as outspoken about her knowledge of Chinese, Murasaki seems to have been humble, an attitude which possibly impressed Michinaga. Although Murasaki used Chinese and incorporated it in her writing, she publicly rejected the language, a commendable attitude during a period of burgeoning Japanese culture.Mostow (2001), 131, 137 Murasaki seems to have been unhappy with court life and was withdrawn and somber. No surviving records show that she entered poetry competitions; she appears to have exchanged few poems or letters with other women during her service. In general, unlike Sei Sh\u014dnagon, Murasaki gives the impression in her diary that she disliked court life, the other ladies-in- waiting, and the drunken revelry. She did, however, become close friends with a lady-in-waiting named Lady Saish\u014d, and she wrote of the winters that she enjoyed, \"I love to see the snow here\".Waley (1960), xiiiWaley (1960), xi According to Waley, Murasaki may not have been unhappy with court life in general but bored in Sh\u014dshi's court. He speculates she would have preferred to serve with the Lady Senshi, whose household seems to have been less strict and more light-hearted. In her diary, Murasaki wrote about Sh\u014dshi's court, \"[she] has gathered round her a number of very worthy young ladies ... Her Majesty is beginning to acquire more experience of life, and no longer judges others by the same rigid standards as before; but meanwhile her Court has gained a reputation for extreme dullness\".Waley (1960), viii In this 13th-century painting, from the Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki, drunk, disarranged, and disordered Heian courtiers are shown joking and flirting with court ladies. Murasaki disliked the men at court whom she thought to be drunken and stupid. However, some scholars, such as Waley, are certain she was involved romantically with Michinaga. At the least, Michinaga pursued her and pressured her strongly, and her flirtation with him is recorded in her diary as late as 1010. Yet, she wrote to him in a poem, \"You have neither read my book, nor won my love.\"Waley (1960), x In her diary she records having to avoid advances from Michinaga\u2014one night he sneaked into her room, stealing a newly written chapter of Genji.Mulhern (1994), 260\u2013261 However, Michinaga's patronage was essential if she was to continue writing.Shirane (1987), 221\u2013222 Murasaki described her daughter's court activities: the lavish ceremonies, the complicated courtships, the \"complexities of the marriage system\", and in elaborate detail, the birth of Sh\u014dshi's two sons. It is likely that Murasaki enjoyed writing in solitude. She believed she did not fit well with the general atmosphere of the court, writing of herself: \"I am wrapped up in the study of ancient stories ... living all the time in a poetical world of my own scarcely realizing the existence of other people .... But when they get to know me, they find to their extreme surprise that I am kind and gentle\".Waley (1960), xv Inge says that she was too outspoken to make friends at court, and Mulhern thinks Murasaki's court life was comparatively quiet compared to other court poets. Mulhern speculates that her remarks about Izumi were not so much directed at Izumi's poetry but at her behavior, lack of morality and her court liaisons, of which Murasaki disapproved. Rank was important in Heian court society and Murasaki would not have felt herself to have much, if anything, in common with the higher ranked and more powerful Fujiwaras.Bowring (2004), 3 In her diary, she wrote of her life at court: \"I realized that my branch of the family was a very humble one; but the thought seldom troubled me, and I was in those days far indeed from the painful consciousness of inferiority which makes life at Court a continual torment to me.\"Waley (1960), xiv A court position would have increased her social standing, but more importantly she gained a greater experience to write about. Court life, as she experienced it, is well reflected in the chapters of Genji written after she joined Sh\u014dshi. The name Murasaki was most probably given to her at a court dinner in an incident she recorded in her diary: in c. 1008 the well-known court poet Fujiwara no Kint\u014d inquired after the \"Young Murasaki\"\u2014an allusion to the character named Murasaki in Genji\u2014which would have been considered a compliment from a male court poet to a female author. ==Later life and death== Genji-Garden at Rozanji, a temple in Kyoto associated with her former mansion When Emperor Ichij\u014d died in 1011, Sh\u014dshi retired from the Imperial Palace to live in a Fujiwara mansion in Biwa, most likely accompanied by Murasaki, who is recorded as being there with Sh\u014dshi in 1013. George Aston explains that when Murasaki retired from court she was again associated with Ishiyama-dera: \"To this beautiful spot, it is said, Murasaki no Shikibu (sic) retired from court life to devote the remainder of her days to literature and religion. There are sceptics, however, Motoori being one, who refuse to believe this story, pointing out ... that it is irreconcilable with known facts. On the other hand, the very chamber in the temple where the Genji was written is shown\u2014with the ink-slab which the author used, and a Buddhist Sutra in her handwriting, which, if they do not satisfy the critic, still are sufficient to carry conviction to the minds of ordinary visitors to the temple.\"Aston (1899), 93 Murasaki may have died in 1014. Her father made a hasty return to Kyoto from his post at Echigo Province that year, possibly because of her death. Writing in A Bridge of Dreams: A Poetics of \"The Tale of Genji\", Shirane mentions that 1014 is generally accepted as the date of Murasaki Shikibu's death and 973 as the date of her birth, making her 41 when she died. Bowring considers 1014 to be speculative, and believes she may have lived with Sh\u014dshi until as late as 1025.Bowring (2004), 5 Waley agrees given that Murasaki may have attended ceremonies with Sh\u014dshi held for Sh\u014dshi's son, Emperor Go-Ichij\u014d around 1025. Murasaki's brother Nobunori died in around 1011, which, combined with the death of his daughter, may have prompted her father to resign his post and take vows at Miidera temple where he died in 1029. Murasaki's daughter entered court service in 1025 as a wet nurse to the future Emperor Go-Reizei (1025\u20131068). She went on to become a well-known poet as Daini no Sanmi.Mulhern (1996), 259 ==Works== Murasaki is depicted writing at Ishiyama-dera in this late 17th-century silk painting on the Harvard Genji Album frontispiece by Tosa Mitsuoki, housed at the Sackler Museum. Three works are attributed to Murasaki: The Tale of Genji, The Diary of Lady Murasaki and Poetic Memoirs, a collection of 128 poems. Her work is considered important because her writing reflects the creation and development of Japanese writing during a period when Japanese shifted from an unwritten vernacular to a written language. Until the 9th century, Japanese language texts were written in Chinese characters using the man'y\u014dgana writing system.Mason (1997), 81 A revolutionary achievement was the development of kana, a true Japanese script, in the mid-to late 9th century. Japanese authors began to write prose in their own language, which led to genres such as tales (monogatari) and poetic journals (Nikki Bungaku).Kodansha International (2004), 475, 120Shirane (2008b), 2, 113\u2013114Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric (2005), 594 Historian Edwin Reischauer writes that genres such as the monogatari were distinctly Japanese and that Genji, written in kana, \"was the outstanding work of the period\". ===Diary and poetry=== 13th-century (emakimono) illustration of The Diary of Lady Murasaki showing Empress Sh\u014dshi with the infant Emperor Go-Ichij\u014d and ladies-in-waiting secluded behind a kich\u014d. Murasaki began her diary after she entered service at Sh\u014dshi's court. Much of what we know about her and her experiences at court comes from the diary, which covers the period from about 1008 to 1010. The long descriptive passages, some of which may have originated as letters, cover her relationships with the other ladies-in-waiting, Michinaga's temperament, the birth of Sh\u014dshi's sons\u2014at Michinaga's mansion rather than at the Imperial Palace\u2014and the process of writing Genji, including descriptions of passing newly written chapters to calligraphers for transcriptions.McCullough (1990), 16 Typical of contemporary court diaries written to honor patrons, Murasaki devotes half to the birth of Sh\u014dshi's son Emperor Go-Ichij\u014d, an event of enormous importance to Michinaga: he had planned for it with his daughter's marriage which made him grandfather and de facto regent to an emperor.Shirane (2008b), 448 Poetic Memoirs is a collection of 128 poems Mulhern describes as \"arranged in a biographical sequence\". The original set has been lost. According to custom, the verses would have been passed from person to person and often copied. Some appear written for a lover\u2014possibly her husband before he died\u2014but she may have merely followed tradition and written simple love poems. They contain biographical details: she mentions a sister who died, the visit to Echizen province with her father and that she wrote poetry for Sh\u014dshi. Murasaki's poems were published in 1206 by Fujiwara no Teika, in what Mulhern believes to be the collection that is closest to the original form; at around the same time Teika included a selection of Murasaki's works in an imperial anthology, New Collections of Ancient and Modern Times. ===The Tale of Genji=== Murasaki is best known for her The Tale of Genji, a three-part novel spanning 1100 pages and 54 chapters,Mulhern (1994), 262McCullough (1990), 9 which is thought to have taken a decade to complete. The earliest chapters were possibly written for a private patron either during her marriage or shortly after her husband's death. She continued writing while at court and probably finished while still in service to Sh\u014dshi.Shively (1999), 445 She would have needed patronage to produce a work of such length. Michinaga provided her with costly paper and ink, and with calligraphers. The first handwritten volumes were probably assembled and bound by ladies-in-waiting. Late 17th-century or early 18th-century silk scroll painting of a scene from chapter 34 of The Tale of Genji showing men playing in the garden watched by a woman sitting behind a screen. In his The Pleasures of Japanese Literature, Keene claims Murasaki wrote the \"supreme work of Japanese fiction\" by drawing on traditions of waka court diaries, and earlier monogatari\u2014written in a mixture of Chinese script and Japanese script\u2014such as The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter or The Tales of Ise.Keene (1988), 75\u201379, 81\u201384 She drew on and blended styles from Chinese histories, narrative poetry and contemporary Japanese prose. Adolphson writes that the juxtaposition of formal Chinese style with mundane subjects resulted in a sense of parody or satire, giving her a distinctive voice.Adolphson (2007), 121\u2013122 Genji follows the traditional format of monogatari\u2014telling a tale\u2014particularly evident in its use of a narrator, but Keene claims Murasaki developed the genre far beyond its bounds, and by doing so created a form that is utterly modern. The story of the \"shining prince\" Genji is set in the late 9th to early 10th centuries, and Murasaki eliminated from it the elements of fairy tales and fantasy frequently found in earlier monogatari.Keene (1988), 81\u201384 The themes in Genji are common to the period, and are defined by Shively as encapsulating \"the tyranny of time and the inescapable sorrow of romantic love\".Shively (1990), 444 The main theme is that of the fragility of life, \"the sorrow of human existence\", mono no aware\u2014she used the term over a thousand times in Genji.Henshall (1999), 27 Keene speculates that in her tale of the \"shining prince\", Murasaki may have created for herself an idealistic escape from court life, which she found less than savory. In Prince Genji she formed a gifted, comely, refined, yet human and sympathetic protagonist. Keene writes that Genji gives a view into the Heian period; for example love affairs flourished, although women typically remained unseen behind screens, curtains or fusuma. Helen McCullough describes Murasaki's writing as of universal appeal and believes The Tale of Genji \"transcends both its genre and age. Its basic subject matter and setting\u2014love at the Heian court\u2014are those of the romance, and its cultural assumptions are those of the mid-Heian period, but Murasaki Shikibu's unique genius has made the work for many a powerful statement of human relationships, the impossibility of permanent happiness in love ... and the vital importance, in a world of sorrows, of sensitivity to the feelings of others.\"McCullough (1999), 9 Prince Genji recognizes in each of his lovers the inner beauty of the woman and the fragility of life, which according to Keene, makes him heroic. The story was popular: Emperor Ichij\u014d had it read to him, even though it was written in Japanese. By 1021 all the chapters were known to be complete and the work was sought after in the provinces where it was scarce.Bowring (2004), 79 ==Legacy== Murasaki's reputation and influence have not diminished since her lifetime when she, with other Heian women writers, was instrumental in developing Japanese into a written language.Bowring (2004), 12 Her writing was required reading for court poets as early as the 12th century as her work began to be studied by scholars who generated authoritative versions and criticism. Within a century of her death she was highly regarded as a classical writer. In the 17th century, Murasaki's work became emblematic of Confucian philosophy and women were encouraged to read her books. In 1673 Kumazawa Banzan argued that her writing was valuable for its sensitivity and depiction of emotions. He wrote in his Discursive Commentary on Genji that when \"human feelings are not understood the harmony of the Five Human Relationships is lost.\"qtd in Lillehoj (2007), 110 The Tale of Genji was copied and illustrated in various forms as early as a century after Murasaki's death. The Genji Monogatari Emaki, is a late Heian era 12th-century handscroll, consisting of four scrolls, 19 paintings, and 20 sheets of calligraphy. The illustrations, definitively dated to between 1110 and 1120, have been tentatively attributed to Fujiwara no Takachika and the calligraphy to various well-known contemporary calligraphers. The scroll is housed at the Gotoh Museum and the Tokugawa Art Museum.Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric (2005), 238 Female virtue was tied to literary knowledge in the 17th century, leading to a demand for Murasaki or Genji inspired artifacts, known as genji-e. Dowry sets decorated with scenes from Genji or illustrations of Murasaki became particularly popular for noblewomen: in the 17th century genji-e symbolically imbued a bride with an increased level of cultural status; by the 18th century they had come to symbolize marital success. In 1628, Tokugawa Iemitsu's daughter had a set of lacquer boxes made for her wedding; Prince Toshitada received a pair of silk genji-e screens, painted by Kan\u014d Tan'y\u016b as a wedding gift in 1649.Lillehoj (2007), 110\u2013113 Murasaki became a popular subject of paintings and illustrations highlighting her as a virtuous woman and poet. She is often shown at her desk in Ishimyama Temple, staring at the moon for inspiration. Tosa Mitsuoki made her the subject of hanging scrolls in the 17th century.Lillehoj, 108\u2013109 The Tale of Genji became a favorite subject of Japanese ukiyo-e artists for centuries with artists such as Hiroshige, Kiyonaga, and Utamaro illustrating various editions of the novel.Geczy (2008), 13 While early Genji art was considered symbolic of court culture, by the middle of the Edo period the mass-produced ukiyo-e prints made the illustrations accessible for the samurai classes and commoners. In Envisioning the \"Tale of Genji\" Shirane observes that \"The Tale of Genji has become many things to many different audiences through many different media over a thousand years ... unmatched by any other Japanese text or artifact.\"Shirane (2008a), 1\u20132 The work and its author were popularized through its illustrations in various media: emaki (illustrated handscrolls); by\u014dbu-e (screen paintings), ukiyo-e (woodblock prints); films, comics, and in the modern period, manga. In her fictionalized account of Murasaki's life, The Tale of Murasaki: A Novel, Liza Dalby has Murasaki involved in a romance during her travels with her father to Echizen Province.Tyler, Royall. \"Murasaki Shikibu: Brief Life of a Legendary Novelist: c. 973 \u2013 c. 1014\". (May 2002) Harvard Magazine. Retrieved August 21, 2011. 17th-century ink and gold paper fan showing Murasaki's writing The Tale of the Genji is recognized as an enduring classic. McCullough writes that Murasaki \"is both the quintessential representative of a unique society and a writer who speaks to universal human concerns with a timeless voice. Japan has not seen another such genius.\" Keene writes that The Tale of Genji continues to captivate, because, in the story, her characters and their concerns are universal. In the 1920s, when Waley's translation was published, reviewers compared Genji to Austen, Proust, and Shakespeare.Keene (1988), 84 Mulhern says of Murasaki that she is similar to Shakespeare, who represented his Elizabethan England, in that she captured the essence of the Heian court and as a novelist \"succeeded perhaps even beyond her own expectations.\" Like Shakespeare, her work has been the subject of reams of criticism and many books.Mulhern (1994), 264 The design of the 2000-yen note was created in Murasaki's honour. Kyoto held a year-long celebration commemorating the 1000th anniversary of Genji in 2008, with poetry competitions, visits to the Tale of Genji Museum in Uji and Ishiyama-dera (where a life size rendition of Murasaki at her desk was displayed), and women dressing in traditional 12-layered Heian court J\u016bnihitoe and ankle-length hair wigs. The author and her work inspired museum exhibits and Genji manga spin- offs. The design on the reverse of the first 2000 yen note commemorated her and The Tale of Genji.\"Japanese Feminist to Adorn Yen\". (February 11, 2009). CBSNews.com. Retrieved August 11, 2011. A plant bearing purple berries has been named after her.Kondansha (1983), 269 A Genji Album, only in the 1970s dated to 1510, is housed at Harvard University. The album is considered the earliest of its kind and consists of 54 paintings by Tosa Mitsunobu and 54 sheets of calligraphy on shikishi paper in five colors, written by master calligraphers. The leaves are housed in a case dated to the Edo period, with a silk frontispiece painted by Tosa Mitsuoki, dated to around 1690. The album contains Mitsuoki's authentication slips for his ancestor's 16th-century paintings.McCormick (2003), 54\u201356 ==Gallery== File:Tale of Genji Royal Outing.jpg|In The Tale of Genji, Murasaki described court life, as depicted in this exterior scene titled \"Royal Outing\", late 16th century by Tosa Mitsuyoshi.
