    "text": "CANTAT-2 was the second Canadian transatlantic telephone cable, in operation from 1974 to 1992. It could carry 1,840 simultaneous telephone calls between Beaver Harbour, Nova Scotia and England. The parties involved were Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation (now Teleglobe) and the British General Post Office. The cable was rerouted to Sable Island as Sitifofog 2000 for a period, and was eventually decommissioned. The work on the U.K. end of the cable involved an accident in which Pisces III, engaged in repeater burial of the newly laid cable on the shelf off Ireland, sank. The submersible sank in of water and was recovered with the crew safe after 76 hours. ==References== * Scotian Shelf: An Atlas of Human Activities Category:Submarine communications cables in the North Atlantic Ocean Category:Transatlantic communications cables Category:British Telecom buildings and structures Category:1992 disestablishments Category:Infrastructure completed in 1974 Category:Canada\u2013United Kingdom relations ",
