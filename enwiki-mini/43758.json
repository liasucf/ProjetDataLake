    "text": "Year 258 (CCLVIII) was a common year starting on Friday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Tuscus and Bassus (or, less frequently, year 1011 Ab urbe condita). The denomination 258 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years. == Events == === By place === ==== Roman Empire ==== * The Goths ravage Asia Minor and Trapezus. * The amount of silver in the Roman currency of the denarius falls below 10%.

This edict divides Christians into four categories: priests, who are to be put to death; senators and equestrians, who are to be stripped of their positions and their property confiscated; nuns, who are to be exiled; and imperial civil servants, who are condemned to forced labour. ==== China ==== * Sima Zhao quells Zhuge Dan's rebellion, thereby also ending what are known as the Three Rebellions in Shouchun. * Sun Xiu succeeds his brother Sun Liang as emperor of the Chinese state of Eastern Wu. === By topic === ==== Religion ==== * Cyprian, the bishop of Carthage, is martyred (decapitation). * Pope Sixtus II is martyred. ==== Education ==== * Nanjing University is founded in Nanjing, China. == Births == == Deaths == * March or April - Zhuge Dan, Chinese general of the Cao Wei state * August 6 - Pope Sixtus II * August 10 - Lawrence of Rome * September 14 - Cyprian, early Christian writer * Novatian, antipope * Valerian II, son of co-emperor Gallienus == References == ",
