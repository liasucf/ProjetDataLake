The area was inhabited by Tavastians and Finns proper until the so-called second crusade to Finland and Swedish colonisation of the area. Prior to the name Vantaa being taken into use in 1974, the area was known as Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4 (; \"Socken of Helsinki\"). The earliest record of the area is as Helsinge in 1351 when king Magnus II of Sweden granted salmon fishing rights on the river Vantaa to the Estonian Padise Abbey. The rapids of river Vantaa were known as Helsingfors, from which the current Swedish name of Helsinki derives. Early settlement in Vantaa was centered around the river, in Helsingin pit\u00e4j\u00e4n kirkonkyl\u00e4, and from it the city's current coat of arms derived its imagery. Since the 14th century, the road between Turku and Vyborg, King's Road, has run through Vantaa. The road brought significant attention to the city, and its location on the salmon rich river led to a permanent population. Ore deposits in Helsingin Pit\u00e4j\u00e4 had been discovered in the 1700s, but weren't utilized until Finland transferred to Russian control in the early 1800s. Ore extraction and processing lead to rapid industrialization in the area, with communities forming around locations like Tikkurila and Kerava. The industrial community in Tikkurila included an expeller pressing plant, which currently operates in the area as the paint manufacturer Tikkurila Oyj. In 1862, the railway between Helsinki and H\u00e4meenlinna was constructed, and one of its seven stations was built in Tikkurila, on its intersection with King's Road. The Swedish architect Carl Albert Edelfelt designed a Renaissance Revival styled station building, which is the oldest extant station building in Finland and (as of 1978) has been adapted into the Vantaa City Museum. The railway brought industry and induced population growth. Helsingin Pit\u00e4j\u00e4 gained municipality rights in 1865, after which it was named Helsingin maalaiskunta/Helsinge kommun (\"Rural Municipality of Helsinki\"). In 1952, the new international airport of Helsinki opened in Vantaa for the 1952 Summer Olympics. In 1972, the municipality was renamed Vantaa () and promoted to a k\u00f6ping (market town) (i.e. Vantaan kauppala/Vanda k\u00f6ping). In 1974, the town got full city rights as Vantaan kaupunki/Vanda stad or \"City of Vantaa\". The city grew rapidly starting from 1960's and a railway line was built to the western side of the city in 1970's. In 2015, an extension to the existing railway line, the Ring Rail Line opened, providing service to the airport and new residential and working districts. Along the ring road, new residential were constructed. The largest of these developments is the Kivist\u00f6 suburb followed by the residential districts of Leinel\u00e4 and Aviapolis. To connect the municipality on the west\u2013east, a new tramway is planned to open in 2030. This tramway will run from the Helsinki-Vantaa airport through districts of Pakkala, Aviapolis and Koivuhaka to the administrative centre of Tikkurila and further onward to Hakkila and L\u00e4nsim\u00e4ki in the east. The tram will also provide a link to the Helsinki metro at Mellunm\u00e4ki station. This tramline will be the first tram in Vantaa. ==Geography== The districts and major regions of Vantaa ===Location=== Vantaa is located in southern Finland, in the region of Uusimaa and the Helsinki sub- region. It is separated from the Gulf of Finland by Helsinki. Prior to the abolition of Finnish provinces in 2009, Vantaa was a part of the Southern Finland Province. The city borders Helsinki, the Finnish capital, which is to the south and southwest. Other neighbouring municipalities are Espoo to the west; Nurmij\u00e4rvi, Kerava, and Tuusula to the north; and Sipoo to the east. Vantaa is a part of the Finnish Capital Region, which is the inner core of the Greater Helsinki metropolitan area. ===Subdivision=== Vantaa is divided into seven major regions (, ): Tikkurila (Dickursby), Hakunila (H\u00e5kansb\u00f6le), Koivukyl\u00e4 (Bj\u00f6rkby), Korso, Aviapolis, Myyrm\u00e4ki (Myrbacka), and Kivist\u00f6. These major regions are then divided into a total of 60 city districts, the most populated of which are Myyrm\u00e4ki, Martinlaakso, Hakunila, and Pakkala. ===Features=== Rapids of river Vantaa Vantaa encompasses , of which is water. The city is mostly suburban and urban area with some rural landscape, notably in the districts of Sotunki and Seutula. Average population density is , which rises above in concentrated urban districts like Myyrm\u00e4ki and Tikkurila. The river Vantaa runs through western Vantaa, and its tributary Keravanjoki runs through eastern Vantaa. For its area, Vantaa has relatively few lakes. The city encompasses two natural lakes: Kuusij\u00e4rvi in Kuninkaanm\u00e4ki and Lammaslampi P\u00e4hkin\u00e4rinne, H\u00e4meenkyl\u00e4. In addition to these, there is an artificial lake, Silvolan tekoj\u00e4rvi. Vantaa shares two lakes with Espoo: Odilampi and Pitk\u00e4j\u00e4rvi. Vantaa exhibits frequent exposed granite bedrock ground, which is common in Finland. Resulting from erosion in the last glacial period (about 10,000 years ago), elevated surfaces often lack soil (superficial deposits), revealing bare stone unsuitable for most plant life. Other geological impacts of the last Ice Age include a series of eskers running through central Vantaa. ===Climate=== Tammisto forest nature reserve Vantaa has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfb), slightly above the threshold for subarctic classification. Although the city no longer (since 2009) has a coastline along the Baltic Sea, it is close enough to experience the mitigating influence of the sea and the Gulf Stream.
