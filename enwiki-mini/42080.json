In the western Atlantic Ocean, cod has a distribution north of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and around both coasts of Greenland and the Labrador Sea; in the eastern Atlantic, it is found from the Bay of Biscay north to the Arctic Ocean, including the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, Sea of the Hebrides,C.Michael Hogan, (2011) Sea of the Hebrides .

The largest individual on record was long and weighed , but usually the cod is between and long and weighs up to . Males and females are similar in size and weight. Atlantic cod can live for 25 years, and usually attain sexual maturity between ages two and four,O'Brien, L., J. Burnett, and R. K. Mayo.

A stripe along its lateral line (used to detect vibrations) is clearly visible. Its habitat ranges from the coastal shoreline down to 305 m (1000 ft) along the continental shelf. Atlantic cod is one of the most heavily fished species. Atlantic cod was fished for thousand years by north European fishers who followed it across the North Atlantic Ocean to North America. It was supporting the US and Canada fishing economy until 1992 when there was a ban on fishing cod. Several cod stocks collapsed in the 1990s (declined by >95% of maximum historical biomass) and have failed to fully recover even with the cessation of fishing. This absence of the apex predator has led to a trophic cascade in many areas. Many other cod stocks remain at risk. The Atlantic cod is labelled vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. ==Lifecycle== File:Gravid female cod.jpg|Gravid female in captivity File:Jonge kabeljauwen of gul nieuwsgierig bij een wrak-4885743.webm|Juveniles on a wreck in the North Sea File:Gadus morhua (head).jpg|Atlantic cod juvenile File:Gadus morhua Cod-2b-Atlanterhavsparken-Norway.JPG|Adult Adult cod form spawning aggregations from late winter to spring. Females release their eggs in batches, and males compete to fertilize them. Fertilized eggs drift with ocean currents and develop into larvae (\"fry\"). Age of maturation varies between cod stocks, from ages two to four in the west Atlantic,O'Brien, L., J. Burnett, and R. K. Mayo.

Cod can live for 13 years or more.ICES (2007), Arctic Fisheries Working Group Report, Section 03, International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (accessed 2008/12/11) ==Taxonomy== The Atlantic cod is one of three cod species in the genus Gadus along with Pacific cod and Greenland cod. A variety of fish species are colloquially known as cod, but they are not all classified within the Gadus, though some are in the Atlantic cod family, Gadidae. ==Behaviour== ===Shoaling=== Shoaling Atlantic cod on a wreck in the North Sea Atlantic cod are a shoaling species and move in large, size-structured aggregations. Larger fish act as scouts and lead the shoal's direction, particularly during post spawning migrations inshore for feeding. Cod actively feed during migration and changes in shoal structure occur when food is encountered. Shoals are generally thought to be relatively leaderless, with all fish having equal status and an equal distribution of resources and benefits. However, some studies suggest that leading fish gain certain feeding benefits. One study of a migrating Atlantic cod shoal showed significant variability in feeding habits based on size and position in the shoal. Larger scouts consumed a more variable, higher quantity of food, while trailing fish had less variable diets and consumed less food. Fish distribution throughout the shoal seems to be dictated by fish size, and ultimately, the smaller lagging fish likely benefit from shoaling because they are more successful in feeding in the shoal than they would be if migrating individually, due to social facilitation. ===Predation=== Young Atlantic cod avoid larger cod and pouting (Trisopterus luscus) and crabs on a wreck in the southern North Sea Atlantic cod are apex predators in the Baltic and adults are generally free from the concerns of predation. Juvenile cod, however, may serve as prey for adult cod, which sometimes practice cannibalism. Juvenile cod make substrate decisions based on risk of predation. Substrates refer to different feeding and swimming environments. Without apparent risk of predation, juvenile cod demonstrated a preference for finer-grained substrates such as sand and gravel-pebble. However, in the presence of a predator, they preferred to seek safety in the space available between stones of a cobble substrate. Selection of cobble significantly reduces the risk of predation. Without access to cobble, the juvenile cod simply tries to escape a predator by fleeing. Additionally, juvenile Atlantic cod vary their behaviour according to the foraging behaviour of predators. In the vicinity of a passive predator, cod behaviour changes very little. The juveniles prefer finer-grained substrates and otherwise avoid the safer kelp, steering clear of the predator. In contrast, in the presence of an actively foraging predator, juveniles are highly avoidant and hide in cobble or in kelp if cobble is unavailable. Heavy fishing of cod in the 1990s and the collapse of American and Canadian cod stocks resulted in trophic cascades. As cod are apex predators, overfishing them removed a significant predatory pressure on other Atlantic fish and crustacean species. Population- limiting effects on several species including American lobsters, crabs, and shrimp from cod predation have decreased significantly, and the abundance of these species and their increasing range serve as evidence of the Atlantic cod's role as a major predator rather than prey. ===Swimming=== Atlantic cod have been recorded to swim at speeds of a minimum of and a maximum of with a mean swimming speed of . In one hour, cod have been recorded to cover a mean range of . Swimming speed was higher during the day than at night. This is reflected in the fact that cod more actively search for food during the day. Cod likely modify their activity pattern according to the length of daylight, thus activity varies with time of year. ===Response to changing temperatures=== Swimming and physiological behaviours change in response to fluctuations in water temperature. Respirometry experiments show that heart rates of Atlantic cod change drastically with changes in temperature of only a few degrees. A rise in water temperature causes marked increases in cod swimming activity. Cod typically avoid new temperature conditions, and the temperatures can dictate where they are distributed in water. They prefer to be deeper, in colder water layers during the day, and in shallower, warmer water layers at night. These fine-tuned behavioural changes to water temperature are driven by an effort to maintain homeostasis to preserve energy. This is demonstrated by the fact that a decrease of only caused a highly costly increase in metabolic rate of 15 to 30%. ==Feeding and diet== The diet of the Atlantic cod consists of fish such as herring, capelin, and sand eels, as well as mollusks, crustaceans and sea worms. Stomach sampling studies have discovered that small Atlantic cod feed primarily on crustaceans, while large Atlantic cod feed primarily on fish. In certain regions, the main food source is decapods with fish as a complementary food item in the diet. Wild Atlantic cod throughout the North Sea depend, to a large extent, on commercial fish species also used in fisheries, such as Atlantic mackerel, haddock, whiting, Atlantic herring, European plaice, and common sole, making fishery manipulation of cod significantly easier. Ultimately, food selection by cod is affected by the food item size relative to their own size. However, providing for size, cod do exhibit food preference and are not simply driven by availability. Atlantic cod practice some cannibalism. In the southern North Sea, 1\u20132% (by weight) of stomach contents for cod larger than consisted of juvenile cod. In the northern North Sea, cannibalism was higher, at 10%. Other reports of cannibalism have estimated as high as 56% of the diet consists of juvenile cod. ==Reproduction== Atlantic cod in a High Arctic Lake in Canada. These cod resemble those of past Atlantic catches. Measuring long and weighing between , it is easy to see that today's commercially caught cod are less than half this size. Atlantic cod reproduce during a 1- to 2-month spawning season annually. Males and females aggregate in spawning schools and each spawning season yields an average of 8.3 egg batches. Spawning occurs in February or April and a female can have as many as 9 million eggs. The eggs and newly hatched young float freely in the water. Females release gametes in a ventral mount, and males then fertilize the released eggs. Evidence suggests male sound production and other sexually selected characteristics allow female cod to actively choose a spawning partner. Males also exhibit aggressive interactions for access to females. Based on behavioral observations of cod, that cod mating systems resemble those of lekking species, which is characterized by males aggregating and establishing dominance hierarchies, at which point females may visit and choose a spawning partner based on status and sexual characteristics. Cod males experience reproductive hierarchies based on size. Larger cod males are ultimately more successful in mating and produce the largest proportion of offspring in a population. However, cod males do experience high levels of sperm competition. In 75% of examined spawning in one study, sperm from multiple males contributed to offspring. As a result of high competition and unpredictable paternity, males may engage in varied mating strategies and may invest in courtship or may simply ejaculate with other spawning couples. Spawning success also varies according to male size relative to female size. Males that are significantly smaller than females demonstrate significantly lower success rates relative to males that are larger than females. == Parasites == Atlantic cod act as intermediate, paratenic, or definitive hosts to a large number of parasite species: 107 taxa listed by Hemmingsen and MacKenzie (2001) and seven new records by Perdiguero- Alonso et al. (2008). The predominant groups of cod parasites in the northeast Atlantic were trematodes (19 species) and nematodes (13 species), including larval anisakids, which comprised 58.2% of the total number of individuals. Parasites of Atlantic cod include copepods, digeneans, monogeneans, acanthocephalans, cestodes, nematodes, myxozoans, and protozoans. ==Fisheries== Capture of Northeast and Northwest Atlantic cod 1950\u20132012, (FAO) Cod populations or stocks can differ significantly both in appearance and biology. For instance, the cod stocks of the Baltic Sea are adapted to low- salinity water. Organisations such as the Northwest Atlantic Fishery Organization (NAFO) and ICES divide the cod into management units or stocks; however, these units are not always biologically distinguishable stocks. Some major stocks/management units on the Canadian/US shelf are the Southern Labrador-Eastern Newfoundland stock (NAFO divisions 2J3KL), the Northern Gulf of St. Lawrence stock (NAFO divisions 3Pn4RS), the Northern Scotian Shelf stock (NAFO divisions 4VsW), which all lie in Canadian waters, and the Georges Bank and Gulf of Maine stocks in United States waters. In the European Atlantic, the numerous separate stocks are on the shelves of Iceland, the coast of Norway, the Barents Sea, the Faroe Islands, off western Scotland, the North Sea, the Irish Sea, the Celtic Sea, and the Baltic Sea. ===Northwest Atlantic cod=== The Northwest Atlantic cod has been regarded as heavily overfished throughout its range, resulting in a crash in the fishery in the United States and Canada during the early 1990s. Newfoundland's northern cod fishery can be traced back to the 16th century. On average, about of cod were landed annually until the 1960s, when advances in technology enabled factory trawlers to take larger catches. By 1968, landings for the fish peaked at before a gradual decline set in. With the reopening of the limited cod fisheries in 2006, nearly of cod were hauled in. In 2007, offshore cod stocks were estimated at 1% of what they were in 1977. Technologies that contributed to the collapse of Atlantic cod include engine-powered vessels and frozen food compartments aboard ships. Engine-powered vessels had larger nets, greater range, and better navigation. The capacity to catch fish became limitless. In addition, sonar technology gave an edge to detecting and catching fish. Sonar was originally developed during World War II to locate enemy submarines, but was later applied to locating schools of fish. These new technologies, as well as bottom trawlers that destroyed entire ecosystems, contributed to the collapse of Atlantic cod. They were vastly different from old techniques used, such as hand lines and long lines.Freedman, Bill. \"Atlantic Cod and its fishery\". Codfishes: Atlantic Cod and its fishery, 2008. 3 November 2008 Free Site Search Engine The fishery has only recently begun to recover, and may never fully recover because of a possibly stable change in the food chain. Atlantic cod was a top-tier predator, along with haddock, flounder and hake, feeding upon smaller prey, such as herring, capelin, shrimp, and snow crab. With the large predatory fish removed, their prey have had population explosions and have become the top predators, affecting the survival rates of cod eggs and fry. Atlantic cod are demersal fish\u2014they prefer sea bottoms with coarse sediments.Atlantic cod NOAA FishWatch. Retrieved 5 November 2012. In the winter of 2011\u20132012, the cod fishery succeeded in convincing NOAA to postpone for one year the planned 82% reduction in catch limits. Instead, the limit was reduced by 22%. The fishery brought in $15.8 million in 2010, coming second behind Georges Bank haddock among the region's 20 regulated bottom- dwelling groundfish. Data released in 2011 indicated that even closing the fishery would not allow populations to rebound by 2014 to levels required under federal law. Restrictions on cod effectively limit fishing on other groundfish species with which the cod swim, such as flounder and haddock. ===Northeast Atlantic cod=== ICES, published in the ICES Report AFWG CM 2013, ACOM:05. The estimation method was standard virtual population analysis. The Northeast Atlantic has the world's largest population of cod. By far, the largest part of this population is the Northeast Arctic cod, as it is labelled by the ICES, or the Arcto-Norwegian cod stock, also referred to as skrei, a Norwegian name meaning something like \"the wanderer\", distinguishing it from coastal cod. The Northeast Arctic cod is found in the Barents Sea area. This stock spawns in March and April along the Norwegian coast, about 40% around the Lofoten archipelago. Newly hatched larvae drift northwards with the coastal current while feeding on larval copepods. By summer, the young cod reach the Barents Sea, where they stay for the rest of their lives, until their spawning migration. As the cod grow, they feed on krill and other small crustaceans and fish. Adult cod primarily feed on fish such as capelin and herring. The northeast Arctic cod also show cannibalistic behaviour. Estimated stock size was in 2008. The North Sea cod stock is primarily fished by European Union member states and Norway. In 1999, the catch was divided among Denmark (31%), Scotland (25%), the rest of the United Kingdom (12%), the Netherlands (10%), Belgium, Germany and Norway (17%). In the 1970s, the annual catch rose to between . Due to concerns about overfishing, catch quotas were repeatedly reduced in the 1980s and 1990s. In 2003, ICES stated a high risk existed of stock collapse if then current exploitation levels continued, and recommended a moratorium on catching Atlantic cod in the North Sea during 2004. However, agriculture and fisheries ministers from the Council of the European Union endorsed the EU/Norway Agreement and set the total allowable catch at . Seafood sustainability guides, such as the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch, often recommend environmentally conscious customers not purchase Atlantic cod. The stock of Northeast Arctic cod was more than four million tons following World War II, but declined to a historic minimum of in 1983. The catch reached a historic maximum of in 1956, and bottomed out at in 1990. Since 2000, the spawning stock has increased quite quickly, helped by low fishing pressure. The total catch in 2012 was , the major fishers being Norway and Russia. ==== Baltic cod ==== There are at least two populations of cod in the Baltic Sea: One large population that spawns east of Bornholm and one population spawning west of Bornholm. Eastern Baltic cod is genetically distinct and adapted to the brackish environment. Adaptations include differences in hemoglobin type, osmoregulatory capacity, egg buoyancy, sperm swimming characteristics and spawning season. The adaptive responses to the environmental conditions in the Baltic Sea may contribute to an effective reproductive barrier, and thus, eastern Baltic cod can be viewed as an example of ongoing speciation. The western Baltic cod consists of one or several small subpopulations that are genetically more similar to the North Sea cod. In the Arkona basin (located off Cape Arkona, R\u00fcgen), spawning and migrating cod from both the eastern and western stocks intermingle in proportions that vary seasonally. The immigration of eastern cod into the western Baltic management unit may mask a poor state of the populations in the western management unit. ===== Recommendations for management ===== Scientifically based recommendations for long-term conservation of Baltic cod from the research project BONUS BAMBI: * Manage the eastern and western Baltic cod as separate units, since the eastern population is adapted to spawning in low salinity and may not be replaced by cod from elsewhere if depleted. Moreover, the large- scale fishing of Baltic cod is expected to cause (unwanted) evolutionary changes, such as reduced age and size at maturity. * Monitor mixing proportions of eastern and western cod in the Arkona basin. * Potentially divide the western Baltic cod into more than one management unit, since it is unclear whether there are several spawning populations within this area. ==Human consumption== Atlantic cod used as food ==See also== *Cod War *Sacred Cod ==Notes== ==References== This article incorporates CC BY-2.0 text from the reference. ==External links== * FishBase * Codtrace * The Centre for Environment Fisheries and Aquaculture Science * The history of the northern cod fishery in Canada * ICES recommendation for the North Sea Cod stock (2007) * ICES recommendation for the North East Arctic Cod stock (2007) * Reports on the status of Canadian fishing stocks, including cod * Governmental Norwegian fact sheet on North-East Arctic Cod * Atlantic cod-Gadus morhua fishery profiles Status of Atlantic cod fisheries, summarised in FisheriesWiki * * View the Atlantic cod genome in Ensembl * Government of Canada Seafisheries Landings * * Pauly , Daniel, and Ashley McCrea Stru. \u201cAtlantic Cod: Past and Present.\u201d Sea Around Us, 21 May 2015, www.seaaroundus.org/atlantic-cod-past- and-present/.
