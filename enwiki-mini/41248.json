    "text": "Hydroxyl ion absorption is the absorption in optical fibers of electromagnetic waves, including the near-infrared, due to the presence of trapped hydroxyl ions remaining from water as a contaminant. The hydroxyl (OH\u2212) ion, can penetrate glass during or after product fabrication, resulting in significant attenuation of discrete optical wavelengths, e.g., centred at 1.383 \u03bcm, used for communications via optical fibres. ==See also== *Water absorption ==References== Category:Fiber optics Category:Glass engineering and science ",
