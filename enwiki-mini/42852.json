    "text": "Radio frequency (RF) is the oscillation rate of an alternating electric current or voltage or of a magnetic, electric or electromagnetic field or mechanical system in the frequency range from around to around . This is roughly between the upper limit of audio frequencies and the lower limit of infrared frequencies; J. A. Fleming, The Principles of Electric Wave Telegraphy and Telephony, London: Longmans, Green & Co., 1919, p. 364A. A. Ghirardi, Radio Physics Course, 2nd ed. New York: Rinehart Books, 1932, p. 249 these are the frequencies at which energy from an oscillating current can radiate off a conductor into space as radio waves. Different sources specify different upper and lower bounds for the frequency range. == Electric current == Electric currents that oscillate at radio frequencies (RF currents) have special properties not shared by direct current or alternating current of lower frequencies. * Energy from RF currents in conductors can radiate into space as electromagnetic waves (radio waves). This is the basis of radio technology. * RF current does not penetrate deeply into electrical conductors but tends to flow along their surfaces; this is known as the skin effect. * RF currents applied to the body often do not cause the painful sensation and muscular contraction of electric shock that lower frequency currents produce. This is because the current changes direction too quickly to trigger depolarization of nerve membranes. However this does not mean RF currents are harmless; they can cause internal injury as well as serious superficial burns called RF burns. * RF current can easily ionize air, creating a conductive path through it. This property is exploited by \"high frequency\" units used in electric arc welding, which use currents at higher frequencies than power distribution uses. * Another property is the ability to appear to flow through paths that contain insulating material, like the dielectric insulator of a capacitor. This is because capacitive reactance in a circuit decreases with increasing frequency. * In contrast, RF current can be blocked by a coil of wire, or even a single turn or bend in a wire. This is because the inductive reactance of a circuit increases with increasing frequency. * When conducted by an ordinary electric cable, RF current has a tendency to reflect from discontinuities in the cable, such as connectors, and travel back down the cable toward the source, causing a condition called standing waves. RF current may be carried efficiently over transmission lines such as coaxial cables. ==Frequency bands== The radio spectrum of frequencies is divided into bands with conventional names designated by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU): {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Frequency range !! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Wavelength range !! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | ITU designation !! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | IEEE bands |- ! scope=\"col\" | Full name ! scope=\"col\" | Abbreviation |- ! scope=\"row\" | Below 3 Hz | >105 km || Tremendously low frequencyTremendously low frequency (TLF) (electromagnetic radiation, frequency below 3 Hz) || style=\"text-align:center\" | TLF || |- ! scope=\"row\" | 3\u201330 Hz | 105\u2013104 km|| Extremely low frequency || style=\"text-align:center\" | ELF || |- ! scope=\"row\" | 30\u2013300 Hz | 104\u2013103 km|| Super low frequency || style=\"text-align:center\" | SLF || |- ! scope=\"row\" | 300\u20133000 Hz | 103\u2013100 km|| Ultra low frequency || style=\"text-align:center\" | ULF || |- ! scope=\"row\" | 3\u201330 kHz | 100\u201310 km|| Very low frequency || style=\"text-align:center\" | VLF || |- ! scope=\"row\" | 30\u2013300 kHz | 10\u20131 km|| Low frequency || style=\"text-align:center\" | LF || |- ! scope=\"row\" | 300 kHz \u2013 3 MHz | 1 km \u2013 100 m|| Medium frequency || style=\"text-align:center\" | MF || |- ! scope=\"row\" | 3\u201330 MHz | 100\u201310 m|| High frequency || style=\"text-align:center\" | HF || style=\"text-align:center\" | HF |- ! scope=\"row\" | 30\u2013300 MHz | 10\u20131 m|| Very high frequency || style=\"text-align:center\" | VHF || style=\"text-align:center\" | VHF |- ! scope=\"row\" | 300 MHz \u2013 3 GHz | 1 m \u2013 10 cm|| Ultra high frequency || style=\"text-align:center\" | UHF || style=\"text-align:center\" | UHF, L, S |- ! scope=\"row\" | 3\u201330 GHz | 10\u20131 cm|| Super high frequency || style=\"text- align:center\" | SHF || style=\"text-align:center\" | S, C, X, Ku, K, Ka |- ! scope=\"row\" | 30\u2013300 GHz | 1 cm \u2013 1 mm|| Extremely high frequency || style=\"text-align:center\" | EHF || style=\"text-align:center\" | Ka, V, W, mm |- ! scope=\"row\" | 300 GHz \u2013 3 THz | 1 mm \u2013 0.1 mm|| Tremendously high frequency || style=\"text-align:center\" | THF || |} Frequencies of 1 GHz and above are conventionally called microwave, while frequencies of 30 GHz and above are designated millimeter wave.

Radio frequencies are also applied in carrier current systems including telephony and control circuits. The MOS integrated circuit is the technology behind the current proliferation of radio frequency wireless telecommunications devices such as cellphones. === Medicine === Radio frequency (RF) energy, in the form of radiating waves or electrical currents, has been used in medical treatments for over 75 years, generally for minimally invasive surgeries using radiofrequency ablation including the treatment of sleep apnea. ==Measurement== Test apparatus for radio frequencies can include standard instruments at the lower end of the range, but at higher frequencies, the test equipment becomes more specialized. ==Mechanical oscillations== While RF usually refers to electrical oscillations, mechanical RF systems are not uncommon: see mechanical filter and RF MEMS. ==See also== * Amplitude modulation (AM) * Bandwidth (signal processing) * Electromagnetic interference * Electromagnetic radiation * Electromagnetic spectrum * EMF measurement * Frequency allocation * Frequency modulation (FM) * Plastic welding * Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy * Spectrum management ==References== ==External links== * Definition of frequency bands (VLF, ELF \u2026 etc.) IK1QFK Home Page (vlf.it) * Radio, light, and sound waves, conversion between wavelength and frequency * RF Terms Glossary Category:Radio spectrum Radio waves Radio waves Category:Television terminology ",
