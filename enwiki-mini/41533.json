He is best known for his novel 1985, and The Guest from the Future: Anna Akhmatova and Isaiah Berlin. ==Life== Dalos was born in Budapest and spent his childhood with his grandparents, as his father had died in 1945 in a labor camp, where he had been sent to as a Jew during World War II. From 1962 to 1967, he studied history at the Lomonossov University in Moscow. He then returned to his native town Budapest to work as a museologist. In 1968, Dalos was accused of \"Maoist activities\" and was handed seven months prison on probation and a Berufsverbot (professional disqualification) and a publication ban; due to that, he worked as a translator. In 1977, he was among the founders of the opposition movement against the Communist regime of Hungary. In 1988/89 he was co-editor of the East German underground opposition paper Ostkreuz. From 1995 to 1999, Dalos was head of the Institute for Hungarian Culture in Berlin. Since 2009 he is member of the International Council of Austrian Service Abroad.
