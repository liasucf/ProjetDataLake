    "text": "Meantone temperament is a musical temperament, that is a tuning system, obtained by slightly compromising the fifths in order to improve the thirds. Meantone temperaments are constructed the same way as Pythagorean tuning, as a stack of equal fifths, but in meantone each fifth is narrow compared to the perfect fifth of ratio 3:2. Comparison between Pythagorean tuning (blue), equal-tempered (black), quarter-comma meantone (red) and third-comma meantone (green). For each, the common origin is arbitrarily chosen as C. The degrees are arranged in the order of the cycle of fifths; as in each of these tunings all fifths are of the same size, the tunings appear as straight lines, the slope indicating the relative tempering with respect to Pythagorean, which has pure fifths (3:2, 702 cents). The Pythagorean A (at the left) is at 792 cents, G (at the right) at 816 cents; the difference is the Pythagorean comma. Equal temperament by definition is such that A and G are at the same level. Quarter- comma meantone produces the \"just\" major third (5:4, 386 cents, a syntonic comma lower than the Pythagorean one of 408 cents). Third-comma meantone produces the \"just\" minor third (6:5, 316 cents, a syntonic comma higher than the Pythagorean one of 294 cents). In both these meantone temperaments, the enharmony, here the difference between A and G, is much larger than in Pythagorean, and with the flat degree higher than the sharp one. ==Expressed in terms of the Dynamic Tonality paradigm== Using the terminology and concepts of the Dynamic Tonality paradigm, the meantone temperament is defined as \"the syntonic temperament with its tuning range constrained to be from P5=694.79\u00a2 to P5=701.96\u00a2.\" This constraint is an artifact of the Static Timbre Paradigm, which was the dominant paradigm, especially for keyboard instruments, up to the present day. In the Static Timbre Paradigm, a tuning's notes are tempered away from Just Intonation, but a timbres' partials are not tempered away from the Harmonic Series. Tempering a tuning's notes, but not the partials of the timbres in which that tuning is played, inevitably results in a mis-alignment of notes and partials, thus making the tuning and timbre less \"related.\" The less related a tuning and timbre are, the less consonant they are when played together. This misalignment constrained meantone to the range of tunings which were consonant when played using Harmonic timbres. Because the meantone temperament is a subrange of the syntonic temperament, which is a rank-2 temperament, this article will briefly discuss rank-2 temperaments and the syntonic temperament. ===Rank-2 temperaments=== In the Dynamic Tonality paradigm, a given rank-2 temperament is defined by a period \u03b1, a generator \u03b2, and a comma sequence. Alt URL A rank-2 temperament defines a rank-2 (i.e., two-dimensional) note-space, as shown in Video 1. Video 1: Generating a rank-2 note-space. ===The syntonic temperament=== The syntonic temperament is a rank-2 temperament defined by its period (the just perfect octave, 1/2), its generator (the just perfect fifth, 3/2) and its comma sequence (that starts with the syntonic comma, 81/80, which names the temperament). The construction of the syntonic temperament's note-space is shown in Video 2. Video 2: Generating the syntonic temperament's note-space (which is the same as the meantone temperament's note-space). The valid tuning range of the syntonic temperament is shown in Figure 1 as extending from P5=686\u00a2 to P5=720\u00a2, a range of (720-686=) 34\u00a2. ===The meantone temperament=== The meantone temperament is exactly the same as the syntonic temperament: that is, they have the same period (the octave), generator (the perfect fifth), and comma sequence (starting with the syntonic comma). The only difference is that the meantone temperament's tuning range is constrained to be a subrange of the syntonic temperament's valid tuning range, equivalent to the \"Purer-Tuning Range\" shown in Figure 1 (on the left, in green), from P5=694.79\u00a2 (which gives just minor thirds) to P5=701.96\u00a2 (which gives just perfect fifths), a tuning range of only (701.96-694.79=) 7.17\u00a2. right|250px|thumb|Figure 1: The syntonic temperament's tuning continuum, which extends from P5=686\u00a2 to P5=720\u00a2, and the subrange of meantone tunings extending from P5=694.79\u00a2 to P5=701.96\u00a2 (labeled as the \"Purer-Tuning Range\"). Notable meantone tunings are labeled, at center- left, with names of the form \"-comma\". ===Why does meantone have a narrower tuning range?=== Tempering a timbre's partials such that they align with the tuning's notes, as per Dynamic Tonality, maximizes consonance across the entire tuning range of the syntonic temperament. The meantone temperament's narrower range is an artifact of the Static Timbre Paradigm, in which Just tunings are tempered to be pseudo-Just, but the Harmonic timbres in which those tunings are played are untempered. This inevitably misaligns the tuning's notes and timbre's partials, making them less related and hence less consonant. The farther one tunes away from the meantone temperament's defined tuning subrange, the less related the tuning & timbre will be, and hence the less consonant, when using untempered Harmonic timbres. Outside of this section, this article discusses the meantone temperament primarily within the context of the Static Timbre Paradigm. ==Notable meantone temperaments== Equal temperament, obtained by making all semitones the same size, each equal to one-twelfth of an octave (with ratio the 12th root of 2 to one (:1), narrows the fifths by about 2 cents or 1/12 of a Pythagorean comma, and produces thirds that are only slightly better than in Pythagorean tuning. Equal temperament is roughly the same as 1/11 comma meantone tuning. Quarter-comma meantone, which tempers the fifths by 1/4 comma, is the best known type of meantone temperament, and the term meantone temperament is often used to refer to it specifically. Four ascending fifths (as C\u2013G\u2013D\u2013A\u2013E) tempered by 1/4 comma produce a perfect major third (C\u2013E), one syntonic comma narrower than the Pythagorean third that would result from four perfect fifths. Quarter-comma meantone has been practiced from the early 16th century to the end of the 19th. In third-comma meantone, the fifths are tempered by 1/3 comma, and three descending fifths (such as A\u2013D\u2013G\u2013C) produce a perfect minor third (A\u2013C) one syntonic comma wider than the Pythagorean one that would result from three perfect fifths. Third-comma meantone can be approximated by a division of the octave in 19 equal steps. ==The tone as a mean== The name \"meantone temperament\" derives from the fact that all such temperaments have only one size of the tone, while just intonation produces a major tone and a minor one, differing by a syntonic comma. In any regular system (i.e. with all fifths but one of the same size)J. Murray Barbour, Tuning and Temperament. A Historical Survey. East Lansing, 1951, p. xi. the tone (as C\u2013D) is reached after two fifths (as C\u2013G\u2013D), while the major third is reached after four fifths: the tone therefore is exactly half the major third. This is one sense in which the tone is a mean. In the case of quarter-comma meantone, in addition, where the major third is made narrower by a syntonic comma, the tone is also half a comma narrower than the major tone of just intonation, or half a comma wider than the minor tone: this is another sense in which the tone in quarter-tone temperament may be considered a mean tone, and it explains why quarter-comma meantone is often considered the meantone temperament properly speaking.Barbour 1951, p. x and pp. 25-44. ==Meantone temperaments== \"Meantone\" can receive the following equivalent definitions: * The meantone is the geometric mean between the major whole tone (9:8 in just intonation) and the minor whole tone (10:9 in just intonation). * The meantone is the mean of its major third (for instance the square root of 5:4 in quarter-comma meantone). The family of meantone temperaments share the common characteristic that they form a stack of identical fifths, the tone being the result of two fifths minus one octave, the major third of four fifths minus two octaves. Meantone temperaments are often described by the fraction of the syntonic comma by which the fifths are tempered: quarter-comma meantone, the most common type, tempers the fifths by of a syntonic comma, with the result that four fifths produce a just major third, a syntonic comma lower than a Pythagorean major third; third-comma meantone tempers by of a syntonic comma, three fifths producing a just major sixth, a syntonic comma lower than a Pythagorean one. A meantone temperament is a linear temperament, distinguished by the width of its generator (often measured in cents), as shown in the central column of Figure 1. Historically notable meantone temperaments, discussed below, occupy a narrow portion of this tuning continuum, with fifths ranging from approximately 695 to 699 cents. While the term meantone temperament refers primarily to the tempering of 5-limit musical intervals, temperaments that approximate 5-limit intervals well, such as Quarter-comma meantone, can also approximate 7-limit intervals well, defining septimal meantone temperament. In Figure 1, the valid tuning ranges of 5-limit, 7-limit, and 11-limit tunings are shown, and can be seen to include many notable meantone tunings. Meantone temperaments can be specified in various ways: by what fraction (logarithmically) of a syntonic comma the fifth is being flattened (as above), what equal temperament has the meantone fifth in question, the width of the tempered perfect fifth in cents, or the ratio of the whole tone to the diatonic semitone. This last ratio was termed \"R\" by American composer, pianist and theoretician Easley Blackwood, but in effect has been in use for much longer than that. It is useful because it gives us an idea of the melodic qualities of the tuning, and because if R is a rational number , so is or , which is the size of fifth in terms of logarithms base 2, and which immediately tells us what division of the octave we will have. If we multiply by 1200, we have the size of fifth in cents. In these terms, some historically notable meantone tunings are listed below. The second and fourth column are corresponding approximations to the first column. The third column shows how close the second column's approximation is to the actual size of the fifth interval in the given meantone tuning from the first column. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Meantone tunings |- !

Equal temperaments useful as meantone tunings include (in order of increasing generator width) 19-ET, 50-ET, 31-ET, 43-ET, and 55-ET. The farther the tuning gets away from quarter-comma meantone, however, the less related the tuning is to harmonic timbres, which can be overcome by tempering the partials to match the tuning \u2013 which is possible, however, only on electronic synthetizers. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Comparison between 1/4-comma meantone and 31-ET (values in cents, rounded to 2 decimals) |- || | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | C | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | C | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | D | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | D | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | D | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | E | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | E | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | E | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | F | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | F | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | G | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | G | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | G | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | A | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | A | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | A | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | B | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | B | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | C | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | C |- || 1/4 comma: | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 0.00 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 76.05 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 117.11 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 193.16 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 269.21 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 310.26 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 386.31 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 462.36 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 503.42 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 579.47 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 620.53 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 696.58 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 772.63 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 813.69 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 889.74 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 965.78 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 1006.84 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 1082.89 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 1123.95 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 1200.00 |- || 31-ET: | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 0.00 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 77.42 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 116.13 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 193.55 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 270.97 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 309.68 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 387.10 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 464.52 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 503.23 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 580.65 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 619.35 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 696.77 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 774.19 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 812.90 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 890.32 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 967.74 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 1006.45 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 1083.87 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 1122.58 | align=\"center\" width=\"20em\" | 1200.00 |} ==Wolf intervals== A whole number of just perfect fifths will never add up to a whole number of octaves, because they are incommensurable (see Fundamental theorem of arithmetic). If a stacked-up whole number of perfect fifths is to close with the octave, then one of the intervals that is enharmonically equivalent to a fifth must have a different width than the other fifths. For example, to make a 12-note chromatic scale in Pythagorean tuning close at the octave, one of the fifth intervals must be lowered (\"out-of-tune\") by the Pythagorean comma; this altered fifth is called a wolf fifth because it sounds similar to a fifth in its interval size and seems like an out-of-tune fifth. However, it really is a Pythagorean diminished sixth (or an augmented third instead of a fourth), say the interval between C and E. Wolf intervals are an artifact of keyboard design. This can be shown most easily using an isomorphic keyboard, such as that shown in Figure 2. Fig. 2: The Wicki isomorphic keyboard, invented by Kaspar Wicki in 1896. On an isomorphic keyboard, any given musical interval has the same shape wherever it appears, except at the edges. Here's an example. On the keyboard shown in Figure 2, from any given note, the note that's a perfect fifth higher is always up-and-rightwardly adjacent to the given note. There are no wolf intervals within the note-span of this keyboard. The problem is at the edge, on the note E. The note that's a perfect fifth higher than E is B, which is not included on the keyboard shown (although it could be included in a larger keyboard, placed just to the right of A, hence maintaining the keyboard's consistent note-pattern). Because there is no B button, when playing an E power chord, one must choose some other note, such as C, to play instead of the missing B. Even edge conditions produce wolf intervals only if the isomorphic keyboard has fewer buttons per octave than the tuning has enharmonically-distinct notes (Milne, 2007). For example, the isomorphic keyboard in Figure 2 has 19 buttons per octave, so the above-cited edge-condition, from E to C, is not a wolf interval in 12-ET, 17-ET, or 19-ET; however, it is a wolf interval 26-ET, 31-ET, and 50-ET. In these latter tunings, using electronic transposition could keep the current key's notes on the isomorphic keyboard's white buttons, such that these wolf intervals would very rarely be encountered in tonal music, despite modulation to exotic keys. Isomorphic keyboards expose the invariant properties of the meantone tunings of the syntonic temperament isomorphically (that is, for example, by exposing a given interval with a single consistent inter-button shape in every octave, key, and tuning) because both the isomorphic keyboard and temperament are two- dimensional (i.e., rank-2) entities (Milne, 2007). One-dimensional N-key keyboards can expose accurately the invariant properties of only a single one- dimensional N-ET tuning; hence, the one-dimensional piano-style keyboard, with 12 keys per octave, can expose the invariant properties of only one tuning: 12-ET. When the perfect fifth is exactly 700 cents wide (that is, tempered by approximately of a syntonic comma, or exactly of a Pythagorean comma) then the tuning is identical to the familiar 12-tone equal temperament. This appears in the table above when R = 2:1. Because of the compromises (and wolf intervals) forced on meantone tunings by the one-dimensional piano-style keyboard, well temperaments and eventually equal temperament became more popular. Using standard interval names, twelve fifths equal six octaves plus one augmented seventh; seven octaves are equal to eleven fifths plus one diminished sixth. Given this, three \"minor thirds\" are actually augmented seconds (for example, B to C), and four \"major thirds\" are actually diminished fourths (for example, B to E). Several triads (like B-E-F and B-C-F) contain both these intervals and have normal fifths. ==Extended meantones== All meantone tunings fall into the valid tuning range of the syntonic temperament, so all meantone tunings are syntonic tunings. All syntonic tunings, including the meantones, have a conceptually infinite number of notes in each octave, that is, seven natural notes, seven sharp notes (F to B), seven flat notes (B to F), double sharp notes, double flat notes, triple sharps and flats, and so on. In fact, double sharps and flats are uncommon, but still needed; triple sharps and flats are almost never seen. In any syntonic tuning that happens to divide the octave into a small number of equally wide smallest intervals (such as 12, 19, or 31), this infinity of notes still exists, although some notes will be equivalent. For example, in 19-ET, E and F are the same pitch. Many musical instruments are capable of very fine distinctions of pitch, such as the human voice, the trombone, unfretted strings such as the violin, and lutes with tied frets. These instruments are well-suited to the use of meantone tunings. On the other hand, the piano keyboard has only twelve physical note-controlling devices per octave, making it poorly suited to any tunings other than 12-ET. Almost all of the historic problems with the meantone temperament are caused by the attempt to map meantone's infinite number of notes per octave to a finite number of piano keys. This is, for example, the source of the \"wolf fifth\" discussed above. When choosing which notes to map to the piano's black keys, it is convenient to choose those notes that are common to a small number of closely related keys, but this will only work up to the edge of the octave; when wrapping around to the next octave, one must use a \"wolf fifth\" that is not as wide as the others, as discussed above. The existence of the \"wolf fifth\" is one of the reasons why, before the introduction of well temperament, instrumental music generally stayed in a number of \"safe\" tonalities that did not involve the \"wolf fifth\" (which was generally put between G and E). Throughout the Renaissance and Enlightenment, theorists as varied as Nicola Vicentino, Francisco de Salinas, Fabio Colonna, Marin Mersenne, Christiaan Huygens, and Isaac Newton advocated the use of meantone tunings that were extended beyond the keyboard's twelve notes,Barbour, J.M., 2004, Tuning and Temperament: A Historical Survey.Duffin, R.W., 2006, How Equal Temperament Ruined Harmony (and Why You Should Care).Isacoff, Stuart, 2003, Temperament: How Music Became a Battleground for the Great Minds of Western Civilization and hence have come to be called \"extended\" meantone tunings. These efforts required a concomitant extension of keyboard instruments to offer means of controlling more than 12 notes per octave, including Vincento's Archicembalo (shown in Figure 3), Mersenne's 19-ET harpsichord, Colonna's 31-ET sambuca, and Huygens' 31-ET harpsichord. Other instruments extended the keyboard by only a few notes. Some period harpsichords and organs have split D/E keys, such that both E major/C minor (4 sharps) and E major/C minor (3 flats) can be played without wolf fifths. Many of those instruments also have split G/A keys, and a few have all the five accidental keys split. All of these alternative instruments were \"complicated\" and \"cumbersome\" (Isacoff, 2003), due to (a) not being isomorphic, and (b) not having the ability to transpose electronically, which can significantly reduce the number of note-controlling buttons needed on an isomorphic keyboard (Plamondon, 2009). Both of these criticisms could be addressed by electronic isomorphic keyboard instruments (such as the open-source hardware jammer keyboard), which could be simpler, less cumbersome, and more expressive than existing keyboard instruments. ==Use of meantone temperament== References to tuning systems that could possibly refer to meantone were published as early as 1496 (Gafori), and Aron (1523) is unmistakably referring to meantone. However, the first mathematically precise Meantone tuning descriptions are found in late 16th century treatises by Francisco de Salinas and Gioseffo Zarlino. Salinas (in De musica libra septem, 1577) describes three different mean tone temperaments: the third-comma system, the two-seventh-comma system, and the quarter-comma system. He is the likely inventor of the third-comma system, while he and Zarlino both wrote on the two-seventh-comma system, apparently independently. Lodovico Fogliano mentions the quarter-comma system, but offers no discussion of it. In the past, meantone temperaments were sometimes used or referred to under other names or descriptions. For example, in 1691 Christiaan Huygens wrote his \"Lettre touchant le cycle harmonique\" (\"Letter concerning the harmonic cycle\") with the purpose of introducing what he believed to be a new division of the octave. In this letter Huygens referred several times, in a comparative way, to a conventional tuning arrangement, which he indicated variously as \"temperament ordinaire\", or \"the one that everyone uses\". But Huygens' description of this conventional arrangement was quite precise, and is clearly identifiable with what is now classified as (quarter-comma) meantone temperament.(See references cited in article 'Temperament Ordinaire'.) Although meantone is best known as a tuning environment associated with earlier music of the Renaissance and Baroque, there is evidence of continuous usage of meantone as a keyboard temperament well into the middle of the 19th century.George Grove wrote as late as 1890: \"The mode of tuning which prevailed before the introduction of equal temperament, is called the Meantone System. It has hardly yet died out in England, for it may still be heard on a few organs in country churches. According to Don B. Y\u00f1iguez, organist of Seville Cathedral, the meantone system is generally maintained on Spanish organs, even at the present day.\" A Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Macmillan, London, vol. IV, 1890 [1st edition], p. 72. Meantone temperament has had considerable revival for early music performance in the late 20th century and in newly composed works specifically demanding meantone by composers including John Adams, Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti and Douglas Leedy. ==See also== * Dynamic tonality * Equal temperament * Just intonation * Interval * Mathematics of musical scales * Pythagorean tuning * Semitone * Well temperament * Regular temperament * List of meantone intervals ==References== ==External links== * An explanation of constructing Quarter Comma Meantone Tuning * LucyTuning - specific meantone derived from pi, and the writings of John Harrison * How to tune quarter-comma meantone * Music fragments played in different temperaments - mp3s not archived * Kyle Gann's Introduction to Historical Tunings has an explanation of how the meantone temperament works. *Willem Kroesbergen, Andrew cruickshank: Meantone, unequal and equal temperament during J.S.
