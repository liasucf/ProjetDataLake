    "text": "Bonnie Tyler (born Gaynor Hopkins; 8 June 1951) is a Welsh singer, known for her distinctive husky voice. Tyler came to prominence with the release of her 1977 album The World Starts Tonight and its singles \"Lost in France\" and \"More Than a Lover\". Her 1978 single \"It's a Heartache\" reached number four on the UK Singles Chart, and number three on the US Billboard Hot 100. In the 1980s, Tyler ventured into rock music with songwriter and producer Jim Steinman. He wrote Tyler's biggest hit \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\", the lead single from her 1983 UK chart-topping album Faster Than the Speed of Night. Steinman also wrote Tyler's other major 1980s hit \"Holding Out for a Hero\". She had success in mainland Europe during the 1990s with Dieter Bohlen, who wrote and produced her hit \"Bitterblue\". In 2003, Tyler re-recorded \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" with singer Kareen Antonn. Their bilingual duet, titled \"Si demain... (Turn Around)\", topped the French charts. Rocks and Honey was released in 2013 and features the single \"Believe in Me\", which she performed representing the United Kingdom at the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malm\u00f6, Sweden. Her latest album Between the Earth and the Stars was released on 15 March 2019. Both \"It's a Heartache\" and \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" are among the best- selling singles of all time, with sales in excess of six million each. Her work has earned her three Grammy Award nominations and three Brit Award nominations, among other accolades. ==Early life== Tyler was born Gaynor Hopkins in Skewen, Wales, to coal miner Glyndwr and housewife Elsie Hopkins. She grew up in a four-bedroom council house with three sisters and two brothers. Her siblings had varied music tastes, exposing her to artists such as Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra and the Beatles. Hopkins and her family were deeply religious Protestants. Her first public performance took place in a chapel as a child, singing the Anglican hymn \"All Things Bright and Beautiful\". Leaving school with no formal qualifications, Hopkins began working in a grocery shop. In 1969, she entered a local talent contest, and after coming in second place, was inspired to pursue a career in singing. Responding to a newspaper advertisement, she found work as a backing singer for Bobby Wayne & the Dixies before forming her own soul band called Imagination. It was around this time that she changed her name to Sherene Davis, to avoid being confused with Welsh folk singer Mary Hopkin. ==Career== === 1975\u20131978: The World Starts Tonight and Natural Force === In 1975, Davis was spotted singing with her band in the Townsman Club, Swansea, by talent scout Roger Bell, who invited her to London to record a demo track. After many months had passed, she received a phone call from RCA Records, offering her a recording contract. They also recommended that she change her name again. After compiling a list of surnames and Christian names from a newspaper, Davis found a new name in \"Bonnie Tyler\". Ronnie Scott and Steve Wolfe became her managers, songwriters and producers. \"My! My! Honeycomb\" was released as her debut single in April 1976, and failed to impact any charts worldwide. RCA increased their promotional efforts for the release of Tyler's second single, \"Lost in France\", arranging for her to meet with a party of journalists at a French ch\u00e2teau. The single had no immediate impact upon its release in September 1976, but became a Top 10 single by the end of the year. Tyler's next single \"More Than a Lover\" was favoured by some critics, and she performed the song on the BBC's Top of the Pops on 31 March 1977. The song peaked at number 27 in the UK. Despite producing two popular singles, Tyler's debut album, The World Starts Tonight, proved unsuccessful in Europe, except in Sweden, where it climbed to number 2. \"It's a Heartache\" saw Tyler return to prominence again in 1978, reaching number 4 in the United Kingdom. The song also became her first hit in the United States, peaking at number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100. Her second studio album Natural Force, released in the same year, was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) with sales of over half a million copies. \"Here Am I\" was released as a third single in the spring of 1978, but the song failed to sustain her success in the United Kingdom and the United States, though it charted in other European countries. ===1979\u20131981: Diamond Cut and Goodbye to the Island=== Tyler's third studio album, Diamond Cut, was released in 1979. Most of the songs were again written and produced by Ronnie Scott and Steve Wolfe. Diamond Cut was a hit in Norway and Sweden, but it only charted on the Billboard 200 at number 145. AllMusic declared the album to be the high point of Tyler's early career, \"and a dynamite showcase for Tyler's inimitable voice\". Record Mirror rated the album three stars out of five, stating that \"only a minority of the material [was] holding her back\", and that the album is \"essential listening\" for Country music fans.Hendriks, Phil (2009). \"Diamond Cut.\" In Diamond Cut (pp. 3\u201313) [CD booklet]. London: Cherry Red Records. Two singles were released from Diamond Cut; those were \"My Guns Are Loaded\" and \"Too Good to Last\". Tyler also released \"(The World Is Full of) Married Men\", which was used as the theme song for the film of the same name. Tyler appears in the film singing the song during the title sequence. It peaked at number thirty- five on the UK Singles Chart in July 1979. Record Mirror criticised the song; its reviewer wrote: \"Bonnie stops chewing gravel for a minute or two...\" and continued with \"she ends up sandpapering my eardrums again. Ouch.\" Tyler's first tour of Japan took place in 1979. During her visit, she represented the United Kingdom in the World Popular Song Festival held in Tokyo. Tyler won the competition with the song \"Sitting on the Edge of the Ocean\", written by Scott and Wolfe. \"I Believe in Your Sweet Love\" was also released in 1979, and listed as a single of the week in 1979 by Record Mirror upon its release.Hendriks, Phil (2009). \"Goodbye to the Island.\" In Goodbye to the Island (pp. 3\u201313) [CD booklet]. London: Cherry Red Records. Both singles featured on Tyler's final studio album with RCA. Goodbye to the Island was released in 1981, recorded in the Algarve, Portugal. AllMusic rated the album three stars out of five, with other critics predicting that Tyler was \"doomed to be a one-hit wonder\". Phil Hendricks from Cherry Records said that Tyler \"[proved] time and time again that she was one of those rare artists who was able to take the odd chart flop on the chin and bounce back having suffered little collateral damage.\" ===1982\u20131989: The CBS Years=== After her contract with RCA expired, Tyler signed with CBS/Columbia. A&R; man Muff Winwood asked Tyler to scout a new producer. She considered Phil Collins, Jeff Lynne and Alan Tarney, but Jim Steinman was her first choice. \"I\u2019m a huge fan of his records, especially his solo album, and when my manager and I were discussing my comeback we both agreed that I had to sound the best or nobody would take me seriously.\" Steinman initially declined, but reconsidered after Tyler sent him demos of the rock material she was hoping to record. After their initial meeting, Tyler returned to Steinman's apartment in New York a few weeks later where he performed \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" with Rory Dodd. Steinman described the song as \"a Wagnerian-like onslaught of sound and emotion\", and a \"showpiece\" for Tyler's voice. Her fifth album was recorded at the Power Station in New York, with members of the E Street Band, Rick Derringer on guitar, Rory Dodd and Eric Troyer on backing vocals, and Steinman as producer. \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" was released in the UK on 11 February 1983. It became one of the best-selling singles of all time with over six million units sold. Her fifth studio album, Faster Than the Speed of Night, debuted at no. 1 on the UK Albums Chart and no. 3 on the Billboard 200, selling over one million copies in the United States. Tyler's commercial success led to several award nominations, including two Grammys, two AMAs and a BRIT Award. Tyler was named Best Recording Artist at the Variety Club of Great Britain Awards, and she received a Goldene Europa. Tyler also found success through some of her soundtrack recordings in the mid-80s. In 1984, she released \"Holding Out for a Hero\" from the Footloose soundtrack. In the following year, her recording of \"Here She Comes\" for Giorgio Moroder's restoration of the 1927 film Metropolis earned Tyler a Grammy nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. Tyler also declined an offer to record the theme for the James Bond spin-off Never Say Never Again. In 1986, Tyler released her sixth studio album, Secret Dreams and Forbidden Fire. In another collaboration with Jim Steinman, the album also featured songs written by Desmond Child, Bryan Adams and a cover of \"Band of Gold\" by Freda Payne. \"If You Were a Woman (And I Was a Man)\" became the album's most successful single, selling over 250,000 units in France. The music video, directed by Steinman and Stuart Orme, received six nominations at the Billboard Video Music Conference. Secret Dreams and Forbidden Fire found chart success in Europe, peaking at no. 24 in the UK. However, the album only reached no. 106 in the US, where the album received mixed reviews. In 1987, Tyler collaborated with Mike Oldfield on the title track to his album Islands. In the following year, Tyler played Polly Garter in George Martin's album Under Milk Wood, a radio drama by Dylan Thomas. The music was composed by Elton John, and features vocal contributions from Tom Jones, Anthony Hopkins and Mary Hopkin. Tyler asked Desmond Child to produce her seventh album, Hide Your Heart, which came out on 9 May 1988. The album featured collaborations with Michael Bolton, Albert Hammond and Diane Warren. The album's singles, \"Hide Your Heart\", \"Save Up All Your Tears\" and \"The Best\" became major hits for other artists. ===1990\u20132000: Success in Europe=== Tyler at her home in Wales, 1993. In 1990, Tyler signed to Hansa/BMG Ariola and began working with various producers for her eighth studio album. She collaborated with Dieter Bohlen, Giorgio Moroder, Nik Kershaw and Roy Bittan. \u201cWe used so many producers in efforts to capture many different moods for many different territories, because we believed in the international crossover potential of Tyler,\u201d stated David Brunner, A&R; manager for Hansa. Bitterblue was released on 11 November 1991. In a retrospective review, AllMusic's Tomas Mureika noted that the album marked a \"much more mainstream and less bombastic\" direction in Tyler's career. The title track was released a month ahead of the album and became a top 40 hit in several European countries. It was named \u2018Catchy Song of the Year\u2019 at the RSH-Gold Awards. In the following year, \u201cBitterblue\u201d was released as a promotional single in the United States where it was met with criticism. Billboard wrote that \u201cbombastic production, with a rush of bagpipes and a choir of chirping children at the forefront, overpower Tyler's distinctive raspy voice.\u201d While Bitterblue was never released in the UK or USA, the album was a commercial success in mainland Europe. It topped the charts in Austria and Norway, achieving 4x Platinum status in the latter country with eleven weeks at no. 1. Tyler's subsequent albums, Angel Heart (1992) and Silhouette in Red (1993), were also successful in mainland Europe. Both albums featured a greater share of songs written and produced by Dieter Bohlen. Tyler was named Best International Singer at the Goldene Europa Awards in 1993, and Best Pop/Rock Singer at the ECHO Awards in 1994. In 1995, Tyler moved to EastWest Records and released Free Spirit.

One of Tyler's earliest musical memories was listening to her mother singing opera music in the family home. Tyler attended church until she was sixteen years old. Her first ever performance was singing \"All Things Bright and Beautiful\" in church. She was also exposed to the music of Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, The Beatles and other 60s bands due to her siblings's musical tastes. Frankie Miller was the first live act that Tyler saw, and she later recorded duets with him. Tyler's two biggest influences from a young age were Janis Joplin and Tina Turner. She cites \"River Deep \u2013 Mountain High\" as being her all-time favourite song. Other artists that influenced Tyler in her youth include Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett, Meat Loaf, Joe Cocker, Dusty Springfield and Tommy Steele. She has also expressed admiration for contemporary artists such as Guns N' Roses,EMS Music / Locomotive Music, Rock For Asia \u2013 Das Charity-Konzert Open Air 2005 DVD (2006).

She has also expressed interest in collaborating with Adele, whom she describes as \"a great song writer, singer and performer.\" ===Vocal style=== Tyler's music contains elements of country, rock, pop, blues and Celtic. Her voice has been likened to Rod Stewart and Kim Carnes as a result of her vocal cord nodule operation in the 1970s, sometimes even being referenced as \"the female Rod Stewart\", and, after her collaborations with Jim Steinman, \"the female Meat Loaf\". Soon after her operation, when recording her second album, Natural Force, the studio band complimented Tyler's changed voice. Reviewers from AllMusic have described Tyler's voice as \"inimitable\", \"wonderfully gritty\", and an \"effective instrument\" for drawing notice to her first managers, Ronnie Scott and Steve Wolfe. In a review of Rocks and Honey, OMH Media described Tyler's vocals as being \"good for only one thing and that's belting out gravelly vocals\", suggesting that she sounds like Johnny Cash in his later years when she \"tries to restrain [her voice]\". With reference to her modern voice, The Yorkshire Times wrote that Tyler's vocals have \"still got what it takes to make you tingle.\" Jim Steinman told People magazine that he wrote \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" as a \"showpiece for [Tyler's] voice\". AllMusic said that Tyler's voice \"produced the perfect type of 'desperate lovelorn' effect to suit the romantic lyrics\". === Songwriting === Though songwriting has never been a significant part of Tyler's career, she has co-written a handful of B-Sides and other tracks. \"Gonna Get Better\", a B-Side to the 1980 Japanese single \"Sayonara Tokyo\", was written with her brother, Paul Hopkins.Bonnie Tyler \"The Collection\" CD booklet, Sony Music, 2013.
