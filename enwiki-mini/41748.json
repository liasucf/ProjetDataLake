    "text": "For an optical fiber, a step-index profile is a refractive index profile characterized by a uniform refractive index within the core and a sharp decrease in refractive index at the core-cladding interface so that the cladding is of a lower refractive index. The step-index profile corresponds to a power-law index profile with the profile parameter approaching infinity. The step-index profile is used in most single-mode fibers and some multimode fibers. A step-index fiber is characterized by the core and cladding refractive indices n1 and n2 and the core and cladding radii a and b. Examples of standard core and cladding diameters 2a/2b are 8/125, 50/125, 62.5/125, 85/125, or 100/140 (units of \u00b5m). The fractional refractive-index change \\triangle \\, = \\frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1} \\ll \\ 1. The value of n1 is typically between 1.44 and 1.46, and \\triangle is typically between 0.001 and 0.02. Step-index optical fiber is generally made by doping high-purity fused silica glass (SiO2) with different concentrations of materials like titanium, germanium, or boron. Pulse dispersion in a step index optical fiber is given by \\text{pulse dispersion} = \\frac{\\triangle\\ n_1\\ \\ell}{c}\\,\\\\! where :\\triangle\\,\\\\! is the difference in refractive indices of core and cladding. :n_1\\,\\\\! is the refractive index of core :\\ell\\,\\\\! is the length of the optical fiber under observation :c is the speed of light ==See also== *Graded- index fiber *Critical Angle *Numerical aperture ==References== Category:Fiber optics ",
