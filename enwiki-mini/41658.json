    "text": "In telecommunication, the term reradiation has the following meanings: #Electromagnetic radiation, at the same or different wavelengths, i.e., frequencies, of energy received from an incident wave. #Undesirable radiation of signals locally generated in a radio receiver. This type of radiation might cause interference or reveal the location of the device.''' Near-field effects of an AM antenna may extend out two miles (3 km) or more. Cellular and microwave towers within this radius can reflect the AM signal out at a different frequency. This process results in interfering frequencies called reradiation.Detuning Communications Towers Solves Reradiation Problem: Technical Note 102 Category:Radio communications ",
