    "text": "VHSIC (Very High Speed Integrated Circuits) was a 1980s U.S. government program. The program's mission was to research and develop very high speed integrated circuits. The United States Department of Defense launched the VHSIC program in 1980 as a joint tri-service (Army/Navy/Air Force) program. The program led to advances in integrated circuit materials, lithography, packaging, testing, and algorithms, and created numerous computer-aided design (CAD) tools. A well-known part of the program's contribution is VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language), a hardware description language (HDL). The program also redirected the military's interest in GaAs ICs back toward the commercial mainstream of CMOS circuits. More than $1 billion in total was spent for the VHSIC program for silicon integrated circuit technology development.U.S. Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, Microelectronics Research and Development \u2013 A Background Paper, OTA-B P-C IT-40, pp. 21\u201322 (Washington , DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, March 1986). A DARPA project which ran concurrently, the VLSI Project, having begun two years earlier in 1978, contributed BSD Unix, the RISC processor, the MOSIS research design fab, and greatly furthered the Mead & Conway revolution in VLSI design automation. By contrast, the VHSIC program was comparatively less cost- effective for the funds invested over a contemporaneous time frame, though the projects had different final objectives and are not entirely comparable for that reason. ==References== Category:Integrated circuits Category:Science and technology in the United States ",
