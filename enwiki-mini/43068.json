    "text": "\"The Gift of the Magi\" is a short story by O. Henry first published in 1905. The story tells of a young husband and wife and how they deal with the challenge of buying secret Christmas gifts for each other with very little money. As a sentimental story with a moral lesson about gift-giving, it has been popular for adaptation, especially for presentation at Christmas time. The plot and its twist ending are well-known, and the ending is generally considered an example of comic irony. It was allegedly written at Pete's Tavern on Irving Place in New York City. The story was initially published in The New York Sunday World under the title \"Gifts of the Magi\" on December 10, 1905. It was first published in book form in the O. Henry Anthology The Four Million in April 1906. ==Plot== On Christmas Eve, Della Young discovers that she has only $1.87 to buy a present for her husband Jim. She visits the nearby shop of a hairdresser, Madame Sonofrie, who buys Della's long hair for $20. Della then uses the money to buy a platinum pocket watch chain for Jim. When Jim comes home from work that evening, Della admits to him that she sold her hair to buy him the chain. Jim gives Della her present-- a set of ornamental combs, which she will be unable to use until her hair grows back out. Della gives Jim the watch chain, and he tells her that he sold the watch to buy the combs. Although Jim and Della are left with gifts that they cannot use, they realize how far they are willing to go to show their love for each other and how priceless their love really is. The story ends with the narrator comparing these sacrificial gifts of love with those of the biblical Magi. ==Adaptations== ===Film=== * The Sacrifice (1909) * Love's Surprises Are Futile (1916) * The Gift of the Magi (1917) * Ustedes los ricos (\"You, the Rich Ones\") (1948) includes the tale as a small sub-plot * As a segment of O.
