    "text": "Alexander Dub\u010dek (; 27 November 1921 \u2013 7 November 1992) was a Czechoslovak and Slovak politician who served as the First Secretary of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KS\u010c) (de facto leader of Czechoslovakia) from January 1968 to April 1969. He attempted to reform the communist government during the Prague Spring but was forced to resign following the Warsaw Pact invasion in August 1968. During his leadership, under the slogan \"Socialism with a human face\", Czechoslovakia lifted censorship on the media and liberalized Czechoslovak society, fuelling the so-called New Wave in Czechoslovak filmography. However, he was put under pressure by Stalinist voices inside the party as well as the Soviet leadership, who disliked the direction the country was taking and feared that Czechoslovakia could loosen ties with the Soviet Union and become more westernized. As a result, the country was invaded by the other Warsaw Pact countries on 20\u201321 August 1968, ending the Prague Spring. Dub\u010dek resigned in April 1969 and was succeeded by Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k, who initiated normalization. Dub\u010dek was then expelled from the Communist Party in 1970. Later, after the Velvet revolution (the overthrow of the communist regime in 1989), he was Chairman of the federal Czechoslovak parliament. Also in 1989, the European Parliament awarded Dub\u010dek the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. ==Early life== Alexander Dub\u010dek was born in Uhrovec, Czechoslovakia (now in Slovakia) on 27 November 1921. When he was three, the family moved to the Soviet Union, in part to help build socialism and in part because jobs were scarce in Czechoslovakia; so that he was raised until 12 on a commune in Pishpek (now Bishkek), in the Kirghiz SSR of the Soviet Union (now Kyrgyzstan) as a member of the Esperantist and Idist industrial cooperative Interhelpo.D. Viney, 'Alexander Dubcek', Studies in Comparative Communism 1 (1968) p. 17-19William Shawcross, 'Dubcek', (rev'd ed. 1990) p. 17 In 1933, the family moved to Gorky, now Nizhny Novgorod, and in 1938 returned to Czechoslovakia. During the Second World War, Dub\u010dek joined the underground resistance against the wartime pro-German Slovak state headed by Jozef Tiso. In August 1944, Dub\u010dek fought in the Jan \u017di\u017eka partisan brigade during the Slovak National Uprising and was wounded twice, while his brother, J\u00falius, was killed.D. Viney, 'Alexander Dubcek', Studies in Comparative Communism 1 (1968) p. 19-20 ==Political career== During the war, Dub\u010dek joined the Communist Party of Slovakia (KSS),B. Wasserstein, Barbarism & Civilization (Oxford 2007) p. 598 which had been created after the formation of the Slovak state and in 1948 was transformed into the Slovak branch of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KS\u010c). After the war, he steadily rose through the ranks in Communist Czechoslovakia. From 1951 to 1955 he was a member of the National Assembly, the parliament of Czechoslovakia. In 1953, he was sent to the Moscow Political College, where he graduated in 1958.D. Viney, 'Alexander Dubcek', Studies in Comparative Communism 1 (1968) p. 21 In 1955 he joined the Central Committee of the Slovak branch and in 1962 became a member of the presidium. In 1958 he also joined the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, which he served as a secretary from 1960 to 1962 and as a member of the presidium after 1962. From 1960 to 1968 he once more was a member of the federal parliament. In 1963, a power struggle in the leadership of the Slovak branch unseated Karol Bac\u00edlek and Pavol David, hard-line allies of Anton\u00edn Novotn\u00fd, First Secretary of the KS\u010c and President of Czechoslovakia. In their place, a new generation of Slovak Communists took control of party and state organs in Slovakia, led by Dub\u010dek, who became First Secretary of the Slovak branch of the party.B. Wasserstein, Barbarism & Civilization (Oxford 2007) p. 598 Under Dub\u010dek's leadership, Slovakia began to evolve toward political liberalization. Because Novotn\u00fd and his Stalinist predecessors had denigrated Slovak \"bourgeois nationalists\", most notably Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k and Vladim\u00edr Clementis, in the 1950s, the Slovak branch worked to promote Slovak identity. This mainly took the form of celebrations and commemorations, such as the 150th birthdays of 19th century leaders of the Slovak National Revival \u013dudov\u00edt \u0160t\u00far and Jozef Miloslav Hurban, the centenary of the Matica slovensk\u00e1 in 1963, and the twentieth anniversary of the Slovak National Uprising. At the same time, the political and intellectual climate in Slovakia became freer than that in the Czech lands.D. Viney, 'Alexander Dubcek', Studies in Comparative Communism 1 (1968) p. 23-4 This was exemplified by the rising readership of Kult\u00farny \u017eivot, the weekly newspaper of the Union of Slovak Writers, which published frank discussions of liberalization, federalization and democratization, written by the most progressive or controversial writers \u2013 both Slovak and Czech. Kult\u00farny \u017eivot consequently became the first Slovak publication to gain a wide following among Czechs. ==Prague Spring== The Czechoslovak planned economy in the 1960s was in serious decline and the imposition of central control from Prague disappointed local Communists, while the destalinization program caused further disquiet. In October 1967, a number of reformers, most notably Ota \u0160ik and Alexander Dub\u010dek, took action: they challenged First Secretary Anton\u00edn Novotn\u00fd at a Central Committee meeting.B. Wasserstein, Civilisation and Barbarism (Oxford 2007) p. 598 Novotn\u00fd faced a mutiny in the Central Committee, so he secretly invited Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet leader, to make a whirlwind visit to Prague in December 1967 in order to shore up his own position. When Brezhnev arrived in Prague and met with the Central Committee members, he was stunned to learn of the extent of the opposition to Novotn\u00fd, leading Brezhnev to opt for non-interference,D. Viney, \"Alexander Dubcek\", Studies in Comparative Communism 1 (1968) p. 26 and paving the way for the Central Committee to force Novotn\u00fd's resignation. Dub\u010dek, with his background and training in Russia, was seen by the USSR as a safe pair of hands. \"Our Sasha\", as Brezhnev called him,Brezhnev, quoted in B. Wasserstein, Civilisation and Barbarism (Oxford 2007) p. 598 and p. 603 became the new First Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia on 5 January 1968. The period following Novotn\u00fd's downfall became known as the Prague Spring. During this time, Dub\u010dek and other reformers sought to liberalize the Communist government\u2014creating \"socialism with a human face\".B. Wasserstein, Civilisation and Barbarism (Oxford 2007) p. 600 Though this loosened the party's influence on the country, Dub\u010dek remained a devoted Communist and intended to preserve the party's rule. However, during the Prague Spring, he and other reform-minded Communists sought to win popular support for the Communist government by eliminating its worst, most repressive features, allowing greater freedom of expression and tolerating political and social organizations not under Communist control.B. Wasserstein, Civilisation and Barbarism (Oxford 2007) p. 599 \"Dub\u010dek! Svoboda!\"Lost World Of Communism (Czechoslovakia), BBC (Documentary) became the popular refrain of student demonstrations during this period, while a poll gave him 78% public support.B. Wasserstein, Civilisation and Barbarism (Oxford 2007) p. 601 Yet Dub\u010dek found himself in an increasingly untenable position. The program of reform gained momentum, leading to pressures for further liberalization and democratization. At the same time, hard-line Communists in Czechoslovakia and the leaders of other Warsaw Pact countries pressured Dub\u010dek to rein in the Prague Spring. Though Dub\u010dek wanted to oversee the reform movement, he refused to resort to any draconian measures to do so, while still stressing the leading role of the Party and the centrality of the Warsaw Pact.D. Viney, 'Alexander Dubcek', Studies in Comparative Communism 1 (1968) p. 31 The Soviet leadership tried to slow down or stop the changes in Czechoslovakia through a series of negotiations. The Soviet Union agreed to bilateral talks with Czechoslovakia in July at \u010cierna nad Tisou, near the Slovak-Soviet border.B. Wasserstein, Civilisation and Barbarism (Oxford 2007) p. 601 At the meeting, Dub\u010dek tried to reassure the Soviets and the Warsaw Pact leaders that he was still friendly to Moscow, arguing that the reforms were an internal matter. He thought he had learned an important lesson from the failing of the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, in which the leaders had gone as far as withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact. Dub\u010dek believed that the Kremlin would allow him a free hand in pursuing domestic reform as long as Czechoslovakia remained a faithful member of the Soviet bloc. Despite Dub\u010dek's continuing efforts to stress these commitments, Brezhnev and other Warsaw Pact leaders remained wary, seeing a free press as threatening an end to one-party rule in Czechoslovakia, and (by extension) elsewhere in Eastern Europe.B. Wasserstein, Civilisation and Barbarism (Oxford 2007) p. 605 ==Downfall== On the night of 20\u201321 August 1968, military forces from every Warsaw Pact member state (except for Albania and Romania) entered Czechoslovakia. The occupying armies quickly seized control of Prague and the Central Committee's building, taking Dub\u010dek and other reformers into Soviet custody. But, before they were arrested, Dub\u010dek urged the people not to resist militarily, on the grounds that \"presenting a military defence would have meant exposing the Czech and Slovak peoples to a senseless bloodbath\".Quoted in B. Wasserstein, Civilisation and Barbarism (Oxford 2007) p. 605 Later in the day, Dub\u010dek and the others were taken to Moscow on a Soviet military transport aircraft. The non-violent resistance of the Czech and Slovak population, which delayed full loss of control to the Warsaw Pact forces for a full eight months (in contrast to the Soviet military's estimate of four days), became a prime example of civilian-based defense. A latter-day Good Soldier Schweik (referring to an early-20th-century Czech satirical novel) wrote of \"the comradely pranks of changing street names and road signs, of pretending not to understand Russian, and of putting out a great variety of humorous welcoming posters\".\"Josef Schweik\", Studies in Comparative Communism 1 (1968) p. 332 Meanwhile, radio stations called for the invaders to return home: \"Long live freedom, Svoboda, Dubcek\".Documents, Studies in Comparative Communism 1 (1968) p. 307 Nevertheless, the reformers were forced to accede to Soviet demands, signing the Moscow protocols (which only Franti\u0161ek Kriegel refused to sign) and ending Dub\u010dek's Prague Spring.Jenny Diski, The Sixties (London 2009) p. 82 Dub\u010dek and most of the reformers were returned to Prague on 27 August, and Dub\u010dek retained his post as the party's first secretary until April 1969.D. Viney, \"Alexander Dubcek\", Studies in Comparative Communism 1 (1968) p. 36-7 The achievements of the Prague Spring were not reversed immediately but over a period of several months. In January 1969, Dub\u010dek was hospitalized in Bratislava complaining of a cold and had to cancel a speech. Rumours sprang up that his illness was radiation sickness and that it was caused by radioactive strontium being placed in his soup during his stay in Moscow in an attempt to kill him. However, a U.S. intelligence report discounted this for lack of evidence.Radiation Sickness or Death Caused by Surreptitious Administration of Ionizing Radiation to an Individual . Report No. 4 of The Molecular Biology Working Group to The Biomedical Intelligence Subcommittee of The Scientific Intelligence Committee of USIB, 27 August 1969. Retrieved 5 May 2007. Dub\u010dek was forced to resign as First Secretary in April 1969, following the Czechoslovak Hockey Riots. He was re-elected to the Federal Assembly (as the federal parliament was now called) and became its chairman. He was later sent as ambassador to Turkey (1969\u201370),B. Wasserstein, Civilisation and Barbarism (Oxford 2007) p. 606 allegedly in the hope that he would defect to the West, which however did not occur. In 1970, he was expelled from the Communist party and lost his seats in the Slovak parliament (which he had held continuously since 1964) and the Federal Assembly. ==Private citizen== After his expulsion from the party, Dub\u010dek worked in the Forestry Service in Slovakia. He remained a popular figure among the Slovaks and Czechs he encountered on the job, using this reverence to procure scarce and hard-to-find materials for his workplace. Dub\u010dek and his wife, Anna, continued to live in a comfortable villa in a nice neighbourhood in Bratislava. In 1988, Dub\u010dek was allowed to travel to Italy to accept an honorary doctorate from Bologna University, and, while there, he gave an interview with Italian Communist Party daily newspaper L'Unit\u00e0, his first public remarks to the press since 1970. Dub\u010dek's appearance and interview helped to return him to international prominence. In 1989, he was awarded the annual Sakharov Prize in its second year of existence.\"Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought: List of prize winners\", European Parliament webpage. ==Velvet Revolution== National Museum in Prague During the Velvet Revolution of 1989, he supported the Public against Violence (VPN) and the Civic Forum. On the night of 24 November, Dub\u010dek appeared with V\u00e1clav Havel on a balcony overlooking Wenceslas Square, where he was greeted with tremendous applause from the throngs of protesters below and embraced as a symbol of democratic freedom. Several onlookers even chanted, \"Dub\u010dek na hrad!\" (\"Dub\u010dek to the Castle\"\u2014i.e., Dub\u010dek for President). He disappointed the crowd somewhat by calling the revolution a chance to continue the work he had started 20 years earlier, and prune out what was wrong with Communism. By that time, the demonstrators in Prague wanted nothing to do with Communism of any sort, even Dub\u010dek's humane version. Later that night, Dub\u010dek was on stage with Havel at the Laterna Magika theatre, the headquarters of Civic Forum, when the entire leadership of the Communist Party resigned, in effect ending Communist rule in Czechoslovakia. Dub\u010dek was elected Chairman of the Federal Assembly (the Czechoslovak Parliament) on 28 December 1989, and re-elected in 1990 and 1992. At the time of the overthrow of Communist party rule, Dub\u010dek described the Velvet Revolution as a victory for his humanistic socialist outlook. In 1990, he received the International Humanist Award from the International Humanist and Ethical Union. He also gave the commencement address to the graduates of the Class of 1990 at The American University in Washington, D.C.; it was his first trip to the United States. In 1992, he became leader of the Social Democratic Party of Slovakia and represented that party in the Federal Assembly. At that time, Dub\u010dek passively supported the union between Czechs and Slovaks in a single Czecho-Slovak federation against the ultimately successful push towards an independent Slovak state. ==Death== Dub\u010dek's grave Monument to Dub\u010dek near the site of his fatal accident Dub\u010dek died on 7 November 1992, as a result of injuries sustained in a car crash that took place on 1 September on the Czech D1 highway, near Humpolec.\"Alexander Dubcek, 70, Dies in Prague\" (The New York Times, 8 November 1992)Kopanic, Michael J Jr, \"Case closed: Dub\u010dek's death declared an accident, not murder\" , Central Europe Review (Vol 2, No 8), 28 February 2000. He was buried in Sl\u00e1vi\u010die \u00fadolie cemetery in Bratislava, Slovakia. ==References== ==External links== * * Alexander Dub\u010dek profile on the Sakharov Prize Network * Dubcek: Dubcek and Czechoslovakia 1918\u20131968 by William Shawcross (1970) *Hope Dies Last The Autobiography of Alexander Dubcek by Alexander Dubcek (Author), Ji\u0159\u00ed Hochman (Editor, Translator), Kodansha Europe (1993), .
