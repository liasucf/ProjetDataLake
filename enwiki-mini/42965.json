() is Irish for \"Ireland\", the name of an island and a sovereign state. == Etymology == The modern Irish \u00c9ire evolved from the Old Irish word \u00c9riu, which was the name of a Gaelic goddess. \u00c9riu is generally believed to have been the matron goddess of Ireland, a goddess of sovereignty, or simply a goddess of the land. The origin of \u00c9riu has been traced to the Proto-Celtic reconstruction *\u03a6\u012bwerjon- (nominative singular \u03a6\u012bwerj\u016b < Pre-Proto-Celtic -j\u014d). This suggests a descent from the Proto-Indo-European reconstruction *piHwerjon-, likely related to the adjectival stem *piHwer- (cf. Sanskrit p\u012bvan, p\u012bvar\u012b and p\u012bvara and Persian parvar(\u067e\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0631) meaning \"fat, full, abounding\"). This would suggest a meaning of \"abundant land\". This Proto-Celtic form became *\u012aweri\u016b in Proto- Goidelic.Mallory, J.P. and D.Q. Adams, ed. Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture. London: Fitzroy Dearborn Pub., 1997, p. 194 It is highly likely that explorers borrowed and modified this term. During his exploration of northwest Europe (circa 320 BC), Pytheas of Massilia called the island Ierne (written ). In his book Geographia (circa 150 AD), Claudius Ptolemaeus called the island Iouernia (written ; ou represented /w/). Based on these historical accounts, the Roman Empire called the island Hibernia. The evolution of the word would follow as such: *Proto-Celtic *\u03a6\u012bwerjon- (nominative singular *\u03a6\u012bwerj\u016b) **Proto-Goidelic *\u012aweri\u016b ***Old Irish \u00c9riu ****Modern Irish \u00c9ire A 19th century proposal, which does not follow modern standards of etymology, derives the name from Scottish Gaelic: * \u00ec (island) + thiar (west) + f\u00f3nn (land), which together give \u00ec-iar-fh\u00f3nn, or \"westland isle\" The etymology fails in that tiar (the historical form) has no *t\u00e9ir forms which would allow the development of the *\u00e9 of \u00c9ire; moreover, Old Irish (= Old Gaelic) \u00ed \"island\" was a late loan word from Old Norse ey \"island\", and so did not exist in prehistoric Ireland. === Difference between \u00c9ire and Erin === While \u00c9ire is simply the name for the island of Ireland in the Irish language, and sometimes used in English, Erin is a common poetic name for Ireland, as in Erin go bragh. The distinction between the two is one of the difference between cases of nouns in Irish. \u00c9ire is the nominative case, the case that is used for nouns that are the subject of a sentence, i.e., the noun that is doing something as well as the direct object of a sentence. Erin derives from \u00c9irinn, the Irish dative case of \u00c9ire, which has replaced the nominative case in D\u00e9ise Irish and some non-standard sub-dialects elsewhere, in Scottish Gaelic (where the usual word for Ireland is ) and Manx (like Irish and Scottish Gaelic, a Goidelic Celtic language), where the word is spelled \"Nerin,\" with the initial n- probably representing a fossilisation of the preposition in/an \"in\" (cf. Irish in \u00c9irinn, Scottish an \u00c8irinn/ann an \u00c8irinn \"in Ireland\"). The genitive case, \u00c9ireann (e.g. stair na h\u00c9ireann \"the history of Ireland, Ireland's history\"), is found in the Gaelic forms of the titles of companies and institutions in Ireland e.g. Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann (Irish Rail), D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Parliament), Poblacht na h\u00c9ireann (The Republic of Ireland) or Tuaisceart \u00c9ireann (Northern Ireland), ==As a state name == Article 4 of the Irish constitution adopted in 1937 by the government under \u00c9amon de Valera states that \u00c9ire is the name of the state, or in the English language, Ireland.\"Constitution of Ireland \". Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Retrieved on 14 March 2007 The Constitution's English-language preamble also describes the population as \"We, the people of \u00c9ire\". Despite the fact that Article 8 designated Irish as the \"national\" and \"first official\" language, \u00c9ire has to some extent passed out of everyday conversation and literature, and the state is referred to as Ireland or its equivalent in all other languages. The name \"\u00c9ire\" has been used on Irish postage stamps since 1922; on all Irish coinage (including Irish euro coins); and together with \"Ireland\" on passports and other official state documents issued since 1937. \"\u00c9ire\" is used on the Seal of the President of Ireland. Initially after 1937 the United Kingdom insisted on using only the name \"Eire\" and refused to accept the name \"Ireland\". It adopted the Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938 putting in law that position. At the 1948 Summer Olympics in London the organisers insisted that the Irish team march under the banner \"Eire\" notwithstanding that every other team was marching according to what their name was in English. The UK Government generally avoided all reference to \"Ireland\" in connection with the state and used what Senator Thomas O'Connell described as \"sneering titles such as Eirish\".The Republic of Ireland Bill, 1948, Seanad \u00c9ireann debate, Vol. 36 No. 2, Friday, 10 December 1948 However, the term \"Eirish\" was also used by some writers in the US, who referred to \"the Eirish people\".The Literary Digest, Volume 124, Funk and Wagnalls, 1938, pages 8-9 Using the genitive form \u00c9ireann as an adjective, the UK media would refer to \"Eireann Ministers\"Chronology of International Events and Documents, Volume 4, Royal Institute of International Affairs, 1947, page 690 and the \"Eireann Army\".The Motor, Volume 78, page 213 The Ireland Act 1949 changed this to \"Republic of Ireland\". It was not until after the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that the UK government accepted the preferred name of simply \"Ireland\", at the same time as Ireland dropped its territorial claim over Northern Ireland. Before the 1937 Constitution, \"Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann\" (the Irish name of the Irish Free State) was generally used. During the Emergency (as World War II was known), Irish ships had \"EIRE\" (and the Irish tricolour) painted large on their sides and deck, to identify them as neutrals. In the 1947 Sinn F\u00e9in Funds case, a co-defendant was cited as \"the Attorney General of Eire\" in the High and Supreme Court cases, and there were similar cases where \"Eire\" was used in the late 1940s as a descriptor of the state in English.Buckley and others v. the Attorney General of Eire and Charles Stewart Power, 1 Irish Reports [1950], 57. Irish Oak torpedoed mid-Atlantic, oil by Kenneth King, showing \"EIRE\" prominently. (National Maritime Museum of Ireland) In 1922\u20131938 the international plate on Irish cars was \"SE\". From 1938 to 1962 it was marked \"EIR\", short for \u00c9ire. In 1961 statutory instrument no. 269 allowed \"IRL\",SI 269 of 1961:\"...the letters EIR are used to indicate the name of the State but the letters IRL may be substituted therefor.\" and by 1962 \"IRL\" had been adopted. Irish politician Bernard Commons TD suggested to the D\u00e1il in 1950 that the government examine \"the tourist identification plate bearing the letters EIR ... with a view to the adoption of identification letters more readily associated with this country by foreigners\". \"EIR\" is also shown in other legislation such as the car insurance statutory instrument no. 383 of 1952 and no. 82 of 1958. Under the 1947 Convention Irish-registered aircraft have carried a registration mark starting \"EI\" for \u00c9ire. From January 2007, the Irish government nameplates at meetings of the European Union have borne both \u00c9ire and Ireland, following the adoption of Irish as a working language of the European Union. ==Spelling Eire rather than \u00c9ire == When Irish-language texts were printed in Gaelic type, diacritics were retained on upper-case letters as for lower-case letters. From the later 1940s, in conjunction with other reforms, printing switched to the same \"Roman type\" used for most other Latin alphabet languages. There was some uncertainty about whether the s\u00edneadh fada (acute accent) should be written on upper-case letters. While it was preserved in all-Irish texts, it was often omitted when short fragments of Irish appeared alone or in English texts. Noel Davern asked in the D\u00e1il in 1974 why Irish stamps had EIRE rather than \u00c9IRE. The reply from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was: Davern considered the spelling Eire to be worse than a misspelling, because eire is a separate word, meaning \"a burden, load or encumbrance\". The minister stated, \"The word on the stamp ... does not mean 'eire' and it is not understood to mean 'eire' by anybody except Davern.\" Stamps later reverted to a Gaelic type with the accent preserved. In 1938 the British government provided in the Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938 that British legislation would henceforth refer to the Irish Free State as \"Eire\" (but not as \"Ireland\"). This was altered by the Ireland Act 1949, where the English-law name of the state was changed to \"Republic of Ireland\".Ireland Act 1949, section 1(3) The 1938 Act was repealed in 1981, and in 1996 a British journalist described Eire as \"now an oddity rarely used, an out-of- date reference\". Founded in 1937, the Eire Society of Boston is an influential Irish-American group.The Eire Society of Boston's history page on-line (seen on 25 August 2011) == Other uses == \u00c9ire has also been incorporated into the names of Irish commercial and social entities, such as Eir (formerly Eircom and Telecom \u00c9ireann) and its former mobile phone network, Eircell. In 2006 the Irish electricity network was devolved to EirGrid. The company \"BetEire Flow\" (eFlow), named as a pun on \"better\", is a French consortium running the electronic tolling system at the West-Link bridge west of Dublin. According to the Dublin Companies Registration Office in 2008, over 500 company names incorporate the word \u00c9ire in some form. == Footnotes == == Bibliography == * Noel Browne, Against the Tide * Constitution of Ireland (1937) * Stephen Collins, The Cosgrave Legacy * Tim Pat Coogan, De Valera (Hutchinson, 1993) * Brian Farrell, De Valera's Constitution and Ours * F.S.L.
