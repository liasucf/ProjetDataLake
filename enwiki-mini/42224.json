    "text": "Anywhere but Here is a 1999 American coming-of-age comedy-drama film, based on the novel of the same name by Mona Simpson. The screenplay was written by Alvin Sargent, and the film was directed by Wayne Wang. It was produced by Laurence Mark, Petra Alexandria, and Ginny Nugent. It stars Susan Sarandon, Natalie Portman, and Shawn Hatosy. Filming began in late June 1998. The film debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 17, 1999, before being released in the United States on November 12. == Plot == Adele August (Susan Sarandon) is an eccentric woman who, with her reluctant daughter, Ann (Natalie Portman), leaves a small Wisconsin town and moves to Beverly Hills to realize her dreams. However, it becomes apparent that Adele is uncertain of what those dreams are \u2013 expressing ideas such as marrying a rich man \u2013 and often makes irresponsible and impulsive decisions, such as purchasing a used Mercedes she cannot afford in order to drive to Beverly Hills. While upset with Adele's decisions, the more practical Ann finds she cannot leave her mother and resents her for leaving Ann's stepfather for a better life. Furthermore, Ann still loves her father, who left her family when Ann was still young. When living in Beverly Hills, Adele improvises from day to day, often unable to pay the bills. She winds up dating a successful dentist, but learns that he doesn't love her and has dumped her for a younger woman. Things get complicated when Adele has a fight with her brother-in-law Jimmy, and Ann starts dating her crush, Peter. Forcing her daughter to enroll in Beverly Hills High School, where a lot of rich kids and movie star kids go to, Adele hopes that Ann will become an actress and attend UCLA, despite Ann's interest in going away to Brown University. Although Adele fails in many respects, she eventually accepts her daughter's plans and decides to help her. == Cast == * Susan Sarandon as Adele August * Natalie Portman as Ann August * Shawn Hatosy as Benny * Hart Bochner as Josh Spritzer * Eileen Ryan as Lillian * Ray Baker as Ted * John Diehl as Jimmy * Bonnie Bedelia as Carol * Faran Tahir as Hisham Badir * Caroline Aaron as Gail Letterfine * Corbin Allred as Peter * Michael Milhoan as Cop * John Carroll Lynch as Jack Irwin * Steve Berra as Hal * Eva Amurri, the daughter of Susan Sarandon, has a cameo appearance as a girl in the crowd at Beverly Hills High School on Ann's first day. ==Reception== ===Box office=== The film opened at #5 at the North American box office and made $5.6 million USD in its opening weekend. ===Critical response=== The film received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes it has a score of 64% based on reviews from 89 critics. The website's consensus reads: \"The strong chemistry between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman as a mother and daughter trying to make a fresh start in L.A. helps to elevate Anywhere But Here above its occasional forays into melodrama.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars and noted \"The movie's interest is not in the plot, which is episodic and 'colorful,' but in the performances. Sarandon bravely makes Adele into a person who is borderline insufferable. Sarandon's role is trickier and more difficult, but Portman's will get the attention. In 'Anywhere But Here,' she gets yanked along by her out of control mother, and her best scenes are when she fights back, not emotionally, but with incisive observations.\" ===Accolades=== Golden Globe Awards * Nominated - Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture - Natalie Portman Young Artist Awards * Nominated - Best Performance in a Feature Film - Leading Young Actress - Natalie Portman Hollywood Makeup Artist and Hair Stylist Guild Awards * Nominated - Best Contemporary Hair Styling (Feature) - Paul LeBlanc ==Production== ===Filming locations=== * Beverly Hills High School, Beverly Hills, California * Beverly Hills Hotel & Bungalows, Beverly Hills * Los Angeles International Airport, Los Angeles, California * Los Angeles, California * Westwood Village, Westwood, Los Angeles, California, ==Soundtrack== A soundtrack to the film was released on November 2, 1999, ten days before the theatrical release.
