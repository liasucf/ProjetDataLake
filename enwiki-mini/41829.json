    "text": "The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) ranks cryptographic products or algorithms by a certification called product types. Product types are defined in the National Information Assurance Glossary (CNSSI No. 4009) which defines Type 1, 2, 3, and 4 products. National Information Assurance Glossary (CNSSI No. 4009, 2010) ==Type 1 product== A Type 1 product is a device or system certified by NSA for use in cryptographically securing classified U.S. Government information. A Type 1 product is defined as: > Cryptographic equipment, assembly or component classified or certified by > NSA for encrypting and decrypting classified and sensitive national security > information when appropriately keyed. Developed using established NSA > business processes and containing NSA approved algorithms. Used to protect > systems requiring the most stringent protection mechanisms. They are available to U.S. Government users, their contractors, and federally sponsored non-U.S. Government activities subject to export restrictions in accordance with International Traffic in Arms Regulations. Type 1 certification is a rigorous process that includes testing and formal analysis of (among other things) cryptographic security, functional security, tamper resistance, emissions security (EMSEC/TEMPEST), and security of the product manufacturing and distribution process. ==Type 2 product== A Type 2 product is unclassified cryptographic equipment, assemblies, or components, endorsed by the NSA, for use in telecommunications and automated information systems for the protection of national security information, as defined as: > Cryptographic equipment, assembly, or component certified by NSA for > encrypting or decrypting sensitive national security information when > appropriately keyed. Developed using established NSA business processes and > containing NSA approved algorithms. Used to protect systems requiring > protection mechanisms exceeding best commercial practices including systems > used for the protection of unclassified national security information. ==Type 3 product== A Type 3 product is a device for use with Sensitive, But Unclassified (SBU) information on non-national security systems, defined as: > Unclassified cryptographic equipment, assembly, or component used, when > appropriately keyed, for encrypting or decrypting unclassified sensitive > U.S. Government or commercial information, and to protect systems requiring > protection mechanisms consistent with standard commercial practices. > Developed using established commercial standards and containing NIST > approved cryptographic algorithms/modules or successfully evaluated by the > National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP). Approved encryption algorithms include three-key Triple DES, and AES (although AES can also be used in NSA-certified Type 1 products). Approvals for DES, two-key Triple DES and Skipjack have been withdrawn as of 2015. http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-131Ar1.pdf Transitions: Recommendation for Transitioning the Use of Cryptographic Algorithms and Key Lengths, NIST.SP.800-131A Rev1, November 6, 2015, Elaine Barker, Allen Roginsky ==Type 4 product== A Type 4 product is an encryption algorithm that has been registered with NIST but is not a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), defined as: > Unevaluated commercial cryptographic equipment, assemblies, or components > that neither NSA nor NIST certify for any Government usage. These products > are typically delivered as part of commercial offerings and are commensurate > with the vendor\u2019s commercial practices. These products may contain either > vendor proprietary algorithms, algorithms registered by NIST, or algorithms > registered by NIST and published in a FIPS. ==See also== * NSA encryption systems, for a historically oriented list of NSA encryption products (most of them Type 1). * NSA cryptography for algorithms that NSA has participated in the development of. * NSA Suite B Cryptography * NSA Suite A Cryptography ==References== Parts of this article have been derived from Federal Standard 1037C, the National Information Systems Security Glossary, and 40 USC 1452.
